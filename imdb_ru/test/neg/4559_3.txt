Ugghhh !!! This is exactly the film “Pre-Code”, which may wrongly convince the viewer that films of this period are nasty, but they are not, just this particular film is terrible. It's terrible, because although the film is trying very hard to be “fashionable” and “adult,” it is also so hopelessly old-fashioned, boring and funny that I was torn between laughing at a movie or just falling asleep !! This is a unique combination, to say the least. <br /> <br /> So why do I hate her so much? Well, the film is incredibly sloppy, but it has no style, and the film is meant for shock, but it lacks subtlety and it makes too many ridiculous turns to be believable. The film begins with a cliché - a prostitute with a heart of gold. Dorothy McCaill is a prostitute, and she seems to accidentally kill a man! Shortly after escaping, she meets an old boyfriend who insists on marrying her (he is not aware of her profession). Seeing this man’s innate kindness, she decides to change her life and stop living a wild life. It's hard when she hides on a fictional Caribbean island. Here, alone and waiting for the return of her man, nothing can be done, and the place is teeming with super-lustful and completely unattractive men. In fact, this part of the film is so boring that it can be difficult for viewers to stay focused. The men on the island are so inflamed by the presence of McCail that they constantly appear on the verge of her rape - only to be repulsed because she is no longer such a girl. Honestly, I am very tired of all these obscene scenes - I just roll my eyes too much and talk my tongue to make it look different than a very bad movie. And looking at all these ugly horned dogs was just annoying and stupid. <br /> <br /> But wait ... it gets a lot worse. The person she THOUGHT to kill killed appears on this tiny island (what are the chances?!), And he tries to rape her. However, he should not be discouraged, and she ends up shooting in order to save her newfound strength. While the jury on the island is going to acquit her, she rushes back to court and lies, telling them that she wanted to kill the man, and this it was deliberately (?), because even if she is acquitted, she knows that the evil jailer will receive him. By the way, when she is sent to prison for possessing weapons. Given that the jailer himself gave her a gun to set her up, she rushed to court and said that she was guilty, in fact, very stupid. Why didn't she just tell them the perverted plan of the jailer ?! She may have done this to preserve her virtue, but to admit that she killed someone so people thought you were a virgin ?! Therefore, in order to avoid short imprisonment (and, again, threats of rape), she does not consider whether to tell the court that he is trying to force her into a sexually compromising situation (the jailer promised to rape her). when it is locked). And just before she was taken to the gallows (to avoid rape), the guy found out in time that she sent him, and the loans fell out. <br /> <br /> Impossible situation and coincidence - so often that the film is just stupid. Combining this with all the sexual hints, it creates an unpleasant and sloppy movie mess that only the most stubborn fans of Pre-Code movies will like. The rest, be careful, it is very sticky and stupid from beginning to end!
