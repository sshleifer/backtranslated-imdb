I remember watching this mini-series for the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and resentment. After reading the comments on this headline, I have to agree with the comments of the inhabitants of Greece. This was done to coincide with the Olympic Games in Los Angeles in 1984, and it seemed to me that this is nothing more than an exercise in hurray-patriotic American nationalism, waving flags, in which American athletes are glorified at the expense of everyone else. Some other nationalities would have every right to feel deeply offended because of the way they were portrayed in this series. This can, however, help explain how many American viewers behaved at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984, and television coverage, which seemed to be interested only in events that the Americans are likely to win.
