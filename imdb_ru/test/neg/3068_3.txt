The recognition of the visitor’s picture on the DVD cover made me realize that it was a local film. The word "Detroit" in the title contributed to my suspicions, and I found out something, and yes, it was a local film. <br /> <br /> I picked it up. Someone I knew actually knew some producers / directors (I don’t remember which ones) and said that producers / directors made people pay to take part in this film. <br /> <br /> Great! What a great idea. Filmmakers get some capital to make a film with their cast and crew. Then investors (actors, film crew, others) receive a part of the profit, I imagine. <br /> <br /> Profit! <br /> <br /> Anyway. This film did not hit me at all. The special effects were special, like those of special children who ride small buses to school. The game was very fun, not intentionally however. There is a great trait where the guy says: “Well, this bone will not smoke itself!” As a loading line. Unfortunately, this is the only fun part of the whole movie. Story? Well, I sort of followed about 3/5 of the way, then everything stopped making sense, and when we sat and watched it, it suddenly ended. I mean, how ... there is no resolution of anything .. as they did not have enough time. “Sorry, guys, out of time, good night!” <br /> <br /> We sat there, confused and mocked, and thrown into another movie. Then, after about 20 minutes, my neighbor appeared ... with one of the guys from the movie! We brought him back and he (the actor) gave us a detailed commentary, which was awesome because he completely ripped the movie! <br /> <br /> What else can I ask ?? <br /> <br /> The scene for a motorcycle chase was the most absurd scene for me when it was so dark that a guy with a flashlight was passing by, not a motorcycle at all. That and the jaw, suddenly ending on your face, is enough to make you howl. Painfully! Zombies were less like zombies than my colleagues. And I also do not work in the morgue. <br /> <br /> So I recommend watching this if you can invite someone from the movie and give you a detailed commentary on everything that happened after the scene and make sure that this person hates the movie because it only adds to fun <br /> <br /> Otherwise, give this pass. Rent something like Feeders if you want your jaw to drop in a funny movie ...
