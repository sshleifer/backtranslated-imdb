Apparently, re-cut the episodes from the TV show Gangbusters on the big screen. Although this was often done in the 50s and 60s, because people did not have a TV or a color TV, and the producers wanted to increase the return on their investments (selling tickets to the big screen or if it went to the resale of a small screen of the series, which no syndication), the results were usually less than the sum of their parts. The only time I saw how it worked was where the multi-part stories were combined (Al Rocky Jones or Man From Uncle) or in the case of a horror anthology (Veil and 13 Demon Street). The effect here is that the stories of American criminals in the 1920s and 1930s (Dillinger, Handsome Floyd, Bonnie and Clyde, etc.) intersect each other when the narrator talks about how the FBI pursued them. This is a strange mixture that does not quite work, because it is clear that there are things here that do not belong to each other. I have repeatedly looked at the TV strange, because everything is not so. For the sake of fairness, I will not describe the low cost of production, since this was what the early television (and series) looked like. This is not bad, but not very good. Honestly, the episodes of the series that I saw work best in single episodes in which we donâ€™t expect much. If I had a choice, I would rent a DVD show instead of this movie.
