I saw this film because in every review I read it was said that it was one of the worst films of the new millennium. I really do not understand what was going on. On the one hand, the dialogue in this film was ridiculously bad (“What if something strange happens?” ... what ????). The game didn't tear my socks off. This could be because the script almost didn’t give the actors anything to work with ... the characters are purely two-dimensional for me, and I didn’t shout at all about them. Another thing is that the film is extremely boring. Extremely. Of course, there are several "shocks" here and there, but for the 112-minute length of the film, he certainly did not use his time wisely. Most of the film contains characters telling things that have nothing to do with the plot. What is the point of this ?? <br /> <br /> To top it off, the film does not make sense. Yes, I think I understood the intentions of the ghosts, but how it fits into the events that actually occur in the film is beyond my powers. In addition, most of the film is played in small vignettes, which sometimes complicates the story. And do not even start me with the ending. What exactly happened there? <br /> <br /> I can pay tribute to Kurosawa for putting some really scary images into the movie. There are very creepy shots of ghosts and other disturbing images. If they thought more about these images and developed them, it would make the film much stronger. But they did not do this, but instead focused in more detail on social commentaries that were interesting, but, again, depicted extremely boring. Yes, this is a movie message. Okay, cool. I'll just get a review of my review right here in the clear: find a better way to spend your free time than watch it.
