As a fan of semi-films, I heard about this infamous film a long time ago. I heard that it was basically a $ 15 million film about the tyrannical rule of the Roman emperor Caligula, complete with hard-core pornography. What struck me was that this porn movie was still big tragedies like Peter O'Toole, John Geilgud, Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren in this !! ?? A week ago I saw a documentary about Caligula on the “History” channel, and this film again surfaced in my head, and finally my curiosity overcame me, I foolishly rented a DVD and watched it even more stupidly. <br /> <br /> During the first 30 minutes, I saw sexual acts and especially violence that could earn NC-17 even by today's standards. Was it really necessary to have a scene with a man who had his urethra closed, then gallons of wine were poured into him, and then his stomach was cut open with a sword (all in very visual detail). And the scene where the guy gets his d *** cut off and fed the dogs (again in very graphic details) .... and it only scratches the surface. The argument for this film from those who like it seems that this is the only film that honestly depicts pagan Rome and its excesses. When in fact this film really is pure exploitation. From the beginning to the end, you see nothing but endless torture, decapitation and all sorts of violence and rude behavior that you can imagine (sadomasochism, rape, necrophilia, it just never stopped). There is no understanding of Caligula himself that could make him go insane, his terrible childhood, which turned him into a sadist in adulthood. This is not a historical film, this is a dirty film. Even porn in this film stinks, and through a lot of it, when I don’t pinch, I was just incredibly boring. By the time it was over, I was depressed, I wasn’t very hungry, and this film does the impossible, it can really distract you from sex. <br /> <br /> What these great actors thought about when they got into this. I read that the porn segments were filmed after the main shooting was completed (which explains why none of the main characters are in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so poor). But still, all these actors had to know what they got into. Right on the opening credits it says "Penthouse Magazine and Bob Gusionn presents." And the scenes in which famous actors actually take part are in themselves disgusting. Obviously, director Tinto Brass wanted to completely eliminate his name from the finished film, just like the screenwriter (Gore Vidal of all people). Even John Galegood and Peter O'Toole begged people not to see it when it opened at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> For the money that the producers spent on it, the quality of the film is terrible. Everything is lit and dull, as if the film had been cast into a swamp before it was developed, and then you were lucky to see a scene that is actually in focus. The sound is poorly duplicated, most of the music is clumsy, and the editing is terrible. <br /> <br /> In any case, I took this movie over. My advice ... do not look at it, do not look at it, do not look at it ... because for myself tomorrow night I am going to watch something lighter ... how DAWN OF THE DEAD!
