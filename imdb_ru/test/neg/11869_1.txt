OK, be brief. This film was not just bad, it was very, very bad, with lines like “if you are dealing with the devil you expect to get in your place,” you know him in the disgusting territory of the film. After watching this movie, I wanted to kill myself and my entire family, it gave me such a huge feeling of self-hatred that I wanted to commit a murder. Do not watch this film I will kill again, but when I do, it will be badly edited with a pitiful soundtrack and a serial shot for episodes of rolled and bad shirts. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there is a flip side, this is the first fighter with a three-door Ford Sierra. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it turns out to be broken on the roof :( <br /> <br /> PS: Worse than the shooter
