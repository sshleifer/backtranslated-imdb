I give him 2 - I reserve 1 rating for the Guy Ritchie and Woody Allen movies. We do not even remember what this film is about. The only thing we remember is one gunshot scene in which the actors fall to the ground, roll over to the other side of the corridor or something else, and then start shooting again. It was like watching an 80-year-old with two broken legs trying to do tricks. In addition, when the characters rode in the truck, the noise of the engine (or the radio? I do not remember) completely disappeared when the actors were talking. <br /> <br /> And, like others, we bought it because of the front cover of the Sandra Bullock. very sad very bad
