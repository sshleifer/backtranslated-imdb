This movie is about two female murderers who go on tour to kill the random men they meet. <br /> <br /> Wow, "Baise-moi" just became the worst movie of all time on my list. The plot is crazy, meaningless and unnecessary. The whole film is full of violence and sex, and I’m sure that no sane parent would want to show this film to their children. I do not understand what people are coming out of, making this film or watching this film. Perhaps someone somewhere fulfilled their perverted desires. There is simply no excuse or reason for the existence of this perverse and vicious work. <br /> <br /> The only consolation that I offer myself is that I watched it fast forward, so I didn’t waste so much time.
