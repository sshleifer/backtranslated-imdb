As a big fan of most modern fantasy movies, I was really looking forward to it. I was not familiar with the character, although, having heard some general comic book stories and good reviews about the film, I thought that it would be a real pleasure for me ... <br /> <br /> From now on, that the main character began to speak to his in a forced hoarse voice, I immediately realized that I would not like this film. I found the story weak and predictable, a bad game, the effects were very good for a small budget film, but did not do anything for the overall plot. <br /> <br /> Perhaps as a comic book fan, you can get something more out of it, otherwise I would advise you to skip it and not spend your money on movies in this boring adventure.
