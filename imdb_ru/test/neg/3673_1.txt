This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen, it has almost no plot, and the plot it has is very distracted. The storyline is absent both in the content and in the suspension and subtitles, since what seems to be a plotline is written in Russian. It seems that this is just one room with different lighting effects, and at that moment when you think that something good should happen, you are disappointed with the complete lack of acting, drama, indecision, horror, bloody, plot and mythology. The directing style was done to death (fisheye camera). It would seem that the only action in this film takes place within the last 10 to 15 minutes, and the action is aggravated by the inability of the actors to correctly depict the unknown. The only interesting thing about this movie is that my dog ​​barks at the surround sound.
