If you suffer from insomnia, then Radiant is the best way to send you to a seven-year-old coma. The film is so ridiculously overwhelmed and common that itâ€™s hard to imagine that director Steve Mahone could miss such obvious dullness. <br /> <br /> There is a banished Doctor (whom we will never see) in history, who goes into the desert to create a vaccine that will cure all diseases, filling the hosts with antibodies that can fight any infection (yes, exactly like this episode of Futurama). Vaccines do not work, and human guinea pigs are infected with a virus that kills within 48 hours. <br /> <br /> Not wanting government masked guys to catch the head of the group in the desert for shelter, hoping that sunlight would kill the virus. All this tells Michael, the only one of the quartets who are immune from infection. And this is the most boring story. They could play someone with an interesting voice, but instead we got someone with a less vocal personality than Clive Owen. <br /> <br /> In addition, the editor insists on cutting out more than half of the film, giving it strange dreams and a growing desire of the audience to go to sleep. Not surprisingly, half of the viewers came out of it, for some reason I was not one of them. But damn, I had to. <br /> <br /> The end must be shocking, smart and premonitory. But it is clear and simply not. Yes, relief, but not at all dramatic. <br /> <br /> The absolute cheapness of this production and the muffled sound that makes many dialogues unintelligible cripples that could be an interesting science fiction story if it had better actors, cooler places and a sense of urgency. As such, Radiant is the snoozefest.
