I love movies in this genre. Beautiful girls, toilet humor, unreasonable nudity. So why didn't I like this movie? No such film should add even the slightest confusion to the plot. Who's who, where's the money, it's not SE7EN, just make me laugh. Maybe it's me, but I never felt so disappointed when I watched American films with pies or any other, more modern films of the National Lamphun. This film has no flow that makes me smile, expecting what will happen next. Instead, I stop to think: “Why did they save this scene?” I do not recommend this film. If you are expecting Van Wilder, think again. The only pleasure I watched for this film was to guess which films were the actors when they were children. 2/10 generously.
