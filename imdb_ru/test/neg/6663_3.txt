During a train ride, a woman (Stefan Exoffie) mistakenly goes to a remote station when the train stops in the middle of the night. Soon, she discovers that the strange lone shooter (Jim van der Vode), who does not speak her language, is the only person in the area, and this was the last train on the way. The man settled her in his house, and between them there were unusual, wordless relationships. <br /> <br /> “De Visselwachter” is an overpriced boredom, on the other, but uninteresting history, which is not going anywhere. I like Off-Hollywood films, but this story is too absurd and ultimately meaningless. Sexual tension between the two leading characters is ridiculous, but too repeated. I saw this movie in an old VHS, and the image is too dark; I don't know if the DVD will be a better quality image. In the end, I was absolutely disappointed with this feature. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Oh Home da Linha” (“Man of the Line”)
