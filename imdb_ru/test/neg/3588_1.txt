The only reason for the existence of FC De Campioenen is local popularity. This made this comedic film work for more than 15 years (and is still considered). <br /> <br /> It tells about an amateur football team with an emphasis on “amateur”. Each story line is devoted to the same topic: some kind of misunderstanding that takes absurd (and predictable) proportions to finally be resolved. <br /> <br /> The show has been going on for more than 15 years, and the production probably will not change the winning team. This means that over the years there have been minor changes in the show (except for the replacement of several actors (they almost all left themselves and were not thrown out of the show)). Humor has not changed over the years, and it was already outdated when it first went on the air. <br /> <br /> I think you must be a Flemish to receive it, and over 60 years old to enjoy such an old-fashioned television show like this.
