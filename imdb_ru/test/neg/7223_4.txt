Richard Donner demonstrates his liberal powers in this ridiculously overcooked simplified attack on South African politics. It's not as if America were the cradle of racial harmony and fraternal love - and additional irony is added by the fact that the film takes place in a city that was the home of Rodney King and glorifies the police department, which has done so much for social relations with its cruel racist behavior . Thus, Donner couples with salt and pepper, who are obviously suffering from teenage love for each other, do their work with complete disregard for the rule of law or the rules of evidence, and no one bothers because the bad guys are white South Africans — undoubtedly an alarming example police racism in itself? Inside the Rudd office (Joss Ackland is supremely hissing), the decor is designed and lit to remind, as far as possible, the bunker führer, and in case some rather stupid moviegoers miss the point, he and his people are called "Nazis" at regular intervals of time, For me, the only bright spot in the film was that Mel Gibson appeared at the anti-apartheid demonstration with a banner reading “The End Is Now Separated”. Strongly annoying Joe Sands is introduced into the franchise in order to remove some of the weight from the shoulders of the boys, continuously following them, nodding like a poorly trained puppy. It would be tolerable if there was the most remote possibility of him being in a concrete coat, but, unfortunately, he survives to annoy another day. Miss Patsy Kensit seems to be in her own world, perhaps not believing that she was lucky to have been thrown in front of Mel Gibson, who has no problems putting her in a bed in her mobile home, which seems to have been washed somewhere. then on the beach. Shortly after completing them, they therefore come under fire from several helicopters that fire enough shells into the Mel Caravan to keep the US Army in Iraq for six months. Fortunately, he has a domestic dog who is not afraid to cause interruption of sexual intercourse just as they go for a few seconds, and his barking warns them of an imminent attack. I hope he received a special bone as a reward. The climax of the film (without a break from Mel's dog) on ​​a cargo ship bound for Nazi Germany (sorry, South Africa), when Mel and Danny kill so many members of the main race that I lost count. Despite the fact that they were spinning like Bonnie and Clyde, Mel survives under the blow of a bullet, curled up in the arms of his partner, like a little child with a wise and benevolent father. Take it apartheid!
