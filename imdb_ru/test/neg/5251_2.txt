What kind. Uh ... <br /> <br /> This film is so disconnected and spoiled that I literally lost some of my sanity after it was over. I will never be the same person. I'm trying to figure out what is completely insane in this ... It's not just funny techno music or the medieval setting of Blade Runner, Wild West, Highlander, or the strange human-like CGI Grendel , made from animated sausages, or even to the monster "Grendel-mother", similar to some Alabama table dancer, who grew claws and tentacles when she stayed too long in the solarium. All these things are weird, but the strangest thing about this film is acting. I just can not explain. This script is obviously damn stupid, but the actors exude deadly seriousness through it all. Lambert is always strange and, as a rule, rather boring, but this time he went to Dolph Lundgreen’s territory: I can’t stop laughing when he speaks. <br /> <br /> I will give this film some credit in order to be completely scattered and crazy as opposed to conservative and boring. I will always tolerate a strange catastrophe of a film over a completely mediocre one. <br /> <br /> Warning: if you plan to look at Christopher Lambert as Beowulf, be prepared to spend a few hours after that, wandering the streets in some kind of nightmarish, hyperactive-catatonic stupor. This is true. When I finished my spiritual journey through Beowulf, I woke up in the middle of the Siberian tundra in a pool of blood and milk. A dead wolf lay next to me, and later I found that I had a handful of human teeth in my shirt pocket. My VHS copy of Beowulf sat on a hastily built stone altar nearby, decorated with candles and faded flowers. Ribbon told me to go. I got up and went.
