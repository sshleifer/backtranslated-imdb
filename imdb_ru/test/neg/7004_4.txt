I met Yvette McClendon in a film at the Los Angeles Film Festival and thought she was a doll. After writing my review of her film, I wanted to see more of her! Found this movie, it was pretty bad. Not her fault, it is only in the first few minutes, when she is obviously the person who pulls you to watch this bad movie. BAD Direction. The scenes are repeated again and again, with all the actresses. Amber Smith has a very bad chest job, but the rest of the actresses looked pretty good. I really like Yvette, but obviously it was her bad choice. I can't believe that I rented this garbage to look for it. I hope to find other films for her.
