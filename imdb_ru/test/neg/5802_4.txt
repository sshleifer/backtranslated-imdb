First of all, I would like to say that I really liked this film. However, I cannot say that it was a “good” movie. I entered the theater with rather low expectations (which I learned to do). I am glad that I did, because the plot and development were not stellar. The jokes were inferior humor. But I was in the right mood to enjoy them. <br /> <br /> I was not the only one. In fact, the whole theater laughed loudly. I did not hear anyone complain after the film came to an end. I even saw one guy fall out of his chair laughing! But then again, I must warn you, “Grandma's Boy” is NOT a high-quality film. This is a funny (albeit low-brow) movie, and if you choose the right mindset, you will really like it. Oh, and do not carry children.
