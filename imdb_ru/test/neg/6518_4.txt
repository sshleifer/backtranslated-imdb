acting is good. These are positives from the road! SOSN is shallow and superficial. Almost all the characters are middle class and English. Gays are depicted as unstable sexual predators seeking to use children in their empty lives. This film can only appeal to people who know the health of Hampstead and will receive little satisfaction. point to any landmarks. There is no time to interact with the characters, and as a result you don’t really care about them, Catherine Tate is in the midst of the stars of her comedic fame as a woman who seeks divorce from her husband and on the screen at about the same time that Nana’s sketches couldn’t convince , however, if she had said “what kind of freedom”, I would have agreed <br /> <br /> I would have better walked through the Park, unwise garbage!
