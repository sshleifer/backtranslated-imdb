Make no mistake that High School Bigshot is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> High School Bigshot is a geek who plans to get rich and get a girlfriend. However, he does it all wrong, and, of course, by the end of the film, death ends with several other people, fortunately, including the girl. <br /> <br /> The moral of this story - all the concerns of women about this wealth. Also for us, men, I suppose, we just have to accept that we either “have” or “we don't have it”! <br /> <br /> I could easily see how this movie can be rated at 1, but it’s higher than the worst movie ever. The action is not really terrible, and production values ​​are not very terrible. In general, this is a bad film, and it is not worth watching for many reasons. If, of course, you insist on torturing yourself, look at the MST version. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe 1.5 / 10)
