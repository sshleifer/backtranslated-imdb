I love Japanese films - I watched at least 100-200. Therefore, it is obvious that I am not afraid of Japanese films. However, sometimes there are Japanese concepts for the film that are just not well suited for Westerners. They may be hits at home, but abroad they just don't seem, well ... normal. It's like living fish that my wife ate at a business meeting, or strange PS2 games, such as dating simulators or Katamari Damacy - things that are accepted there that are not confusing the Japanese. Probably this is how others take things that Americans take for granted, such as football, Snicker Fries and Paris Hilton! Well, the king of strange Japanese films that Americans simply do not fit, maybe ATAMA-YAMA. Now the style of animation does not matter - it is different, but quite good. No, this is the very concept of the story and a rather strange ending. This is what makes this film really unusual, and it looks like this: there was a miserly man who, for no apparent reason, had a tree growing out of his head. At first there was little, and he just cut it off, but again and again it grew again - so he just decided to let go. And after a while, people began to live on their heads under the shade of a tree. Strangely enough, when they were under a tree, they were tiny, but when they left, they were full-size again. Then, finally, sick of it all and tearing out a tree, the man drowned (!?) In a hole at the top of the head, where there was a tree! The end. <br /> <br /> See! I told you that it was very, very strange, but not as good as “Tampopo” or “The Happiness of the Katakuri” - just strange. O-D-D .... weird! And if you do not have a very high tolerance for such things, I doubt that it will be bad for you to know that this Oscar-nominated film did not win. Honestly, it makes me happy, because I really do not want this film to stimulate such films. The only reason he earns 4 is related to good, but not impressive animation. <br /> <br /> This film hurt my brain ... I hope this is not a sign that I have a tree!
