This film is painful. This is probably the best way to describe it. These are 93 minutes of your life that you can never return. Well, actually, itâ€™s more like 86 minutes, because no one wants to sit through the captions in this stinking heap of dog feces. We can immediately say that the film is from the producer "Mortal Kombat", because of the loud and annoying techno soundtrack. It drains some ridiculously pleasant moments that this film can give you. Everything else is exhausted by the completely uninteresting and annoying characters, the acting abilities of "Freddie Prinze, Jr. School of Acting" of all the participants (including the mistaken Christopher Lambert) and the non-existent director. Did I miss something? Of course I did. Let's not forget about the script that leads to suicide, with its unitary (??) funny dialogue. Oh yes, and let's also talk about how they dishonored the original poem with this sad and useless futuristic / medieval translation. Suits and weapons (were those giant pizza scissors that I kept on seeing?!?!) Just stupid, this is the best way I can describe them. And the last culprit of the night is always a terrible CGI. When will directors find out that CGI sucks? When will we see the wonderful effects used in the 80s? Probably never, but movies like this and Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace make us want them to return them. In conclusion, avoid this movie as the latest Freddie Prince Jr. movie. On the other hand, if you like the films of Freddie Prince Jr., then you deserve to find this terrible reason for filmmaking.
