I caught this North American premiere at the Chicago International Film Festival. I was out of frustration. Judging by the mood of the audience, I was not the only one. <br /> <br /> The film takes a long time to get to the conflict, and then he refuses to allow it, instead deciding to tell us "To be continued." Is it a spoiler to show that the movie has no end? I think this is more of a warning. This is, at best, only half the film, not the good half.
