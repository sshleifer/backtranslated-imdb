I was a big fan of the original Robocop. <br /> <br /> But to say that I was disappointed with this first sequel would be an understatement. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of problems. <br /> <br /> Glossy, although the film may seem like there are a lot of balls on the screen that everyone sees: guides, cameramen, etc., which I consider completely unacceptable for someone from the Irvin Kreshner pedigree. <br /> <br /> Robocop has become a robot. There is no spark of humanity in this character. True disappointment, given that his "soul" returned to the end of the first film. Here his attitude shows no human side and does not allow him to sympathize. <br /> <br /> Kane is a bad villain. Well, I know that the Boddiker from the first movie was better than average, mainly due to Kurtwood Smith’s performance, but usually the solid Tom Noonan creates a character that you don’t care about either. <br /> <br /> What happened to the old man ???? I appreciate the fact that he has not achieved where he is, being “nice”, but the change in his character here is nothing short of a daze. In the first film, it is clear that he despises the tactics and attitude of Dick John, and yet here he is no better than Jones. This makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Dr. Fax is a poor substitute for the charismatic, albeit unpleasant, genius OCP resident Bob Morton. <br /> <br /> Sequences of actions, with the exception of the sequence in which Murphy stuck on the side of Kane's truck, are sharp and nasty and repulsive rather than entertaining. <br /> <br /> And finally. What's with the musical score? Do not tell me that Poleduris could not do this simply because at that time he was working on Total Recall. The soundtrack to the show (TV or movie) is part of his personality. Part of his character. When you take it away, it hurts the familiar characters we are watching. So it's bad enough, but a shame Leonard Rosenman. Here he deserves evil, camp and worthy of attention. <br /> <br /> History has moments to be fair. There is a lot of originality. But he tries too many things to fit into one movie. Hob is a well-implemented villain and the only truly unsightly "villain" in this movement, everything is with his thumb up to Gabriel Damon. <br /> <br /> The final match between Robocop and Robocop 2 is also fun. <Br /> <br /> But for the vast majority of his work time, this is a serious disappointment.
