If you need the key to understanding whether Playmaker is decent or not, look at its star, Colin Firth, who calls it in the interview "absolute rubbish - I sincerely hope that no one will ever see it." <br /> <The script and plot are ridiculous, the female role is not convincing. The only thing worth is Colin Firth, and he seems a little confused everywhere. <br /> <br /> Only for inflexible Firth fans - one scene in the soul is worth $ 3.99, which you may have to pay out if you find it in a trash can for a video like me. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m glad for Mr. Firth that his days when he was working on similar projects are over!
