Noir friends, friends, do not be deceived, this is a stinker ... badly filmed, poorly played and nothing ... there is nothing here for the movie buff looking for another solid B-film from the gold mines of the 40-50s classics. I tried this based on a relatively high IMDb rating. There is no accounting for taste, but I have not found anything in this film to recommend to other members of IMDb. This is a classic example of how you watched a movie and felt that you were deceived because of the number of minutes it took the film for its grateful demise. Alan Ladd on the cover of a DVD / cassette is almost a scam, he takes off his camera for less than two minutes and barely speaks! This is not "This is a weapon for its people" ... this is a classic in a lousy sense, when studios produce food without a budget ... We are all looking for excellent ... save your time on Gangs, Inc. Paper bullets ... it's crappy!
