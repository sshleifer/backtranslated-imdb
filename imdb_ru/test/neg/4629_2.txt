Sex is the most remarkable aspect of existence. This is perhaps the most interesting occupation between birth and death. LE DECLIN DE L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN exploring human sexuality in a dry and boring way. In fact, worse than just bored, seeing naked 40-year-olds is, of course, unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I suppose that the shocking maturity of adults is what adults say about sex, but after twenty minutes, it ceases to be interesting. Perhaps if the characters were 20 years younger, the film would be more visually fascinating. <br /> <br /> LE DECLIN DE L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN is not worth the time.
