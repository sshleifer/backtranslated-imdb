This picture is a bad and exploded excerpt from Michael Paul's short film, RANDOM since 1995. While the idea of ​​Michael Paul was original and ideal for a short film, the plot of SOUND OF THUNDER was poorly adapted to the story of Paul and was not suitable for a full-length feature film that could be expected from a large studio Hollywod. In this case, the tragic flood situation that destroyed the film sets in Prague was just one bad link in a long rusty film production chain. For a studio to release such a product ... it's a shame. Especially for Warner Brothers, a studio that opened new stages for effects with shows such as BABYLON 5 in 1993. On TELEVISION. The visual effects for television shows that first used computer graphics in episodic television in the mid-nineties were much more sophisticated than what is shown on the screen in this picture. In such cases, sadly: maybe a movie.
