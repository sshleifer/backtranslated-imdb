In New York, on the morning before Christmas, the father and mother from the upper class ride their BMW to a private school to watch their daughter's play. Then they go shopping and then return to their trendy Manhattan apartments. At night, they move into a simple apartment in a dangerous area where drugs are prepared for distribution. On Christmas Eve, buying a Christmas present for his daughter, his father is kidnapped, and his wife is desperate to raise a large amount of money to pay the ransom requested. “R Xmas” is a deceptive film by Abel Ferrara. The main characters do not have names, are anonymous, and perhaps its intention is to say that there may be drug dealers in the chest of a neighboring family; or that drug dealers may also have families and may be loving people; or that there are a lot of dirty cops, probably worse than criminals; or is it a simple excuse for crime? No difference! However, this humanization of criminals is a terrible message, and I really didn’t like this film. For example, in Brazil, many drug dealers and criminals are helping their communities because of the lack of a state in poor areas and slums, but this procedure does not make them a model citizen. In this film, we see a loving family of the upper class, which gives drugs as a means of livelihood, but the destruction of members of other families is not reflected in history, and it is impossible to feel sympathy for any characters. In the end, I wished them all dead. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Gangues do Gueto” (“Ghetto Gangs”)
