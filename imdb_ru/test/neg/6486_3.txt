An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous bag of nuts (note: I would like to see Drago, Stephen McHetti and Lance Hendrickson in one movie; let's talk about raging cheekbones!). The soundtrack wasn't terrible either. <br /> <br /> But acting was even awesome for professionals such as Drago and Debbie Rochon, the direction was worse (probably contributed to the first), the chimpanzee dialogues, and the camera works, it's barely tolerable. However, these were sets that got a big “10” on my “oi-wei” scale. I don’t know where it was taken, but if I ventured to suggest it would be either an open-air museum or one of those reconstruction villages where everything is too well maintained to do more than suggest a “real old west”. Well, it was filmed on a student college budget. However, I could forgive one or two of the above errors. But, having gathered everything together and being generous, I did not see him give him more than three stars.
