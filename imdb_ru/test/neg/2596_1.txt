It’s such a shame that so many people “love” Family Guy, because it’s easily one of the worst shows on television, there are a lot of things to watch out for. <br /> <br /> Memories. Now, in season 1 and 2, which, in my opinion, were exceptional, the memories were quite frequent and in fact were somewhat related to the plot and were even funny. Now, in the 4th season, the memories have become even brighter and have no relation to the plot, they are not funny, but really long, boring and meaningless. The family guy thinks that long dredges that lead nowhere are ridiculous, although in reality this is a bad letter. <br /> <br /> Stewie: Wow, baby that sounds English. How funny can that be? Is not. His character is so unstable that it is incredible. Remember, at the beginning of the season, when Stewie was interested in world domination and Lois murder. Well, now he just has scenes that are awkwardly funny with Brian. From striving for world domination to becoming gay = bad writing. <br /> <br /> Recommendations: How do they manage to constantly give bad references to TV shows or events of the 80s? Well, they just reuse the same old trash. You know, in 20 years, I hope Family Guy will be canceled by then, if they still joke about the 80s show, it will be even more irrelevant than before. Because they will forget. It still makes me wonder why they can't just write good episodes with quality jokes. <br /> <br /> Voice: Oh my God, the voices in this series are very bad. Seth MacFarlin should just focus on his crappy episode and stop making voices. All additions in the already bad episodes of "Family Guy" sound the same. The Simpsons make 6 or 7 people do ALL the voices. Some of them sound about 15-20 characters ... all sound very different. But why can't the Family Guy do this? Yes, of course, this is a shit show. <br /> <br /> Stuttering: Peter, Stewie, Bryan and other extras usually do it, whenever they say or be offended, they should stutter in their sentence just to try to laugh cheaply. I can't believe that Family Guy can't even speak properly to make people laugh at their "jokes." <br /> <br /> Offense: good, short and simple, Family Guy tries to overcome the barrier and be a cutting edge, but in fact they fall every time. Go see South Park ... <br /> <br /> Horrible stories: stories and storylines are just rubbish. The Simpsons began their 20th seasons, STILL have better plots than Family Guy. About 8 or 9 minutes are memories and drag scenes that have nothing to do. <br /> <br /> Popularity. Many young children wear Stewie shirts and think that he is so funny, although in fact they don’t even get badly written sexy jokes. They just say, “Oh, haha, stew!” When they don't even get it. Family Guy was canceled twice and returned to sales of the DVD, which is sad. They are canceled for the first time, I think, after the 2nd or 3rd season, and I sincerely believe that it should be so. these episodes were great then, they had to be left on a high note. <br /> <br /> Drag and Drop Scenes and Falls There are scenes that last too long. The one that was just broadcast this past Sunday, Peter went to the executive bathroom, in which about 2 minutes was spent imitating joining the Jurassic Park, and the plot of this episode was also stolen from the Seinfeld episode. There is also a scene in which Chris works in a store and for about 5 minutes talks with an employee about a film that also has a stutter. FIGHT AGAINST CHICKENS SO STUPID, 3 of them, each longer than the previous one. useless, unfamiliar writing, thinking that people like long scenes of re-fight, between chickens and chicken. now, every time someone falls, and by the way, no family fan can deny it, that every time he falls, it happens in a split second, and they ALWAYS land with their hands on their backs to make them look ridiculous. I think it was used at least 30 times. <br /> <br /> Herman Oh, God, everyone thinks that the old pedophile is so funny when he just runs very badly. they even went to great lengths, giving him singing scenes (which are very poor) and, basing ALL the episodes around him, they did the same thing with other characters like the doctor, who, as I know, had an episode based around him. <br /> <br /> The Simpsons Well, there are not many explanations needed. There is a lot of evidence that Family Guy stole Simpson's jokes. As a family guy - just the Simpsons of the poor. <br /> <br /> So I’m sure that I’ve forgotten some key points somewhere, but I’m sure that this is enough to prove that the family guy is really terribly horribly written TV show that everyone seems to love when In fact, they should watch Simpson, Seinfeld and Fraser.
