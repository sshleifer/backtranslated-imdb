Well, this is part of historical filmmaking that caused noise, shocked people and was banned. I will give it to him, which is why I gave him 3, not 1. Perhaps it was ahead of time, but, of course, now it is far behind the times. I'm a big fan of Salvador Dali, and I loved Un Chien Andalou. This short one was exciting with one creative scene after another. L'age d'Or was too long and boring — just an indulgent piece of pompous filmmaking, created simply as a weak attempt to surpass Un Chien Andalou by creating a full-length film (and shamelessly using Dali’s film ). Full of garbage, with the exception of (very) several shots of "shocking scenes", separated by long pieces of boring inaction. A waste of time and money. Both of my thumbs are down. He will go to my regiment and will never look again.
