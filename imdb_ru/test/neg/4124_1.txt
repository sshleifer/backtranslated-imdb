In general, skip this movie, it's so bad. In short, this film is about an armory where a secret weapon is developed. Since they do bad things, they are not popular, so to speak. A new female CEO is coming to clarify the situation and make sure that the company's reputation will be improved. She does this by passing confidential company information to the press ... Do you believe that? In addition, she begins to fire people she has never seen. Incredible, huh? The pacifist group is trying to destroy the company's mainframe because there is a secret weapon model there. This mainframe is located at the bottom of a building, hidden in some kind of storage. Of course, the film would not be complete without a mad scientist and a robot, which is a perfect machine-killer, which resembles "Alien" from films about Aliens. A mad scientist likes a female CEO. <br /> <br /> A mad scientist instructs a robot to kill everyone, protects his work, enhances the command staff and makes the film interesting. Pacifists team up with the CEO and another face of the board of directors to escape from the robot. They further agree to blow up this evil computer mainframe while avoiding the robot. They also discover that a part-time, part-time soldier was being developed at the factory. They can erase personal memory and replace it with a veteran soldier. One of the pacifists turns into such a soldier and will hunt for a killer robot. I think the mad scientist also wrote the script for this film. This super-soldier looks and behaves almost as much as Robocop, although not so funny. <br /> <br /> It all comes down to this. People are running, pursued by a killer-robot, it hurts them, but it seems they donâ€™t care about them, except that they are lame, and, of course, the female general director is the main character of this film and cannot be killed. . survives with every attack, explosion, you name it. I will not bother you with a chase, let's move on to the end. They have a lot of weapons, and a pacifist, and they know how to use it. When they are on the roof of a building, they remove all the weapons on the killer robot. They enter the elevator, which is used to clean the exterior windows. And then the executive director also knows magic: on the roof she complained that she had no bullets left, and, like magic, the gun was reloading. Thus, she can shoot at the ropes and allow the elevator to fall sharply 70 or so floors and allow it to stop right above the ground, pulling the brake. And to top it all off, the police are waiting for them there. The robot jumps behind them and kills the cops. Funny no? The robot chases them down the storage area where the mainframe is located, and when the robot finally gets so close to it that it can touch it / kill it, it stops. Because the mad scientist did not want her killed. The best name for this guy would be a learned idiot. Although it was he who made this film watchable. At that moment I was already trying to kill the killer robot to finish them all, so the film will end. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this film is rated so highly, and that is why I wrote this comment. Avoid this movie like the plague. This is a monster, and I'm not talking about Death Car.
