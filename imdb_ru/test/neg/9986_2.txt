As an ancient film fan, I heard a lot about the controversial film Caligul being regarded as ambiguous as one of the most realistic epics in some and as one of the most disgusting porn films of others. I decided to see him in the whole uncut version, in order to evaluate it myself in the hope of finding something positive that could justify many accusations in the film. I sat down on a chair one autumn evening and began to look. The initial quotation from the New Testament shocked me a little and caused the first contradiction in me ... why involve the proposal of the Gospel of Mark in the film about pagan Rome? But the prelude pastoral scene with a young half-naked couple (Caligula and Drusilla), hopelessly running through the meadows, seemed rather sentimental. Music that sounded unforgettable, while credits also provoked me in a positive sense. However, negative feelings came to me rather soon, especially after the death of Tiberius. Cruelty seemed very strong, and sexuality was exaggerated. However, it was not so terrible for the middle. In the second half of the film, I felt as if I had not seen any historical epic, but extremely disgusting porn. In the end, I said to myself: “This is one of the films that one can really hate” ... I know that the film can be controversial, but I never expected CALIGULA to go that far, removing all the limits of taste. I hate this film for many reasons, but especially for one. <br /> <br /> CALIGULA does not serve the purpose of the ancient epic (as he claims it is), but Bob Guccione, the director and founder of Penthouse pornographic magazine, aims to combine cinema with porn. This, I think, is the most serious thing to blame the film. Cinema is an art that should reign in taste, according to the message, through a feeling of epic grandeur, while this film kills all the limits of good taste. CALIGULA shows the most brutal side of a person in the most evil, decadent way. Some scenes are so disgusting that I do not think that there are people whose psyche will not be affected by them. Some say that Rome during the reign of Caligula was so cruel. Yes it's true. Corruption flourished at the time, various sexual deviations were preferable to Roman citizens. However, I don’t think that it’s strictly so strictly to focus on these deviations and make them an accent of an ancient epic. I suppose that this rather proves the bizarre psyche of producers and their strange tendencies ... <br /> <br /> HUGE HISTORICAL ERRORS: the scenario of Vidala Mountain is notorious for its inaccuracies. This is noticeable, for example, on the figure of Proculus (Donato Placido), the historic Roman senator. Nevertheless, the film shows him as a mere soldier upon whom Caligula imposes his most decadent methods of torture and rape. Moreover, Libya was not the wife of Proculus, raped by Caesar at her wedding. What is behind the transformation of the stories of historical characters in history, filled with incredible vulgarity and violence? Another example of historical parody is the figure of Caesonia, depicted by Helen Mirren. She is represented as the wife of Caligula along with Drusilla, his sister. In fact, Caligula married Cezonia much later than the death of his sister. Sexual abuse of his new wife in the temple is a fun scene without historical grounds. I also hated the moment with the killing machine - the director's pure imagination, which has nothing to do with historical facts. <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL ASPECT AND ACTORS: From a technical point of view, the film is nothing special. Cinematography cannot boast that it is exceptionally good, and the scenery along with the costumes are also no different. Nevertheless, the only strength of the film - the performances, in particular, Malcolm McDowell in the role of Caligula. He copes well with the work in the title role, depicting the madness and cruelty of the emperor. McDowall adds value to the film. If in CALIGULA everything bothers you, you can at least admire his game. It also seemed to me that Helen Mirren as Kesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla (although the film is based on Suetonius's rumors that Caligula was making love to his sister). Sir John Gilgud as Nerva and Peter O'Toole as Old Tiberius were also remembered. O'Toole performs his best works in a sequence of the Grotto of Capri, depicting the decline and exhaustion of the old emperor. Yes, I admit that the only thing I like about CALIGULA is the performances. Therefore, I do not appreciate the film 1/10. <br /> <br /> LAME CONTINUITY: the historical inaccuracy of the film is also combined with poor continuity. Let's analyze only the beginning: Caligula comes to Capri Grotto, where he sees the terrible pleasures of old Tiberius. Then, after about 15 minutes, the action moves to Rome, where the black bird near Drusilla and the bed of Caligula represents a bad omen. And immediately the characters again appear on Capri, where the Nerva dies (John Gilgud) ...? <br /> <br /> In general, I do not recommend seeing KALIGULA to anyone. If you want to know the story, read Robert Graves's magnificent novel “I, CLAUDY and CLAUDIA GOD” or watch the Herbert Wise mini-series with the magnificent performance of Derek Jacobi. CALIGULA is a sick film, the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art. It is, for its part, a porn movie that should never be called epic. <br /> <br /> There are films that are truly artistic and sharpen the taste of people of beauty, <br /> <br /> there are films of the average level; nevertheless, they have something to offer, <br /> <br /> there are films that show extreme violence; yet they still convey some morality, <br /> <br /> however there are films that show illness and decay for their own sake and therefore harm people's minds.
