I'm a big fan of vile and horrible movies, when you connect them, this is my favorite place: terrible meanness. You won't get it in this movie, however. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is deception when girls are abducted and tortured, naked, tied to various things. The meanness is not very mean, though. He did not show up too high on my device, mainly because none of the girls was the least attractive and did not try to act as if they were even threatened. They seemed to be thinking more about what was at dinner, or maybe when they could have cracked some kind of crack. <br /> <br /> Forget about the effects, they were extremely backward. Bravery contributed to a bad game; effects are harder to believe when even actors and actresses who do not buy into them. <br /> <br /> The cameraman was very bad, they could hire a couple of porn cameramen and do better. In fact, it could increase the attractiveness factor to make it enjoyable. In fact, there are many dark frames that you cannot see very clearly, and what you see does not look too good. <br /> <br /> The terrible factor is zero. Zero. Zero. Nada Zip Shish. I saw children's films that were more frightening. There is no camp here either. It's just a movie that tries to be disgustingly sloppy, but it doesn't even come close.
