When a film claims fame, this is what Martin Shin's younger, lesser-known brother plays a role in it, you know that he will not be really good. "Soultaker" is a low-budget, stupid film about a group of 20 with something that the angel of death has been pursuing. This is a stupid film, but it is quite interesting and even a little pleasant in its stupidity. <br /> <br /> The plot in the film is very small, and it stretches as much as possible. Joe Estevez is not a very good actor, so, fortunately for the audience, he has very few lines and his role is mainly only in the fact that he was walking. This film really gives the impression that he is trying to be a horror / fantasy franchise, given that he has the same plot scheme as the slasher. 4 characters, each dying one by one ... will anyone live? Who really cares. Although it seems I hated it, but I did not. I just didnâ€™t like it very much, but I was interested in most of them, so I think it means something. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 of ****. 90 minutes PG-13 for language, violence and nudity.
