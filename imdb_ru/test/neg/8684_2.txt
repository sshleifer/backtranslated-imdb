This film was a complete yawn, which lasted forever, but never was. It was just boring to look at, in fact, so much that I could never really dive into it. This film is not a horror film with a strained imagination, the cover of the videotape is made as such. Instead, it's a thriller-like movie with several horror elements that make the movie more interesting. Of course, this will not help this film at all. Basically, all I remember is that this film was something of a 1970s movie called The Deep. A bunch of treasure hunt, rival groups of this kind of stuff. It also has supernatural turns, but, to tell the truth, I was so bored to watch this movie, that I sort of turned off, so I can not say what kind of supernatural elements it is. I kind of remember traces on the bottom of the sea, so maybe it was some walking dead, or I could have thought of Lucio Fulcio’s film “Zombies”, and not about a horror movie that was set on a tropical island and strange that it was much more interesting than this movie. That day we learned a valuable lesson: never make a film based on the cover.
