... if you laughed for a long time and want to relax. <br /> <br /> After reading about 25 adverse reviews about this show, I decided to turn it on and check it out. for myself. Everything that each of these people said about this show is absolutely true. Mind of Mencia is like the half-hour version of Mad TV, but with slightly worse jokes. <br /> <br /> One parody, which I observed with displeasure, was the "Second Annual Olympiad on Stereotypes." What's so funny about a black guy who has swimming problems, or a gay guy named “Brilliant” who won the banana-eating contest? None of these concepts is particularly new, insightful or fun. Do we really need a Star Wars joke in every episode? This film was released 30 years ago. The decision of Mencia to solve funny things is to discard some stereotypes about Hispanics and add a few “beans” there; and call it a day to go home and ride in a pile of money. Pure comedic genius. <br /> <br /> Then he brazenly tore off Jeff Foxworthy in the second show, which I watched, with the bit "Your gay, if ...". You could only imagine the roaring laughter he got when he made his way to the joke of Ryan-Seekrest-and-gay. It is not like what has already been done to death. <br /> <br /> If you're not a big fan of Jason Friedberg and Adam Zeltser’s films, please stay away from this show. Especially when there are real comedians like Dave Chappell, who can joke about races and racism and still be insightful.
