Yes, I really found this film unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I didn’t like Sandra’s character. Oh, she really annoyed me. It is unlikely that it will be adopted in rural Italian life due to the fact that it is not white. It was nonsense for the PC. <br /> <br /> The film is also offensive to Italian men. For example, one man with whom she (Diane Lane) has an affair turns out to be a liar. But guess what: in the end, your typically plastic American brick head appears, all tender white smile and tan, and she finally finds what she wants: a real American man, and now she has colonized another part of the world. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is rather racist, depicting Italians and how it enslaves them as clever Lotarians or backward peasants. <br /> <br /> The photo was good, but the film and its attitude were trash.
