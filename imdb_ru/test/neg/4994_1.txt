With a terrible game, terrible dialogue, a lot of bad humor, a crappy storyline and a terrible movie. It must be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I am the king in search of bad movies. For effect, they simply shed fake blood on people and things, did not spend time creating wounds and creating special effects that cost something. Most people who make low-cost horror films at least do something like pieces of cloth or something else to make a wound. The dialogue was far from even decent, and the game was without guidance or effort. They just threw some of the actors on the set and said they have it. I swear, I saw the best films from my film, which I teach at school. How did it get the DVD release?
