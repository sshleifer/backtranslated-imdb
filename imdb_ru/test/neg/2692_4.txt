Last week, I watched Macbeth production at the Royal Shakespeare Company. It was 25 years old, removed without props, except for swords, unfurnished, except for chairs. It was a CELL. The acting was super - all the actors taught the British. Compare this performance with this ... yawn yawn yawn. Al Pacino, like Shylock, was tragic, heavy and could not completely lose the New York accent, despite the long .... pauses ... between ..... lines ... It was all sleepy. Even "comic" the scenes were hardly worth a smile, let the lonely belly laugh. It must be funny. They tried to make it tragic. It was not just boring. I give him four points for the costumes, scenery and Jeremy Irons, who can play a boring, depressed, with a deep voice of a guy (can he be someone else ???)
