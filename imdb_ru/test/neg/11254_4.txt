The conqueror of Shambhala shows what happens when the creators of the anime do not understand what their fans want. I, as a fan, did not want the film “Evil Nazis” of the 1920s. I would like to see a real final confrontation between Ed and Dante, since we DO NOT really know what happened to her. I would also like Ed to return to his world much earlier and ask him to stay there in order to finally get a chance to become normal. You know, to create a family with a certain blonde-mechanic, this kind of thing. No, instead I got an elaborate plot involving Nazi mystics, Fritz Lang and about ten minutes Al, a joke with Cameo Roy Mustang and only one Armstrong joke, one short joke and the absence of Winry hitting Ed with a wrench. First of all, I just did not think that it was the Steel Alchemist.
