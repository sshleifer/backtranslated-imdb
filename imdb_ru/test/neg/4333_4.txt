The author of "The Prince" manages to take a great cast, a decent story, a mediocre script and carefully assemble them into one boring, monotonous, amateurish mess. Despite the strong central role of Frank Nassau, the prince, this scattered film wanders aimlessly from stage to stage, painfully breaking up into a hash. The result brings a sigh of relief at the end, where there should be tears of joy. A sad waste of time and talent and a good example of how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br />
