Sad ... really sad. There is nothing in this film (hmmm, well, maybe Sybil Dunning) for you to watch. It also hurt me to see Linda Blair in this movie about exploitation. She certainly deserves better. <br /> <br /> What is the story about? Let's see ... Prison Warden John Vernon records the prisoners in rather inspiring positions, while prisoner Sybil actually runs the prison, and little Linda must fight to survive ... Sounds like a B-movie, eh? It.
