I am very interested in the vast majority of positive reviews here. Despite the fact that he had some good features, for the most part I found this film heavy, predictable and, worst of all, not a bit scary. The first 30 minutes of the film were promising, the actress worked well on her image, and the world around her was well thought out and informative. Unfortunately, from there the film entered into a downward spiral. I entered this film, having no idea what it would be about - I did not know anything about the actors, directors, genre, etc. At some point, my wife made a comment “is it scary” for a movie? ". Well, I suppose that, like in the sketches of a" horror film, "full of creaking violins and extended vibrato, could mean nothing. plunged into a ridiculous kingdom. A similar movie follows a dangerously narrow path, Unfortunately, there comes a moment when the viewer has to decide whether to continue to go this way, or jump, and just laugh at the absurdity of it all. In the last 30 minutes, I chose the latter.
