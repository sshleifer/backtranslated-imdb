Do not choose this. **** Spoiler alert ***** The plot of this horribly bad movie says that four friends are very jealous of taking a shuttle from the airport. On the shuttle with them is a rather milky type of business type. <br /> <br /> Soon during the trip, the shuttle driver stops, and some crazy driver tries to knock them out of the way. The end result - they get a flat tire. The driver forces one of the people on the shuttle to help change the tire, and the jack slips, and the guy's fingers between the tires and the shuttle are crushed. It was at that moment that the driver showed himself to be the kidnapper and took all the people hostage. <br /> <br /> Now the film becomes very slow and tedious, because the characters do one unconvincing thing after another. One of the men was killed trying to escape - even this lacked expectation. Finally, it turns out that the sweet-dough business guy conspired with the driver when the sweet-meat guy killed another male friend by cutting his throat. <br /> <br /> There are several attempts to escape from women. Milquetoast is hit on the head with a tire iron - but it survives. <br /> <br /> The driver was also beaten and somehow survived the head in a collision with a fence at high speed, kneeling next to the wheel. Somehow he didn’t go through the window and didn’t even get a serious injury when he collided with the windshield. However, the woman driving the shuttle was unconscious — she had a steering wheel to protect her, and he had nothing between him and the windshield. <br /> <br /> In the end, he can subdue women and force them to an underground garage, which is the front for human trafficking. One of the women is murdered. The other strikes the driver in the leg with a splinter of a large broken mirror and shoots / wounds him in the head, but he is able (in what should be a severely weakened state - a serious loss of blood, two head injuries and a large leg wound) to pull it out from the shuttle, drag it into a large crate, throw it into it and lock it up, all the time with its fierce struggle with it. <br /> <br /> Now some people admire the post about a film about human trafficking and how it is happening today. This is a serious problem. But making an extremely boring movie on this topic does not give him the right to a higher rating.
