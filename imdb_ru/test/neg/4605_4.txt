Perry Mason: The case of the glass coffin discovers that Raymond Barr is protecting David Copperfield / Rick Blaine, like the wizard Peter Scolari, on charges of murdering one of his assistants. The trick with a hanging glass coffin falls through the air and Nancy Gran’s body falls out. <br /> <br /> Nancy was one of six assistants who work with the act, and we learn two things about her. At first, at the moment of drunken weakness, Scolari was seduced by her, and she claims to have been fertilized. Secondly, she lives under an assumed name and has a secret from her past. <br /> <br /> Billy Moses, who probably never thought he would deal with such rude things in law school, could get confused with a couple of good people. old boys, when they go in search of truth in their hometown of Gran. A little more action than usual for Ken Malansky, he almost killed himself. <br /> <br /> One big flaw in this mystery is simple forensic science. The medical examiner's report should have provided concrete evidence that the victim was killed in such a way that Scolari might not have been able to complete the case. The police had to look for the killer in a different direction. <br /> <br /> When you see who the killer is, you won’t blame this person, but you’ll also see how investigator James McEachin was wrong from the start. It kind of spoils this particular film about Mason.
