I was so disappointed with this movie. The slogan was something like a “Story about the Sexual Awakening of Girls”. You can only imagine how disappointed I was. I was then seventeen, and I took my girlfriend to see it. I thought we were going to see a sexy movie that would make my girlfriend gag. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I think we were simply not ready for a deep and meaningful film that required an element of refinement that we simply did not have at that time. I am not sure that I possess it now, and I have long parted with this particular girl (very sorry ... my first love). We left the movie in the middle of the film, my friend, who should have known better, stayed at it all. I still got the desired result with my girlfriend, the film just didn't help much. It would be interesting to see it again so that I could make more informed criticism, although I feel that this experience left me with scars for life.
