I accidentally stumbled upon this film and checked IMDb for more information: a rating of 6.7, well ... not so bad. Genre: fiction ... well, i like fiction. So, I got the film and was looking forward to a relaxing Sunday evening to watch it. But, but ... NO. <br /> <br /> As a whole, this is not a film at all. This is a religious advertisement, including: sermons about Jesus, God, the devil, the end of the world, etc. The film begins with an epic story of abduction: driving at night, stopping cars, bright lights, and so on ... Well, actually there was a movie. The last of this ... well ... honestly, I don't know what to call it ... it was a dialogue about the end of the world and the last judgment. Those television preachers say the same thing, but they are "good" at it. <br /> <br /> Honestly, if you don’t want to watch a fantastic movie or something with a UFO, please stay away from this “thing”. It has nothing to do with them. If you want to hear the opinion of a cuckoo's head, what the Bible says and what you should do. Then go and look at this “thing,” but I still prefer to go to church on Sunday. <br /> <br /> This is complete nonsense. (and evangelical Christian propaganda, as other users said = Good ... I needed to read the comments of other users before I get the film. <br /> <br /> (27% of voters rated this “thing” as 10. Yes , right. Please go somewhere to do propaganda)
