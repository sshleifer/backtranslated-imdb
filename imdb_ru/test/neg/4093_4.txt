It was a film doomed to failure. The idea itself was unconvincing - to take a minor character from the mediocre movie PG-13 and make absolutely no continuation by changing your tone to a family movie with a PG rating. I was not at all interested. Then came the trailer. Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to distribute the whole film; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every point of the plot, every joke is told in the trailer. This is like a 3-minute version of the Cliff Notes click. Obviously, I was not going to pay to watch it, but as soon as it was released on DVD, I definitely thought that I would watch it for free. Perhaps Steve Carell can save him. <br /> <br /> No. <br /> <br /> I still don’t understand why he subscribed to this. He must have owed someone a favor. All the jokes were so flat and obvious, and the director obviously asked him to choose a very broad comedic style, like Jim Carrey’s from the original Bruce Almighty film. But this is just not funny. The studio apparently tried to capitalize on the success of the 40-year-old Virgin, complete with several of Karell's past colleagues in the film, a reference to a film in a theater tent and another final musical sequence. But even the talented Carrell cannot save it. His colleagues do not feel much better with people like Morgan Freeman, John Hill and Ed Helms. Wanda Sykes is not wasted, she just wastes everything she does, and her terrible cues and reactions just make you want people to stop giving her work. <br /> <br /> The story itself is simply predictable and lazy. It hits you in the head with an obvious omen, like Evan’s disregard for the environment. - The supreme sermon of both faith and the environment. <br /> <br /> Why the film was shot at all, quite mysteriously, but I really do not understand how it became the most expensive comedy in history. The only real work with effects is the presence of all animals, and their integration into the scenes is one of the worst and most obvious blue / green screen jobs I've ever seen. Perhaps renting live animals on the set cost a fortune. Who knows. But whatever it costs them so much, it does not mean that it is quality. But hey, it was far from the worst movie of the year. There are still many worst failures, such as the Norbit and Death Proof.
