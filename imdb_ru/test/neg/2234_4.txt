This is the second addition to the Frank O'Bom film trilogy of Oz. In fact, this is the same childishness as in the other two figures, although I think it is preferable to the others because it is shorter. As in other films, there are performers in animal costumes, an adult woman pretends to be a boy, and the characters and plot jump everywhere, while the operator works motionless. At this time in the center is a magic cloak that fulfills desires, and the boy, played by a woman, becomes king. <br /> <br /> Most of the special effects are witnessed at the beginning. Fairies are represented by multiple exposures. And there is a man on the moon similar to what Georges Melies had done many years before, best known in Le Voyage dans la lune (1902). Melies's creative fantasies and creative effects made him the leading pioneer of early cinema, and the films he made at the turn of the century were much better and even more technically more advanced than this trifling Oz series.
