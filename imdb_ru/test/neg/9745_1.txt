I don't care what anyone else says, this film is the worst piece of garbage allowed in the film. What was John Landis thinking about? <br /> <br /> I know that it is based on a series of children's books, but come on! Even kids hate this movie. It is meaningless and boring. Tom Arnold once again convincingly demonstrates that his only talent is to spend money on production. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason why “Fools” haven't appeared in the 100 worst films of all time is that only 20 or so people admit to watching this garbage. At least the Hobgoblins did it on MST3K.
