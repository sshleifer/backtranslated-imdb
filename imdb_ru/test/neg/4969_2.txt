I finished watching Mandy Lane about an hour ago and felt a desire to come straight home and get up here to warn anyone who was going to spend money on a DVD - NOT. <br /> <br /> Supporting characters Shallow, the failure in the acting game is higher than in Matthew McConaughey’s films, and until the very end of the plot the plot is almost not obvious. Nine out of ten you can see the next scene 5 minutes before it starts. The whole movie is more or less without motives or messages, and half the revelation of the "killer" just kills the little interest that you could leave at that moment. What could save this boring, boring film is a decent splash, or at least blood worthy of the Slasher genre - it also fails there. <br /> <br /> If you need a background movie for a party, you can jump and go without missing anything, I recommend to buy All The Boys Love Mandy Lane. <br /> <br /> If you want to sit down and focus on the screen for more than 15 seconds, I don’t.
