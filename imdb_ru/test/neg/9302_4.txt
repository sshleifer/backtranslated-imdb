As the name suggests, in this film there is a philosophical, meritocratic thread: if a person has talent and he is looking for his way into society and money, what can be the result if he is denied that he does not have factor X? This issue is not resolved satisfactorily in this adaptation of the book by Patricia Highsmith and left me rather cold on the way. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon - Ripley in the title, and besides the fact that he makes his way to a funded walk to Europe, falls within the scope of his assigned goal, Dickie Greenleaf (The Law). Homo-eroticism and social instability are entangled in a violent fire that grew and complicated itself until the end of the film. Lowe, Damon and damn nice Paltrow, like Dickie's girlfriend, is fine. I liked the comedienne Philip Seymour Hoffman, Freddie Miles, a girlfriend of the bluff society that Ripley can never be. The problem is that this story is without any arc - or, for that matter, redemption - which is quite difficult to swallow. 4/10
