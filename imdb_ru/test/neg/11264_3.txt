I saw this film last week during the Berlin Film Festival, and I had average expectations. - Directed by Bertrand Tavernier, and I was familiar with some of his previous works in French cinema. I really enjoyed some of his earlier films. - Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, Peter Sarsgard, Mary Steenbergen ... I was looking forward to seeing all this talent on the screen. - I was not familiar with the book on which it is based, and I did not read anything about the film in advance, but I was told that it was an investigation film in the Deep South (we have seen many of these in the past, maybe this will good as others ...) <br /> <br /> After 2 hours, the final headers appear: THANK YOU GOD, THIS WAS !!!! - The plot is beyond comprehension. If you read the book, you have a significant advantage. There were too many secondary characters and many useless arc shots. We did not understand anything! - Accents. Oh my God! The accent of Tommy Lee Jones is decent, but I still have nightmares because of the singing of Majen Stenburgen in French Cajun ... - In my opinion, the poor cast. I can't believe that old Tommy Lee Jones can beat the shit out of a dumbass, built from a midfielder ... And I'm not afraid of John Goodman. - Who were these people?!? We barely understand who all these characters are and what they do. Is there a bait shop? Does Tommy Lee Jones have a girl from Guatemala? Blörg! - Comedy attempts were pathetic. The funniest thing in the film was probably his “action films” and “waiting scenes”. They were terrible. No thrills. Bad behavior (Can Tommy Lee Jones make different faces or does he look like Derek Zulander?) ... - And then there are sci-fi things. No spoilers, but this is ridiculous and annoyingly strange. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write any comments on IMDb, but it seemed to me that the film was so bad and disappointing that I was forced to share my opinion. But it's just me ...
