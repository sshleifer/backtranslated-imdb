A boring mixture of humorous efforts with humor and romantic melodrama does not give this poorly shot film any flavor of reality. When the action begins, Reno (AJ Buckley) enters his apartment, there he discovers his girlfriend in a flagship affair with his roommate, who maliciously says Reno, “Well, at least it’s with someone you know,” as a result, Renault decided to never have another roommate. This decision was passed on to the audience with the help of a voice-over comment soon left. Then the storyline continues for ten months, and we find that Renault is really true to his word about how to avoid roommates, although it seems that this question arises from the fact that he collects the living lover Holly (Holly Fields), with which he has generated matrimonial plans. The plot briefly goes to the mean-spirited Hollywood strip club where Uncle Reno Charlie, who is in love with the “dancer”, whom he considers extremely desirable, overturns at the top of the club bar after seeing the unvarnished charms displayed by the object of his affections. Obviously, Charlie was aware of the wicked state of his heart, because he created a videotape, during which his comment bequeathed his large (and mortgaged) residence to Reno Hollywood, and we see that the latter decides, contrary to his swearing, interview with applicants for two roommates as tenants, while he and Holly are orderly sharing the selection process. Following a meaningless sequence with the participation of strange candidates for a tenant, all of whom Renault and Holly, which is not surprising, consider unfit to live with them in their house, they, unknown to each other, choose a tenant of the opposite sex, and lovers are clearly cool in choosing their partner . Novices (Chad and Nicole), apparently, have little noticeable meaning in their existence, with the exception of prodigal communication with a wide range of partners, and shortly before jealousy harmonious relations of Rino and Holly are violated. Renault is keen to patent and sell some sports travel bag, and since he gave Holly an engagement ring, the potential success of this entrepreneurial adventure is of great financial importance if he intends to promote his family plan. Unfortunately, the predatory team of Chad and Nicole, whose every action is supposedly permeated with lust, can destroy any future Reno wedding intentions. The direction is weak, obviously far from satisfying the basic needs of the players, although the mistakenly composed scenario provides scant material that actors can work with, and the advertising campaign is embarrassingly falling. As a result, the performances are no different, they are not amenable to point editing, and the style of work with the camera changes as suddenly and often as the back lamp of the firefly. Filmed with a small budget and in place, only a small qualification is required for the design processes, but a higher measure of value could be placed in a tasteless D.D.J. The background soundtrack is usually glaring and almost always aggressive. The good discussion was stimulated by the final episodes of the film, which are obviously not expected by the viewer based on what happened before, but in reality they are probably the only thoughtful parts of a poorly paved script and fair rates so that the work is almost watchable, despite the lost quality products in general.
