The 1940s cartoon, now banned, is probably due to the Black Beauty gag, in which Duffy rides a black man like a horse. <br /> <br /> This whole story takes place in a bookstore where book characters come alive every night. So, we have, among other things, the Ugly Duck (Duffy) and the Walstrit Wolf. They fell into the pursuit of how the wolf had deceived Duffy with a fake duck (hence the name). <br /> <br /> And all that is in this little cartoon is the chase, which is currently not very attractive. Probably fun only if you are a real Looney Tunes fan ... <br /> <br /> 4/10.
