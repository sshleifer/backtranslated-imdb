"Eighteen," although not a complete waste of time, in fact, not everything was as sweet as it seemed. And not the age of the actors they portray? 18, my butt McKellen may have actually appeared in the film, saying that he is 30 years old and would ask us to believe in it. Even Michael J. Fox was more believable when he was a teenager in “Back to the Future”, parts II and III (well, perhaps not; they are probably equally likely.) If you can overcome an obvious age disadvantage, you will either total emptiness in acting, or just replaying (the so-called suffering of Paul Anthony, the life moments of Clarence Sponigl, and although I do approve of Brendan Fletcher, it’s best to just watch him, and much more, in Freddy vs. Jason) faster than br marriage Itney Spears, incest, to prove his point of view, and a person who needs help to urinate, but which has one more hand free? I guess it was the writer's imagination), a whole film of disgusting characters (Anthony may be playing someone then 18 years old, but he behaves as if he is 12 years old, and some strange “John” rushes at him so that Pip Anthony’s character can save the day (was there really a sex scene before a child?), and almost every character asking your own sexuality with weird actions / scenes. On the other hand, I really liked Jan McKellen's voice-over when I saw a (rarely well-depicted) direct / cheerful friendship, love for a puppy (from someone who collects soft puppies, that is), a good account, some kind of decent dialogue (I love separation) of gays and pedophilia, “it’s a pity that more people don’t realize this” and acting on women's leashes (as well as on Cumming). I can not recommend it, because it really tries to be too many things? gay tolerance, homosexuality, homelessness, the epic of the Second World War, the priesthood, first love, wrong judges, etc., etc., etc. ?? on a limited budget.
