This is what I kept asking myself while watching this movie. I mean, the number of nudity and sex was one thing, but the other part of the film that gave the adult industry genre was a lack of plot. Actually, I just wanted to get up and leave during the whole movie, but I persisted. I persisted in the hope that maybe the plot would improve, that in the end there could be a good turn. However, I could not be more wrong. In the end, I persisted because I decided that I could write a bad review if I looked at something. <br /> <br /> I mean, don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong with beautiful, sexy, and energetic women, but when the director only shows that, along with a crappy story, he thinks the viewer wants to see it, insults us all It’s ridiculous to think that we are all so small that we only want to see a burlesque from reporters, major film industry players. My advice: hire another movie.
