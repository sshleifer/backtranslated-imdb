This woman is a terrible comedian. She can't joke. She has no real character. This is another example of a typical American trash that people laugh at, because they have no idea how to react, so they say to themselves: “Well, this is a comedy show,” so I think I will laugh. > <br /> I can't stand this pathetic woman and her bad excuse for a comedy. She deserves nothing but booze. <br /> <br /> Why America cannot get rid of this kind of Turkish pleasure and go for something that really contains humor. <br /> <br /> She is not funny. It's my pleasure. Why, even ONE person like this idiot?
