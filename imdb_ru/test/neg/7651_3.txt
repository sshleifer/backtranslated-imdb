When my parents rented this movie, I was expecting a very funny movie, as Randy Quaid is very funny in comedy films. However, this film is not so funny, and it is somewhat boring. You can see the surprise approaching a mile away, and it lasts a long time for the film, which supposedly lasts just eighty-one minutes. So I can honestly say that this is not a movie that is on my favorites list. It might work for some people, but it just didnâ€™t work with me, being pretty slow in the process of creating virtually nothing that amused me throughout the film. Randy Quaid is lost, and the rest of the cast is a list of very soft actors and actresses. The premise of the film had potential, as did the actors Quaid, but it all just splashes, and the inclusion of the element of horror seems completely unnecessary. Of course, the only sequence of dreams that the child had when he jumped on the bed, and suddenly he turned into a whirlpool of blood, was very well done and would work very well in the film, which should have been pure horror, and not that lists comedy as its first genre.
