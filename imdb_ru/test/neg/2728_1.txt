It is a little hard to believe that it was from the same director who gave us HELLRAISER. Where is style, premonition and charm? I mean, HELLRAISER is not a great horror movie, but at least there was something about it. NIGHTBREED is like a big ball of bad ideas, poorly executed. From the debut there is a problem with subtlety: the monsters are shown in the first frame! The opening dream sequence shows too much for too long. Our hero does not show professional acting skills (but no one expected from this bastard genre). There are murders that would be more interesting. Then we have David Cronenberg. This man has never been an actor. He adequately performs the role of a terrible psychiatrist, but he should take a step behind the camera and save this catastrophe. Then we arrive at Midian, a terrible fake cemetery with an overly eerie fake gate. This item is not a huge improvement over the graveyard in plan 9 from outside space. It gets worse when we meet creatures in it. There is nothing really wrong with character design and makeup effects (well ... except a guy without a scalp, a guy with a pointed chin and forehead, and a fat guy with dark circles around the eyes), the problem is how they act in the terrible dialogue that they are given. Barker's picture of the underground city is tired, and this part of the story could have been done much better. Some may call what SPOILERS should. After our hero dies and becomes a “nightlife”, we wait to see what he becomes (talking about things that fly and werewolves), but when it comes time for him to change, they clearly think that their hero too good to give decent design to creatures. With a turn in Kronenberg's “character,” the story becomes less interesting, until the battle of freaks against norms begins (which is just bad). Barker's mythology let him down here. For NIGHTBREED there is no genius and special originality. The picture could have used a bigger budget, a serious script and character design that won't make you say “oh, oh, how stupid”. What a waste. Not scary, not cool, not even very dark, just weak.
