Well, I admit that I like Bridget Nilsen in an unhealthy way, I just have a thing for 6 'tall women with swords. There I said it. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the movie? Almost every mistake you can make has been made. You take a successful series of films (conan) and drag it through the mud with a bad script, a bad caste, bad effects and the worst of all ... you put a pretty child there for comic relief. You know, this kind of thing almost killed the Indiana Jones series. Cute kids for Disney movies, not real movies. At least, Neilsen took the film seriously, although no one else seemed to do it. The plot made Schwarzenegger repeatedly drag Red Sony's fat out of the fire, and this greatly undermined her character. A warrior woman does not need a dude to bring her out of disarray, this is her job! Not using Conanâ€™s character in this movie was a crime. Kalidor? Sheesh. The film never set the proper mood, and its pace was rather scattered and sloppy, unlike Conan the barbarian, who had several plot lines that flowed gracefully. When it comes to fantasy movies, it's good to have crappy costumes, it's good to have animation in the style of Harryhausen, it's good to have stupid exorbitant sets that don't make sense, but the horrible script is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> This film could have been a classic, but the script seemed to have been written by a 12-year-old.
