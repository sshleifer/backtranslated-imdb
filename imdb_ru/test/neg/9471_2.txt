This film was definitely boring. The acting was decent and the film looks pretty good, the soundtrack is definitely for fans of Kenny G and Michael Bolton. Speaking of the soundtrack, I found it quite ironic that the film was about telling the truth, not about the theft, I decided to use in my titles a song that was the CHARITY SQUARE of Paul Simon's "You Call Me Al" - except they do not. recognize it at all. Is there something a bit hypocritical there? The scene in which was the main child, where he imitated the host of the game show, was my favorite. 10 lines? Should I write ten lines about this film to be included? What a sham, I don't think it would be too fair for FORCE people to write more than they would just include it!
