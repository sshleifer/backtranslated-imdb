Don't get me wrong, I love a good movie, and after watching “The Thin Red Line” (and I really like it), I really wanted to track Terrence Malix on two earlier films, and, just watched “Days of the Sky”, I enthusiastically watched Badlands have almost disappeared. <br /> <br /> I noted a lot of enthusiastic reviews about beautiful photography, but I saw this movie on a terribly old videotape that looked pretty awful. All I can say is, I hope the photo was excellent, because it would be one of the only things of interest in this film. Not since “Spare Killers” I fell asleep during the movie. This film was felt for such a long time (and this is not so!), The editing was intermittent and fragmented, the plot line was absent, the voiceover was an incoherent, meaningless character development, and everything went on without changes. I know that Malik did not know how to make a film. As a result, he took a huge amount of material, and then spent about two years editing it in an attempt to put everything together. This is very obvious on the screen. Everything looks split, every time the scene seemed to be gaining momentum (or character development), it intrusively turns to boring scenes of people who do boring things. It was as if someone was trying to cut a story from video material about people engaged in agriculture. A few good moments - the music and the chase scene near the end, but these things are not close enough to maintain interest. I usually skip a bad movie without being too loud, but when it's so overrated, you have to say something. <br /> <br /> Maybe the farmer will like it ...?
