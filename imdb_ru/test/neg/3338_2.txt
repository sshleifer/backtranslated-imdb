I'm used to being patient with movies, because, as a rule, it pays off. But several works raise fatigue to new levels and enter the sphere of provocations ... I remember the “Last year in Marienbad”. Well, “Paul X” is not “Last year in Marienbad”. I can count, on the one hand, on the number of films that I have released over the years. Paula X became a member of this August group. In my defense, I believe that I made a valiant attempt to defend my position - hoping that everything will change. Nevertheless, I finally threw a towel, do not hesitate to mark 90 minutes - quite well in the circumstances. Pola X does not come close to the promise of Carax’s earlier work. After a 10-year break, it should have been really bitter for him. Melville is still spinning in his grave!
