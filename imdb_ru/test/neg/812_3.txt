Outside of Sweden, you did not expect to see this film. Happy you. The cast includes several actors who are an important part of the modern history of Swedish cinema. And yet .. <br /> <br /> It seems that Peter Dalle had an idea that lasted about 20 minutes. Robert Gustafson is not at all used in this film, trying to copy the younger Gosta Ekman. Ekman, by the way, is the only actor who lives up to his expectations. <br /> <br /> Credit that can be given is a photograph, a great idea using black and white colors. Music is all right. <br /> <br /> But in general, itâ€™s a waste of the actors and the time of the audience.
