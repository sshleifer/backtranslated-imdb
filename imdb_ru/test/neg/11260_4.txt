This is a disappointing adaptation of the novel by James Lee Burke "In the electric fog of the dead of the Confederation". It acted rather badly mainly due to the miscalculations of the main players. Tommy Lee Jones, usually a wonderful actor, just doesn't shoot "Dave Robishau" Burke. Being the prime sworn enemy of Robosh, John Goodman casually works as "heavy." The guy who plays actor Robish-a-friend doesn’t look like the former A leader. The rest of the film is mostly filmed with nameless locals who simply don’t pay tribute to the great novel. <br /> <br /> The film and the performance of Jones are too much in a hurry on one side. Robishot in the series of novels by Burke gives a person the feeling that most of the time he fits well with the environment, being calm and slow. It is just like deep south and south Louisiana. At times, Robishaw is almost insane in his efforts. Jones is just moving at a fast pace throughout the film. It does not change. Ned Beatty wasted. Mary Steenburgen is out of place. The only good thing about this is tuning. In general, the film gives the impression of a television movie.
