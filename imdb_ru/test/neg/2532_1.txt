I just saw Princess Raccoon at an Asian film festival in New York. The gentleman who presented the film, congratulated the audience with their wonderful taste. “You could be in Herbie: fully loaded,” he said with a smug smile, “but instead you are here to look at the princess Seygun Suzuki’s raccoon.” The audience applauded and cheered. Well, let me tell you, I'd rather watch Herbie: fully loaded twice in a row. The raccoon princess, supposedly a bizarre musical based on Japanese folklore, easily falls into one of the ten worst films I've ever seen. It's so terrible that this wretchedness actually makes me dislike other films about Seijune Suzuki, which is a real feat. <br /> <br /> With Princess Raccoon there is not much that I hardly know where to start. Perhaps his worst flaws are both aggressively illegible and stunningly monotonous. If the drums were messed up or half of them were lost in the shipment, the audience would not feel the difference. If you do not believe me, I will allow myself to steal the print and ask someone to start the drums in random order. If you can tell me where it goes, where I will give you every penny that I have. <br /> <br /> In the first third of the film scenes are mixed, songs (including rap, annoying) and images seem to have nothing to do with it. Terribly integrated computer animation turns into a deal, adding another brick to the huge and rapidly growing wall of incomprehensibility. I would not be surprised if the writer wrote down any Japanese folklore that came to mind on a stack of note cards, folded them, shuffled them, distributed cards on the table, and then wrote the script in accordance with their order. <br /> <br /> After about thirty-five minutes of the film, a kind of plot appears. Something about the changeable princess of a raccoon (in human form) and an ordinary man in love. I was hoping that this would be an omen of the film, which is something other than a series of puzzled scenes, but not such luck. The film continues in the same completely incomprehensible manner. I wish I could go out then, but I was trapped in the middle of a narrow row. Looking back, it would be worth the awkward scene. <br /> <br /> I'm tired, just thinking about the last two drums. I spent every minute hoping and praying that it was all over. Every major movement of the pupa, a wave of music or a scene that looked remotely, as if it was ending, renewed my hopes that the loans were about to begin. The agonizing minute after the agonizing minute continued. And so on. Finally, after dozens of false alarms, I realized that this should be an abstract pattern by which credits should have appeared. Then, contrary to all reasons, he moved on to another scene. How could I forget? The completely unrelated plot about how the ninja grabbed, pissed and cooked in the soup, has not yet been wrapped. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to return these 111 minutes ago, but you can save yourself the pain. If you do not want to spoil your memory or the future enjoyment of the great Seijun Suzuki films, such as Youth of the Beast and Tokyo Drifter, you will not see the Princess Raccoon. I would rather spend time vomiting.
