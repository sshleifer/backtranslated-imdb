That was what I was looking forward to. Both Ultimate Avengers films exceeded my expectations, and since Iron Man was one of my favorite Marvel characters, I thought the same production team could do really great things with the solo name Iron Man. But the final film was unsatisfactory. I did not expect them to spend most of the film paying tribute to the gray armor of Iron Man. Red and gold armor is visible for ten minutes or so. Not the main complaint, but not what I expected from the advertisement and the box. But worst of all was the story, the acting and the CGI animation with shaded cells for the Iron Man monsters and armor, which was not convincing. It didnâ€™t mix well with cellular animation. Even in itself, it seems sticky and lifeless. The arc of Tony Stark's character, incredibly slow, so forced and unconvincing. I wanted to watch this movie, because I love Iron Man, but, after running through the film, I thought if they could come up with something as good as Ultimate Avengers films.
