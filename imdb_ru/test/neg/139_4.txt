When I was young, I got up early every Saturday morning, not to watch cartoons, but to turn on the local channel for the so-called Kung Fu Theater. It was not as if these films were works of art. It was not like all these films came from China, Japan, Korea or any other country; if the story was related to the fight ?? whether it is a sword or fist fight ?? and if the struggle did not resemble anything happening in any American sports class, then that was enough. It was not as if they were really very good. It was just great action films with incredibly dramatic music, where the hero was going to take revenge on a whole range of bad guys, and then the credits would have swept. <br /> <br /> “The Sword on the Moon” is very similar to these films of my youth, perhaps a bit of a thematic return that got the desired twist, confusing the characters so much that it becomes harder to distinguish the bad guys from the good ones. <br /> <br /> Yun (Cho Zhe Hyun) is known throughout the kingdom as the “human butcher”. He kills quickly and mercilessly in the name of the Chun dynasty, the Emperor’s main bodyguard, who spared his life and the lives of his people in exchange for his service. However, the same relentless rebel and his buddy appear in the countryside and begin to kill the imperial ministers, and Yun agrees to find these rebels and kill them. His task becomes a personal discovery when he learns that the two rebels are Choi (a friend from his past) and his former love, Shi Yong. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the “Mech” is not particularly different from other militants. Some stunning cinematography is almost completely wasted on shoddy editing with parts of the film folded so loosely, it's hard to believe that what inevitably made it in the film was something that someone intended. While the atmosphere and history tend to dark mood, the tone is almost sacrificed to the endless parade of memories, as each of the main characters is given a healthy storyline. What should have been a quick and easy fighter is burdened with too much personal baggage, and as a result the film suffers. <br /> <br /> I read that this film marks Korea’s first real foray into the world of art-house action films, such as The Crouching Tiger, the Hidden Dragon. Next time, I strongly recommend that producers stick with a bit more “combat” and a little less “artistic.”
