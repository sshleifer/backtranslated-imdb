This movie was so bad, it was funny! For a while, I thought I was actually watching a parody of a bad movie (a la “At your discretion”). The climber scene at the end made me laugh until my insides hurt. The script was horrible enough, but when combined with the terrible game of Sean Yang — especially while she explains the whole story in the smallest detail (complete with memories) while it hangs off a cliff — it makes it really a classically bad movie worth watching! In fact, the fake footage in this scene reminded me of Ed Wood's movie. I still can not believe how this thing was done. First of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? How are star actors attached? Were they low in their careers? Questions, questions.
