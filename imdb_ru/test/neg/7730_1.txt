This film is now with Oscar and Moment for the Moment as one of the unintentionally funny films of all time. <br /> <br /> It is worth rolling for some wildly great laugh. <br /> <br /> The story is absolutely ridiculous. Nothing in life would have happened like this. This is absolutely unbelievable. James Woods is trying his best to push heavy hitters than they give this supposed two-bit hustler a job for 3000 miles in Los Angeles, what a joke <br /> <br /> I like the old VW mistake to show how low they are ” we got in life because of all the things that belonged to Tutski. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is incredibly bad, like "I will always love you, no matter what, wife" you will ever see. it was not so funny that you would challenge how sweet sweet Young tries to project himself. and as bad to play as you have ever seen. <br /> <br /> James Wood replays throughout the entire film, and he is so incredibly Funny and very, just can not believe it, I can not believe that Woods looks like a parody of a cocaine demon on Saturday evening live. But watching Woods on "People" is worth the cost of renting. <br /> <br /> I really like Woods telling the guy who wants to give him a few more “people” that he doesn't do this anymore, just before that Woods just made three giant lines of coke. <br /> <This is a very fun thing. <br /> <br /> The ending is so funny, but on par with the rest of the film.
