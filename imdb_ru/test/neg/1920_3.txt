Rich versus poor. Big city vs small town. White collar against blue collar. These things are not original cinema themes. Therefore, when someone decides to use these themes, the situational storyline must be very original or very good. This one was not one. I never believed in the romance of two young lovers in this film. Neither convincing nor convincing, he simply collapsed. Don't worry, even with the rental video.
