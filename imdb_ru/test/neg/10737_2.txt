A few words: it's good that George Romero is still among us, because if he were dead, he would have to rise from the grave to vote against people who made this “political satire” these people. Yes, there are zombies in it, and they have a good reason to return from the afterlife: vote. Oh, and one of them finishes the Doctor from Startrek Voyager. It's as scary as people are. If you're looking for a horror movie, I suggest you continue. And if you are looking for a witty political satire, you are also in the wrong place, and not only because this series is called “Masters of Horror”. But don't let me hold you back: maybe you see something I missed. Although, most likely, you will spend time on it just like me. Let's just say I prefer my zombie movies when zombies are facing the camera.
