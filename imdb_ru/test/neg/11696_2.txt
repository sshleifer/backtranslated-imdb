I just looked at Acacia and found that I have to agree with negative reviews here. I like Asian and Korean horrors, and I had high hopes for this film. Man, I was disappointed. Watching this, I continued to think: “Of course, they just do it in order to catch me by surprise,” and for a while I expected something brilliant to happen. However, I gradually realized that the film is really so bad. This is the cheapest cash on the Asian horror market that I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> The main story may not even be so bad, but the way it is shot seems to be the funniest story in the story. A tree as a “scary” device may be in order, if it is used wisely, but everything that the director does is gives us different pictures ... yes, of the tree, again and again. It seems that he hopes that the tree will do all the work for him in terms of tension and build-up, but it just looks like it: tree shots. For heaven's sake! <br /> <br /> Slow developments can be very effective, and a film in which the viewer is given only a few glimpses of what is wrong can bring good fears, but not Acacia. Of course, we see a child on a tricycle disappear around the corner, and, again, meaningful pictures of a tree from above, below or on the side, but these scenes are just not scary. They feel stupid, especially because you understand that the director means that they are scared. They just don't. <br /> <br /> In addition, I agree with some other reviewers that the characters are ridiculous. In particular, the “descent into madness” of one character is ridiculous. However, what really breaks Acacia is terrible editing. It's hard to understand why the scenes were stitched the way they are, but this is bad, and it kills any spark of interest that he might have. It also makes me feel patronizing, because I see what they are trying to achieve with it, but I can't believe they think I will fall in love with such cheap tricks. <br /> <br /> There are many great Asian ghost movies, and many bad ones, but this is the worst I've seen. They must have looked through the “what to add to ghost films” list and ticked them, but in the end they forgot to add the movie itself.
