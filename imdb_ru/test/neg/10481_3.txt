The rivalry between the brothers leads to the main storyline. Navy Commander Chuck Prescott (Marshall Thompson) developed the Y12 aircraft to check how far a person can climb into the atmosphere. His brother, Lieutenant Dan Prescott (Bill Edwards), seems to be the best test pilot in the world, and is chosen on the Y12. Dan, of course, has a problem accepting orders, and he is too self-confident, a brave devil. <br /> <br /> During Danâ€™s second flight, he overcomes a comfort zone of 300 miles, and his ship passes through a meteoric dust storm. Returning to the ground, Dan becomes a monster, like 200 pounds of bad asphalt. He also craves blood, whether from farm animals or other people. <br /> <br /> Short work time - one hour and seventeen minutes; black and white with almost stoic acting skills ... typical of low-budget science fiction. <br /> <br /> Actors Marla Landi, Robert Ayers and Karl Jaffe finish. Remarkable little things: about two months after the release of this film; Russian planted a real first man in space.
