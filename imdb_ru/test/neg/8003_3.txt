Boring, stamped and predictable. The only original bit was the Brighton gangster location. This, of course, is not a “Locking Warehouse, etc.”. Hannah was cute in the Sliding Doors. In the Circus I did not have sympathy for his character, and I could not tell what happened to him or his girlfriend. Although this film was so frank and predictable, the finale did not come as a surprise, I was not so interested that I even didn’t care why the film was given the name “Circus” ....... to visit this great peak.
