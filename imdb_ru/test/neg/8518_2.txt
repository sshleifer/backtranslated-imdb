Eddie Fisher was just bad. Perhaps the worst scene occurred at the very beginning of the film, when it broke out a spontaneous song and dance number, centered around the piano and several conveniently located employees. The song was completely stupid ... I think I could drunkenly offer a few lines on a piece of paper that would have surpassed it much and might have won the Grammy. Then, as if the authors can't come up with a better way to avoid the absurdity of the scene, Fisher says something like: “Don't say (insert the guy's name). He does not like music "and smiles, I can not describe how bad it is, I felt a little embarrassed. And the guy Debbie Reynolds works with and the one who always attacks her is annoying too. I can't even imagine how someone like her spends some of her time on him. The jokes were delivered without any chemistry between the characters who made the movie crawl by. At least the baby had cute hair. Two stars for Reynolds, who looked like a swan among ugly ducks. <br /> <br /> Check out Bach’s Mother instead.
