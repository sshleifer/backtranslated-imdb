The brilliant skattershot and sometimes the suspicious story of journalist Bob Woodward about the rise and fall of the actor John Belushi turns into a completely erroneous film, a hazy “fantasy” of director Larry Pierce, as if he was doing something sharp and vital. Michael Chiklis (years before his breakthrough on The Shield) finds himself in an unenviable position, depicting Belushi, making a posthumous journey through his life, recreating those “Saturday Night Live” parodies that are now part of the history of television. It's like watching someone trying to outwit Lucy Lucile Ball - that's impossible. The reason for this sadness was the death of Belushi, because he was one of a kind. Chiklis makes a meritorious attempt to inspect the role, and he is funny on the early stage, trying to escape from the morgue. However, this is a difficult undertaking, and no actor, no matter how talented, could save him. * from ****
