My friend and I shot this film, and for the first 5 minutes we didnâ€™t know what was going on. It seemed to me that it should have ended within the first 15 minutes. It was a terrible film, my younger brother could be a better actor than some of those who were in the film, and the plot (if you can call it that) was full of holes. I would never recommend this film to my worst enemy, but no one liked it.
