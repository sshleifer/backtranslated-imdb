Final Fantasy: Advent Children - this will remain a classic example of the misuse of substance. Instead of relying on memorable characters and fascinating mythology of the original game, Square Enix made a frivolous installation of incomprehensible battle scenes. Yes, I said "incomprehensible." Did you know that Tifa knows stunningly fast kung fu techniques that magically cause the camera angle to shift every second? Can that cloud effortlessly hang in the air for a full minute, wildly moving away with its 2-ton sword? English dub mediocre. Although it’s not so bad, it’s far from good. The quality is comparable to the quality of the usual anime dub. <br /> <br /> This is what I would like to say to inflexible FFVII fans who can't tear themselves away from this film. the best fan service you could hope for from Square Enix, but even such a disgusting CG movie like Galerians: Rion had a better story. You will be confused by this film and its lack of thought in due time. The days of his novelty are numbered. <br /> <br /> Films like Advent Children make me wonder if Square Enix recognizes the potential of its franchises. In the end (and no offense) is a Japanese company. Japanese developers can make fun games, but most of their offers are disappointingly small. However, when it comes to product quality, they are just nuts. Advent Children presents some of the most exciting renderings in the history of computer graphics, but this does not save her from the intricate plot and cardboard characters. <br /> <br /> Any fan of this movie knows that Sephiroth is coming back. Bending the story to adapt it to the resurrection was a big mistake. <br /> <br /> NOTE: One moment I give to this “film” concerns the honor of 10,000 enslaved Japanese animators who gave their lives to make each bleached blond hair on a cloudy, feminine-like Caucasian head.
