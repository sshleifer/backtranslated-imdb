Not the best of the Lone Star series, but it moves fast with good performances. <br /> <br /> John Wayne, presented as “singing Sandy” in the main title, as “singing the cowboy”, did not succeed - you don’t even see him close-up while he “sings”. 'The real singer is the son of the director, Bill Bradley, who sings, sings like many popular singers of the time, such as Hutch or Joseph Wagstaff. <br /> <br /> Cecilia Parker (also starring in The Lost Jungle, Tombstone Canyon, and older sister Marian in Andy Hardy’s films) starring Katherine Hepburn-- “They Are should not; in fact, I am not "; Al St. John, before he literally became" Fuzzy, "filling all of his available screen time with his characteristic work: turning his hat over, scratching his head and chin, wincing, clumsy physical gestures and movements; George (before Gabby) Hayes as a gentle father smoking a pipe, and Forrest Taylor, a junior vet of 395 films and TV shows, playing a fat villain with a string bow tie and a cigar. <br /> <br /> Funny or weird moments: Yakima’s great stunt Kanutta under the coach; "fun" scene when Singin 'Sandy binds Burt and Elmer face-to-face, drags them on a rope to his horse and throws them into Kincaid’s office, where Kincaid says: “You are a beautiful pair of birds in love!”; Denton’s enthusiastic commentary after a terrible song and playing Sandy. “Mmm. I could listen to it all night!”; Kincaid’s reply: “We won’t go into that,” after the rancher said, “You have a snake soul!” And, of course, he says the immortal : “I made an offer to Denton that he cannot refuse. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is rescued by Sandy Kincaid’s deception and then the three magic words in many of these films: “I'm from Washington.” FDR saved us from depression! (Is this why villains are always either bankers or are they engaged in real estate?) <br /> <br /> A sequence of shootouts is taken from Bradbury’s earlier film The Man from the Edges of Hell (1932). All the Lone Star Westerns are special because of their unique mixture of interesting characters, a troupe of actors and stuntmen, as well as cool cliches and repeated stories and situations. This rating is a bit low, overshadowed by the inappropriate and wrong “Singing Cowboy” trick, I will give him 4.
