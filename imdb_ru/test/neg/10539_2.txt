As if the world needs another film about Seagal. Add a group of actors who are ... well, actually ... not real actors, a heavy metal band that complements rap and, of course, hot-looking crazy chick in thigh-less skin, and we don’t give ourselves the opportunity to go beyond budget framework, why, oh, why do people sabotage themselves by participating in such films? <br /> <br /> The FBI captures two friends and sends them to the “New Alcatraz”, where the first prisoner of the prison, who is executed, has unexpected guests. <Br /> <br /> An excellent game around, especially in any scene related to the tragedy for the good guys. Seriously, however, the director really tried, and pulled out a modern, hard edge for the film, as he could. If he went to the well too often, HALF PAST DEAD gets annoying too soon. What else can you do when prisoners just hang out and the hostages constantly ask what motivates the main bad guy? Pointless action flick, which is almost insignificant, if not a "flight."
