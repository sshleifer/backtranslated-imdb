A young couple decides to escape to sunny California. They never reach their goal, because they decide to stop at a rest stop. <br /> <br /> After the fight with her boyfriend Nicole Carrow insists on stopping the rest. When she is ready to leave, she walks out of the bathroom and discovers that her boyfriend has disappeared with their car, leaving her trapped on the Texas back roads, leaving only the left van to support her company. <br /> <br /> Rest Stop is one of those cheap and tasteless horror films that can become a cult classic. You may ask whether Rest Stop Stop will be a cult classic? Well, the three elements that you need to become a cult classic are blood, sex, and artistic merit. The rest stop is filled with blood, and although I don’t want to give too much away, it contains a bunch of blood-soaked muck. This film has it all: from a bad guy who several times ran over the legs of a policeman in his car, before he used a pneumatic drill on a girl's leg. From time to time it can be as bloody as the film can be. He also has a gratuitous and yet fairly close love scene in the first minutes of the film. Therefore, the floor is covered. Now heavy ?? Does he have any artistic merit? You never see the bad guy's face ?? You see glimpses, profiles, shadow silhouettes. He is a faceless, unforgiving monster, which in itself is highly valued on a scale of artistic merit. The film has very few characters, except for the main character. Nicole Carrow (Jamie Alexander). Since she spends most of the film on her own, she cannot reveal her thoughts during the conversation, but must speak them out loud so that we, the audience, know what she is thinking about. Sometimes it can be a bit annoying; However, this is a bold move by the author (John Shiban), and it works for most of the film. As the audience knows, being completely lonely and isolated from civilization is scary enough, even if you are not pursued by psychotic killers. <br /> <br /> So will the Rest Stop become a cult classic? This is likely to happen because, along with blood, sex and controversial artistic merit, there is also a lot of chill, interesting and inventive plot that causes a lot of screaming on the screen, because the main character does a lot of things that you definitely shouldn’t do when running away from a psychotic killer. (Why are horror movies interesting if you can't complain about the stupidity of the victims?)
