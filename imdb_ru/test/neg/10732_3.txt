The murderer (John Carlen) with a penchant for a very bad disguise (African wig on a white dude?) Traveling in his van in search of victims. Detective DeCarlo (James Louise) does this thing and quite easily finds the killer, just walking around the local pool and looking for anyone who looks weird (again, an afro-wig comes into play). Tracking the killer to his house, DeCarlo decides to create a risky bite with the participation of a female police psychologist. <br /> <br /> Inspired by the crimes of Ted Bundy before he was caught, KILLER'S DELIGHT - a rather predictable and cheap series of a killer click. Director Jeremy Hoyenak doesnâ€™t know how to promote a movie or even make it tense. He really knows how to show a lot of close-ups of a killer who wring his hands! The only thing this has is the captured atmosphere of the 70s (note the wallpaper for the bathroom). Well, this is a dark ending. There are many nice things on DVD Media Blasters / Shriek Show, including audio commentary by Hoenack and Karlen, as well as video interviews, trailers and an alternate discovery.
