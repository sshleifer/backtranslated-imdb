I can only name a few films that I saw that were so bad. In this film, everything is awful: the dialogue is banal and cliché ”, the acting game for the most part leaves much to be desired, with rare exceptions, the cinematography has nothing to cheer on, and the plot the stupid daughter did not get into the football team) It's so bad, it's funny to watch. If you can catch it for life, I highly recommend it as a comedy. As for a serious film, I'm afraid I will have to rate it as 2. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this film if you are a serious movie fan and are looking for an interesting and complex storyline. or a good game. Nothing found. <br /> <br /> Edit: Hmmm ... I think that a group of people who work for a lifetime should write some fake reviews and reject all negative ones. Do not believe them. This is really a crappy movie.
