I had high hopes for this David Lynch film, which I really like, but the very bad game of all but Naomi Watts was the first clue that it was a waste. Some Twin Peaks characters are reworked into this film, but it wasn’t creepy, it wasn’t interesting (except for scenes with Topless Watts), and quirks were poorly performed. <br /> <br /> I’ll probably give Lynch another chance, but the excitement around this movie just didn’t work, especially for those of us fans who saw Eraserhead when it just came out.
