This movie is very scary with scenes where the Devil uses Gabriel's horn to open Heaven and pull out good angel dogs and capture them on Alcatraz. The devil sings and dances to a few songs about the joys of being bad and at some point eats a live rat. <br /> <br /> We got this movie for free with pizza. You get what you pay for.
