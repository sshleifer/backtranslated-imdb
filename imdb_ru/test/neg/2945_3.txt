The effect of the twins is a bad film in many ways. The only good element is that he does not take himself seriously. In addition, this is not really a film, but a merchandising tool for two movie stars, popular pop idols in their native Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> The film itself is poorly designed and operational. The line suggests some stupid martial arts, which is strange, since the director of the action (and supposedly the co-director) is Donnie Yen. As with many Hong Kong films intended for teenage audiences, the main fans of “actors” such as Twins (two girls who play the main roles in this film) and Ekin Cheng, there is so much bad music to make the audience to believe that certain scenes are funny, intelligent, etc. <br /> <br /> The final conclusion: everything is in vain Even being a fan of Hong Kong films, this is a bad movie. Not funny enough, not serious enough, and, as a rule, too fake chewing gum for your own good. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> (Go to http://www.nixflix.com for a more in-depth review of this film and other foreign films)
