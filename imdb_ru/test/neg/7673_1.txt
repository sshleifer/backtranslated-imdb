The last of the "Airport" sequels. These are Alain Delon and George Kennedy (who was in all films of the Airport) as pilots; David Warner (!!!) as a radio engineer; Susan Blakely as a death journalist; Robert Wagner as a brilliant scientist (stop laughing!); Eddie Albert as president of the airline; Charo in a terrible "funny" bit; John Davidson is a journalist (love how his hair stays in place, even after the plane turned over!); poor Martha Ray is humiliated; Cecily Tyson plays a mother who flies with her heart for her dying son (stop rolling your eyes!); Jimmy Walker as a clarinet player (what did I say about not laughing?); Mercedes McCambridge as a Russian gymnastics coach (well, you can laugh at this); Bibi Andresson as a prostitute, and Sylvia Kristel and Sybil Dunning in love interests. <br /> <br /> Just a pity. Full of wacky plots and dialogue that will make you cry - watch how Davidson gets married on the plane near the end! Concord carries all these people to Russia. They are attacked by rockets, run off, land safely in France and REMOVED AGAIN the next day !!!! Don't you think the flight would be canceled or something? Much of the action is terrible - McCambridge is a sight in a red wig of fear and a terrible fake accent. The only good acting game from Kennedy and Delon (looks fantastic), which gives a very attractive game. And yet this is not enough to make you sit down through this nonsense. Too long and lousy special effects too. It was a megabomb, and (fortunately) prevented Universal from doing more.
