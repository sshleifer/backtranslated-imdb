Overall, this is a pretty bad movie. But for $ 5 at PathMark, it wasnâ€™t a waste. <br /> <br /> The whole scenario is related to the guy whose lady is infected with snakes, presumably because of the magic curse. Actors / actresses are not big names (although some of them look like TV shows), so I will not do my usual work with Troy McClure. <br /> <br /> For a while, the film interests you. as the couple jumps onto the train and travels to Los Angeles to see the shaman, to remove the curse. There are also few other conspiracies; like two ladies smuggling drugs. <br /> <br /> But the last 20 minutes are a complete disappointment. No matter how cruel and bloody the whole movie is, the grand finale is simply fully animated on the computer. <br /> <br /> I saw a version without rating, in which there was a lot of language, blood, blood, violence and everything else! Bonus features were fine. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: D-
