I managed to avoid reading Hemingway in college. From what I could say, along with his reduktivistic verbiage, he proposed reduktivistic plot lines. This transformation AF2A film into a simplified, gray-haired, exhausted story does not distract me from my suspicions: a guy who barely sees action on the European battlefield (Hudson) gets into a nurse (Jones), and they agree to spend time together. Was Hemingway's great contribution to the story a romantic journey? Who knows what these two lovers have in common? They are so versatile. The film never even tells about the complete irresponsibility necessary to leave the front in favor of the adventures of lovers. Both have a season in the Alps, right from the J. Cru catalog. A number of the best scenes undermined by a banal, ordinary melodrama elsewhere. The film continues to accumulate tiny, unbelievable, vague details that struggle with epic processing. The cavernous hospital where Miss Barkley works is almost empty, so no secondary storyline can divert attention from the fragile main story. Difficult, it is not. <br /> <br /> Camera work better than average with amazing shooting. Directed by Charles Widor (or maybe Houston?) He does amazing things in the first hour with a widescreen camera in place ... there is no second squad. Vidor shows massive panoramic pictures, panoramas over the line of hundreds of soldiers rushing through the mountains; and then with a turn of 90 degrees his camera catches up with the Hudson ambulance rushing at him. <br /> <br /> Hudson looks great. He is a better actor than trustworthy, but with such informal material he can become very mechanical. Mercedes McCambridge plays a one-dimensional obstinate. Jennifer Jones is plump and does not fit into a dull woman. The film is best when it is behind the scenes. Love scenes are about as spectacular as coffee ads.
