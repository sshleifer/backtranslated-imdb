People seem to be attracted to shows that demonstrate pitiful lives that have no purpose whatsoever. For me, I express my sincerity to NBC for their hard efforts to make new changes in television, making the track of free shows laugh. It seems they always find great success, like The Office. When I first started watching, it seemed to me that this could be a hit. But after a couple of episodes, I really wanted to go to church and donate every penny in my entire bank to the wretched people shown in these poor, shameful places. And in the end, when they show Earl and brother in bed together, it just seems to me that this show is trying to show the bad side of life, like street beggars or people who struggle to pay rent and have no idea that The real world of normal people in society is similar. It just seems to me that I am disgusted when I watch the filth in which people live on this show. It's like Venice Beach in California, beautiful, but a lot of vagrants. Believe me, I'm not a rich guy, middle class, and I'm not crazy either, a little sloppy, but it just seems to me that the show simply cannot seem disgusting of all the disgusting schmuck who have one leg. I just want them to show a little more class, not all the dirt and poverty and trailers and just below the average standard of living, it just seems to put me down. For me, this show is nothing but a demonstration of what cannot be done in life, what is not. It also shows me that education is the most important thing you can get, because, obviously, these two have not a drop of minds. This is a schmuck.
