Jack Black and Kyle Gass play their fantasy versions in this comic showcase for their side band Tenacious D, an art-rock costume with satirical, barbed lyrics. A former runaway man obsessed with heavy metal and living on the beach, a slacker who smokes marijuana, pretends that he is a rock god, meets and forms a group (the birthmarks on both their buttocks form the group's nickname). "The Pick of Destiny", which begins with a funny prologue, featuring the Twisted Sister video from the 80s, is a fairly well thought out film for older children; sometimes it resembles nothing more than a variation of middle-aged World of Wayne, with intermittent jokes and a disastrous duel with Beelzebub himself, although Black and Gass have extremely comfortable mutual understanding (they also acted as producers, co-wrote the script and all the music). The target audience will obviously go for it, although the inspiration is a bit low, especially in the second half (at about the time when our heroes impulsively overtake the police in the driver’s car). The musical sequences are much more successful than the satirical attempts of the film, and for the first thirty minutes Jack Jack’s manic enthusiasm is contagious. * 1/2 of ****
