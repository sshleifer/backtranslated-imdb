CUJO is a screen version of the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. <br /> <br /> I never read this novel, but a simple scan of the comments page gave me some insight. I noticed a mention of a change in the final. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is this: a St. Bernard’s dog is bitten by a mad bat, and it kills. <br /> <br /> The plot sounds rather dilapidated because it was shot in various films. However, it could be something new when King wrote a novel. Or perhaps King’s novel influenced a story that was never shown in the film. <br /> <br /> In any case, the first 40 minutes of this film are not worth mentioning at all, except for a bitten dog. Nothing else happens - nothing terrible, nothing funny, nothing to add depth to the characters and nothing interesting in any other respect. It was difficult for me to look through this section, and I constantly shouted on the TV: “Come on, get started!”. The events I saw on the screen resembled a drama television film or an extended episode of a television series. Unfortunately, there was only one family in the film that could not focus, so she could not work even at the level of a soap opera. The dog was the best character in the film, but in this section it lacked screen time. There was nothing that would indicate why this dog would be slaughtered later. <br /> <br /> After the 40-minute mark, something finally happened. The dog suddenly turned from a cute pet into an evil killing machine. It began to attack some people. There was also an interesting chase for the cat and the mouse, when the two characters were trapped in the car, unable to escape because the dog attacked them. Even in this excessively long second half, the expectation accumulated long before dying again. It was just a recurring situation, recurring again and again, until the film came to an end. <br /> <br /> Without giving up the ending, I can say that it was very formal and unworthy of the story of Stephen King. <br /> <br /> Spectacular scenes when they are on the screen are fun to watch. Some excellent camera angles pose a threat to the evil nature of the dog when it attacks people. This is especially important because, as others have mentioned, the St. Bernard dog is not nearly as scary as, say, a Rottweiler. Unfortunately, the film does not use tense music to support images on the screen. The music is too melodramatic, not tense. It may fit a television movie, but it looks incredibly out of place in what should be a dark movie representing the viewer a living nightmare. <br /> <br /> This leads me to a wider problem with this film - photography. The filming and especially the choice of colors make this film a very cheap television film that could be seen as a full-time film on Channel 5 here in the UK, where I am writing this commentary. <br /> <br /> Two main actors give good acting performances that help breathe life into the boring episodes of the film. Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro should be honored for their excellent work with the poor material they are given. I could forgive a few brief points of the revaluation, paying more attention to the dialogue, which, in my opinion, could not give any other interpretation. I will not judge other actors, because they have practically nothing to do. <br /> <br /> As a fan of SALEM'S LOT and STEPHEN KING'S, both versions of the famous novels of Stephen King, I had high hopes for this film. But it turned out to be a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> In general, I do not recommend Stephen King’s fans or horror films to watch CUJO at all. This is one of those moments when I should recommend a book, not a film. I hope this will revive the story in a way that the film could not do.
