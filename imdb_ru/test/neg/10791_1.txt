This story is about safari in Africa, where there is a guy named Trent, who convinces them to look for a tribe of white kids. Naturally, they turn out to be Amazon warriors and capture people. Everything else is pretty predictable. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything you expect from a basement movie about Africa — often irrelevant video footage, films about animals that are NOT native to the continent. (for example, orangutans, elk, koatamundis and marmots), a white actor in a dark make-up, playing natives, acting poorly (especially from Trent - a handsome man with balsa character), comic relief (sounds like Chico Marx) a guy dressed in a gorilla costume and bikini-clad white women with strings that are supposedly cruel jungle warriors are like a tribe of evil tarzan women. Apparently, I assume that the film was made for less than 49.95 dollars, including the cost of developing and paying for the rental of the gorilla costume! But what I did not expect was an IMDb 4.9 account. This is bad, but not so bad, considering that it is in all possible ways, and there is no imaginable reason why the film was rated so highly! Now I am NOT saying that the film is not worth watching - it is quite picky and stupid enough to make watching enjoyable, especially with friends. Just do not expect anything like a professionally made or competent film. <br /> <br /> Finally, here is a small part of this jungle classic dialogue: <br /> <br /> “Walam, like a strong white man. Walma wants a strong white man ... "<br /> <br /> oonga-bunga <br /> <br /> me-te-tonga .... no .... keel ') man "
