This is easily the worst adaptation of Greek mythology I have ever seen. I think that it does not fit at all as an adaptation of the original myth, inventing stupid plot twists and cutting 12 works to ... 3 or 4. It is absolutely useless to try to combine other myths in clumsy ways that have been challenged by what the writers have ever read. myths, such as changing birds for harpies, lions for sphinxes, the oracle Delphi for Tiresias and bulls for pedantry, the Proteus version, even unifying aspects that had never been seen outside of Sam Raimi’s entertainment series concerning his first marriage with a woman the opted name of one of the Furies, so that sounds appropriate to the period. <br /> <br /> I might accept most of this, but it also fails completely in the pure standards of the film; The most painful is the dialogue, lead, ominous pseudo-Xx-prank pranks. This is a poor rethinking of myths, a sad attempt at a similar postmodern revisionism that Crichton’s “13th Warrior” has taken on the Beowulf legend, but at the same time includes strictly mythological elements, such as obvious interference from the gods and magical superpower . The sad, sad failure of the entertainment process, which, I am sure, many of the actors involved in it deeply regret.
