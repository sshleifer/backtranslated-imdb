I am a big fan of British films in general, but especially gangster ones. Unfortunately, this film was terribly bad. I think it is rather frustrating that this film gets good customer reviews. The idea that this film is gritty and realistic is ridiculous. I read quite a lot and heard a fist about the real events shown in this film, and almost all of them were glorified by excessive violence, etc. The only serious life event in the whole film was the Range Rover murders, where some bloated bouncers were rubbed contacting people with whom they could not cope. This film is a shame for British cinema! He does not have a plot and a decent game, and he relies only on violence (hard and realistic, as some people like to say). The people who made this film should not be allowed to stay close to the budget or movie camera, just like people This film is about not being given the opportunity to tell this pathetic, cruel little story about the consequences.
