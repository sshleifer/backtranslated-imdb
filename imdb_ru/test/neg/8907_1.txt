Honestly, this is a very funny movie if you are looking for a bad game (Heather Graham can never survive this ... she has three names for a reason - to protect the guilty!), Nicely bad dialogue ("Do you like ... ribs? "), and a plot that only mom could approve, this is your evening entertainment on Friday! <br /> <br /> My roommate rented it under the name" Horrified "because he liked Heather Graham, but terrified this is what we felt after the final credits, not because the movie was scary, but because someone actually paid a den To make this piece on a movie. <br /> <br /> A terrible movie. There are several nameless actors who offer an unintended comedy, but nothing worth watching. Heather Graham’s dramatic climax was also one of the most pitiful and disturbing things, I've ever seen. I don’t give this film any meaning, and may God have mercy on his soul.
