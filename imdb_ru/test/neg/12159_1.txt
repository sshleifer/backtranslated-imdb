As a “fan” of Genghis Khan, I was looking forward to this film. After devouring Conn Yggulden's epic novels about Chingiz and reading many historical records, I feel that I know something about this issue, and was happy to share my knowledge with friends through this film ... <br /> <br /> . This film is almost from beginning to end. There are a few things that seem right, but mostly they are pure fantasy of writers. This should not be a problem, I like good fun, like everyone else, unfortunately, it’s mostly boring. There is nothing great about this movie. <br /> <br /> I would NOT recommend this film if you know anything about this issue.
