I really wanted this movie to be liked, but after several funny debuts, I barely smiled. I agree that there was no chemistry between the two heroes, and the other characters were cocky. The script completely wasted the talents of Bud Tingwell and Kim Gingell. <br /> <br /> However, I must say that there was a lot of laughter around me and even a little applause at the end. Perhaps I just could not treat this enough. I'm just glad I went for cheap tickets.
