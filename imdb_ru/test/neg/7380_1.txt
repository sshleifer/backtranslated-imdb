If you asked me 1 month ago, like this film, I would probably leave most of it, but I'm a fan and, like any fan, I often visit movie sites when Super Troopers come out, I visited this site after they released on DVD and hooked, yes, it's difficult to stay on this site, but good ones tend to look like good families that they hold together. What is the story of this company / comedy squad. BEGIN people come and watch movies on the streets, in universities, wherever they can, and all for free, and in the end, develop an excellent fan base in a few years. we decided to close the site there, which helped them and was created for the fans, but the worst thing about it ... THEY DIDN'T SAY ABOUT THEM. They just decided that they are better than us, and they need new fans, not fans who helped them get to the place where they are ... you know the same fans that they asked for many years ago. Despite the fact that they are a smart team, they released the best movie with Super Troopers and attracted everyoneâ€™s attention and thanked God for that, because after that they sucked the rest. Good for you guys, the way to the mainstream, just remember, when you realize that your material is not so good, and you have no new fans left, you are the ones who rejected the original ones. Fans make you what you are not the other way. Never burn your bridges
