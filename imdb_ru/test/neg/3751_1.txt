Let's not fool ourselves, this atrocity is not a Plan Nine or Catwoman. This is bad, point! Performances range from theatrical productions of the theater (Marla English) to a walk "all the same" (Tom Conway). A photograph (even in a good font) is so muddy that it is sometimes difficult to see what is happening. The real problem, however, lies in the aimless, senseless, almost plot plot and lead, stepless direction. At the fastest 77 minutes, it still seems endless. <br /> <br /> Scenario is especially inept There are two plot lines that intersect only at the very end of the picture. Tom Conway is trying to create a superraces, using voodoo and modern science (although there is little evidence) that he can control telepathically. He holds his wife in captivity (for no apparent reason). Meanwhile, a pair of petty crooks and a white hunter's guide are trying to find the village in which he works, waiting for gold and precious stones. When they finally arrive, Tom Conway decides that one of them, a woman, is the perfect subject for his experiments. She turns into a monster, kills Conway (naturally!), And then returns to normal. She sees a golden statue, half drowned in a boiling pool, tries to find her, falls into the water and, obviously, sinks. White hunter saves his wife. In the last picture, we see that the supposedly drowned woman becomes a monster again; threatening with a sequel (now it's a really scary thought!). <br /> <br /> AIP Producer Samuel Z. Arkoff in his lecture on DVD is proud to have discovered the teen niche market and satisfied his ingenious low-budget films. However, it is difficult to understand how someone would have thought that this rancid mixture would satisfy any audience. What kind of appeal do they think it might have? Monster appears so rarely that it can hardly be called a horror movie. The action of the jungle is cool and tiring. There are no teenagers and characters with whom teenagers can identify themselves. <br /> <br /> The producers shot 77 minutes of the film, but they didnâ€™t shoot the film. This is a trick, and Arkoff should be ashamed of his connection with him.
