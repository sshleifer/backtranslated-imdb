The basic premise of this film is that every person in the world may know that he is gay, except this person. And that a man who likes to show melodies, has good taste and neat appearance, MUST be homosexual. Yes, the film is funny piece by piece, but the basic premise is homophobia and an insult that the entire film crumbles into something that is quite painful to watch. The performances, especially Joan Cusack and Kevin Kline, are very good.
