Super Troopers was a real classic. Club Dread, although it disappointed many, had its moments. Puddle Cruisers has fewer moments. I saw this film on the shelf of my local video store and saw below that it was made by a group of Broken Lizard, which made Super Troopers, so naturally, I picked it up. I found only one scene to laugh out loud funny. Away from the Super Troopers. In general, I was very disappointed. I would not recommend it to anyone unless you have free time and you really need to kill time. However, you better play video games or watch something that might make you laugh or think.
