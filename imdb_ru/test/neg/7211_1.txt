“Direct-to-video” is a phrase that never sounds promising to the consumer, unless it is a continuation of the movie to the video that first turned to video. Despite this, the studios insisted on releasing numerous sequels directly to the video over the years for cult hits. I don’t think that it is even necessary to mention that these sequels are among the worst games of all time, including HITCHER II, STARSHIP TROOPERS 2 and CRUEL INTENTIONS 3. It’s appropriate that the ROAD HOUSE 2 was driving Scott Tsill because he was also human responsible for the destruction of a series of cruel intentions. Like his entry in the Cruel Intentions trilogy, Ziehl takes the elements that made the first ROAD HOUSE a great guy and paraphrases them without success. This is not a continuation, it is a remake completely. Different lines from the original are repeated, the points of the plot are cut and inserted, and the scenes are reproduced almost off-screen from the first. The only thing that could not be reproduced was the amazing battle scenes that made ROAD HOUSE what it was. Here we get clumsy directed combat sequences that are either too short or too long and seemingly planned and removed in an hour. Compare this to the battle scenes of its predecessor, which look as if months and months have gone by for their preparation. Ziehl is able to manage the actions as he excelled in the 2001 EARTH VS remake. Spider, but none of the talents shown there, pass in this mess. This is not entirely his fault, because the script is very, very poorly written and clumsy. I don't care if something goes straight to the video, a good script is still required. Someone should remember this, constantly releasing these low-budget films with direct access to DVD. Skip this completely. 1/10
