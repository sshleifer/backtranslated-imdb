The only good thing about this funny thing is that I didn't have to pay for it. I saw it for free in college. And if a college student cannot find humor in something free, it is hopeless. <br /> <br /> Inappropriate joke and bad jokes cannot be disguised by the excellent, but amazing design of the scenery (which prevents it from entering the Volkswagon Beetles market). I don't know what Michaels Myers did in this film, but I have never seen anything more depressing. It was nothing more than a blatant attempt to capitalize on the previous success of Grinch (who has his opponents, but I really enjoyed it). It is hard not to survive this failure and wonder what the best projects have been transferred to finance it. <br /> <br /> Do you want a funny adaptation of Suze? Go with Grinch.
