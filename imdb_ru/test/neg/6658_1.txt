This movie "Desperate Measures" was ... I'm not quite sure how to put it in words. Was this supposed to be a comedy? I could not stop laughing at how it was absolutely ridiculous. I love Michael Keaton and I can not understand that he did it. They did a good job holding my attention, because I couldn't wait to see how funnier it would be to get every minute. I actually just signed up on this site so I can get it. I do not watch movies. I do not have time for this, but I cannot let it go, knowing that I have not fulfilled my civic duty, letting people (those who have an IQ of 85 and above) know that this is not a fighter / fighter god. You people who really got the thrill of it scare me. Go see a good movie like Million Dollar Baby. Clint Eastwood's game is not great, but in the end I was delighted. Train your brain America!
