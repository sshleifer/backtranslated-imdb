I started watching this movie on TV. a few weeks ago, but gave up after the first 10 minutes or so. First, a person in a witness protection scheme located in an isolated farmhouse begins to get nervous because of his guards stationed outside, and then asks the guard inside the house if he can make a phone call â€” only to find that the line is broken. <br /> Shortly thereafter, Roy Shader, as one of the killer witnesses, appears and properly kills the witness and his wife, after which the character of Roy Shader properly picks up the wall phone in the kitchen, dials the number and then says: done !!!! It was for me!
