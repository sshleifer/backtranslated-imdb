I will say it again ... one of the worst films ever made, and it was done by a director who made one of my favorite films, Excalibur. I was amazed that I received a rating higher than six. This movie sucks. It looked awful. It appears that he was shot dead in 18 days, and Burman must have slept when he took it off. Arquette did nothing. Just horrible, rotten, unbearable, and probably the only flaw in Borman's famous career. <br /> <br /> 1/10 !!!!!
