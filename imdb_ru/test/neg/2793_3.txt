Well, I apologize to the cast and crew for this review, but this film is the worst I've ever seen ... First, the acting was fine. It could have been better (especially in some parts), but it was “good.” Then there was the cheapest camcorder (which they used). Violence was pretty good. If it was faster, it would be cool, but they did not (* sigh *) ... Scary. Scares were well written (in script), but not very well done. For example ... (SPOILER HERE!) In the attic the girl is halfway there, and the other half is in the dark lower part of the house of the barn, then she gets it. The monster jerks it down, and then you hear someone breaking out. Panic might be better if the music was not copied from a cheap CD with horror sounds. The effects of the blood were pretty good, but the blood was like Kill Bill. K.B. pulled him out because he had to resemble old kung fu movies, but when the team can't understand the difference between red and pink ... it's sad. The ripped bodies in the film were good, but the costumes of the stuffed animals could be seen for 25 bucks in the Halloween shop. Don't let the cover fool you, the costumes suck! My overall rating is 3/10. If you are interested in independent films, are easily satisfied, or you have 3 dollars that burned a hole in your pocket, go to Blockbuster and see the horror of failure.
