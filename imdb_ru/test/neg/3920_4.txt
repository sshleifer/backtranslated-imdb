Cheaply made, poorly functioning and unimagined, a directed flight to Mars is still interesting, despite the fact that it goes against it. It is planned to fly to Mars with five people (three senior gentlemen, Cameron Mitchell as a journalist and one woman scientist / obvious love interest), "serving" the ship. The spacecraft gets there and discovers that the Martians who live there are very similar to humans and there are technological advances that would make the Earth turn red. But not everything is so rosy in the underground cities of the Martians (several caves and several rooms are shown here). Martians are a dying planet, and one faction wants the earthlings to fix only the ship to pick it up at the last moment and then mobilize to attack the Earth, and the other faction wants to talk the world and see if they can not convince the Earth to provide them with living space. The special effects here are rather inconclusive even for the science fiction standards of the 50s. complete with a slow rocket ship, pastel / neon alien vestments, where women wear shorts that would make many blush (except men, of course) and a little less suggested. Cameron Mitchell is a journalist and friendly, if nothing else. Marguer Ithe Chapman is beautiful in very short shorts, but adds a bit of acting. The rest of the cast is filled with some old science fiction veterans like Arthur Franz and Morris Ankrum doing useful work. This is not a premiere science fiction film from the Golden Age by any standards, but it is very watchable and penetrates at a fast pace.
