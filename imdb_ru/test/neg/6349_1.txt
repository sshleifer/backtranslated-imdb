I was bored last night, and I decided to watch a movie called “Out Kold”, which I once bought, with many other cheap movies in a video store. Looks like a good old fighter, so I took out the chips and coke and was ready for a relaxing evening. Well, the pain started from the beginning. The main character is a boxer, the nicest guy I've ever seen. As a good man, he, of course, must be cute, but he just pussy! This is completely inappropriate for a boxer who has 28 knockouts and starts working for a pimp to earn extra money. Even the good guys can still be cool. And then his first fight began, while he was working on this pimp. Each hit was clearly missed, and it became even more annoying because the sound effect was not synchronized with the beats. Then there is a completely useless game of the entire cast, and you have enough reasons to leave this film as it is. I gave him 1 because I have never seen such a bad movie.
