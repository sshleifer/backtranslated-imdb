Well, there are a few things about this movie. Everybody must see it. You see the nation of Iraq as if you have never seen it covered in the media, and you are shooting from a point of view that is hardly seen by most Americans, where the film has a mainstream audience. However, all these wonderful things in memory allow you to look at some other facts of the film. 150 chambers were handed over to the Iraqi people, most of which view the war and the subordination of the occupying forces as a growing pain to improve the situation of their nation. And compared to Saddam, this is just a slight scratching on the skin. In addition, Netflix, as its main distributor, advertised it before the fun choices we just had, sending a massive email to the entire list to watch the movie. Many of what should be described as opinions put forward as facts listed by the polled Iraqis are wrong. If you look at the records of the Red Cross about torture in Abu Ghraib, then not Saddam’s minions were tortured, but only 80-90% of innocent civilians and 10-20% of lawfully detained people. It has never been reported that any of these 10-20% were Saddam’s minions or curfew violators. In addition, the Arab world has never really mentioned “Democracy” as one of its opponents, more precisely, it is 6 billion US dollars a year in Izreale, our military bases in Saudi Arabia and our interest in oil. I agree that the media is a complete distortion, but this film shows the same distortion. I fear that the Iraqi people who represent this film have been edited to speak the voice of the Yankees. Yes, it is true that Saddam is sick, and that many see his elimination at best. It is true that some Iraqis are actually paid a good salary. It is also true that not a single Iraqi people controls its most valuable oil, like American corporations. It is also not mentioned that 20,000 civilians died solely because of US artillery. Still 15% of the country that once had plumbing and electricity, now no. Also not mentioned that from 1993-2003. UN sanctions, developed and approved by the US government, killed more than 200,000 Iraqi civilians. Democracy is not mentioned when people decide the government, and not the huge military machine that sends the message "Be killed or obey." I am afraid that there should be quite a few Iraqis on the floor of the cutting room, who are not very happy with the occupation. Just as the vast majority of the world was not for war. In fact, America, Britain, Spain and the rest are not carriers of democracy, they turned away from it when they saw how full their pockets could be. Hooray, Saddam has no power, but I am afraid that not a single Iraqi is in power. In the power of the corporation, in the power of the media. Read, do your own research and don't let them blindfold.
