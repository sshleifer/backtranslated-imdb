Now I have seen quite a few films by Pedro Almodovar, but this must have been the most disappointing so far. In this film, it seems, lacked composure, which is usually found in his films, and the story just did not interest me. In this film, many regular musicians of Almodovar appear, so itâ€™s not that there is no shortage of screen talents, but this film seemed more serious than his other films. If there was a comedic edge in this film, I definitely could not find it, and it became one surprisingly weak film.
