It is surprising that such a film about yuppie melancholy was actually made first. The characters are so weak, and the actions are so boring that it is impossible to take care of anyone, especially Brooke Shields. The temptation to move forward through the slow parts is almost irresistible. If you like this genre, you'd better rent one-on-one or body, rest and movement.
