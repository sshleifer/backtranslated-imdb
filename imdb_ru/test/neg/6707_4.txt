Simply put, I was surprisingly disappointed. I am a big fan of Asian horror, and I can observe the lack of originality (I myself liked Red Shoes and Telephone), but it was just bad. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of elements in the film that are of very high quality: the photo attracts attention, the visual effects are cool, the direction is inspiring, the acting is pretty good, the music is pleasant to the ear, and CGI is incredible. But since this is a horror movie, we have to be scared, which is not going to happen with this movie. As with most South Korean horrors, it is unoriginal almost from beginning to end: there is a vengeful long-haired female ghost, ominous heaps of thick black hair and puddles of water, and closer to the end is a turn that * almost *, but not quite a sense of all this (turning easily is one of the best qualities). And to the irritation of the viewer, when the film does not recycle (sometimes so precise that it could easily be called plagiarism) images from other films, it makes you jump. Lot. And by jumping I don’t mean that something jumps out or something like that, just VERY loud noises and squeals in the soundtrack that make the audience jump six feet in the air (there are even a few moments that make you jump). just infuriates) And when it does not break other films, it is boring and hard to experience. <br /> <br /> And it's a shame, because “Ryeong” could be really good, and it has everything to do it well, but this annoying overuse of completely predictable loud noises and panic, which ultimately destroy the film. A perfect example of how well this could be: there is a moment when one of the characters looks at a corpse, and without a sound the corpse looks back. This is quite predictable, but the use of silence in this scene is simply superb. And, unfortunately, it's as scary as a movie for me. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, Ryeong has some good features, and even a couple of jumps that are not so predictable and work. There is a very good and sad background, used to explain events, and the turn is rather unpredictable. This is the only thing that distinguishes the film from any other Asian ghost / horror film. But the problem is that, despite the fact that they work, they have been used before (J-Horror fans will easily understand that the great response was inspired by The Tale of Two Sisters), and this takes history well. fifty minutes to start. <br /> <br /> In the end, Ryong really seems like a lost opportunity. Tae-kyeong Kim hopes that the plot twist and other useful features will be distracting, so viewers will not notice huge flaws. But he failed, and well ... We all noticed. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10.
