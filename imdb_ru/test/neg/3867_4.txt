Well ... there were wonderful creamy smooth face shots of Marlene along with her “shocking” outfit for men and women (plus her unsurpassed “transmogrification” from ape to man); but, on the whole, the whole lame plot and outdated acting — not to mention the less attractive melodies emanating from Miss Dietrich’s baritone voice — little provided Blonde Venus with a permanent place in the Pantheon of memorable films of my mind. Cary Grant — still in the throes of his cinematic childhood — seemed to have always hoped to “find himself”, while Herbert Marshall probably had never been anything, BUT Herbert Marshall from the day he was born and until the day of his death. Naturally, from a historical point of view, it was interesting to watch the blonde Venus, while you could drop ... "high expectations."
