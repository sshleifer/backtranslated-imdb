Saw the movie at the premiere of the film "Lawrence, Kansas." This hesitating story about how a group of disgruntled high school students killed competitors for the prom queen was just awful. It fails for many reasons - a bad game, a bad scenario, there is no clear meaning. But basically it was like the directors said to themselves: “Hey, I have some money, so let's make a film!” - without thinking. Unfortunately, most indie films that don't make him suffer from this mentality. It seems they simply do not understand that in order to make a good film, you need more than money ... or, in this case, even to watch. With this film, I am not ashamed to say that if I did not know some of the film crew, I would go out. Just like that.
