I just finished reading the Forsythe novel Icon. I thought it was one of the most profound, detailed, and overturning pages of books I've ever read, definitely in the top 10. I purchased a DVD version of a book featuring Mr. Swayze. Well, let me first point out that it would be impossible to write a decent adaptation of the novel at 2.5 hours of film show, so I understand why the teams deviate from the book version and are different. However, when I say “different”, what I really have to say is “take the characters from the book, add a few, leave a few, remove the plot of the book, add a new modern story, add the name of Frederick Forsyth”. I'm not saying that it was a bad picture, far from it, some effects were top notch, and the game was not half bad. The story sucks and is not based on logic or reality. Forsyth's novel was so good and truthful that it changed the facts of reality instead of exaggerating them. It could be much more if it took its time and was turned into a series of 10 parts. If you have not read the book, then expect a decent TV movie with a good cast, if you read the book, try to forget it when watching it.
