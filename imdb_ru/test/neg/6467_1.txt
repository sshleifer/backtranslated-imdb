The only interesting thing I discovered while watching this movie is listening to Star Wars going through the wall of the cinema (yes, I am going to a really bad movie theater). This film is so stunningly bad that I would prefer a cat to scratch my eyes, rather than watch it again. <br /> <br /> Let's compare it with the original. One is charming, funny, exciting, well-played, and one of the best films ever made, the other is so far from ridiculous that all you can do is hope that your eyeballs will fall out so that you no longer have to watch , I wish Christina Ricci is a great actress, but she can't compare with Hayley Mills, and doesnâ€™t even let me start with Doug E. Doug in the first part, busy with the amazing and absolutely charming Dean Jones. A tiny part of Dean Jones in the new version is the only partly redemptive part of this film, and this is the only reason I can justify a 1 * rating (also because imdb is not included in negatives).
