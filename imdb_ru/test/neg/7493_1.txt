After spending half an hour studying the Rumors, a gay bar located outside Tupelo, Mississippi, SMALL TOWN GAY BAR turns its attention to the murder of Scotty Weaver in Bey-Minett to demonstrate the risks to the interviewees. But there is a problem. Minett Bay is not near Tupelo, as the film suggests. It is not even in the same condition. In fact, it is about three hundred miles off the coast of Alabama. <br /> <br /> Director Malcolm Ingram is not in a hurry to point out this fact and doesn’t bother to mention that although Bay Minett itself is a bit more Wide area on the road, it’s actually about two deep sighs from the main zone of the Mobil metro station, Alabama, where there is a noticeable gay community, quite a lot of gay bars and even a congregation of the Metropolitan Community Church. If Ingram cunning on these issues, you need to ask if he applies to others. <br /> <br /> Speaking of someone who was born, grew up and continues to live in Mississippi, I have to say that I find most of the small town GAY BAR is a lot of hooey. Neither Meridian nor Tupelo, the communities Ingram is focused on are not as rural, small or isolated as he could have imagined, and gay bars are more common in the state than the film suggests. Nevertheless, Ingram rather blithely ignores the fact that the absence of a gay bar does not mean the absence of a gay community, and at the same time it demonstrates a rather deep ignorance of southern culture, which tends to keep those who frequent bars - whether they are gay or straight. - in low esteem. <br /> <br /> THE SMALL GAY BAR is, in my opinion, the case when the cinematographer approached his topic with a personal agenda and then proceeded to the movie of the agenda. Do gay and lesbian people living in rural Mississippi face serious, sometimes frightening problems? You bet they do - but this is no excuse for messing with reality to that extent. The DVD contains a track with comments and a few deleted scenes, but the feature film itself seemed so ridiculous that I did not waste time on them. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
