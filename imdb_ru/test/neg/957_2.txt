POSSIBLE SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Quaid and I like Meg Ryan. I was looking forward to meeting them, I got married and everything, I wanted to see their chemistry on the screen. Well, it is, as they say, I think, the fact that they are actors, their offscreen relationships should not have penetrated their actions, especially with this scenario. <br /> <br /> How stupid a professor can be to stick himself to anyone. I do not remember the original, but I can only assume that O'Brien was probably handcuffed to his lead woman, probably in a more inevitable manner. If I were “connected” with someone, I would be very angry. Crush, which I would have received, would surely quickly dissipate. Meg showed even a slight annoyance, just a slight surprise. Dennis was supposed to make me kick and scream. This whole piece of the film was so terrible - especially Meg, forced to go to the bathroom (# 2) between the trash cans in the dark at night. Ewww. Not damn good by the way! <br /> <br /> What about Dennis hugging every suspect in the movie? Sock first ask questions later. Not one, not two, but too much — I could keep the score if I were so inclined. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the film is Nick and his family drama. It is a pity that could not become more plot. Alleged offscreen drama leading to this tragedy. I think it could be written without interrupting the search for Dex. <br /> <br /> My fault lies with the authors of this script. If the director and others have not tweaked it so much that it cannot be recognized. <br /> <br /> I don’t even understand the real reason why poor Dex was killed. How funny this is. Even when Dex ran into a real killer, and the reason was explained (the present moment of “film numbering”), everyone on the screen seemed bored. Oh, _____ happened. Oh. (yawns) "Dex even says it's a silly reason for triple killing. Oh, tension, you could cut him with a spoon. <br /> <br /> If anyone other than Dennis were in this film, I have to give him 1/2 stars (just because I really saw the worst), but in this case 1 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> For stars Dennis and Meg, see ANYTHING.
