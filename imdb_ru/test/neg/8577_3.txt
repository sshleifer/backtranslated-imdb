This is a stereotype plot. A young fighter is trying to take part in competitions when he is not ready and not chosen to represent his military school. This leads to separation from the school of struggle and, naturally, he finds a strange new master who will teach him to fight. <br /> <br /> Fights do not meet high standards. They are too “simple”, so 1 + 1 is simple for every adult. The fighter trains and enters the ring, but does not do what he trained, and gets kicked in the ass. The coach shouts to do it and to do it without success. And after one more of this ridiculous beating, he suddenly does what he is told, and once hits his opponent. This leads to a turning point in the battle, although our hero beats his life up to this point. Think of Rocky movies, and you will have a good idea of ​​how much he really beats. Fights also shoot badly. <br /> <br /> And the last thing that spoils this film is a silly novel. Cheesy music and awkward moments are not what I call entertainment. <br /> <br /> These guys really could arrange some kind of quality entertainment, but the director did not cope with the task. Or another crew, in my opinion. Perhaps they had a small budget, I don’t know, but ultimately it’s important that this film is bad and deserves a rating of 3 out of 10.
