In the 1950s, a gay photographer named Bob Mizer (Daniel McIvor) founded an agency for male models, releasing a muscle magazine called Physique Pictorial and a movie about men, and many of the models became prostitutes. "Beefcake" shows the ups and downs of this pervert. <br /> <br /> Alternating plots from the 50s, the testimony of many models and Bob Mizer himself in our days, director Tom Fitzgerald used this trick to show naked men and a lot of penis for 93 minutes, with a full bad taste and very stupid shit. I have never heard anything about this morally corrupt Bob Mizer, and I donâ€™t know what AMG is. In my opinion, the theme of this boring and pretentious film may appeal only to gays and a very specific audience. My voice is two. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Carne Fresca" ("Fresh Meat")
