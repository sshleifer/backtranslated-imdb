For reasons that I cannot understand, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) begins to inject the blood of a wolf into his stupid craftsman Peter (Glenn Strange). Result ?? Petro turns into a disgusting (as disgusting as a man with a bad wig and sharp teeth) killer beast. Dr. Cameron uses Petro to take revenge on those who in the scientific community mocked his ideas and ridiculed them (and why not, Dr. Cameron is more crazy than a cupcake). <br /> <br /> Overall, The Mad Monster is one boring and poorly crafted Thriller thriller. In fact, there is only one positive thing that I can write about in the Mad Monster. George Zucco can be fun to watch, as he plays a mad scientist in about the same way as any other. His doctor Cameron is an ordinary psycho. He has no doubt about the murder; he has whole conversations with people who are not there; and, like most mad scientists, he is entangled in the “possessions of God” (in fact, I'm not sure that someone blames him for this, but it fits). But besides Zucco, there is nothing to recommend. Everything else from the effects of the monster to the auxiliary cast for the music is just bad. There are much better examples of the horrors of poverty in the 1940s than the Mad Monster.
