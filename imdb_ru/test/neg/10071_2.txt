Did people expect the Jurassic Park 3 to be full of surprises? Not a single moment is worth it. Many elements can easily scare people out of movies ... and these are not dinosaurs! Tea Leoni ... I think she is a great actress, but I'm sorry to say that this time she reached the point. I wonder if she happened to strain her vocal cords during the shooting of the film ... Laura Dern ... she's fine, but why not be more visible in the film, perhaps sharing smart dialogues with Sam Neal. Alessandro Nivola - â€œHave you ever heard of something called facial expression? Feelings, emotions ... "... he must work harder on this! Sam Neal, no big deal. The soundtrack ... has to change this recording, or you are tired of it. My applause is to William H. Macy, a talented actor I have never seen playing a bad role ... unfortunately, he cannot save the film, nor can well-created computer dinosaurs.
