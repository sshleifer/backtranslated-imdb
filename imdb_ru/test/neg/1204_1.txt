An adolescent boy who is not a soldier and not trained to be a fighter pilot goes to a foreign country to save his father. If this is not funny enough, he asks the colonel in the Air Force to help him get the plane (wow!). To make the picture even more absurd, the colonel is risking his career and life, giving the brave guy a helping hand. Not only do they not make colonels like them, but they never did. This juicy, banal film should be thrown into the air and blown up by MIG.
