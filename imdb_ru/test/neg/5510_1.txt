Really terrible. Obviously an attempt to cash in on Star Wars enthusiasm, but there is no excuse for this tasteless piece of trash. The storyline is lost to the middle, the characters are forgotten, and the child is not so talented that all he does is pose for the camera. The planet of the aliens on which they land is actually a naval warehouse in Long Beach, California. <br /> <br /> This movie actually made me physically ill watching it. <br /> <br /> Roger Korman has made some good, some bad films in his career, but there is no excuse for this. <br /> <br /> 0/10 - IMDb will not allow you to dial zero.
