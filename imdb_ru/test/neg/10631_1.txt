After enduring this film last night, I turned off the DVD player with the feeling that I deserve a medal for having the stamina to bring it to the end. Throughout the film, I felt like I was watching the fillers that you get in high budget porn movies. the acting skills were tough and tight, the camera work was terrifying, and the locations and scenery were so poor that it seemed that they borrowed them from the local high school "Amateur Society of Playwrights". the film was that Amy Adams and Harriet Sansom Harris were in his credits, except that it was pure dribbling.
