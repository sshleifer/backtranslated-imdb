If rich people are different from us because they have more money, then filmmakers are different from us because they think that the world cares about their every thought. <br /> <br /> It seems that this indulgent piece was made only because the director felt that it was time to make another film and someone would finance it. Not every banal idea or thinking is worthy of a film (unless you are a college student trying to complete a course). When you have nothing to say, it is sometimes better to be silent. <br /> <br /> Visualization is not breathtaking. They are pretty ordinary. The dialogue is meaningless and incredible. They say the words that no one will be every sequence together in situations that are beyond imagination. Germain Greer without zip f ** k is finally displayed. Even if you believe in love at first sight, no one will fall into bed as easily as these characters. They screw up before they speak. Even more incredible is that an aging, balding director finds instant sex with the most beautiful chick in town, although gravity penetrates Miss Marceau at a young age.
