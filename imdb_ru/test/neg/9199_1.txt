This is just a bad movie. Not as bad as R.I.C.C.O. not bad. It got me hooked because I was born, and then completely lost me. After that, the acting skills ended, then it went very far. Do not watch this movie at any cost, TRUST ME WITH ALL HEART !!!! The directors who are brothers are not the next Hughes brothers who made really great films such as DEAD PRESIDENTS, FROM HELL, AMERICAN PIMP and MENACE II SOCIETY. A great actor once, if he makes better films than this one. Kristina Kaparula also did a good job on what she received. I hope FITTEST is 10 times better than this piece of shit!
