For some time I heard legends about this “movie” (quotes used to not insult movies), so when I finally got a DVD with it, I started to watch it with impatience. By the end, I * had to * move forward through some of the most idiotic, ineptly crafted, meaningless scenes of this meaningless childish confusion to complete it faster. <br /> <br /> It could be the worst movie. I even “touched” - and for a while I was connected with Thunder. The Manson Family makes the bottom of Tromy's notes look like bold and innovative art-house artwork. I could continue to talk about the syphilitic skeleton of the “plot” that it has, the disgustingly bad “acting”, the painful, inept “direction”, the scenery and the supports with their “ninety-nine dollar” appearance (I especially “loved”) the pistols used on the Tate murder scene! ”or the sickening look and feel of this whole garbage bag (I think it should have been a drug-induced hallucination; I absolutely have no idea how the drug-induced hallucination looks or feels tvuet and I don’t want to find out - but I suppose that drug addicts with burned “brains” will love this “movie” (they seem to be the ones who did it), I have seen many films from various “Worst” 50- inch lists, traditionally opened by Eddie Wood, and Eddie Wood would be shocked by Van Webber’s obvious ineptitude and lack of talent (or whatever his name is; I certainly don’t want to remember him), I never saw Superbaby or its continuation, but I would very much like Manson to join them in the IMDb rating. Fortunately, this obscure trash of the crowd of viewers will not see that they are enough to get enough "1" votes - and so much the better!
