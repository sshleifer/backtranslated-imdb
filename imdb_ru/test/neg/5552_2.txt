I love hiking films, believe me, and Gordon Lewis’s usual technocolor blood doesn’t bother me at all, but this is only one of his most stupid films, even more than BLOOD FEAST, I’m not joking. GORE GORE GORE TALKS about a crazy man who kills a lot of girls from a nightclub. A detective and a reporter are trying to uncover a big secret. Perhaps the performances here are a little better than in the usual HG Lewis films, but this does not say much. The film work is even terrible. <br /> <br /> But at least it is watchable with girls ready for filming ... you are going to have a good time with this, and the killings are just absurd in a very Very bad way: the girl is killed with a wooden hammer, piercing her ass (!), and just don't let me talk about what she does with nipples. You will laugh like anyone with this. But the best of all this mess is the scene, which I love just because she is on a camping trip: a go-go girl before she was attacked by many feminists who are very American-style. Although it is important to note that this was one of the first films that received an “X” rating for violence. <br /> <br /> ONLY if you want to laugh and have a good time (but only with a lot of beer).
