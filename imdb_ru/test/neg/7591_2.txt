I saw this movie at midnight, and I can say that it is worse than another horror movie about the haunted house. Alexandra Paul is not one of the best actresses, but she can play this role better. The girl is getting worse, this is an example. A bad actress, she has no future in the great world of cinema. MESSAGE FOR THE HOUSE OF DAMES: BAD
