Oh, God, what Disney has done recently ... most of their new shows really sucks. Zack and Cody's storyline is pretty good, but other shows, such as Corey in the house, Wizards of Waverly Place, are lame and canâ€™t be tracked. <br /> <br /> Naturally, Sadie is almost stupid and stupid. This is a teenager named Sadie, who loves science, grows up and outlives his daily life. There are her friends Margaret and Raine and her older annoying brother Hal. They are all annoying and stupid. Especially Margaret, who thinks that she is the most popular girl in school and thinks that she is so cute ... it's just awful. I hate all the seasons of this show, it's just awful in every way (although the first season was better). <br /> <br /> If you value your life, you would not watch this nonsense, its painful and stupid
