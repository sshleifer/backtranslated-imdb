There are a few films that my school friends and I joked about. Basically they are the work of the 50s, shown on television at the end of the show. It was one of our favorites. The soul of a fallen native being came to life in a stump with a gloomy face. Now my friends claimed that if you look closely, you will see that this thing had shoes. I have never seen it. What struck me most was the fact that the natives seemed to be white people with black oily paint on their faces; some looked like Italians. They also spoke to the strangest timbre, which seemed not to fit their situation. Like films about the mummy, mobility was not a particular threat. In the confrontation you only need to go quickly; I think this is an old element of wonder. If you see it, do not take it too seriously. Be happy that we have a battery from old horror films that gave us such joy.
