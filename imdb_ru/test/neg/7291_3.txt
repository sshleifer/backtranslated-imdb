What (beep) goes wrong with Disney in recent years? Do you have exhausted good ideas? Where is the magic? Where are the good animators, the good songwriters, the good directors, the good ones ... Well, I know, Walt himself and the famous "ninth old man" cannot return. But is this the reason for launching countless cheap sequels and slow but steady destruction of Walt Disneyâ€™s ideals? I never rent or buy Disney's sequel to the fact that the film however. Because I read quite a lot about his (lack of) quality. But "Atlantis: Milo's Return" was broadcast today on television in Germany, and I watch it. This confirmed my doubts about the continuation. It was absolutely boring. Defective animation, primitive color rotation, simple characters, some unsuccessful attempts to simulate the famous multi-plane camera with CGI, mediocre music and a patchwork of various, simple stories. It looks absolutely not like Disney! Not like Disney, I know! This is similar to one of countless, cheap and simple animated series such as DragonballZ, Beyblade, etc., which were broadcast daily on children's television. <br /> <br /> My first reaction after showing this shit was to load Bambi into my DVD player, see the immortal magic, depth, spirit and charm of Disney again, see the culmination of Disney again, see the amazing art of hand animation again . Bambi was the first (and still the only) film that I give 10 out of 10 stars. But "Atlantis: Milo's Return"? No magic, no depth, no charm, no spirit ... It deserves only 3 out of 10!
