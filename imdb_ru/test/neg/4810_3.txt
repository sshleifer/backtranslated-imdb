I can not believe that I really bought this movie! It sucks! ... Where I live in Mexican films Mexican films are never advertised or even sold ... they cannot be found at regular rental locations ... so I had to buy them ... I really like Mexican films! They bring me closer to my roots and my people, and they are very different from what you used to be used to ... but this one was so predictable !!! You can guess what was going to happen ... I'm not a horrible movie! It just wasn't worth what I paid for it! Hajj ... but if you have time and you are really bored, then yes, you should watch it ... but if you like Mexican films and love the theater itself, then don't watch it, it will be painful lol
