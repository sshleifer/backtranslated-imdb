I am very interested in the children of animals, and I read many novels by Edger Rice Burrows - but this horrible film could not interest me, nor could I digest all absurd, unreal scenes. I managed to sit only part of Africa and the first days of John in Scotland. Let's talk about “unrealistic” and “totally stupid”! The actors in the monkey costumes looked like very big chimpanzees, not like monkeys (there is a difference). They did not move with grace like a wild animal. (For comparison, watch some of the best films about the Planet of the Apes, where they trained their actors to move in a monkey's manner). Monkeys eat large pieces of meat - as far as I know, this is not a common practice for monkeys. I am interested in animal stories, but the script did not make me care about monkeys. The great white hunters on the expedition, who find John Clayton, are completely charismatic. Clayton's parents were shipwrecked by the ocean, but somehow this is a very long journey along the river to get to the coast - let me rest! Let's talk about "slow." Even people who think that this is a great movie, admit that it is not an action movie. Not at all. It tries to be a study of character - unfortunately a completely silly part prevails! I did not read the books of Tarzan Burroughs, but many of his other series - they were filled with meaningful action and a heroic goal! This movie just does not exist
