I really hoped to see it, since I always like the performances of Paul Bettany. I thought he was very good, like Darwin, and I tried my best, given the terrible stuff he had to work with. <br /> <br /> Darwin’s book On the Origin of Species was one of the most revolutionary, controversial, and innovative. publication, but you would never think that this is because of this tedious movie. It's like a two-hour episode of a soap opera in a Victorian setting. For example, on Darwin’s five-year Beagle tour to the Galapagos Islands, there is practically nothing that would undoubtedly be of paramount importance to history, since it was thanks to his wildlife research that he began to form his theory of evolution. br /> <br /> This is only one long, dreary, inner drama, with Darwin portrayed as a slightly shifted eccentric, seeing the visions of his dead daughter all over the world and being given the cold shoulder of his emotional-constipated wife. The image of Jennifer Connelly Emma Darwin is nothing short of terrible and has little to do with the historical descriptions of the real Emma. There could be an opportunity to present a creationist interpretation of life on earth, either from Emma or from a local priest, performed by Jeremy Northam (part of “blink and miss”, which is a complete waste of time). talented actor) act as a counterweight to the views of Darwin, but this was not accepted. <br /> <br /> The story was too focused on endless fraudulent feelings about Darwin’s grief for his daughter Annie, and too much time was wasted in Darwin wondering whether to write his book or not. In the end, I felt so bored that it was difficult to take care of me. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a bit like making a film about Picasso and two-hour focusing on him falling out with his girlfriend and not mentioning that he was an artist.
