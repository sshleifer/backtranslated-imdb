This film was absolutely terrible. The only explanation I can come up with for the good reviews it received from some here is that they were written by people in the cast. It was actually painful to watch this movie. Even my grandchildren (6-13 years old) could not look at it. As far as I know, this film has never been shown in cinemas and for good reason. As if some people were idle and drinking beer and saying, “Hey! Let's make a movie. Who wants to be in it? ”This is so bad. Besides Luke Perry, who is only in a small part of the film, I did not recognize any other actor. This is not necessarily bad, but in this case. I liked Sandlot (I), and I generally like silly and stupid films, but this film does not have the only quality of redemption. The people who wrote this have no idea how the children think, speak or act, and the film is a mess of horribly banal lines and silly jokes. I rarely write negative reviews, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen since “Best Man's Friend,” and this is definitely one of the ten worst films I've ever seen in my life. If you rent it, remember that I warned you. The fact that some people rated this film as good is a sad comment on their taste and intelligence. I do not exaggerate.
