This is an excellent example of why many people say that the 90s sucks when it comes to horror films. A boring story about a voodoo-in-campus about terror starring the once so promising Cory Feldman (“Stand with me,” “Lost Boys”, etc.). There may be enough things that can keep you from falling asleep, and it does not look too cheap, but it is still a horror aimed at an audience that was in its early teens in the 90s. Perhaps I was a part of this audience, but still I received as much benefit as I watched now. And nowadays, teenagers have become accustomed to something bigger and better, and I cannot imagine that any of them know or care about who Corey Feldman was. Or "really," because the dude is still making films. But the only thing that still connects him with his glory days is the continuation of LOST BOYS 2: THE TRIBE, which was done recently. And I think that even no one will encourage anyone to look for a wind. Just another movie, lost in the horror of the 90s for obvious reasons.
