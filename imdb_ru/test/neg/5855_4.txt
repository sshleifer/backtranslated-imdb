This film coincides with Mike Allred's mini-series Red Rocket-Seven and tells the story of an alien who ran to Earth to wait for Astro, which is related to the book of Revelation and the apocalypse. This is only part of a larger story (if the movie confuses you, read also “RR7”). You can easily tell Allred is used to telling stories with pictures. The direction is very good, and the effect is not bad for a budget of $ 500. Unfortunately, Mike used many friends to play roles, and probably did not have the courage to say that they could not play. In addition, Mike does not show his writing skills in this film. His dialogue gives you the plot and does not allow you to enjoy the characters. It was really disappointing, given his great writing abilities shown in his comics. 4 out of 10
