Simply put, it was a pompous piece of dog puppies. Excessively stage, and everyone at that moment is a complete melodramatic drama queen. After a while, I began to wish that every character in the film was not such nonsense anal restraint. <br /> <br /> And in this film there is another one of those really annoying things that have recently appeared in fashion and should not have: all the scenes in some kind of diffuse, gray-blue steel. Hmm, the last time I checked, candles and lights are quite capable of applying a fairly wide range of colors. In fact, the light they emit tends to be a warmer, yellowish-orange spectrum. So where does all this blue-steel-gray light come from? <br /> <br /> This movie has fancy scenery and brilliant cgi fx, but it's still disgusting. This is a miserable junk for modern moviegoers who are easy to appease miserable junk. <br /> <br /> I really like vampires and werewolves as plot movies, but it was a complete hacker job. <br /> <br /> Universal Studios '41 "The Wolfman" infinitely surpasses this, even though its fx is rather primitive compared to what can be done now. <br /> <br /> I ended up with this franchise. The first film was quite decent. The second is still somewhat entertaining. But this one, which I could not even finish to the end, because it was so boring.
