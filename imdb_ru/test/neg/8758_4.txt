Oh God! I saw a lot of horror movies on my day, but this one makes me shake with laughter, not disgust. This is definitely a crazy movie, and it’s very low-budget, I could add, but if you can watch through cheap audio, terrible dialogues, ugly girls, obviously fake blood scenes and general obscenity of the movie, then you can find some of this movie somewhat interesting. This story is about a cat killer who commits a murder every "5th day, 5th month, 5th year" (wow, as original), and up to two detectives (one of whom valiantly tried to make a dialogue about delicacy good) to stop the murderous murderous violence. The killing scenes (which are made with a plastic toy knife) are quite cruel (which is good), but very annoying because of the constant repetition of the clearly recorded scream (which is very piercing). As for the blood, it is a lot of it, but it looks very unreal; especially blood - dude, come on, purple blood? But if you're a fan of bloody videos like me, then in this video you will find something that you can cherish just like me (a crap-talking detective ... he is the best thing for this film). In addition, all you find is a bunch of senseless nudity (which is also good, but it’s too bad that the girls are so cute) and a very idiotic hippie necrophilic serial killer. Sorry, but this sucks.
