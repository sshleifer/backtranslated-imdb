The next stop on our journey through the killer-calendar scene is ... oh, yes, Graduation Day! All these elderly people are just full of opportunities and ready to go out into the real world and become adults. That is, however, IF they can do it before graduation, without contacting the insane campus that runs, knocking the life out of students with their fencing sword ... Yes, it all comes from the high school star who falls dead from a blood clot during a race, and a year later her older sister returns home from the navy to the prom. The coach holds the blame and reflects on his low position in the store class, while the girl's boyfriend is still mourning her death a year later ... All these characters are the main candidates for the serial killer of the year, and you just need to sit through this movie until the end to find out who did it. “Graduation Day” is fun, although it is by no means originally fascinating and there are not so many memorable ends, but this is enough to entertain you. For example, Linnea Quigley, fucking a music teacher and trapped together, 30-year-old actors playing teenagers, and, of course ... Rollerdisco! Gotta love this shit! You can do a lot worse than Graduation, kids ...
