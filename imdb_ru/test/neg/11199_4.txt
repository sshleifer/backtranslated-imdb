I went to see it only thanks to Albert Finney. He is one of my favorite actors, and he rarely plays. I'm not sure that the plot is interesting or just stupid: it’s about a little boy who’s about to be born, but since his mother is starting to give birth, he refuses to go out! It sends God and the whole human plant into a crisis, and Albert Finney is summoned from purgatory to try to convince the boy to change his mind and make a decision to be born. Therefore, Finney goes on a journey through the Big Apple to the unborn boy, hoping to show him all the reasons why he wants to live. <br /> <br /> Despite the absurdity of the plot, I could take it if the director I did not try to turn it into your typical Hollywood sentimental film with moralistic messages. In the filmmaking direction, the film became unbearable because of the terrible soundtrack to serial sentimental music that Hollywood directors seem unable to resist. <br /> <br /> Next, he cut a somewhat unusual story, each time giving his hand. Whatever twists and turns were left in the plot, they were completely surrendered to how the story unfolded. As if the director suggested that the audience is just a group of idiots who do not see any obvious hints coming from a mile. <br /> <br /> Even Finney in his speech, although satisfactory, looked a little awkward place; and the little curly-haired boy, although he should have been pretty, was actually quite boring. Bridget Fonda seems to have intended to repeat the performance of Demi Moore in Phantom, shedding tears at any moment. <br /> <br /> I understand that so far the film has not been successful in distribution in the USA, which is surprising, I think it has a box office potential to be a modest hit, attractive for both children and sentimental adults. As far as quality is concerned, this is not a terrible film, it is just not very good. (4 out of 10)
