I literally ran to watch it, expecting the film to make me cry or touch my heart. <br /> <br /> What I found was not the heartbreaking, but the lame exploitation of one strong human character. <Br /> <br /> Intertwined between a pair of young lesbians and an obese man. <br /> <br /> In an environment in which there is almost no sound, not to mention the most common actions. <br /> <br /> It wasn’t quite BAD, as I’ve seen the worst - and I left the movie 10 dollars poorer, but wiser - that a well-advertised film is not the same thing as a MOVIE.
