Special previews are always a good time. No matter what movie you watch, the theater will always be filled with people who have been waiting for a movie, for example, for free, thought it would be something, or just get lost. In any case, no matter how good or bad the film is, only the audience will make it enjoyable. Now that this movie is a pseudo-horror movie PG-13 (can you really be horrified when MPAA is censoring everything on your back?), You know there will be chatter, laughter and breath-holding. With the “Messengers,” the crowd did not disappoint, giving numerous bursts and warnings to the characters on the screen. As for the film itself, I feel sorry for those who participated in it, because it really could be much better if it was properly tuned and allowed to stretch the legs beyond the effects of scare / fade to show black / show, in these films. In the end, we are shown a boring, tedious story with no surprises and a few moments of real expectation. <br /> <br /> This story is ordinary. The family moves from the big city to the country after a traumatic event to try to re-establish their relationship with each other. Having come to their senses, the spirits of the house go to a reformer-troublemaker, whose past helps parents not to even believe everything he said. Of course, the child does not cry a wolf, and people around him will know only when it is too late. I would be grateful to the Pang brothers (directors of the famous “Eyes”, whom I would like to watch more than before, to see what they can do without Hollywood interference). Presumably, the filming of “Messengers” was made by someone else, but saved the credit. It’s a pity that our studio system does with foreigners, especially when it was creative independence, thanks to which the films introduce them, and not the original noise), because they really fit the style and keep a few tired lines. about fresh. Unfortunately, I also have to give them their due for almost unbearable sluggishness. Just as I didn’t like “What lies under me,” I couldn’t bear the lingering wait that goes so far as to make it ridiculous. When our heroine and her brother are standing in the corridor with a ghost behind them, the scene lasts about eight minutes with static, strangely folded close-ups and changes in the depth of field, which ultimately ends with absolutely nothing. Being just 84 minutes, I almost think it would work better, even shorter. <br /> <br /> In addition to the very effective opening sequence, which features the fantastic Jodelle Ferland (playing the boy strangely), and the excellent atmospheric credit sequence, the only thing that saves the film from debris is action. With the exception of Penelope Ann Miller, who first made me think about what happened to her, and then, after several scenes, made me understand why I never asked this question in those years when she was absent, and Dustina Milligan, who absolutely lacked confidence, the acting is very strong. Diane McDermott does an excellent job, as his father tries to save his family in difficult times. He has many small moments of light comedy to counter his serious, dramatic role. William B. Davis (beloved Ruckman) is effectively used as an almost bad foreboding, unfortunately, is not used anymore. Our real stars are Kristen Stewart and John Corbett. Stewart plays very good emotions and shows some promises as an actress with this and Panic Room in her resume. As for Corbett, if he did not cope with his role, the whole film would have collapsed completely. I would really like him to be given more work, since I enjoyed it after the underrated TV series "The Visitor"? I still need to check out his first role in the Northern Impact, a show that I haven’t been able to catch up with. It is a pity that he will probably be the most recognizable for the over-appreciated My Great Fat Greek Wedding. <br /> <br /> In any case, the Messengers gave me a good insight into the work of the Pan Brothers and enlivened my desire to check their Chinese catalog of horrors. The mood and performances were there; it was just a simple and empty story that required too many additions to create a feature film. If they delved more into other characters, and not just Stewart's characters, it would be more effective if they had something more to show ten-minute scenes from nothing. If our main character is the only one being attacked, there is no doubt about how far the creatures will go to harm her. The moments of danger did not matter to them, and to the end really just stood as a filler. However, I am happy for the free comics, which are distributed after the special show, because, I hope, the environment will allow for faster development, an exciting story before it tries to surprise.
