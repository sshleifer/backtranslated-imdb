Having received a Sunday newspaper DVD, I hoped that it was not ordinary films that were distributed because no one would ever buy them. I was wrong. Shins plays on a par with a decade in a school pantomime staging, and the same goes for most actors. Neil is satisfactory, but he plays in Russian and his hybrid Northern Irish-New Zealand accent does not help him, nor does the rest of the KGB characters, all of whom sound as if they were in a Cambridge Footlights reunion. In fact, the only people with authentic accents are the extras who supply a strange word here and there, helping us to at least know where the hell it all happens in what is otherwise a complete mess. The "espionage" factor is not impressive for the most part and consists mainly of the fact that Sheen plays various ridiculous disguises, trying to merge with the background, quickly becoming not only boring, but also ridiculous. The plot has the potential, but is completely killed by the rest of the confusing production elements. It could have been much better.
