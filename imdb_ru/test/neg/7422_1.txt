(r # 64) <br /> <br /> Not redeemable, without merit, and, above all, tedious garbage. You know the film will be bad when its only star power is Lance Henriksen. The French title of this film speaks for itself: "Inexplicable." How can you make a movie so incredibly bad these days? Whatever the trick of Jonas Castel, it worked. This is über-trash, I'm talking about the shit of the “Manos” level, meaningless, imperceptible, not even so bad, this is good, cinematic bile of a higher order. <br /> <br /> Lance Henriksen I.S. Harlan Knowles, a character who could be interesting if he were not completely devoid of characteristics or individuality. Together with a bunch of morons, he goes on a tour in search of the evil Saskvach, who is believed to have attacked the plane that crashed in the woods, or something like that. Nothing else happens. There is some kind of soft (in the sense of: teletubby level) nudity and several obvious robberies of the Predator. After 92 minutes of total pain and another ripped scene, this time from Blair Witches, the film finally staggers through the finish line and ends. As a bonus, we see the monster itself for only one or two scenes in the entire film. <br /> <br /> There’s really nothing to say about this movie. All you need to know is that this is a very bad movie and you should not even see it as “so bad, it's good.” The Untold is an entertainment value, and Orlando Bloom is a typical game. Avoid this like arsenic.
