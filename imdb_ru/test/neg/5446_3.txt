This is just one of those films that constantly make you moan, and I would like it to be over. There are many problems, but few advantages. I feel that the main problem with this film is that it has something that makes a trashy conspiracy, and they are trying to make it an epic film, a film about super evil monkeys and smart ones who sign up, just not epic, it's cheese. When you have cheese, you make the movie more fun. Of course, the final scene with monkeys and this laser was very pleasant to watch, and more such things were needed. Instead, the actors are doing such a serious work that you feel that the film is just a banal plot against the background of all the serious tension that the film is trying to create. The plot revolves around a woman who is trying to figure out what happened to her missing ex-husband, as well as looking for some legendary diamonds. She uses these two guys who have taught the monkey sign language, and now they want to return her to nature as a cover in order to get into the country and begin a mediocre adventure of a lifetime. The only thing that makes this film somewhat tolerable is the character of Ernie Hudson and the laser attack at the end.
