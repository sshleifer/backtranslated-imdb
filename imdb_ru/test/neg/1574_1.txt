this “thriller” attempt would have no meaning! Some may say that "this film has everything?" Autism, arson, robbery, lost love, bag of money, slit throat, murder, blood, snub-nosed revolver, gnashed teeth moans, boobs (various definitions can be used), big lanterns, tribal people, fraternal duet trying to portray "stupid and stupid" white wolves, fighting scenes that resemble “happy slaps”, a snowmobile (s), a large tracked vehicle and a reconstructed motel? All this, with the tune of "Enyanesque" by the end ... <br /> <br /> Maybe my rating is a bit rude, but for a sensible film director one viewing will probably be enough, and nothing else can be done. <br /> <br /> Fuck
