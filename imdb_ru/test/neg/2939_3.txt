I am quite surprised that someone found this film touching or touching. <br /> <br /> The main premise of the film seemed to me a wonderful, albeit provocative idea for a film about rare relationships, but one (if I can judge by real examples that I know) is very deep and loving. <br /> <br /> However, the film was written cheaply - poorly scripted - and although it has a number of very nice pictures I did not find anything special. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem is that it is too short and poorly composed to give the audience enough time to invest, emotionally, in the characters: we are not worried about any of them, and therefore their stresses and obstacles do not concern us. <br /> <br /> I think that REMOVING - from the script to - with some character development by some really good writers - can significantly improve it. It is instructive to compare this film with Brokeback Mountain, which the scriptwriters raised to much higher levels than the scriptwriter - the scriptwriters, who clearly understood how to write a classic tragedy, and completed their task with care, planning and superb skill! However, people seem to alter only those films that do not need it! You will not miss anything if you miss it: I found it really very disappointing, and it saved me from getting 1 star from me thanks to the courage and intuition that was needed to make a film on this sensitive topic,
