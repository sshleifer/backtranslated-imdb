"Breaking the jaw" - the worst of all the Italian "genres", and director Joe D'Amato is second only to the great Jess Franco on rates for the production of trash movies. Connect them together and what do you get? A giant piece of trash, of course. Unfortunately, this is not rubbish in a good sense of the word, since Deep Blood gives more boredom than fun. To the credit of the film, he is really trying to do something bordering on the plot; but take the mentioned credit from the film - plot - rubbish. This is somehow due to the fact that a group of friends takes an oath (friendship), and then some kind of Indian curse, which manifests itself in a shark. Or at least I think so. In any case, most of the film is filled with boring dialogue and “drama”, and the shark itself - which allows us not to forget, this is the only thing that we really want to see - turns out only as cameos. Or not even that, since most sharks are actually footage! Although it is a rubbish genre, there are actually many funny Jawblocks; but with this, Joe D'Amato makes it clear that he did not even bother to try, and the result is what must be the worst Italian film about sharks of all time. Avoid this slag.
