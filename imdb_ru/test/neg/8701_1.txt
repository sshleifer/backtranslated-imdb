I really want Hollywood to come up with new ideas and quickly. Instead, they walk around, recreate and spoil a perfectly good film with alteration. This movie is terrible from the version of DeMille. Throughout the film, I told myself, eh? - What kind???? - I do not remember this part. So far, the only exciting moment in this film was the separation of the Red Sea. And in the version of Heston - it was much better than this version. Has anyone else seen a cloud of an atomic or nuclear bomb disappear and disappear when the Red Sea parted? I think I did. In any case, I could - could - see the last part tonight. <br /> <br /> I would like Hollywood to deal with various ideas and issues when creating new films. Instead of rehashing old movies. <br /> <br /> They should be left quite well alone. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: <br /> <br /> Well, I watched the last part. Did Moses come up with a second copy of the Ten Commandments with his hand — or did I see something — please someone write me and let me know. HORRIBLE
