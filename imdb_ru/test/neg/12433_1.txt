Nothing to say, except that I want my time to return, that this film took away from me. I am not racist against Hispanics. Hell, I'm half Brazilian. I liked the movie Children. It makes no sense. These children just walk and do nothing. They don't even know how to skate. All the time, I'm just waiting for something to happen! but it is not. Nothing happens the whole movie. I mentioned that they suck on skates. I could make a movie called Beat the Rockers, and the whole premise will be how to throw the crap out of troubled assholes like these kids. I'm not even going to go into details, this film sucks. Please do yourself a favor and burn this film if you come across it so that some other poor soul will not make the same mistake.
