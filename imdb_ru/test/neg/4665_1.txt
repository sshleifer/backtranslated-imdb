This movie has bad writing and bad editing. It is difficult to keep track of what is happening, because none of the characters make much sense. Some serious disaster occurs every 30 seconds. As a result, none of the sequences of "actions" are generally interesting. The film is “discarded” scenes in two hours, which are connected only by the fact that they have common actors. There is not even a sense of humor in this film to be a good “bad” movie.
