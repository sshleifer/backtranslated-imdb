The incident on the Mountain Road and beyond is the recording of Don Coscarelli in the series “Masters of Horror” by Mick Harris. Coscarelli is famous for being behind such iconic pearls as the Phantasm series and the irresistibly weird Bubba Ho-Tep; but he doesn’t add to this television episode the qualities that made these films magnificent. The plot is a mill that follows the routine idea of ​​an innocent, pursued by a lunatic. This time a young woman is driving along a mountain road. After a collision with her head, she discovers that she is being pursued by a white-faced maniac. The whole chase sequence is really ridiculous: the young lady often stops to set traps; only for a maniac who should appear in a few seconds, and it is cut from scenes showing her with her husband - who simply has a wealth of information on how to avoid insane killers; with strings like "expect the unexpected." The only real event for me was the presence of the High Man of Fantasma, Angus Scrimma. Coscarelli struggles to realize as many horrible images as possible; with such things as the rotted corpse of a dead child - but, since everything is so stupid in general, it is difficult to take this piece seriously. This is the first episode in the series and the first that I saw; I really hope they get better.
