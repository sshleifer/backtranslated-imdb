I am partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say “partially” because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant and boring. Unfortunately, this film falls into a later category. <br /> <br /> This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazaki’s recent Moving Castle Castle Howl. An intriguing premise is created, but then it immediately turns into a background for some incomprehensible events that only confuse the plot, and do not explain it. <br /> <br /> The first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world in which the story unfolds, and in fact it seems that a very interesting story is about to unfold. From this point on, things are going down the slope. The middle part of the film consists mainly of thinly veiled eco-propaganda, and the final is heavily overshadowed by the support of impregnable spiritualism, which destroys a large number of Japanese animated films. <br /> <br /> In general, the film looks as if someone has snatched all the other pages from the script before passing it to the animators. What remains is something visually stunning (although, unfortunately, the version I saw was a copy of the Nth generation, with poor color - which gives rise to the common myth that Nausika shows her bare bottom ), but it makes no sense and ultimately left me confused.
