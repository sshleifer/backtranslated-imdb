Lone Star Productions must have produced them in the 1930s, and Star Packer seems to be one of the most hasty. John Wayne - US Marshal John Traverse, investigating a crooked hooligan, known only as "The Shadow", responsible for the theft of livestock, kidnapping on the stage, etc., as well as for orders from the door of a fake wall safe. Yakima Kanutt is a reliable Indian assistant to Traverse, who is rightly called ... well, "Yak". <br /> <br /> In the beginning, we learn that Matt Matlock (George do Gabby Hayes), the head of the Union of Pastoralists, is really Shadow; a dead sale is when he offers to buy (presumably) half of Matlock's ranch from his niece Anita, since “this is not a place for a girl”. Like Anita, Verna Hilly has nothing to do with the film, although in the comic moment she uses a six-charger to blow up the ass of one of the villains in a night raid for panic. <br /> <The film has several curiosities - for example, the character of Wayne alternately rides a white horse and a dark horse in the first half of the film. In what could be a neat device, a hollowed-out tree stump used by a minion is located right in the middle of the street. And finally, the film doesn’t match the title, since Sheriff Travers never wears a badge throughout the entire film, that is, a star packer without a star. <br /> <br /> Horse chases, runaways stage scenes, stage-coaches from the cliff (another curiosity, the horses conveniently leave the stage) are all fairly standard things. But fans of John Wayne want to see him because of the charisma that he showed at the beginning of his career. For those who are more critical, the white handkerchiefs worn by a good guy’s squad could only mean that they all had a headache.
