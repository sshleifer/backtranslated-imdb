Photographing is completed, the acting is pretty good, but in almost all other departments the Greek tycoon is boring. Inspired by the real love story of Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis, this film is a glossy, but absolutely empty soap opera that can be seen on TV all day. Viewers who cover the entire “culture of celebrity magazines” (paparazzi photos and stories of rich and famous gossip) will undoubtedly find a lot of interesting things here. But those who prefer films with a little more pithiness, skill and quirkiness will find the 107-minute time a sounding tedious blow. <br /> <br /> American President James Cassidy (James Francis) and his beautiful wife Liz (Jacqueline) Bisset are in Greece on official business. The ridiculously rich Greek sea magnate Theo Tomasis (Anthony Quinn) sees Liz at a party on his elegant estate. Although they are both married to someone else, there is an immediate attraction between them. Later, at a private party aboard her yacht, Tomasis talks about her desires to Liz. Some time later, President Cassidy was killed while walking along the beach. Liz is shocked and saddened by his death, but soon she seeks solace in the arms of her Greek lover Thomasis. In the end, they are both married, and their love intrigue becomes a favorite subject of discussion for world newspapers, magazines, photographers and artists. <br /> <br /> It is somewhat amusing to note the power with which the producers of this film denied that it was a dramatization of the Kennedy Onassis story. They wanted the film to be viewed as an original story based on fiction. But anyone with a brain can see where the film draws inspiration from. Even Aristotle Onassis himself knew that the Greek tycoon was equal to his love life for treatment in Hollywood (according to rumors, he really had a hand in Anthony Quinn's statement on the role of Thomasis!) the movie? Is it better suited to action movies like Guns Of Navarone and Ice Cold In Alex ?? but he is in court proceedings with an uninspired professional approach. Quinn is very watchable as Tomasis; Bissett looks beautiful as an object of his desires; Francis uses his toothy smile and facade of integrity to make a believable politician. Their actions are good on the surface, but the actors can do little on a deeper level. In the same way, Tony Richmond's photo gives the film an elegant surface gloss when it moves from one exotic region to another, but the simplicity of scratches proves that there is nothing behind the glossy appearance of the film.
