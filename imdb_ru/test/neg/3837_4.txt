Hopper has never been worse, as if he felt that this film deserves only class B ratings, and it delivers pretty good. Outside Madsen and Hopper, the game is terrible; You have seen better in your local high school. Sound, and sometimes editing, and camera shots are the lower end of B-films. The spy-tom scene is the movies with the greatest episodes of naked nudity I've ever seen (it doesn't even fit into the movie). The script was probably a great 10-page plan, but when it comes out in a feature film, there are more holes in it than dead bodies left by Madsen. I have to say that Hopper, wearing a nice suit behind the wheel of a Hummer, made me laugh out loud, but I don't think that was the goal. Yes, there is a bit of style, and Hopper can always interest me. However, the interesting concept of the plot never pays off, and you wonder why you are wasting your time on it.
