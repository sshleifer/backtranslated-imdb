I read several reviews that ask the question “Why was this film made”? I myself discovered that this question hung in my head, as the function of the clock and twenty minutes seemed to stretch closer to the middle, only to create the feeling that at the end it was gaining momentum when in fact he did not do anything like that. So "Why was this movie made"? I think this is a great question for those who watch Heftig and the Beygist. This reviewer is proud of director Knut Eric Jensen for giving us this powerful image of hope, brotherhood and inspiration in this men's choir, but I don't think Jensen did enough to bring the exciting story to the table. Let me ask you a question: “Do viewers need more documentary than just a direct story in order to maintain interest”? My answer is yes, and it was here that Jensen failed. Heftig og begeistret was a good documentary, but it was far from great. Jensen has done a terrible job with the history and dedication of the subjects. It was great to hear the songs, but over time these songs seemed boring, stunning and a bit premature. From the first scene where our people sing their hearts in the blinding snow, I knew that I was hooked, but as the film developed, I lost interest. What for? Jensen never took us viewers to the next level. He maintained the playing field and ultimately damaged the overall tone of the film. Was it a movie about music or people in the choir? The world may never know. <br /> <br /> Again, I would like to state that Jensen did a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of people who definitely went through difficult times and how they coped with it all the time. music, but as if the male choir was a band of the most boring men ever created. Jensen gave me great music, but these were characters, stories that I didn't know about by the end of the movie. In the mix, we had a 97-year-old man who still had a driver's license, we had a big man in the bath, singing classic American songs, we had old people who were once heartbreaking, we had some tension between young people the chorus and veteran singers, and we even had a former drug addict who was clean for only eleven years. Does Jensen even develop these interesting stories? No, he left them on the table. It was obvious that these singers were ready to talk about this further (see the Politician who missed his political days), but Jensen seemed to have broken away from those spiritual moments and headed straight to interesting places where he could sing in chorus. For me, the music was defined at the beginning of the film, I wanted to meet and hear the stories of these individuals. They were all charming, but Jensen seemed to ignore them completely. <br /> <br /> Ignoring the main plot of this documentary, Jensen was unable to create any tension at the end. Without giving up the end, I felt that Jensen was painting the lines. Instead of being bold beyond the boundaries, he decided not to create a moment of sympathy, emotion, nervousness, or sadness. Jensen transferred our subjects from point A to point B to point C, without asking us to participate in any way in any way. I can see how the national mood made this film a huge success in Norway, but for everyone else who watched (i.e., me), more was needed. I wanted to feel these guys. I wanted to know if they were going to succeed while traveling or just to find themselves loved in their city. There was no history, mostly partly without the development of objects. When you watch modern documentaries (oddly enough, this film was shot in 2001), you want it to be played like any Hollywood feature film. You want uncertainty, realism and drama, alas, with Heftig og begeistret you will not get anything like that. <br /> <br /> In general, I have to ask the question again: “Why was this film made”? My last answer, Alex, is that Jensen wanted to show how troubled times and a changing economy can bring happiness even to the coldest places on Earth. I think Jensen wanted to show human loyalty and how something as simple as singing can bring people together. Having said that, Jensen perfectly demonstrated it in this film, but he did not create a good documentary. When you make a film of this kind, I feel that you have to look into the group, examine the choir members and hear each of their stories in order to achieve an end that captures your heart. The only thing that captured this film was my attention when he tried to leave the room at the speed of a rocket. Again, I do not want to sound negative about this film, because the music was excellent, and the singing of men caused a sense of honesty, but I needed more. Due to the fact that documentaries are becoming the main product in the cinematic community, we can expect a bit more than what Heftig and Begeistret gave us. I want to see reality and people, not just another song and dance routine! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** of *****
