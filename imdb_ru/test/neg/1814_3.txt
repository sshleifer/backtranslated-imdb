In general, the film "Heart of Darkness" was miserable compared to the book. Anyone who has ever read a book and had a sufficient understanding of it could see countless obvious flaws. There is an immeasurable difference between them. It seems to me that the director was going to a losing battle. I could not imagine that someone would undertake the monstrous task of recreating the “Heart of Darkness”. Huge details and the magic of history would be impossible to rightfully interpret. Conrad’s history had so many layers and such depth that it would be pointless to try to visually interpret it. <br /> <br /> First, the coverage of the history details is unattainable. The colossal subtleties created by Joseph Conrad cannot rightly be recreated with the help of a film. Marlowe's feelings and emotions cannot be equally interpreted in the film. If you took on the enormous task of the work of Conrad, then, like me, you know that Conrad wrote only half the story. The extra half is a series of connections made by the reader. You, as a reader, should be able to draw and connect the ideas of Joseph Conrad. As a result, the film lacks some important details. <br /> <br /> In addition, although the film was of sufficient length, the film seemed short. It seemed that Konrad was able to collect on 75 pages much more detail than the film could in an hour and a half. The speed of the film prevented the viewer from getting acquainted with the characters. Marlowe was a much stranger man. The viewpoint of the book puts you in Marlowe’s place. However, in the film you almost look at Marlow in the distance. I began to think that the director was trying to use the same “reading between the lines” method as Conrad. However, the connections were weak. I know that if I had not read the book then, I could in no way begin to understand the depth of the situation and the characters. <br /> <br /> Finally, Kurtz seems to have been misinterpreted as well. His role was short, and the details were not all included. It was impossible to comprehend the true Kurtz for the time that he was shown. An important detail in the book was that Kurtz became a god to Africans. I did not think that significant details were identified. Also in the book, Kurtz represented a soulless creature. He died inside a long time ago. I think the director understood this detail. However, instead of recreating it, he simply made Kurtz joke and mumble everything. Moreover, it seemed that the director tried to make Kurtz seem mysterious, but instead he seemed completely unidentified. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film reminded me of a teenager preparing to finish a science project because of the next day. It seems that it was created without much effort and at any time. The characters were alienated, important details were omitted, and, in general, the central plot was lost in translation.
