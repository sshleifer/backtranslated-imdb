This is not the worst movie I've ever seen. I did not feel that I wanted to forcibly remove my eyeballs after watching Galaxina. This is just not good. The jokes are almost ridiculous, but they fail. All of them. A few jokes are knocked down, repeating them again and again. Production values, well, in general, do not exist. The sound is bad, the lighting is bad ... it seems that everything is done cheaply; overly so. Dialogue ... well, it is often absent - a lot of awkward silence; they all just stand around, and it seems like someone has to say something. The film even seems ambivalent about what it wants to be - it is not always clear that it was conceived as a comedy - as maybe what developed after the start of filming. It is felt that someone's film project, which they put together the night before it was released, and if they spent two weeks on it, it could be good. <br /> <br /> And it's easy to please me. I thought that “Mom and Dad, save the world” is a scream. I like Pluto Nash. Mystery Men is one of my favorite movies. "Spaced Invaders" is almost a classic. This turkey just does not do that. "Space Truckers" was more believable. <br /> <br /> Avery Schreiber, who can be very funny, is trying too hard. His role calls for straightness, and he plays it based on a comedy series. Dorothy Stratten is good in her role, but not particularly remarkable. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, "My watch is always slow." The line was funny. I will give this film all the thanks that he can get, he needs it. <br /> <br /> Spacecraft models are not bad, but they are few and they are not used effectively. Space scenes are vague. No detailed passes, detailed fly-overs, not even suitable action scenes when they are on the dock. (The infinity really crashes into the earth is very strange at one point.) The flight dynamics are terrible; worst of all, what you saw, they are sharp, not smooth. The initial battle is unnatural and static; Although the two ships just showed that they can maneuver in their own way, they exchange (slow) shots from close range in a way that looks more like a 16th-century naval battle, except for a less exciting one. <br /> Aliens - imagine if all Star Wars was a cantina scene. A lot of rubber masks can dull rather quickly, right? Some of them are used as sights, which work normally the first time, but not the fifth. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, if you try to watch Galaksin, you will most likely fall asleep. (I did something else and missed the last ten minutes and didn’t feel that it was worth repeating. If it doesn’t say “It sucks,” I don’t know what a great potential is doing and it could easily become a good movie. It would be easy to remake it and get a decent movie. <br /> <br /> MadKaugh
