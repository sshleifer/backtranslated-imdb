Beautiful images, propaganda and history as a toy. The ingredients of this film are good, interesting, but with a lot of shadows. Political shadows. Jefferson is more than the hero of mythical America. He is a silhouette of a vision of life and society, an eminent thinker, a teacher of much of North America. In the film there is only Superman. A thin outline of ideas crushed. The subtle birth of essential truth is forgotten. And Jefferson is the main tool for creating a good picture of American realities. The end, triumphant and false, romantic and heroic, is suicide from a weapon in history that can be high with greater wisdom. And the war against Avatar is another gray spot. For someone who has not heard of Jefferson, the film is a good start. For the rest - disappointment. It is like precious silk tailor. But the tailor is keen on silk, and clothes are just ordinary clothes. So sad experience. Pieces of beauty and boring lakes, a patriotic lesson and shattering anticipation. A film that should be impressive. And the ashes of history, which can be magnificent.
