I found this film preaching and unreal. This is an attempt to be a film showing children fighting against the system, but this does not even represent a positive decision. I think I didnâ€™t really feel for children. I fully understand what problems they had, and I know how bad the schools are, but I found that solving them and how the outside handles them is a big pile of fu. If this happens on TV, do not waste your time. See the short circuit again for the 235th time.
