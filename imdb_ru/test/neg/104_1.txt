This film had a completely unique impact on me: it stopped my understanding that this film really sucks! It is disguised as a “thought film” in the spirit of “Memento” and other similar jewels, but in the end, and even after a few minutes, you realize that this is nothing but a pretentious crypt. Probably written by some collage student with friends to tell him out of compassion that his letter sucks. Whole idea elementary school, you suddenly come to the "one truth" about everything, then you have to kill someone and admit it ?? !!! What kind? How, what, why, why? It's like saying that in order to make a cake, just throw a bunch of ingredients and add water ?? forgot about cooking? I think that these guys have forgotten, have not explained, but they have presented a mechanism. WHY did this happen? You have to do this when you present a story in which ordinary daily activities (solving riddles) begin to have an abnormal effect on people. The acting was terrible, with the girl who always tried to look cute on camera, and the guy from Highlanders, the show, who behaved like a heavy metal store (yes, they are all real, albeit with-b). A “threatening” atmosphere, with “oh-so clever” riddles (enter the 60s series of “Batman and Robin” with the guest appearance “Riddles”) and crazy people who claim that they have “knowledge” behind that faces ?? just awful, HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> I am usually very partial to low-budget films and lean towards the weak, giving them more praise than they can deserve, instead of their limitations, you know, but this is just an ugly excuse for a movie that makes you want to be good for an hour and a half, and in the end you just lament that you fell in love with it.
