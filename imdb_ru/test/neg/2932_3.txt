I believe that in 1997, Hollywood was not able to openly celebrate homosexuality, so you can thank those who made this film for showing a little courage. Someone just wanted to give them credit for putting together a really good film, and, in my opinion, “In & Out” does not meet these requirements. This is the story of Howard Brackett (Kevin Klein) - an English teacher at a secondary school in a small town who was expelled on the eve of his wedding by an Oscar student who had to go through what can only be described as a period of self-knowledge to be homosexual. For me it was the first problem with this movie. Howard didn't have to be gay. The film would have been more ridiculous (and perhaps even more provocative) if Brackett remained defiantly direct, despite the stereotypically funny aspects of his life and the urban faith after Oscar's speech that he was gay. (Actually, I thought that identifying him as gay, given the presence of these stereotypes, can be quite offensive for the gay community, as well as for ordinary men who love poetry and believe in neat clothes!) <br /> <br Kline was decent enough in this role and mostly wore a film. Besides him, most of the other actors (albeit good actors) were people not very famous for their success on the big screen. People like Tom Selleck, Wilford Brimley and Bob Newhart are good actors, but not big movie stars. I really thought that the most funny (if very small) role in the film was the role of the super-model Sonya, played by an actress named Shalom Harlow (Speaking of stereotypes, I loved her such a stereotypical model line), I promised to do it after noon. I have to take a shower and wrest! ") In the end, what really turned me away from this film is a funny ending, starting with the graduation ceremony (and, frankly, even if someone decided that the prom was really necessary, the film should have ended there, instead of to continue with completely unnecessary weddings at the end.) <br /> <br /> In fact, I got a few chuckles from this, but no more. 3/10
