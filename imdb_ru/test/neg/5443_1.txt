As an avid movie buff, I felt that when I ranked my favorite movies, I felt that it would be fair to rate my most hated movies. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I have nothing positive to say about this movie. In fact, this is one of two films that I ever went to. In fairness, I came back and watched the film again, to give him one more chance, and sat it, wanting me to stay away. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that the film is really a decent cast and film crew. ... but then even the brightest Hollywood stars will not be able to realize the dead duck of the script. <br /> <br /> Do not come to life ... Save yourself from this truly sad "movie" 1/10
