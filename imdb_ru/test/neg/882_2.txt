My husband brought this house from the video store so that I could see something while I was sick at home. A kind of patient where you can never concentrate on a book, but some kind of silly, light, romantic click sounds like this (this is a bowl of chicken soup). Well, he meant well. <br /> <br /> My first thought (as well as some other posts here) was that the house MUST be fake ... it is not only isolated on the beach, but also installed on the moorings in loose sand and so close to ocean, that the waves of the surf go right under the house! It looks so obviously dangerous (in the country of hurricanes, in THE FALL), so potentially catastrophic that I was sure that the filmmakers simply made CGI-all (or used movie magic to shove a pretty B & B into the surf). <br /> <br /> But I have to tell you guys, thanks to the “cobwebs”, I can say that the house “Serendipity” is very real, really located next to Rodanthe and, with the exception of some windows and bushes, it looks mostly as he does in the film. You can rent it yourself in the off season for $ 1,710 a week (or about $ 3,850 in the summer)! Act! But ... interesting, there are serious problems in the house. The second thing that struck me after being “washed away” was “how about running water / electricity? In this surf? ”And, of course,“ Serendipity ”was convicted for a break in sanitation caused by an outflow from the ocean (They restore.) <br /> <br /> And the house is not from“ Civil War ”. Not to mention the fact that Viola Davis, playing "Black's best friend of the cliché" (an ungrateful role for a wonderful actress who was last seen in "Doubts"), is not so far that her INTERNAL could build something in the Civil War ! HELLO! it was 150 years ago! Try great-great-great! (In fact, “Serendipity” was built in 1988, ridiculously recently.) <br /> <br /> The main film is built on the typical cry of Nicholas Sparks, which means many coincidences and trivial predictable cases. It also targets a very indulgent way of "women" - you know, us women who love B & B, hot antiques and knick-knacks ... who dream of romance and guys who look like Richard Gere and dance in the moonlight. Do not give us a plot or thoughtful character development; Just set up some mechanisms and create love scenes! <br /> <br /> Gir plays a plastic surgeon who lost a patient during a routine operation for a benign cyst on her cheek. Of course, she died from an overdose of anesthesia, so you immediately wonder why the surgeon is to blame, not the anesthesiologist! HELLO! where is this guy? Why isn't that doctor feeling guilty? <br /> <br /> Gere came to sulk and fought with the woman’s husband, and stayed in a remote guesthouse ... who should be there, why ONLY ANOTHER PERSON IN THE INN ... Diane Lane! She is a lonely divorced, with rotten children and a former hubby who wants to return her. While she is trying to solve this, the best dark-skinned girlfriend of the cliché is arranging her mistress role in B & B. Now, in the real world, if such an installation ever happens, the doctor will look like this: Ernest Borgnine and lonely divorced, like Rosie O'Donnell. He spent his holidays searching for a 22-year-old girl on the beach while she sulks and thinks about going on a diet. But this is not the real world; I got distracted. <br /> <br /> A couple confesses everything, falls in love, hurricane strikes ... they make love, fall in love, he must go, he dies, and she cries a lot about it. The end. <br /> <br /> There I saved you from this; now you do not need to torture yourself or any familiar men (husbands, sons, guys) while sitting in this prank. It is very tiring. <br /> <br /> Someone else asked why Diane Lane, the perfect tiny woman (which directors seem to like to shoot because she is pretty and skinny enough that most women would like to look like her, but she is 45 and not excessively, so that it does not threaten) is constantly covered with large canvas handkerchiefs. It would make sense if it were plump, but it is not. <br /> <br /> In any case, someone throws a beautiful paisley shawl over this movie. So we do not need to watch it. Conclusion: read the book if you are not too sick. If too sick, go to sleep.
