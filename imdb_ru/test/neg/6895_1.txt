Around 1980, the name of Godfrey Ho was assigned to a series of comedy fighters with the participation of an actor with the unlikely name Elton Chong. ‚Äù Despite the absence of masterpieces of the genre, they remain surprisingly interesting for those who have a high tolerance for stupidity. <br /> <br /> It is completely unclear why Ho (or anyone else) would like to make a film that would have attacked Jackie Chan's Drunken Magic, a film that legitimized the creation of comedy fighters in Hong Kong. But this is a wild attack on Chan's film (imitation of Chan, who starred in this film, learns to make his opponents laugh to death - a meaningless trick in any genre). <br /> <br /> Along with all the flaws that can be expected from the Godfrey Ho film of this period - there is no continuity, no motivation, an incomprehensible storyline, irrelevant and incredible characters - the film suffers from two unforgivable flaws that actually make it invisible : scenes of battles stink, and comedy is not funny. <br /> <br /> Pointless.
