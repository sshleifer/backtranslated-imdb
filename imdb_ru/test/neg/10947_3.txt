The film was half finished before I could figure out what was going on. This is a dog breakfast from a movie about four Thanksgiving family dinners. Cliches and stereotypes fall on each other. When more than ten hours have passed - well, it seems ten hours - you break your head over what it was. I do not want to watch a movie about the quarrel at the dinner table. In my family, that's enough. The turkeys looked pretty good. The rest gave me an upset stomach.
