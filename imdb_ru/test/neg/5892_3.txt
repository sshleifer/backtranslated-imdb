This film is very disappointing that some elements of the book were made incorrectly. The main story is the same, but there are several flaws that hurt the film. <br /> <br /> 1) Bubi Miles is injured at the beginning of the story in a Texas Tech preseason game. This means that he will not do anything during the season at all, and Chris Comer will appear in the team earlier. <br /> <br /> 2) The game against Marshall was lost in Marshall. The team, portrayed as Marshall, was actually Midland High, one of Perm's main rivals, and here's proof — Marshall High is Scarlet and Silver mavery, Midland High is Purple and Gold bulldogs. Look at the jerseys and you will see who it is. In addition, the overwhelmingly football list of the real Marshall High is black, the team shown was racially mixed, like Midland High. <br /> <br /> 3) Permyak loses Midland Lee by only one point in the district game. Midland Lee loses to Midland High, and Midland High loses to Perm. These are the commands that set up coin toss as such. <br /> <br /> 4) Bubi returns to the team as a reserve to Chris Comer, and after he doesn’t get any playing time in the game of Midland Lee, he leaves. the team is completely at half-time and never stands aside or goes to any games again. <br /> <br /> 5) Brian Chavez was a Tight End and a Protective End, who wore No. 85 not the Tight End and Strong security. In addition, Bubi wore No. 35, and Kot Christian - No. 62. 6) Coaches eventually like Chris Comer as a player more than Bubi, because he has the best lifting ethics and he works more directly, plays the way his staff prefers, so partly Booby leaves the team. <br /> <br /> 7) Dallas Carter plays in Austin at the Darrell C. Royal Memorial Stadium, where UT plays in the semifinals of the state and not in the state finals. Carter wins the state title, but is forced to be a loser due to an inappropriate player. <br /> <br /> The game is going well, but if you read the book, you will see that these flaws are quite correct. I'm also tired of hearing all the PC hypocrites complain about the image of the Dallas Carter football team. The team, according to the book, is as big, monstrous, talented and black as the film shows. People say that this is a racist image, but reading the book, you see the real image of the team. The story has changed a lot, and this film received a rating of 3.5 / 10.
