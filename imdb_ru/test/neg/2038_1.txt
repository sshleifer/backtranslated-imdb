Brilliant game, great story, great special effects! This is what I would say about this film, if I watched it with a bag of diarrhea on my head the whole movie. Instead, I suffered 2 hours of shit-frame. Our “brilliant” story begins with a certain billionaire who has nothing to do except to look into volcanoes in a vain attempt to find his lucky charm. Instead, he finds a 5'4-inch man in a stupid rubber dinosaur costume and some strange cavemen. <br /> <br /> In his infinite wisdom (along with his infinitely large nose) he decides to go inside this Vulcan with a team of “special” people. To travel to this underground land, they fly by plane? Not. A boat? Not. They use this giant can of soup with a “solid metal” drill at the end, which I swear I saw the wobble Summing up, this film was more fake than ... Oh, that's right! It was the most fake film I've ever seen! For those of you who have not seen him and are thinking of sitting down on a Sunday afternoon with this wonderful film; I warn you! If you are watching this film, you should be ready to cut any piece of your manhood and give yourself a complete frontal lobotomy. <br /> <br /> ECCCHHH !! The rating system allows only a minimum of 1/10. I give it a -10/10!
