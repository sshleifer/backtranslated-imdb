What a terrible adaptation. The worst part was the music. Sax, muzak and synthesizers playing in the plot in the early 1800s ?????? The only character that didn’t bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy. I had to fight to keep my eyes open on it, and I usually love Jane Austen films. I didn't even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They had to pay me to take it. I don’t quite understand how Katherine and Henry managed to kiss at the end, when they had no chemistry or signs that they cared for each other throughout the film. Isabella and her brother were too exaggerated; It was no secret to me that she and her brother were “bad guys,” and part of the excitement of Jane Austen’s films is that what you think is good is not so. This is probably on my list of the ten worst films I've seen.
