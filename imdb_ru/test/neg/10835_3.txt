What a horrible movie. The effects were bad, especially by today's standards, but it was excusable. What was unforgivable was a terrible rehash of every flood / dam disaster film ever made in this piece of garbage. The game was terrible and I mean HORRIBLE. The point in the story where Michelle Green stops to save the dog from the approaching stream was fun. They see the water coming and run after their lives. (By the way, they had to find a very old fat dog, so that Mrs. Green did not look unfit). They manage to get ahead of the water for a while before taking refuge. What a speed! Later, the accelerating machine is not fast enough to avoid the torrent. God, she and this dog really ran fast! If you want to watch a good film about the destruction of the dam - it is not. Porchlight Entertainment released some good family films, but this time they just didnâ€™t hit the target.
