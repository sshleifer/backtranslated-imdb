“Embarrassing” is the only word that describes this horribly funny work. From the blatant disregard for the source material (probably will enrage anyone who is remotely familiar with the mythology) to the predictably insufficient production value, this whole mini-series is a train wreck. <br /> <br /> The cast (which includes some good actors I regret) delivers an illogical dialogue in the same generic “European” accent that is often found in bad epics. Worse, the lack of originality in almost all other aspects, from costume and scenery (blurring of styles in time and space) to musical score (which seems to mimic poorly many recognizable classical melodies, as well as The Lord of the Rings) alone prove that if you cannot afford to do them well, RECORD THEM. <br /> <br /> It was painful for me to see another legendary story, the cheap “adaptation” killed. Maybe one day someone will do it right.
