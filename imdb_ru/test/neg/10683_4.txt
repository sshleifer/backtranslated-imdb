I was all ready to hate it, but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerant - although the MTV-style of filmmaking (shot on DV, to download) is pretty sick! I liked the smug style of the script, as well as its central idea that the female vampire would lead as a contract killer. As for the cast, Eileen Daley (better known as the “star” of these dreadful introductions “Redemption”) has an undeniable presence on the screen and is quite sensual, despite her age; nevertheless, the main villain Christopher Adamson disgusted. David Warbeck has a short role as a doctor (nicknamed "The Man-Horror Film"!), Who conducts an autopsy on one of the victims of the vampire; The film seems to have taken quite a long time to shoot Warback in 1997! There is a lot of nudity and violence, but, alas, there is no special meaning (especially since its subplot, including the secret society of vampires, penetrating into power structures, is hardly developed); the film is also too long for its purpose and ultimately slips within the last half hour.
