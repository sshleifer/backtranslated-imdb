As another user, I got it cheap - I thought. 85 CZK (8 pounds sterling). Although it is not worth this amount of money, it is a classic classic that I, like other users, saw for the first time when I was a child, and looked forward to meeting again after 20 years. The story is surprisingly thin (that is why it may have worked for children), but all the radio language and material for truckers compensate for this. It will look good on my DVD shelf in the coming years. The first viewing (1980): 10/10. The second viewing (2002): 4/10
