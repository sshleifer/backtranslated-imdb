I was looking forward to watching this movie, since I liked the version of David Lynch. In my first attempt to watch it, I fell asleep. Nothing happened. The next night I tried to look at the rest, and again it put me to sleep! There was nothing in this film that could hold anyoneâ€™s interest. The only time it became a bit more exciting was when I tried it on Fast Forward! The DVD came with a second disc that contained bonus material. Needless to say, it was not difficult for me to survive the torture, watching Dune more (2000). Here are the lowest moments: the game was bad, the story was moving in slow motion, the scenery was and looked cheap, the direction was pitiful, and the CGI visual effects were childish. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Dune, save money or rent the 1984 version.
