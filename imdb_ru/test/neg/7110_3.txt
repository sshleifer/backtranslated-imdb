This 1988 film was shown recently via cable. We wanted to see another film that supposedly began, but because in that period of time the mixed film Hire-Kop was shown. Having never seen it when it was commercially released, we took a chance on it. Bad decision. <br /> <br /> Someone wondered what made the people behind the picture go to Rent-a-Cop, or how they sold it in the studio for distribution. Looks like this movie failed a great time. This film does not add anything new to its genre. This is absolutely predictable, because as soon as the basic premise is shown, we know how it will end. <br /> <br /> Bert Reynolds plays a wooden church. This actor can do better, but whoever knows what is going on behind the scenes, or perhaps the direction given to him by Jerry London, had the opposite effect. Mr Reynolds has one expression throughout the film. He simply does not register any emotions. <br /> <br /> Lisa Minnelli, a prostitute who witnessed the initial murder at a hotel in Chicago, makes no sense. The novel with her Della and Church seems fake from the very beginning. She and Mr. Reynolds play one-dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on turkey.
