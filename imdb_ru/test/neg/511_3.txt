Attention, possible spoilers <br /> <br /> This film is so lousy that it actually becomes funny. The director has put in all the clichés that the B-series films have ever pursued. The stupid fool (good rack) again and again falls into the hands of the bad guys, the main villain smirks and reveals his plots before they happen so that they can be destroyed, and which, of course, intimidated / killed the hero’s father the policeman's face is small, bald, and whose only preparation for the last battle (another cliche) is to bring his baseball cap back, etc. <br /> <br /> The end of the film really surpasses it, after the main villain dies when the hero is Paralyzed Jack Stoneface or to about something other throws him off the roof of the building height of ten floors, they come out of the building. Which of the exteriors looks only on three floors and is very similar to your ordinary town hall. <br /> <br /> When they leave the building, a side blow cannot walk, as his right leg seems to be wounded. Like, no one can say: ten minutes ago, he dropped a shot in the shoulder, and his legs were fine. There is no further explanation for the inquisitive mind of the viewer, who would be interested to learn such trivial things as “Where is the body of the villain that should lie near the building?” And “Why is there no police or even curious people around this body?”. <br /> <br /> I could keep this list forever. Why does another of the bad guys claim to have invented martial arts when they quickly kicked his ass? Why do bad guys even make stupid moves when attacking? Why does the hero look so strange? Does anyone really think: “Yes, these characters and this plot make this movie memorable”? And the actors suck. Our hero and savior of the day wears the same facial expression. Whole movie This disgust - an attempt to be a cheeky grin, must be his own feat. <br /> <br /> In addition, the thought that so far 12% of people evaluating this film gave him 10 makes me fear inside. They could be serious, and then we are doomed.
