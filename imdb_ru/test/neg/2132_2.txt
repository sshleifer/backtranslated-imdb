a movie i have ever seen. In fact, I find this one of the most interesting MST 3000 episodes I've seen. Not that it was good, but for anyone who saw Manos: Hands of Destiny know that these are not two bad ones. The monster in the film looked awful, everyone was in frustrated swimsuits, and the plot was ridiculous. I still have no idea why they made a monster, they never gave a good reason. The lead woman had to be the thinnest girl I ever saw. They would do better if they abandoned the girl who was killed at the beginning as a leader. On the other hand, the game of dolphins was great !!!
