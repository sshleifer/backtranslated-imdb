According to the advertisement on the back of the DVD case; Jonathan Ross "laughed until a little crumb came out." I suspect that this is more due to the fact that it is full. <br /> <br /> I never watched the show for one reason or another, so maybe I’m missing some important clues. As for this film; I watched the first 45 minutes or so. I laughed once, smiled once, then reached for the newspaper, waiting for something else to entertain. It's nothing you can do. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this was a surreal parody of life in the post-Python style, with a crude sense of humor. Over the past few years, many comedy series have appeared on television, not the least of which were “Bottom”, “Quick Show”, “Vicar Dibley” and “Father Ted”, each of which was engaged in a group of strange but funny characters and sketches. Any one of them could throw this nonsense into a cocked hat. <br /> <br /> If the show were something like this movie; I am surprised that they received funding. Fortunately, it was one of those Tesco purchases for £ 2, and now she’s at a local thrift store. <br /> <br /> The moral of this story is as follows; Do not believe the experts, never pay the best dollar.
