I can't understand how horrible this movie was. My eyes want to jump out of my head, and my ears are gushing with blood from a terrible, terrible soundtrack from one song. There are four children and a dog, and they run away from the hospital, and then they steal two cars and a bus. No one gives them any punishment or anything to correct them. Acting is so terrible that it sounds like an educational video for social studies. I can't remember one thing that I like about this movie. Nothing. Even the kid who lost his dog made me want to vomit. He returns his dog without a lady, even seeing the dog run out the door. Perhaps the dog was trying to escape from this movie. Then there is a bit of horse manure in the whole mixture. Watching the movie was torture. Then, in the end, the eldest boy says that being together is not a crime, and they all embrace him and love him. Stealing gas is a crime. Stealing two cars and a bus is a crime, and he had to go to the children's room or something like that. Avoid this movie at all costs, especially if you want to keep the family together.
