This film could well become a propaganda film for the North American phalangist party - or some similar group ... A strong man (Quercy) puts himself above the law (but not outlawed) and frees up decent citizens, killing useless trash, The only thing I think that this was not done by KKK, this is what a Jew played the role of a good guy ... Try to watch him again, thinking of it as a propaganda film for the far right wing - and you will see what I mean .. . <br /> <br /> This is the tragedy that Jimmy eydzh actually created the music for this film ... :(
