This is really a horrible movie. Jokes are rare and far from each other, and rhythm is a test of endurance. The only thing that is funny from this performance is a comparison with the classic film “This is the spine”. <br /> <br /> Avoid this film as if it were one of the scourges of the Bible itself. /> <br />
