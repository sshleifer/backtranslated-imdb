Produced at some point in his career, where he had juice to do whatever he wanted, Eddie Murphy took on the task of producing, directing, writing and starring in HARLEM NIGHTS, seemingly expensive, but in the end the empty gangster saga of a group of black nightclub / gangster owners who ran a posh club in the 1930s, led by a hot shot (Eddie Murphy) and his adoptive father (Richard Pryor) and their attempts to avoid capture by white gangsters who think what they grab the lawn seems they rightfully belong to them, simply because of their color. This idea probably looked great on paper, but it definitely lost something in translation. For Eddie, it was vanity, and I think he stretched out a little here, trying to be the whole show here. Admittedly, it was nice to see Murphy and Pryor together on screen, but the rest of the big cast, including Arsenio Hall, Redd Fox, Della Reese, Michael Lerner, Danny Aiello, Jasmine Guy, Thomas Mical Ford, Stan Shaw and Brother Eddie really has little to do (although I admit that the scene of the Murphy fight with Della Reese is hysterically funny and probably the best scene of the film). Murphy has clearly invested a lot of money in this film, and a lot of this can be seen on the screen. The art and scenery is impressive, and breathtaking costumes should have won an Oscar, but this one was a big blunder for Eddie, as he was definitely trying to wear too many hats.
