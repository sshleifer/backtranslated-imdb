I do not understand why someone could allow a director who works at a lower level to put such nonsense on celluloid. This film has already been shot, at least twice as good as this one ("Mr. Jordan Comes Here - 1941, and" Heaven Can Wait "- 1978). The only factor of salvation for figure skating fans might be some good skating done by a professional line-up of figure skaters, but this simply does not happen. The closest thing viewers see in good skating is when Tara Lipinskiâ€™s character turns on the ice for a moment. Others, such as Nancy Kerrigan and Elvis Stoyko, are hidden in the background and are not involved in figure skating at all. There are not so many real emotions here, and in fact there is no reason to tune in to this film, clearly created for television. My advice: rent the original.
