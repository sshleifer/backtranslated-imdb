What should have been an ordinary nanny in a secluded lake house turns into a night of horror, as high school student Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) receives threatening phone calls from a sadistic stalker, trying to stay one step ahead of him. br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes of the original film were pretty good, but from there everything was downhill. The remake takes these first 20 minutes and turns them into an 80-minute feature film. This is a good idea, because it eliminates everything that made the original bad. However, if they wanted this film to work more efficiently, they should have hired a better lead actress, better director, screenwriter, etc. There are no expectations, everything can be figured out long before it happens, and this is very boring. film, because there is not much going on, at least there is not much time to sit out in less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> If this premise worked, then the lead actress should give a realistic presentation. Camilla Belle gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen, and she seemed to read her lines throughout the entire film. You get the lead role in a Hollywood movie that will be watched by millions of people, and you will not make any effort! Why did they hire this girl? Of course, she is beautiful, but she cannot act at all, but I believe that it will not matter to the target audience, who will most likely eat this film. The rest of the cast is soft and easy to forget, especially the woman who plays the maid, Rosa. Even the stranger was lame, and his telephone calls were not effective at all. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of the disappointing boogeyman horror film of recent years. This film was a bunch of cheap alarmists and false alarms, and “When a Stranger Calls” is almost the same. Jill enters the room because she hears a noise, but it's just a false alarm, like a cat or a maid. This type of scene repeats over and over until a stranger appears in about 50 minutes. He must be one of the loudest killers in history. He had no weapons, and he did not seem to pose a particular threat. The ending is bad, but corresponds to the rest of the film, so it doesn't matter. The film is directed by Simon West, and he is very bad at creating uncertainty. He used all the clichés he could think about, and the results were not very good. The house was amazing and I pay homage to the film. It was an isolated house, so it was rather creepy, but this is the only good thing this film has to offer. In the end, if you're not a girl, then you should skip the movie. 2/10 rating
