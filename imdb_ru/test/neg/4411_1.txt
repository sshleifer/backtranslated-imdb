I know this is not original, but what the hey? What else can you say about this? I feel completely stupid, just paying attention to “From Hell It Came”. The film makes fun and dismiss an important political and social question about the consequences of atmospheric atomic tests, and not the anxiety and alarm that scientists around the world were raising at the time.
