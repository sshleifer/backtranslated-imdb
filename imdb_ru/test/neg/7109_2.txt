Being a fan of Marlene Dietrich films, I really wanted to see this “documentary”. I was also absorbed in reading an enthusiastic review after an enthusiastic review from national critics. It was supposed to notify me. <br /> <br /> The film is simply boring and clearly overvalued. You do not even see Dietrich. She is heard in the background, discussing her films and this video. She does almost nothing, but complains about everything. What a resistance! <br /> <br /> Film director Maximilian Schell constantly complains about himself and implores her to act in front of the camera ... all to no avail. She simply refuses to cooperate. After a while, these things become really tiresome. With her attitude, why did Shell continue this project? He should have just said to the diva "to push him." <br /> <br /> No matter what you read, do not waste your time on it.
