Most of all in this film, I miss the fact that there is no room for imagination, that says it all. It looks like a documentary, but not as good as a documentary, because it is not a documentary. Patchwork film without a continuous story. Very superficially, nothing to think about, because the film already tells you what you should think. Too many different problems are affected, but not one solved to make you think. I don't even know if this is a funny movie that wants to be serious, or a serious movie that wants to be funny. Many scenes are very unrealistic, and the acting is rather meager. The film is pretty boring.
