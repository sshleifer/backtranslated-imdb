This is the best film that ranks first among the sickest and most useful films ever made in this poor country. in fact, people don’t even know what the word cinema means, and you vote for movies, I’m really interested to know how many films about PP or L.Bunuel you saw. Evaluation of this "experiment with the file" reflects many things that you understand and learn a good / high-quality film when you see it. We, Romanians, have only ONE film, and until today its status has not changed, and this film is called “Padurea Spanzuratilor”. But I do not waste time thinking about how many of you have seen it. This is a film in which all the necessary qualities of the film are observed. From the script to the frame and even to the quality / clarity of the picture, even 41 years passed behind it. I recommend that voters look for the best films and then vote. Kudos see you later.
