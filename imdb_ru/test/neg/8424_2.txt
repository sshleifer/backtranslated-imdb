Forget about any documentary! This film is valid, and from a comedy about the 40th Yer-old pornstar, whose goal in life is to sing songs of the useless party chain. The only problem? Colton Ford can not sing! And the film ends whenever he seems ready to burst into song. Yet Ford and the same helpless guy, Blake Harper, whine, stomp and run around in their shirts, determined to make their dreams come true. Even funnier is “manager” Kyle, who seems to have I.Q. turnips, whose collagen lips look like a bee that stung him. How can adults be such self-deception? Bva ha ha! As for the documentary, the filmmakers seem to have no POV, and the film is poorly structured and wildly uneven. Very little background information on the three leads. Such an inclusion would make these three seem to be something different from the aging Western Hollywood stereotypes.
