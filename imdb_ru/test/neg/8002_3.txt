Moknie arrives in Brighton; despite the poor reception in the British press and state-funded British cinema written everywhere, I was hoping that we would get some dirty, shrill London by the sea of ​​Graeme Green. /> <br /> It doesn't even aspire to this. Characters directly from their clone clips reproduce Guy Ritchie types. The format is more like a British TV series than a movie (Brighton is a gold mine spent on plastic studio work). <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in search of a good performance by Famke Janssen ... she is a bit dexterous for this company, her big-screen brand belonging more to blockbusters such as Deep Rising. As for acting (even the role!), The search continues. The circus is boring. 3/10
