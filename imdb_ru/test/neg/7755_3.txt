It began as a good comedy sketching. The first few shows were very good, and I was looking forward to a long run. What was really funny was an imitation of Mariah Carey and a takeoff at the Beverly Hills 90210, showing a hair fight. Delta Burke v. William Conrad in heavyweight was also good. Unfortunately, the following shows were pretty fast. The letter became boring and, oh, so predictable, as if the show had acquired a cult after his youthful stay. Nothing new was offered, and repetitive parodies were boring. One example is the family of pistols (or whatever it was called there), which has become a weekly function. This sketch is not so funny to begin with, not to mention being a regular feature. An example of a quick, promising start, and then a sudden fall.
