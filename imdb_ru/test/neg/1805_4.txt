In a sense, this film does not even compare with the novel. However, it would be nice to have a visual idea of ​​what Congo looked like, as well as the natives, if you can't visualize while reading. I would never recommend watching a movie, rather than reading a book. I hardly suggest even watching this film, let alone other films based on this literary work. This movie; and many others who have not fulfilled this book. One important part that is missing from the film is Merlow's sense of how the absence of a government in Africa shaped the early genocide. Also in the film, Marlowe and his companions did not stop and did not receive a note and firewood. Similarly, Kurtz's African mistress knocks Marlowe closer to the end of the story, which has a great influence in the story, but was not in the book. In the novel, Kurtz died on a ship, but he died in his hut in the film. The groom's reaction to Marz’s interpretation of Kurtz’s last words was also different. This film is only effective if you want to present the novel more clearly.
