I just saw this movie last night, and after reading all the reviews, I was expecting a good, emotional sports film. What I got was something boring and boring. Yes, I thought it was boring. I saw how all the stars suffered long before the game. I thought that maybe they will wait until it collapses, until the game comes out before the “big one”, but I think the first game is good enough. <br /> <br /> Parenting was also very clichéd, with the dominant drunken father (I’ll say that McGraw impressed me, however) and the boy who wants to stay and help his (sick?) mother. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the occasional girls (Melissa and Maria) who were in the film for the entire 5 minutes, and placed there just to get the football boys some action from the field. I thought, “Okay, now, how does this work on the plot again?” Maybe I missed the moment, except that “Well, they play football in a city that loves it, so the girls rush to their feet.” <br /> <br /> Sports had some good moments, but most of them were so hurried! I think that the first game lasted longer than the installation of the entire playoffs! And I was not sure of the continuity of the winding up clock in the final game. <br /> <br /> I think I could see this film winning ESPY for the best sports film if it were released only one. Honestly, I found it to be a boring film, full of people who are crazy and piggy-skinned. For the best football movie, see Remember the Titans.
