Hercules: The TV - the film Hercules is a very perverted and cast version of the story about Greek superheroes. Paul Telfer makes a good attempt to play this hero. Sean Astin reinterprets his image of Sam Gamgee, playing Lupine, a character who has become a hero, to make it all a picture from a film of friends. I almost expected that one day he would say: â€œWe are in a bad situation, Mr. Frodo, I mean Hercules. An unexpected good performance comes from Timothy Dalton (one of the younger James Bonds), like Hercules' father. like Paris Hilton, something that immediately turned me off. Unhappily someone distorted and turned the original story into some dark, and sometimes incomprehensible story. Special effects don't help either. While the Hydra scene justifies the original story of the Nemean Lion and the Harpy simply ... well, lame. I believe that the creatures and effects from the Mighty Rangers flashed through my mind at least twice. And Golden Hind felt excited and very computer-generated. And they destroyed the Cerberus! from my favorite parts of what was originally a very cool story. The film cannot decide whether it will be Greek, Roman or American. And he almost destroyed the original story, the classic epic. Do not try to search this on straight to DVD. - WITH
