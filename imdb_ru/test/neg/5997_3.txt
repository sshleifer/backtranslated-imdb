Potential viewers should be warned, the current IMDb viewer rating for Tomorrow at Seven is an anomaly of low voter turnout. He has an interesting premise: the killer leaves his business card Ace of Spades at the scene of the crime warning the victim in advance. The performance, however, remains unsuccessful, and to say that the film has its share of holes in the plot, it would mean that in fact there is a plot. <br /> <br /> Chester Morris portrays the mysterious writer Neil Broderick, combining elements of the real murders of the ace of spades killer in his latest novel. Broderick intends to interview a wealthy businessman for his book, but first he must pass by this man's eccentric secretary - "If you put his relatives in a row, you will be crazy enough to hold Ford together." This line unceremoniously adores his daughter “nutlet” Martha (Vivien Osborne), who offers to meet. <br /> <br /> Broderick meets Thornton Drake (Henry Stevenson), just at the moment when the last one is about to finish the puzzle, delivered by courier that morning. The only remaining fragments, as we will see in the next scene, form a fat black figure "Ace of Spades" containing the words "At seven tomorrow evening." Now the one who collects the puzzle, does not use pieces with contrasting colors in the first place! <br /> <br /> I was initially intrigued by the appearance of Frank McHugh and Allen Jenkins in the role of police detectives summoned to Drake's residence. As a rule, their characters are colorful enough to offer a real comic relief, but here they are just annoying. In particular, Clancy McHugh negates objections to the meaningless comments made by his partner Dugan, and both usually move in the opposite direction when real problems can arise. <br /> <br /> Now the question is - in the light of the identity of assassin Ace, why did he invite the novelist and a couple of police officers he just met for a flight to his plantation in Louisiana? Especially when at seven o'clock all the participants will be captured aboard the plane when the first murder is committed. However, it was not Drake who died, but his secretary, Austin Winters (Grant Mitchell). An early suspicion falls on the pilot Henderson (Cornelius Keefe), after he failed, but Henderson still did not report the murder to his observer, until he arrived at the Drake plantation with everyone. Can you imagine anyone trying to get away with today, unless your name is Ted Kennedy? <br /> <br /> If the cause of death has not yet been determined, the local coroner is called, but the first one that shows An (Broderick's accomplice) is fake. However, when the real coroner appears, it immediately disappears! In the second darkened scene, a letter should be read from the murder victim of Austin Winters. When the lights return, he disappears, and since he can point to the killer, he becomes the key to be found. So where was the letter? Winters daughter Martha grabbed him and laid him on the mantle of the living room! How many thoughts have been invested in this? <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is all so meaningless that the character of Morris solves the matter quite easily. Despite the fact that the film begins in about an hour, it becomes almost a chore to look at it with all this nonsense. There really is only one humorous moment worth repeating; while on board the plane, detectives have this exchange: Dugan - “Hey, Clancy, how often do these things fall?” Clancy - “Once!” <br /> <br /> With the exception of McHugh and Jenkins, I cannot say that I have seen other players in films of that era, although I am a fan of most mysterious B films from the 30s to 50s. Fortunately, the couple turned out much better, supporting Humphrey Bogart in the muddled jewel of 1938 - “Swing Your Lady”, where they laugh purposely. The best I can offer about “Tomorrow at seven” is Martha Winters' quote about the middle path, although this turkey - "It's just a stupid waste of time."
