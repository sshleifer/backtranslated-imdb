QUESTION: How does a film deserve two different names, such as "Librarians" and "Shock Force"? <br /> <br /> ANSWER: The film is soooo bad that the filmmakers could not even decide on the title !!!! <br /> <br /> This film is a mix of martial arts, death-vendetta, melodrama, romance and other cliché techniques. The story tells of a vigilant group called the Librarians, led by agent Simon (William Forsyth). The group is hot in pursuit of a vile multilingual creature named Marcos (Andrew Divoff), which captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world in southern Florida. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds appears as a cameo in this film, and his scene is completely alien to action. Bert sets out a long monologue in one of the strangest events I have ever heard. Perhaps it was Bert’s attempt to switch to the Irish dialect, but the overall effect is a kind of perverted imitation of Marlon Brando in The Godfather. <br /> <br /> This film also features Erika Eleniak, who penetrated into the inner circle of the strange world of Marcos. Erica's character allies with Simon. Librarians and Erica will be a powerful shock force against evil in the film, which was delivered straight from the editing room to your cable television converter.
