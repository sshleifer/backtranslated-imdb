I have to start by saying that I have something like a love-hate relationship with musicals. Some of them are just fantastic, some are just crap. Therefore, I expected Hair to fall into one of these categories. However, this is not the case, falling in the middle. <br /> <br /> The songs are not brilliant, although the song "Sodomy" really made me smile a lot, and everything looks rather outdated. But the film did not attract me, as others, such as Rocky Horror. Although this is a bad example, because for many years I hated Rocky Horror, but suddenly I received it and have since loved it. Maybe the hair will be the same. Although I doubt that because of the language and nudes, he will get the same fame as "Rocky Horror", so I doubt that I will have a chance for this to affect me. Gettit? Hair .... growing ... oh, fit. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I havenâ€™t seen the last fifteen minutes or so because of a technical glitch, which was a shame, as I would have liked to see how it ended, especially after reading some of the reviews here. <br /> <br /> This is not a film for an ordinary viewer, but a film for music lovers. I really hope that they do not redo it, since I think that any such alteration would end up with a small, pale, computer version of the original. <br /> <br /> Worth looking lovers Genre.
