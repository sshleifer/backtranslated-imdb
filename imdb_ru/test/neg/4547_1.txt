When I decided to watch a movie about cryogenic zombies (“cryonoids”), I did not expect much. This is exactly what I received, and even less. In addition to the lack of special effects (squibs?) And the acute shortage of acting talent, “Cooling” also demonstrates the worst scenario I have ever seen in the film. During the first 45 minutes I had to stop the tape several times in order to correct the damage done to my intellect for witnessing such a brutal dialogue as here. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the collection of characters is so funny and formally funny: a corrupt doctor; his assistant, played by Linda Blair (we know that she is his “assistant” because he repeatedly calls her by that name); a recently widowed businessman with a heart of gold who develops a romantic interest in the character of Blair; his criminal son; an alcoholic, abusive, unemployed guy of character Blair, whom we meet with the most skillful use of memories; and, of course, a rough, strong, bearded guard who becomes a hero. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the preservative fluid that some cryogenic laboratories use on their bodies is highly conductive, which naturally leads to a catastrophe when all the lab containers end up in the open air in a remarkable sequence of events during a thunderstorm ( Halloween, no less). As for the zombies themselves, if you like to watch people in green latex masks who wear aluminum foil suits, then Cooling is a movie for you. Zombie action is very weak at its best; The main method of killing zombies seems to be taking people by the shoulders and shaking them to death. The businessman and the guard spend most of the battles with zombies, including the very tense scene of the re-freezing of the undead with liquid nitrogen. Let me tell you that on the steelworks stage in T2 nothing is said about Cooling when it depicts an enemy frozen on its tracks. <br /> <br /> Getting Linda Blair stuck in the middle of this piece of wood is really a mystery. True, her career didn’t take off much in the 80s (unfortunately), but this film confuses her. The script doesn't even have the propriety to use it. The maximum that is given to her in her character is to scream things like “Here they are,” “Do something,” “Hurry!”. The only thing I can understand is that poor Linda received compensation for her work on this film in the diets. The hero plays the Grizzlies Adams himself, Dan Haggerty. In this photo, he is faced with a tough actor fight with his beard and guard dog and makes every effort to surpass them both. <br /> <br /> The only frightening part of “Cooling” is the introduction that brings up the actual elements of cryogenics and suggests that “the film you are about to see can happen in your own community.” As I counted how many times several names repeat in the closing credits, I was amazed to suddenly see that Lucasfilm was credited. Fortunately, it was only for sound film production. 1/10
