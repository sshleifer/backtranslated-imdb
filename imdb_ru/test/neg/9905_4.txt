The first two hours of the televised version are full of character and plot descriptions - after an early short Las Vegas sequence that hit a tornado, the action really doesn't start until the second two hours. However, some character relationships do not become clear until the second part. Actors perform in competent performances, but nothing special (though better than in “Aftershock: Earthquake in New York”). The exception is Randy Quaid, whose temper is superfluous and incredibly annoying. The plot is a fairly standard mixture of the parts “Independence Day”, “Speed”, “Day After Tomorrow”, “Earthquake”, “Rising Hell” and several other films. You can predict what happens next and come close to predicting dialogue, word for word. The special effects are incredibly bad. Despite the effects in Twister, the tornadoes in this film seem less realistic than in The Wizard of Oz, and other effects were obviously made for less money than such TV shows as CSI and The Cold Case, spent on the aggregate of one episode. If you need to watch a film about the disaster created for television, see “Day after”, “Asteroid” or “Special Bulletin” - you will get the best stories, actions and effects.
