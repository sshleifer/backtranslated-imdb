Leonard Nimoy shot Star Trek III, which was not so bad. Maybe William Shatner thought that, like Nimoy did, he could. After watching this movie, he had to reverse this decision. <br /> <br /> Star Trek V The final frontier is the worst in the series. The actions of all participants, including those like Shatner and Nimoy, are bad and blurred, and make them seem as old as they look in real life, special effects are tasteless, like when Spock has to save Kirk on a jetpack when he falls down from the mountain . <br /> <br /> Attempts at humor were pitiful, and the story is so horrible that one doesnâ€™t have to think about what the Vulcan basically steals from the Enterprise to find God (seriously). take care of any of this film and oh, not to mention that Uhura performs belly dancing to distract male guards. She looked like she was in a grandmothers competition. If they wanted her to look sexy. They were wrong. She looked grotesque. <br /> <br /> How it got into production or even written ... well, nothing to think about. The only place good for this movie is rubbish. The worst of the series.
