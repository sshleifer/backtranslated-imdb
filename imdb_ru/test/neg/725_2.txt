Others have mentioned the meaningless dialogue in this series, and I agree. <br /> <br /> If mom and daughter were really so clever, they should have become the Queen and Princess of the Universe, and not walk in some small town. . <br /> <br /> I really tried to watch a few episodes, but when the witty staccato-mumble of pop culture begins, I switch the channel. <br /> <br /> I watched a bit of a new episode. to see if anything has changed (for the better, what I hoped for), but no, the same old “we are so clever with our references to pop culture” that I almost felt embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Old-time fans who are not happy that new seasons can simply invent and fall sick with a regurgitated pub that never stops.
