I'm a big fan of MD. But I call it what I see. This movie was limping. The plot was ridiculous. Getting access to the heads of state in this film is easier than accessing the local grocery store. Come on! Tone Loc has the emotions of a wooden board. Loosen up Editing is changeable. The actors, and I freely use this term, sound as if they are reading their lines about Valium. <br /> <br /> This movie could be better. Dudikoff has potential, but he chooses scripts that just scream "Stinker." <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good Dudikoff movie, can I suggest Crash Dive or Avenging Force. If you have never seen one of his films, this is not one that will introduce you to his work. You will leave with a bad taste in your mouth and will think that all his projects are so bad.
