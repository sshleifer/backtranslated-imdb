I usually do not write reviews, but this “movie” was special. I could not turn it off. I do not believe that I have ever seen the worst movie, but I sat and watched. It was like a terrible car accident with blood flowing down the highway. It was disgusting, but I could not turn away. Where do I begin? It seems in the film it seems that this is a sports thriller, but it is so funny that it can only be a comedy, but it is not funny, even silly / stupid. This is similar to how your cousins ​​are trying to play the game on family get-togethers. It hurts to look at it, but at least for one or two minutes. The second string lasted more than an hour. <br /> <br /> Anyone who was involved in creating this film should not work again. To write, direct, play and everything was just awful. The problem is that I can't describe how bad everything was; you just had to see it. And I am sure that it will never be shown again, so if you have not seen it, you are not lucky. I mean, it was almost worth seeing just for giving me some appreciation for every other “bad” film that I’ve seen in my whole life. And for each film that I see in the future, which I hate, I think to myself, well, at least it was not bad, like the second line.
