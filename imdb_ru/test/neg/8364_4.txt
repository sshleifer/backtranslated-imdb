Last night, I saw an early preview of Prozac Nation. Because I love everything that Christina Ricci does, at first I was very excited, but when the film went on, I began to wonder where he was going. Based on a true story, it's just about Christina Ricci's character and her fight with depression, drugs, friends and family, as you can probably tell from the title. In my opinion, this film was moving too fast, and it was too dramatic. I would say that every five minutes there is a dramatic moment, and the film moves through her life very quickly, and this does not leave us a place to communicate with the character Christina Ricci. Christina Ricci's performance was fantastic, as always, but Jessica Lange stood out throughout the film, and I believe that the success of this film will be largely due to her and Christina Ricci. I would rate it 4 out of 10, and I would advise you to rent it or read Elizabeth Würzel’s books, they are good and definitely worth checking them out.
