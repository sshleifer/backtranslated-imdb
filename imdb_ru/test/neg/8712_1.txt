I almost fell asleep while watching this. From a boring story that seems to go on forever, it follows several days from the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his techniques. After the hot romance, the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they cannot be together and how they should go their own ways. <br /> <br /> Then a male prostitute walks down a downward self-destructive spiral, trying to find his “one true love”, repeatedly returning to the same places where they were often in search of new evidence or signs of where he might find my love. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, he meets with one ugly guy (whom I also considered a male prostitute), a homosexual and a guy who eventually arranges a “three-second session of sexual intercourse” with him in a back alley. <br /> <br /> It never ceases Surprise me how movies still portray casual sex as scenes that can occur in short seconds, for example, in this case, when the stunt barely had his pants come off before pushing its three times and miraculously experience orgasm! <br /> <br /> All these casual encounters end up with the sexual partner asking him to call them, and he discards their phone numbers. <br /> <br /> There is a brief story involving a character visiting his busy mother, who seems to have no time for his lifestyle. There is also another short side story involving a casual conversation with a young woman who several times noticed him standing on the bridge from her window. And there is another short side story in which he shows a letter to a familiar man, but the audience is not informed about his attitude towards this man. <br /> <br /> None of this is really related to each other, just to show us how lost and confused this young man really is. It seems he lives like a ghost. Throughout the film there was one good scene in which he delved into the yard, looking for a specific recording with the saddest song in the world. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this film seems to go on forever. Filmed in black and white, it may seem very fabulous, but sitting in the theater for almost two hours, watching how this stuff resembles a nightmare! <br /> <br /> I found the ending strange, since I was not not sure that the young man died and went to heaven? It would be a good reward to put an end to the suffering that both the audience and the main character in this senseless joke had to endure. But, given that this is an “independent film,” films with such endings should encourage you to “use your imagination.” <br /> <br /> For those of you who are looking for nudity, there are only short scenes, and most of them are shot in such a way that everything that suggests the idea is artfully hidden in the shadows. In other words, do not waste your time on this. <br /> <br /> My rating is 2 out of 10
