I am ashamed that it took me about 3 minutes to work to go to the video store, and it was 2 hours for one night, and I was really intrigued by the image of the half-star. <br /> <br /> I think this film shows what the New York Film School and Sir Papa’s condition - judging by the biography of this clown at the head - can do for you and for you and for you, because that's what we have here and, moreover, a photograph with the participation of the main “actor” with someone's body in a still image that is not found anywhere else in the film. This is strange, because in many ways he was thrown money, obviously, it was low-budget cash buckets, but from the very beginning, when all extras laugh at their scene of terror, it doesn’t bode well, perhaps it would have some charm was made for 2 cents! I soon missed the scene and quickly moved to see the image on the box, and that was all that really worried me. Strange, why don't I take off porn or something? but wow, there is a bad game, it's funny, I think, and a bad game, it's just bad. Robert Englund is pretty pathetic in this, like everyone else. it makes you appreciate the fact that there is not so straightforward horror. , blah, most of which I would not bother. Should I watch Hellraiser 3, if I want to see 8 packs! I believe that excited old funny guys with 2 minutes in the video store will be the main tenants of this, and they should start a class action suit!
