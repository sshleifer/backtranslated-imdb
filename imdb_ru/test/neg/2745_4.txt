-SPOILERS ------------ I'm a fan of French cinema of the 60s-70s, but not necessarily more modern, so, frankly, I watched this because of Bellucci. She is very young here, very Beautiful and, moreover, supposedly, in this film they met with Kassel, so he attaches special importance to him. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a very beautiful style, reminiscent of DePalma. Then, suddenly, we are thrown into the Memory, and goes back and forth, which tires. I do not mind a flash back, but do it and finish with a man !!! In any case, the film is still interesting to me until the moment when the first and definite hole in the plot, which takes into account the rest of the story, never allows me to enjoy the rest. I can tolerate small holes here and there, but not base the whole plot in the hot air. This is the story of a man who literally looks for the old flame. This is the main plot. I will go further when the story at some point convinces me that there are really mysterious things happening, but in This is a story in which there is nothing mysterious. Bellucci-Cassel is a couple, then Bellucci urgently needs to leave for some work in Italy (not the most distant place on earth from Paris), and she leaves him a message, which, for reasons explained later, he does not. well, so what? Don't these people have phones? Supposedly, she was absent for 2 months (not exactly a hundred years), and she would not call her boyfriend in Paris to find out how he was doing? Of course not. Even after she returns, she will forget everything about him. And this is normal, but later in the film she tells her friend that this was her greatest love, and she was ready to do it for the first time in her life. she could not call him for 2 months and then never tried to contact him. What about the character Kassel? He, presumably, could not find her in Italy, it is really difficult to find someone in Italy, probably, like in Siberia, especially the Actress, who is probably listed even in art newspapers. And after 2 months, when she returns, it is very difficult to find her and ask for explanations. Someone thinks she wanted to avoid him, but no, we find out that they simply could not meet. So hard to meet in Paris. Well, I donâ€™t need to go further, because this is the case when the whole movie is based. Worse, Bellucci is not really the star of this film, but another girl Boringer.
