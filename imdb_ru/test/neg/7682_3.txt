Sorry guys, I like the work of Ray Bolger, but he is not the presenter. Maybe if you pretend that he is the last person on earth, this romantic story might work, but come right now! <br /> <br /> Here is a film that exists simply to show the title song, which was a great success for the group Basie a year earlier (1951). And some graceful singing and dancing save him from a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> However, the storyline is pathetic, even by the standards of the 1952 musical comedy. And other songs are as easily forgotten as Evening In Paris cologne. The dialogue confuses the stars, Day & Bolger. Only Claude Dauphin’s buyer's spell holds his three-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> So, how to watch this movie on video? <br /> <br /> A.) Fast forward through the entire dialogue ... <br /> <br /> B.) Surrender to Doris Day vocal and Ray Bolger’s relaxed work. And don't miss Dauphin’s cheerful look at the rain-drenched, wind-filled reprise of April in Paris ... <br /> <br /> C.) Finally, keep a couple of bottles of Cabernet chilled and comfortable. <br /> Bob Raymond
