From an English accent to such unnecessary violence after violence. Showing Moses as a killer. People who truly believe in the Old Testament just sit there and shake their heads. I am not a religious person at all. But even I felt that the authors of this film are trying to incite us all against God and the Jews. When Moses took this stone and threw the first stone at a woman to kill her for adultery. I wanted to stone writers. I can not believe in our time that Hallmark and ABC (Disney) will try to show such garbage as this. Do we not have enough problems in this world?
