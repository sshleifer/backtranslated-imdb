It would have to be rated as one of the worst films of all time. The film was shown at the Italian Film Festival in Melbourne, Australia. After checking, I not only wanted my money back, I wanted to return and 1.5 hours wasted in my life. I have a very broad level of tolerance when it comes to the condescension of some European film productions, but this is one of those films that is chosen for festivals based on the reputation of one director. This film is proof that, although such a choice can satisfy the ego of the filmâ€™s creator and the panel of choice, the audience is absolutely not happy. There is no character development at all, the plot is a distorted mess, the style is meaningless, the choice of shots is terrible, and editing is worse. By the end of the first video you will be surprised if you entered the wrong cinema, and by the end of the third video you will be asked to get rid of your sufferings. This film is an abomination.
