What about the mathematical geniuses, because of which the critics flow? BEAUTIFUL MIND was not many, in my opinion (FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserved an Oscar this year), while GOOD WILL HUNTING won several awards unfairly, <br /> <br /> First of all, this is the script. When I was in film school, I was told that “GOOD FUTURE HUNTING” is a very good example of how not to start a script, and the tutor was right. There is no opening hook in this film, and for the most part it is very slow. If you had written an unsolicited script like this, the script reader would have abandoned it on page 15. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the idea that a member of the American lower class is a kind of intelligent god, in fact doesn't sound true. Ask yourself: if he is the smartest character in the film, why did he pass his short life without noticing his abilities? Did not a single teacher from his childhood notice his gift? It is highly unlikely, since the fact that he read so much expands the liturgy. And if Will is so smart, why does he not pay attention to what is happening with the cute young boys in American prisons? <br /> <br /> But it was the casting that led most of the film. Do you want a couple of actors to play in the coolest cool Irish gangs? Let's take Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who are similar to getting Russell Crowe to play a pacifist or Charles Bronson to play a liberal kind man. I was not convinced by the dirty mouths of Damon and Affleck, when they were pushing the fact that they beat people on the chops, and could not help but think that, although they had written the script, the roles had to be handed to different actors, because Billy Bob Thornton received written Scripts for films in which he was not played, and here the same criteria were to be applied <br /> <br /> There are several positive points in this film. Robin Williams is great as a person who is trying to show Will’s potential and is also very good - this is Stellan Skarsgard, who is just one of the greatest actors of the characters who have gone beyond Europe, and, despite my previous criticism of the script, this is quite a touching part of the dialogue in the park when Williams' character explains to Will what he saw in life <br /> <br /> But I have to repeat that there are fewer advantages in this film than negatives, and I got to agree with the people who said that the hunt for good people are boring and neu editelna
