I seem to be outnumbered by this, but I found the One True Thing to be shmale, contrived and generally unpleasant. Not that acting was so bad, but the characters seemed a bit more archetypes (bad father, oh, but wait, maybe heâ€™s not hopelessly bad; perhaps there could be a solution in the end ...) Admittedly, the woman with whom I was, loved the movie, so maybe you would like it. But I did not.
