Yesterday was one of those days when we decided to go to the movies. We chose “Ik ook van Jou” more or less randomly, but it was interesting for us to look at the state of the modern Dutch film industry. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the book of Ronald Hipphart, and I must admit right away that it is not exactly one of my favorites. The film features actors who are best known in the Netherlands for taking part in serials and / or day talk shows. At least one of them (Kamerling) made quite decent material after leaving the soap world. So we decided to give this film the benefit of doubt. <br /> <br /> And what a mistake it was. This film fails on all fronts. Bad behavior (in fact, the best performance is a guinea pig, which very convincingly pretends to be dead). A flat, uninteresting story with unexplained and uninteresting parties (Why France? Why tell a story to a girl from Uganda?) Mistakes (as far as I know, black people do not need to use sunscreen, and heating systems in the Netherlands do not produce clouds of steam, as in New York Even if it looks great on film, people don’t wear T-shirts in the streets on New Year’s Eve in Northern Europe). There is one funny moment in which two little dogs are involved, that's all. <br /> <br /> So, I think, but, more importantly, it seemed that none of the people who left the cinema afterwards liked it. I heard one of them say that he was very disappointed because he liked the book very much. I did not read the book, but my advice was to be: read the book, do not watch the movie.
