Dark Harvest 3: Scarecrow: 1 out of 10: in Einstein's theory of relativity, time has the perspective of what time considers. (Or so I heard) In other words, this film feels much longer than an hour and changes. Even with fast forward (and you will reach for this forward button), it works somewhere in eternity. <br /> <br /> If you're familiar with the Lionsgate Project Greenlight's own version (here they buy a home movie, but a cool cover and insight into the horrors section of your local Wal-Mart) you won't be surprised by the complete and total lack of entertainment value inside. <br /> <br /> The reading line (I refuse to call it acting) is equally awful. This is a collection of ruthless fathers and strippers pretending to be in a film between Slitz banks. The cameraman is a drunken father who removes the quality of the film on vacation, and although the special effects are in order, the most terrible effect is the scars from breast augmentation in the naked scene. <br /> <br /> The story is horrible, wear haunted Halloween decorations by the ADHD high school students and once again reading the line (remember that this does not work more than diving to the bottom of the pool - swimming) distracts from simple words. Avoid.
