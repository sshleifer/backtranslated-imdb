This movie is so bad it's fun. I watched how Hell Ride half thought it was a comedy, although I could not understand if they really took p * ss, or if it was really a serious attempt to do something decent. I noticed that it is not listed here as a comedy, so they must be serious! In fact, we are talking about a gang of pensioners who ride motorcycles, shooting at each other and exchanging the most ridiculous and unpleasant dialogues that one can imagine. One scene inexplicably has two characters breaking the bottles over each other’s heads, and then showing each other the “Get Out of Prison” cards they made! Also check out Vinnie Jones's accent, where the hell was he supposed to be ?! Oh, and there, too, are a bunch of naked girls who, for some incomprehensible reason, seem to want nothing more than to just stop sex with these dark, crazy girls! The guy who wrote and filmed it - similar to Pee Wee Hermann with a 2000 Greeshan beard and orange tanned tanning bed - for some reason played a major role, maybe this is part of the joke, I don't know I think about it, the more I am sure that this film is a good result. He is produced by Quentin Tarantino, and perhaps he released it with humor as laughter. This is a complete scrap of Tarantino style, but just made is really very bad. Although it is very funny, and I think that in any case it can become a cult classic, be it a funny parody of the Tarantino / Rodrigues style or something very unintentionally funny. Need to see to believe.
