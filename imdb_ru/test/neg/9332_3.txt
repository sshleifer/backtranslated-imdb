Mostly an unbroken biblical impasse that lasts more than two hours. The only thing that saves this film from God's wreath (and remember that there is only one God) is an unintentionally funny dialogue and a good battle scene that appears in the film too late. Most of the two hours before the action scenes are too many; the dialogue is so inept that MST3K simply asks to fake the movie. <br /> <br /> George Saunders is absolutely terrible; one of the busiest, overly theatrical performances I've ever seen. Brynner is not much better; his tough, wooden game combined with horrible inscriptions about wisdom and cookies make Solomon rather dull and stupid. It seems that every time Brynner opens his mouth, something very wise and ridiculously strong comes out. To some extent, this is not the fault of Sanders and Brynner, because of the wacky, ridiculous dialogue and the typical biblical one-dimensional characteristic, but otherwise they made little effort. Brynner’s accent is even a bit like Schwarzenegger’s; this is not a plus. Only Lollobrigida avoids embarrassment by playing the role with greater persuasiveness and appropriateness, which corresponds to the role in such a stupid film. Describing these biblical symbols as one-dimensional would be too deserved; the characteristic is half size.
