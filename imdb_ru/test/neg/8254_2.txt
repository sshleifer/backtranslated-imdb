Unfortunately. I hired it because I thought it was the Bitter harvest (1981) that was recommended. After the terrible Patsy Kensit appeared, I checked the recommendation and discovered my mistake. Well, it's watchable, because the main characters are very sexy, but the game is terrible. Stephen Baldwin all the time looks sullen, which is understandable, given his colleague in the film. Patsy competes with Liz Hurley for the title of the most clearly useless actor on the screen?
