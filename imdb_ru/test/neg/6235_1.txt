What is the atomic bomb from the movie. The story goes nowhere and comes out of nowhere. This leaves the viewer of the theater with their hands up, saying "this is all." What happened to Redford. Once he was an honest actor. Now he thinks that he can appear on the set and make several scenes, and this is a double. Wrong. What an unemotional film. I don't want to be so cruel, but what the hell is a movie. Incredible amateur crap. If I were in this film, I would be so embarrassed that I would not show my face. I tell you that if I was involved with this film, I have a big problem. This film will go down in the annals of film making as the king of bombs, with which all others will be compared.
