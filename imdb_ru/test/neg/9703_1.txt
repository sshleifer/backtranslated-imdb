From the first frame of the film - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet, wandering, reading across the field at dawn, and thus referring to all the cliches designed to solve the phenomenon of a strong rebellious female character in a periodical drama - I knew that I was it waits to make me want to kill myself. <br /> <br /> It seemed that Joe Wright not only did not read the book, but also regretted that his shooting was not really a subtle, nuanced comedy by Jane Austen. demeanor, conducted through a sparkling, delicate social interaction in the English living rooms of the eighteenth century, but a kind of U-certificate Wuthering Heights. Thus, we looked at every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy, which took place on the street for no apparent reason, in an improper rocky landscape and often under heavy rain. Not to mention the fact that Jane Austen, in particular P & P, does not engage in passion, sexual tension or love. These are different strategies for negotiating the formation of an eighteenth century society. This was completely ignored, so the Bennetts house was a noisy, chaotic place where everyone at once shouted, ran, left their underwear on the chairs, and the pigs happily wandered around the house; club balls turn into noisy country dances a step away from a dance orgy in the style of Matrix Reloaded; and everyone says exactly what they think, without the slightest respect for propriety. <br /> <br /> Jane Austen's genius is to explore the emptiness created by a society in which no one says what they think or mean because of overwhelming respect. for decency, and the tragic difficulties of her characters arise from misunderstanding and misunderstanding caused by this silent gap. Thus, the brilliance of Jane Austen and the very factor that allows her scenes - especially in this film - to function, were completely erased. Subtlety was never anywhere in his film, donated for the drama, which was completely destroyed by the material and performances. <br /> <br /> It was so obvious that he was trying to be a * serious * movie. The humor, which is Pride and Prejudice, Austin's methodology and its appeal, was almost completely suppressed in favor of this entire melodrama, and when it was admitted, it was treated so clumsily. “Pride and Prejudice” is a serious story, in which there are serious moments, yes, but these serious moments and more important topics are not just intertwined with humor, they are embedded in it. You cannot lose the Jane Austen technique, leaving only the bare bones of the story, and expect the themes to remain. Even when you replace her methods with your own powerful mystical cinematography with artificial intelligence. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be a woman, adult, mature, sensible, and insightful. Keira Knightley played the first half of the film as a giggling schoolgirl with empty heads, and the second half as a schoolgirl with empty heads who thinks she is a tragic heroine. Elizabeth's wit, her bellicose verbal exchanges, her characteristic ability to see and laugh at all recklessness, including her own, her strength and composure, and her fantastic insight were completely lost and replaced ... what? Giggle a lot and look away? Instead of holding her head when everyone around her was losing hers, she began to cry and scream at the slightest provocation — and not really raging; no, it was an irritable hiss. And where Elizabeth Austen’s enormous strength (at least in the eyes of Austen) was her ability to maintain integrity and compliance, staying within society and maintaining impeccable propriety, Elizabeth Knightley had nothing to do with the agreement. In addition, she seemed to think that wandering barefoot through the mud in an eighteenth-century jumpsuit version made her no doubt energetic and strong, and therefore nothing in the character, as written, or in the play could withstand it. Surprisingly gentle and soft work. In search of politeness and weakness, she was skillfully picked up by Matthew Macfadyen. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, because Mr. Bennet seemed weak, useless and constantly bewildered without a wicked sense of humor and ironic detachment at the expense of the human attitude that makes Mr. Bennet so exciting and tragic. His special connection with Lizzy, as the only two rational people in the world of fools, was completely lost, not least because both were fools in the world of fools, and this completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact. Mr. Bingley was no longer kindly and well-intentioned to madness, but he was played as a complete brake for cheap laughter, and the woman who played Jane was so wildly inconsistent that she might as well not try to do anything with the character on all The script wildly hesitated between the literal pieces of Jane Austen, performed with astonishing clumsiness, and a completely modern language that would be out of place in a modern romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Just get the BBC adaptation to a DVD and save yourself from heartache.
