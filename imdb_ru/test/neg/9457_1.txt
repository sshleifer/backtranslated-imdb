Nothing but the director's youthful fantasy came to life. This “film” is nothing more than an excuse for a director / actor to play a kiss with an attractive young woman who otherwise would never give him the time of day. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, the direction does not exist, and the film stretches, while the actor / director / writer / narrator tells. Do not be fooled by the “X” rating; there is no nudity and minimal blood smell.
