I tried to look at this device, but it was so terrible that I could not torture myself like that. The performances were quite low, with the exception of Ariel. The foundation was unsurpassed in a role with which to handle with some subtlety. I studied Shakespeare and saw a lot of adaptations, and this is by far the worst I've ever seen. I have to wonder why on earth someone made this film. Shakespeare can and was perfectly adapted in many cases. This is not one of them. If you have to watch this movie, can I suggest a drinking game? Drink every time they leave the book on the original idea, and twice each time Fonda overeats. You must be pretty drunk in a very short time.
