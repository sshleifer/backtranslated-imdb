This film is on par with “Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael” for the biggest pieces of trash that have ever fallen on a silver screen. If these guys were not Adam Sandler's gay friends, this scenario would have been what it should be: like toilet paper from some big movie. I hate this film, it makes me want to hurt people. I admit that I have high standards, but, to be honest, I would prefer to see “Step 2”. The ultra sad part was when I went to IMDb and read that you, pieces of trash, actually gave this film a rating of 6.9. This is the testimony of all the mentally retarded in our society, who will go to watch horrible films that only joke for half an hour about members, farts and weeds, almost without originality. After watching this rating, I would like to offer Tyler Perry's House of Pain to all of you guys who enjoyed this movie; you will see there high-quality humor at about the same level of this disgusting filth.
