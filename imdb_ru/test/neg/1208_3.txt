This film is an 80s film that shows the viewer that while he or she tries something, they can be better than professionals. The main character, Doug, demonstrated his skill in operating a Cessna aircraft, which seemed to be equal to the ability to fly a jet plane and the ability to kill people. We all would like to have several million dollars to play ... maybe make a good investment, donate, buy a few things, but the directors of this film decided to make Iron Eagle ... never ... not twice ... not even three times; Yes, four times the “Hollywood endings” in this film are most waiting. Just when you think the movie will end after a funny final sequence, there is another stupid final sequence. Then another. Definitely a film to watch to believe ... and maybe your own to remind yourself of how great the 80s were.
