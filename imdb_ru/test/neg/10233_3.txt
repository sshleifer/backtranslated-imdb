I think my resume says it all. This MTV response to the classic TV show Candid Camera shows the type of Gen X (or Gen Y) in fake choppers, in various hats, wigs and glasses, and people in rather outlandish, though often not very interesting situations. , Example: Kennedy asked a guy to invite his parents to his "wedding". Kennedy is a bride dressed in a full wedding dress and a long wig. The “joke” is that parents immediately understand that their son is marrying a man who claims that he no longer has “pieces”. The problem is that this game is taking too long, obviously, to fill the time. And Kennedy is as funny as dead cod lying in the sun. Candid Chambers would perform three or four scenarios in the time it took Kennedy to go through this scenario, running around, constantly asking, “Do I look fat?” I admit that the show was not done for me. This was done for 12 year old pinheads who think JACKASS is the pinnacle of comedy today. So let them laugh. Thank God, the show was short.
