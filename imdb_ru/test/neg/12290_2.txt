Saw it in the video store and thought I would try. Sounded like a good story, and the cover looked good. That was it. The characters looked good, and the actor who played Noel was the most convincing, although he had no hard time in the film. I find it very difficult to give a film a bad rating, but this is one of the few that gets my book. As the film progressed, I continued to wish it to be better, but to no avail. Aesthetically it was good. The sound and lighting were good, but the game in this film killed him for me. It was like watching a poor quality soap opera. I just kept saying, “I can't believe they released this move like this.” I paused several times because of the disbelief that the acting was so bad. I want to say so much, but I just say it, everything else, for the most part, was good, it was an acting game, like the final version that really made this film
