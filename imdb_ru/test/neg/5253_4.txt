I heard a lot about Beowulf, perhaps because I'm from Romania, and most of the film was shot here in my country. And I expected a lot from this movie. In the end, I was disappointed. This is not as bad as other users said, but it is definitely bad. It's all about the monster that kills people in the 6th century castle and Lambert, who comes to kill him. Lambert is good, as he is in all his roles, but the rest of the characters suck, and the action is also not very good. Plus, perhaps the only thing that could save this film - the special effects are also very bad, the monster looks awful (not scary, but terrible). Oh, and another bad thing: music. The film tries, and manages to create an atmosphere of the 6th century. But all the sequences of actions are represented on rock music, which is very, very bad. I mean, the action about rock works great in a movie like Charlie's Angels, where it's the perfect way to shoot your action. But here it was a very bad idea. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10.
