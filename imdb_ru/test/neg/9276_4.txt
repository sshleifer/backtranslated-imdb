The last entry in the “By buses” trilogy tells how ordinary people go about their business in Wales. I'm sure the franchise could go on, but Harold Pinter complained that because of the scenarios, he looked bad compared to him, and nothing more was done. <br /> <br /> In fact, less than two minutes passed before we received the first batch of sexism - a woman running behind the bus discovers that her breasts fall out of a dress for no reason. However, this at least makes Stan laugh (Reg Varney), but what is wrong? He and Jack (Bob Grant) spend the entire film with a loud laugh, almost without provocation. It seems that they urinate, watching as the paint dries. <br /> <br /> As before, the only funny element is the really funny Stephen Lewis, funny as Blakey. However, he is on his own with a stupid dated script that even wastes such top-notch talents like Wilfrid Brambell and Henry McGee. Nevertheless, it seems that only Lewis understands how to calculate precarious material, twisting laughter from even the weakest lines. Describing how her daughter fell into the river, Stan's mom complains: "I hope she is not polluted." “Well, it will be now,” Blakey jokes. <br /> <br /> In the plot - if he really is - sees Stan, who is thirsting for a young girl, but constantly suffering from her domineering mother. I'm sure you will agree that this is a recipe for a fun split on the side, and whether it's riding a storm boat or swimming baths, the exploits of Stan and Mavis always give the same result ... disgusting boredom. Later conquests include Maria, the Italian stereotype, and full-time employee. Even Stan's mom gets one night, and Stan gently reminds her to "put on your tin boxes." <br /> <br /> When one of the comic “high points” is Arthur Mallard, listening to Oliva trying to find light. switch to darkness (“I cannot find it”) and, having thought that she speaks about sex, one can understand why this work reaches the highest levels of literary sophistication. In fact, why I didn't get into the Top 100 BFI films, I don't know. <br /> <br /> Other delicate machinations involving ribs include Oliva (Anna Karen), breaking her glasses. I do not know what is more surprising, poor predictability of the installation or underdeveloped returns. Short-sighted Olivia follows the man in the kilt into the men's room, thinking that he is a woman in a skirt. The next shot shows how she got out of Blake and redirected to the ladies. And it's all. Then she finds herself in the bed of another man and receives an order from his wife. And ... no, this is also all that is needed for this scene. <br /> <br /> When the last time a bus leave movie was shown on British television, the program failed. In fact, it was a blessed relief.
