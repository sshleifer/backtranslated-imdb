Hitchcock is a great director. Ironically, I basically find his films a waste of time watching. I admire Hitchcock on a purely visual and technical level. <br /> <br /> Positive first. Hitchcock invented the concept of a probe chamber. A curious eye that can hide or search for information. This is not a completely new visual grammar, but then it was revolutionary. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Hitchcock has greatly improved the thriller and the film “The Chase”. He has an economical style and he always thinks about the audience. He gives them regular thrills, regular pushes of humor and regular shocks. In short, he anticipates the basic needs of the audience and plays them like a violin. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic needs of a person are mostly stupid. Food, sex, the thrill of danger and a little comedy. Hitcock satisfies all these needs on the screen, except for food, which, judging by its size, it serves off-screen. <br /> <br /> It is this indulgence in front of an audience that sabotages most of his films. The second drawback is that most of Hitchcock’s camera work and visual grammar are now commonplace. What makes his films watchable is the simple saving of his stories, the intelligence of his camera work and his ability to create intense fighting. <br /> <br /> So, “Diversant”. This is a carefree romp in the spirit of "39 steps." He jumps from sequence to sequence until he completes Hitchcock's typical graduation performance. <br /> <br /> At the emotional level, the relationship between the leaders is not up to par with Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll in the “39 steps”. Therefore, the whole story lacks a certain amount of energy. The plot just rumbles like a car, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes. And the new scenes only bring us closer to the end, since it is unclear whether the lead is the hero’s salvation from the police, from the villains or from his actions to prevent planned sabotage. <br /> <br /> There is the usual Hitchcock flawed logic. For example, a guy with handcuffs frees himself by using a car fan belt, etc. (Why doesn't he just leave in the car? Of course, the handcuffs are not so strict? After all, he can swim in them!) /> If you need a better propaganda film from Hitchcock’s 40s, I would advise you to watch Foreign Correspondant. Both of them are stupid chase movies with a catchy finale, but Foreign Correspondant makes extensive use of umbrellas and tulips, which Spielberg perfectly plucks in the Minority Report. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 - Good set pieces. In addition, however, there is nothing to sink their teeth.
