I just went to see this movie with a friend. I quickly looked and read a brief summary and thought it sounded interesting. We left the films without feeling very confident if we didn't like it. <br /> <br /> The game was good enough, and the connection with the characters was fine. The main character I thought acted very much like someone like Van Helsing. Yes, it was quite fascinating. <br /> <br /> But the plot seemed to me as if it were used in other films. The script was a little weak, I'm not sure why every time something bad happens, the main character says “Oh my god” every time. <br /> <br /> The special effects worked well, but (sorry for this spoiler) the main monster in the main climax reminded me a lot of Balrok from the Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film was fine, but I felt that was already done. Go and see, buy all the money, but don’t expect too much.
