It is really easy to broil, fry, beat and otherwise burn this film for all its abundant flaws. This was done by high school students and teachers and the whole community; it shows! Of course, I could study the script, which is just ridiculous. A monster made out of the rubbish of a growing Californian city begins to eat garbage and take garbage cans all over the city. Soon this huge beast with wings no less begins to destroy buildings and even plays "beauty and monster" with a young schoolgirl. Fortunately for her, there is a gang of guys, her former boyfriend, nicknamed "Penguin", and the city drunk to help her. Direction is awful, production values ​​are just awful, actions don't exist, and the pace is slow. The film is difficult to survive - full. However, as they say, this is also a miracle of the film, given that this thing was created by the whole community. You can see all the collective efforts from actors, mayors, firefighters and police officers to used images of the terrain. I was also struck by all the local businesses, which at the end of the film are credited with helping to finance or in any way contribute to this film. When you look at the film from this point of view, it is a really great achievement. I knew nothing about this before I sat down and looked. Now that I have learned something about this, I am impressed. But do not be mistaken - I do not have ... NO ... desire to relive it.
