Useless money back, which has nothing to add, except for abominations, this is a certain case of sloppy seconds for Robocop. The stunning, ruthless and tired mess of the sequel of Irwin Kershner is watchable and even slightly entertains in a dubious, unpleasantly dirty way, but there is practically nothing original, original, emotional, mental or exciting in it. Instead, we have another empty blockbuster spectacle, the only reason for the existence of which, it seems, is nausea of ​​the viewer by ruthless violence, which is much more brainless gratuitous than anything in the original. Omni Consumer Products, which made the original cyborg Robocop, turned into a more totalitarian force than ever the second time, with suspicious Nazi banners, attack aircraft, and hired tanks at the end; As for the anonymous Old Man (Daniel O'Herlihi), he is a less benevolent defender and rather the repulsive type of Mr. Burns, surrounding himself with retarded servants who sincerely believe that they put the brain of a murderous psychopath on a completely new Robocop 2 body - a good idea. Yes, and the first Robocop looks somewhere in the midst of all this mess, although you wonder what on earth such a good actor like Peter Weller has seen in the script. Droll, Tom Noonan, has nothing to work like a villain, and Nancy Allen is heavily wasted as a partner of Robocop. There are some fun moments everywhere; for example, the “Magnavolt” commercial, but this is a bad continuation of a truly magnificent original.
