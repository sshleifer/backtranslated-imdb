Let me give you some tips, guys, if you are going to watch this movie, just to see how many unattractive characters are killed in a dozen different ways, then you will like this movie because everyone dies a horrible death, except for blood. nothing else is needed. <br /> <br /> where to start: - the heroes do not appeal to the audience, because there are no prehistories for them, because I did not feel a connection with any of them, in fact, I didnâ€™t like any of them, and I was so tired of them that by the end of the film I was rooting for a disfigured creep to kill them all (which, by the way, he did) <br /> <br /> - it does not work well; I mean, I did not understand, take, for example, an Asian guide, he first spoke perfect English, then, after their little sunken tourist boat, he somehow felt the accent, and then switched to normal English . br /> <br /> - one of the worst endings for horror: (if you can call it that) after the monster / mutant man kills almost everyone, the last two remaining idiots kill him, or they thought so! the monster / man eventually dies when a beauty and a geek thrust a pole into his heart / nick (it was hard to say), and he probably died right in front of them (within reach), but later he comes back and kills them (wtf ), I mean, why he just did not kill them when he was near them. Arghhhh! I mean, he was too backward, as if the writer did not know where he wanted the story to go (or he missed a few minutes and 80 minutes, so he added a few more delayed turns to the film so that people could get shit on 80 minutes instead of 75 minutes. <br /> <br /> I did not understand why they simply did not kill this damn thing while she was unconscious, but simply left her, like idiots, and left so that he could return and kill them. The only reason I gave him 4 was because of the blood, which was actually the only schuh, for which I watched this movie until the end, in order to watch how they are all killed. (No, I'm serious)
