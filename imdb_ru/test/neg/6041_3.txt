Webs starts in Chicago: Present, when four electrics: Dean (Richard Greco), Ray (Richard Iwood), Sheldon (Jeffrey Douglas) and Junior (Jason Jones) are going to turn off the electricity from an unused building that is planned to be demolished. When they search for appropriate cables and stuff, they encounter a set of doors that, according to buildings, should not be present, because they have to be curious and make the doors open to look and find a room full of computers and science equipment. When they fiddle with some buttons, a portal opens into a parallel universe, Dean and Junior accidentally “fall” with Ray and Sheldon after them in search of their friends. Unfortunately, they all ended up on exactly parallel Earth, which was captured by mutant spiders, who either devour humans or turn them into mutant soldiers, with which she defends herself and does everything she wants them to be. In a desperate desire for survival, they team up with the last few remaining people, including the original inventor of the portal Dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who says that with the help of our electric boys, he can (yes can) build another portal to back home ... <br /> <br /> Edited and directed by David Wu, I thought Webs was pretty shitty, he was as simple and understandable as he really was. The scenario of Grenville Cayce and Robinson Young is ridiculous, at least ridiculous, and there are holes in the plot from which you can drive a tank, for example, this film really tries to suggest that several mutant spiders are no more than a couple of people in size captured the whole world? How did they do it? If this parallel Earth was the same as ours, where the hell was the army? Police? All our weapons? Some fragile-looking spiders against literally billions of people ?! The whole erroneous, stupid and straightforward concept constantly bothered me throughout the entire film. Let us not forget that there is an interdimensional portal to the parallel Earth in the basement of most buildings that have been there without interference for decades and remain in perfect working condition, right? Then there is a nuclear reactor the size of a briefcase, the fact that one electrician can get him to work completely accidentally when he randomly presses a few buttons in a room, which probably had a hundred times dozens of pieces of equipment and what about an amazingly thoughtful guy, who sets an explosive trap at his base, without telling anyone, but what if one of his comrades worked and found that their homemade bomb had exploded into pieces? You wouldn't like it, would you? What about food? Do they grow their own in small plant areas? I could talk about how ugly, poorly designed and poorly written websites can last a whole day, but that doesn’t bother me. The character is cliché and annoying, like the film as a whole, which obviously does not help. The only half decent thing I can say about Webs is that it is short and it moves at a fair pace, but when all is said and done, it is still crap. <br /> <br /> Director Wu has to take most of the Blame here, for a start the film looks cheap and the editing that he is credited with is terrible. There are many annoying inappropriate slow shots that come from nowhere, fighting scenes are almost identical and become incredibly boring very quickly. He uses this very annoying fast-cutting technique along with a little movement of the old sharp camera, now I don’t know about anybody else, but I hate this editing style, as it looks like just an incoherent mess. In fact, I don’t know a single person who would like such things, and I’m puzzled why directors think people love them so much. Forget about any blood, just a few shot wounds to zombie spider soldiers, and they still don't have red blood, so this has nothing to do with the reality in my mind. <br /> <br /> Networks were created for -TV, an American science fiction channel, I think it looks as cheap, low-budget and fast as you would expect. It's all so soft, forgettable, flat and boring. The special effects are far from special, and the spiders lack imagination when they finally unfold. The game was fine, considering that everything else was so bad, and I still can not believe that the sweater in which Gryko was wearing. <br /> <br /> The web is shit, I can't say anything good except me. I watched the worst movies, and this is the only reason why I don’t give him 1 star, and a quick glance at the IMDb user ratings for websites confirms that I already knew that he has more “1” votes than anyone the other is a very good reason why ...
