There is no better way to describe the HORRIBLE experience that can be watched over mom. Mia: Hitler must be looking up, saying to pseudo-director Phyllida Lloyd: “Are you a monster, what have you done?” <br /> <br /> Everything about the film is not that one Simply?? Wrong! Even his success, which is inexplicable. I can understand when these lousy parody films, such as Epic Movie, make their minimum share of money and make a profit just because they are cheap (of course they are!). But when something like Mamma Mia earns $ 450 million worldwide, you think: “What the hell is wrong with the world?” <br /> <br /> And to think that we have Meryl Streep alone of the greatest living actresses of the world, in this? What was she thinking about? “I need money,” she might say. Well, then sell one of your grandchildren, even that will be less embarrassing. This does not mean that Meryl is good in a terrible movie. She is also catastrophic! When she sings, although she has vocals, it's funny. Worse than her only Pierce Brosnan. He used to be James Bond. Now he sings Abba in purple spandex during the credits of the worst movie ever. Indeed? And when I mention Abba, I have nothing against the band and their music. Although it does not help them when the actors start singing (poorly), dance (worse), and then they join in additional ones (they appear from nowhere! Often!) In order to present one terrible musical sequence after another. You want to cry when the music starts. And I love musicals! But this is the first genre in which you PRAY for real silence. <br /> <br /> I could go on. This list can go on forever. You can write a Stephen King novel with a complete list of errors in this film. <br /> <br /> To summarize: go and see! Indeed! You must be a witness to understand! And since this is a huge success, who cares if he earns a few more dollars from you? And you do not like that you are selling your soul to the devil. Meryl did it before. For all of humanity. And now the world must end, because we have done the greatest evil, and we must be destroyed.
