Dorothy Provine does the opposite here: she continues to grow and grow. However, I did not find any subtext. "The Incredible Shrinking Man" and other similar films of that period were parables about radiation, nuclear war and other horrors. The growth of the Provine is the result of an incompetent computer / robot. <br /> <br /> And who controls this computer besides Lou Costello! I like some of his films with Bad Abbott. But, although it’s a pretty bad movie, it’s fine without him. And Gail Green is a great foil. <br /> <br /> Green plays a pompous city. He is the father of Provin. He intends to be elected mayor. Therefore, when his beloved daughter has problems, he leaves her. He definitely does not abandon her, but abandons his battle against her longtime fan of Costello. <br /> <br /> This is pretty implausible: Costello is a local garbage collector. <br /> <br /> is minimal. And the subplot involving the military is lame to the extreme.
