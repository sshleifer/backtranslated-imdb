Well, I saw this film during the last film festival in San Sebastian. The reaction to this was ... let's say, as ridiculous as the film, unintentionally. It happened that they showed a copy with horribly wrong Spanish subtitles. They seemed to translate from Chinese into English, and then into Spanish. It was all confusing, gender changes were changing (girls seemed boys and boys seemed girls), and my friends and I remember excellent features ... but because they were so absurd. In general, the film is not very good, but if they ever show it on TV and you have nothing to do, and if you want to laugh (again, not so much at the film), then continue: “Visible secret” is your film .
