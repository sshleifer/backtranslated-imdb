... a film appears that manages to be absolutely terrible from the initial titles to the studio logo marked at the end of the final credits. It was such a film - the kind that you can’t stop watching for fear of missing a moment of its downward quality. <br /> <br /> Forget about the low budget, as evidenced by a slow, monotonous initial sequence, showing security agents running near the presidential motorcade without a crowd, without movement or a place that can be distinguished. Forget about the erratic logic necessary even for the real plot to seem believable. Forget that Roy Shader provides some of the roughest conversations, while at the same time making no secret of his shame. <br /> <br /> This swan is walking awfully, being bombarded by a score that is simply ridiculous and seems to be edited by the third class. At the same time twisting the scenarios to hide the most difficult part in shooting the presidential plotline on the cheap: make it seem presidential. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I sleep for a while on the last drum, and when I woke up, I ran it back so as not to miss a single agonizing shot. Try this drinking game: take a picture every time you see that it clearly plays along with another much better film. You too will fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Since “The Man” with Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy has not seen such a delightfully unprofitable project. I can hand out copies as Christmas gifts. Zero stars. A thousand laughs
