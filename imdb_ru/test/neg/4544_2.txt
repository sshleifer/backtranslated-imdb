Woof! Quite boring, and they could just as well remove it in black and white, it was so colorless. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a scrolling text explaining cryogenics and asking if God or Satan is behind it. There are several protests near the cryogenic laboratory. Some people rob a bank, and many of the robbers and guards are shot and wounded. The father of one of the robbers (I think) arranges the freezing of his son. Initially, there are many jumps from scene to scene, when we introduce the characters, and we do not know how they relate. <br /> <br /> Electricity is turned off, and uniforms containing frozen people are struck by lightning, and they appear. like a zombie. They all wear silver Mylar suits, and their skin is dark green and wrinkled (I have no idea why they look so bad - freezing obviously did not preserve their appearance), and they have silver eyes. They walk, killing people, sometimes they rush like zombies, sometimes they move like normal people. <br /> <br /> Linda Blair appears from time to time, towards which goal I am not quite sure. I think her character works in a cryogenic laboratory, but she is not very important for the plot, and her role is very small. <br /> <br /> The film ends with frames with text labels that tell us what happened to the characters around, which is pretty silly.
