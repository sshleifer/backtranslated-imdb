I am so disappointed. After three years of waiting for replays / DVDs with the original masterpiece of the Dark Place series, I could not wait for this series. The first episode has just ended, and I am shocked. Everything that was great in Darkplace is erased here. Worst introduction: canned laughter. it takes the starting point and just makes it almost imperceptible. (one joke about how Garthâ€™s eyes impregnated the audience was good ... the rest I can hardly remember ...) seems like a bad quality "Knowing me, knowing you." I hope this improves as the series continues, otherwise I will be seriously disappointed. back to the "Dark Place ..." <br /> <br /> "You are the most compassionate person I have ever known. And I know God ..."
