Guy Richie is to blame. The end of the 90s, when Ritchie captured the Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels cliché, marked the beginning of a series of pitiful gangster films from which the genre never recovered. Unfortunately, Rise of the Footsoldier - the true story of the Essex nut Carlton Lich - is unlikely to reverse this trend. Despite a decent lead role from Hartnett, the film falls prey to too familiar East End stereotypes. They are either busy carrying off someone's brains, or they are fucking a poorly dressed blonde. <br /> <br /> From a scary football hooligan in the eighties to a key figure in the criminal underworld in the nineties, futtsoldery soldiers marked the rise of the Lich through the ranks of bandits. Leaving the terraces for nightclubs, Leach becomes a bouncer, where he is given a blank check to drive out anyone. Here he meets with the infamous gang leaders Pat Tate (Fairbrass) and Tony Tucker (Stone) and begins to realize that gang fighting is not what it takes to be. <br /> <br /> I had the ridiculous script of director-writer Julian Gilby “Join the Points,” since each sentence seems to start with “Am I going to give a damn?” or “You fucking ??” or, in some cases, “So, then I just went“ fackin ”??”, usually ending with the obligatory “caaaant!” bloody denouement with a shotgun in the face, in triplicate. <br /> <br /> Gilbie’s use of the classic gangster narrative of rise and fall is not what Futsolder dooms to the obscurity of the big screen. Not the fact that halfway through the film annoyingly pushes the Lich to the side of events, the culmination of which is the infamous shooting of Tate and Tucker. This is Gilby’s nauseous appetite for keen violence that destroys the film; whether it is a brick in the face or an ax in the head during a vicious attack on a train, all this is unnecessarily delayed. Footsoldier is not so much a blow as it leaves an insult and, more importantly, takes away two hours of your life from you, which you will not return ...
