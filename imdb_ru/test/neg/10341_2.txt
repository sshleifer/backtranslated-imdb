I attended this movie. It was made with clich√©s and very unfunny jokes and machinations. I think that other comments were made by people who must have worked on the film or were members of the family of actors. I am amazed that this film cost 3-4 million dollars without real stars. Where did the budget go? This obviously did not go to the authors for rewriting. A good idea to count on the success of Big Fat Greek Wedding, but the main thing to miss. There was a small or some spark between the main characters, and the incitement incident was at best a little flimsy. The direction was boring and looked like a student film. <br /> <br /> I don't even know what that means. This is a real saying. I never heard that.
