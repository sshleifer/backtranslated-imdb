technically, this film would have everything: decent actors, a good landscape, with no obvious signs of lack of budget, celebrities like Richard Santborough. the plot summary also sounded promising, offering a satire on the stupid bureaucracy and on the simple people who outwitted it. <br /> <br /> However, this never brought results. the plot is just too illogical. throughout the film no man does any sensible thing. crazy politicians, ridiculous soldiers, brainless villagers - everyone just fusses from one incredible situation to another. What they all do is never meaningful in a context that goes beyond the current scene. <br /> <br /> Of course, such a film must be absurd and exaggerated. however, it must also have at least one occasion to indicate the madness that separates the city in the middle. in fact, there are (at least) two attempts that unfortunately fail: the main character, who seems to have no idea what happens to him, and the “writer” who sometimes breaks jokes which may be an audience of only 12 year olds who find me funny. <br /> <br /> What struck me the most was the fact that the film tries to be funny all the time, but it never made me laugh. I have seen some bad "funny" films, but so far each has had at least 2 or 3 good laughs. so in this sense, “puckoon” is really wonderful. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie with a comparable plot, see Brazil. do not waste your time on "Puckoon".
