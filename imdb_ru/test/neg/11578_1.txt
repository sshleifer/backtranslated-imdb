I am currently watching this film, and I have no doubt that I am considering it now. The game is funny. Half the cast should be retired porn actors and get kicked off. You could imagine the quality of the action. <br /> <br /> The graph in contrast to everything I've ever seen. I think there are puppet shows with more believability. They can not even afford the blanks for the guns, which they shoot a pitiful excuse for monsters. Perhaps I should also point out how incredibly impressed I am with the number of “bullets” that their pistols can hold. <br /> <br /> If I were asked to summarize the film, I would say that at a local county fair someone joked a group of completely hopeless people, hit them on the island, added unnecessarily intense music and allowed 6 years to do editing. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I cannot formulate a possible explanation for why this film was released, burned to DVD and costs $ 6 from my local video store for one day. In any case, I gained a favor by learning that I am much smarter than all the parties involved in this film. <br /> <br /> I hate this film with great intensity. What for? If I knew the captain, I would like to know ....
