!!!! SMART SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> With the exception of the TERMINATOR and the FULL REVIEW, I do not think that Arnieâ€™s action films / adventure films are anything special. They are certainly better than his comedies, but that says little. The problem I faced in all of his action movies is that they are bloated and devoid of any morality. <br /> <br /> Moral? I mentioned in my review of TERMINATOR 2 a scene where a good guy Terminator knocks his kneecaps from a special forces team. Should we think that because the hero cripples people doing their work, rather than killing them, we will somehow admire him? This is a problem with ERASER, when the character of James Cann is revealed as a traitor in the American Marshal. Arnie's character, John Kruger, runs with a witness whom he defends, but in several later episodes Kruger kills a rather large number of marshals working with the villain. How do we understand they were all traitors too? Of course, many of them were honest people who tried to stop Kruger because the bad guy told them that Kruger was a traitor? A rather unpleasant idea that Kruger killed several people who tried to really defend the law. <br /> <br /> Despite the one hundred million dollars, special effects are not so impressive. Look at the scene where Kruger lets go of the jet wing and scrambles to put on a parachute. In the course of the action, it becomes obvious that this is a stuntman who performs a free fall sequence while Arnie is in the studio in front of the blue screen. ERASER is also a film in which there are unnecessary CGI with the participation of alligator-killers, and not only unnecessary CGI, but also unconvincing CGI. There are also several holes in the plot, as in the opening scene with the participation of several defense witnesses that the crowd encountered. Kruger opens the trunk of the car, pulls out a pair of bodies and kindles a fire, throwing out a crowd of smell. Kruger then rearranges the dental records using the computer of the pair he saved. It would be logical to do this, but will ALL the paired dental records be stored on a computer? Most importantly, should we believe that the marshal department of the United States keeps a freezer full of bodies for such events? <br /> <br /> So, you go, Arnie's typical thriller, long on unlikely scenes and lack of intelligence? and it is interesting to note that ERASER did not receive large profits from the box office, as the production costs almost exceeded the potential audience. After ERASER, Arnie did not start doing business more at the box office, with the exception of TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF MACHINES, which was a film about events, and it would be interesting to know whether he will be remembered as a politician and not as a movie star
