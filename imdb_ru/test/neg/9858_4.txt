This documentary was not made neither professionally nor objectively. It was all played out like IBM's conspiracy theory to win the match, just to make some money. Garry Kasparov has a problem with ego. He was bloated before the match, and when he lost, he did not like it. I remember playing chess against computers back in the 80s, and it was not so difficult to win. Over time, I started to lose and I did not like it. Today, I just don't play against computers anymore, because they are too good. Moreover, the games are uninteresting and do not have attractiveness for human games, where both sides are more likely to make mistakes and open up exciting possibilities for the game. This documentary continues to show us images of Turk, an ancient chess automat, which man really drove. From the very beginning to the end, we tend to believe that IBM literally hid a GM man in the back of his computer the size of a cabinet. I’m a computer scientist and I’m offended by the fact that just because Harry lost, IBM must have cheated. I know how computers play chess. This is not a magic or a mystery. They can be trained, have an enormous amount of knowledge in chess, and they certainly see positions and opportunities in unprecedented detail compared to people. No wonder Deep Blue won. Perhaps at the time it was. If this happened today, given the constantly growing computing power of the machines; people are unlikely to blink. If today the car could not even play with GM, people would think that the program is weak.
