To say that this film is worse than suffocation from its own diarrhea is a magnanimous understatement. The only thing that is more pitiful than this reprehensible piece of trash in the movie is the schmuck, with which producers pay for registering a bunch of accounts to post a fake rating. <br /> <br /> If you look at a poorly acting, unintentional, an excerpt from a film about a sloth from a guni kills people in a way that completely ignores all laws of physics your idea of ​​a good movie and then knock yourself out. <br /> <br /> No carbon-based life form with a functioning occipital lobe of millions of aeons would consider this film scary or interesting.
