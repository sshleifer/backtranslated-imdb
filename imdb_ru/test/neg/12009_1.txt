Whenever someone tries to tell me that he thinks the film is the worst ever (and usually it's some kind of film that is “cool” to hate, like, for example, “Manos, Hands of Destiny” or The Avengers "), I ask them:" Is this what a comedy about an orphan who is constantly trying to kill adults? Does anyone say “I would rather eat a piece of shit” in this movie? <br /> <br /> This film is TOO infantile and moronic for adults, and Too strong and irresponsible for children. Is there a lot of money from the Beavis and Butthead demographers to make a series of such films? There is a problem child 3, but I have not seen him. I'd rather eat poop.
