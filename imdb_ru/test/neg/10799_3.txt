First of all, I read the comments of the director and I want to thank him for his opinion. It was always interesting to me that the creators of the films criticized on MST3K felt that their work was destroyed (not to mention how Best Brains acquired the rights). However, comments from Rissi interest me as far as Sci-Fi could cut a movie to make it look different (now I think I can rent it from NetFlix). Of course, I have never seen an uncut version of this film, not related to MST3K, but even seeing it on MST3K, I never thought of it as a bad movie or something that cannot be seen (although I thought it was there was a rather funny episode with MST3K). ); of course not, as Pearl describes, “terrible skin peeling”; not seeing such as "Future War" and "Hobgoblins." <br /> <br /> As for the cutting of the film, this was done earlier on MST3K at least once. Case in point: a film by Jo Don Baker, Mitchell, in which the plot with the participation of the character John Saxon cut out in version MST3K, but Joel and Bots comment on the absence of Saxon after his appearance at the beginning of the film. If I can imagine the criticism of MST3K, if you need to cut the film for reasons of time, fine, but be fair to the film that is being cut (even if it’s a lousy movie like Mitchell). Of course, such criticism is rather meaningless with the end of the show, but I think that this aspect was unfair. But in any case, if this is so with Soultaker, it makes me sympathize. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I argue that this is a pleasant episode of MST3K, although the film itself, even the version that was “hacked” in MST3K, is far from terrible. <br /> <br /> As a last note, by a strange coincidence or perhaps the case of Synchronicity, I accidentally watched Hudsaker’s proxy on the day Soultaker came out, and don't you know, the guy who played father Vivian Schelling had a small role in this film; one of his three credited roles, in fact. I thought it was a bit strange.
