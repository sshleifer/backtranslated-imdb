This painfully sweet and painstaking 5-spot commercial is definitely not among the best films of Harold Lloyd. Jokes are rare and mostly not inspired. Saccharin Romance is plentiful. Installation requires forever, like Lloyd, an unconventional but incredibly amiable, country doctor makes a detour, bringing some sunshine into the lives of children, the elderly and puppies. It's like the 1922 Patch Adams version. Ugh. 4/10.
