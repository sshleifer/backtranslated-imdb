Larry Bishop is 60 years old, he is dirty and not very good in this film, but he is like a drug for women between the ages of twenty and twenty. <br /> <br /> Many films claim that they are sexist, but if any film deserves this title, it is this one. <br /> <br /> I can't even count how many boobs there were shown in this film, probably more than the hours that Larry Bishop spends writing the script. <br /> <br /> The scenario is ridiculous, the bishop and his gang argue, ride bikes, have parties, have sex, kill people, and the next day they argue, ride bikes, have parties, have sex, kill people and on the third day, you understand. <Br /> <br /> I like Eric Balfour, and considering what he had to work with, he coped well with the role of Comanche. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is about Larry Bishop’s Pistolero, which is so one-dimensional that it’s not even funny. <br /> <br /> He is also a terrible actor, and obviously he never intended to play the main role himself, but everyone he asked said no, so what should he do? As soon as he realized that he himself would play a leading role, he probably rewrote the script to correct more girls. <br /> <br /> Although visually it looks beautiful, at least the Biker scenes and Eric Balfour are not so bad, this film is just a big mess. <br /> <br /> I hope never to see Larry Bishop in front of the camera again.
