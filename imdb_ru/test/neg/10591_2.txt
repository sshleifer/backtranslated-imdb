I had the misfortune to watch this last night on the BBC, I guess I was the only spectator. From the very beginning there was something completely wrong in the film, after a few minutes of viewing I managed to understand what it was. CINEMA WAS BAD! Not bad in a good way, like a wolf pack or a Seagal film, just plain old bad stuff. <br /> <br /> Why did this turn into a movie? I saw several episodes of the series and thought it was all right, but I only saw repetitions of this because they did it. <br /> <br /> I spent most of the film trying to figure out what the story was and by the end I didn’t become wiser. It seems that at some point I remember a character, maybe Farina mentions that a squad of mods can get to where ordinary cops can't. “Place” turns out to be a “club”, one of the most difficult places to visit, maybe it was a student night? At that moment I lost track of the plot, or perhaps there was no plot, and the film was simply cut from various remnants of other TV series remakes. <br /> <br /> Was it an action movie? I do not remember laughter. <br /> <br /> In general, there wasn’t a real scene in this film that could kidnap someone like Seymour Hoffman as a bad guy. With him, Ribisi would have someone to bounce off.
