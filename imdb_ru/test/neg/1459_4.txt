It is difficult to decide what to say about it. This is not really, one hundred percent bad. Although the film in the film is unspeakably bad, it must be polite, but missed a mile. However, I am sure it is intentional. Danny Aiello here is quite adequate and more or less gives him a pitiful character. Dayan Cannon was good in a small role. Clotilde Kuro was an impressive last twenty-year-old girl. And Linda Carlson had a brave topless scene, which she shot well. <br /> <br /> So it’s not really bad, but I don’t believe that this scene reaches its goals. In general, it is probably worth passing.
