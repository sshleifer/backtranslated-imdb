It is said that this is the first Polish Western scriptwriter and director Peter Uklansky. In this film, known in the USA as “THE MAN'S KITCHEN OF A MAN”, this film uses strange visual effects telling a story in which there is little dialogue. Val Kilmer plays the corpse, and some scenes through his dead eyes. Some awkward visual situations are actually funny in a painful form. My favorite is a young man who builds the gallows, chops off one of his fingers and actually hangs himself, checking the strength of the rope. A cowboy, known only as a “stranger” (Karel Rodin), finds a dead person (Kilmer), whom he considers to be a wanted person. He takes it to the nearest town to pick up the reward. As a result, he loses a corpse and a potential reward in a game of chance with a drunken sheriff of the city (Bohuslav Linda), and several residents of the city rebel against him when he has a connection with a bartender (Katarzyna Figura). He manages to avoid certain death and leads a small squad in the dangerous "pursuit of a wild goose." In one scene, a stranger seeks a wound on his head, burning with gunpowder and a match. The corpse is rotting, chained to the joke, when the sheriff learns that there will be no reward. This film, also known as SUMMER LOVE, has a haunting theme song, sung by John Davidson. However, this western is like a train wreck. There is something that tells you not to look ... but you do.
