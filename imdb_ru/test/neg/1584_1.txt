I am not surprised when I find the comments of users for this film full of nonsense, for example, this film "[proves] that when it is predetermined, love will find a way out." I start in such a way as not to criticize a particular reviewer, but because this quotation so typifies hyperbolic non-critical molasses, which was poured over this film even before it hit the cinema. Even the best films do not “prove” and are not intended. The best films entertain and excite the viewer, and the “English Patient” fails on both criteria. <br /> <br /> I remember very well the promotion of the English Patient Studio: “From the producers of Amadeus and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” he announced majestically. An ignorant or careless listener may skip the key word “producers” in this insincere statement and mistakenly link the director of “The English Patient”, completely inappropriate, to a really great director Milos Forman. Such a comparison is insulting to the memory of Mr. Foreman. <br /> <br /> Although Michael Ondaye’s novel, on which the film is based, is good, it is regrettable that the film could not capture any quality. books in any way. In addition to the elements of the plot that seem similar by coincidence, the film is a little like a novel. <br /> <br /> Despite the fears that began when I heard this shameless promotion, I went to see this movie in the theater. When he began to unfold, I realized that the rendering of the original magic of the novel did not succeed, that the actors knew their words, but not their characters, and that their characters were flat, dull and uninteresting. The film was a complete parody of Ondaya's novel and a completely stillborn cinematic artifact with the worst description. <br /> <br /> Those who look at this film are very inclined to speak with adjectives like “sweeping” and “great” and “hypnotic”. Well, it is not. In fact, even the wonderful novel Ondatie cannot be described as "wide" or "great." This can be described as "magical" and "hypnotic" - but these are the qualities that the film could not convey at all. As if Minghella, as a reader, completely missed what was valuable in the novel, and could only pull out a pale, skeletal version on celluloid, a version that not only missed the spirit of the story, but also focused on the wrong characters. He produced a cinematic transliteration in which not only did the metaphors of history not respect, but also did not realize them. <br /> <br /> Minghella diverted central attention from Hana and Kip and placed him on Patient and Catherine. Clifton, thereby missing the narrative trail of the novel, as well as its "essence". <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas put on a restless, boring, unattractive, unemotional acts that were clearly intended to convey an excellent, passionate, passionate love affair with the audience, but in fact he gave only an inexplicable, careless connection between two flat, shallow, uninteresting adulterers. Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and uninteresting, and none of the performances gave the viewer a great emotional response, clearly intended for Minghella’s grandiose and bloated presentation. <br /> <br /> “The gorgeous, broad, David-Ling-like” qualities, which many illegible reviewers of this stupid film like to refer to, simply do not. The comparison with David Lin ("Doctor Zhivago") clearly offends another great director. Take, for example, the "Patient" sandstorm, which is undoubtedly the one in which these "great, broad" qualities were thought to have lived (or should have lived): the sandstorm is not great - it is not even convincing . The subsequent burial of the characters in the car and their appearance after the storm, which undoubtedly should have affected the viewer dramatically and emotionally, is completely devoid of drama or emotion - in fact, because it was so obviously weak, it had comedic air, where comedy is clearly out of place . <br /> <br /> This movie failed. It failed as a translation of the novel, and it failed as a film. It seemed to be the “anointed conductor of the Oscars” of the year (joining an excessive pipe like Kramer vs. Kramer or Tenderness Conditions). One can only thank God for the fact that even the acadia, moved by the hype, made good sense to present the award for the best actress Frances MacDormand for her really worthy performance in the really excellent film “Fargo”. The performing "English patient" did not have a single performance that was neither embarrassingly terrible excessive action (Willem Defoe), nor truly forgetful, mediocre action (Fiennes and Scott Thomas). <br /> <br /> Why this is not the essence of the film keeps the covenant of fanatical (and obviously tasteless) devotees, will remain a mystery. Fortunately, the sands of time will forever bury this mediocrity of the film, and, fortunately, he does not have the strength to dig himself out.
