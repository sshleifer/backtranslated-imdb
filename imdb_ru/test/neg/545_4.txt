The idea of ​​"Enchanted April" is great: two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an Italian villa for a month. To further cover the costs, they invite two strangers. What makes it interesting is the relationship both before and during this holiday, in particular, showing how this beautiful setting really changes their outlook on life. Unfortunately, this good idea is completely spoiled by two key actions in the ensemble that are so bad that they destroy the film. Ann Harding plays a major role in the film in such a way that it seems ridiculous. Her expression with a squint and empty eyes really make you wonder: this is not a film about zombies or is she just an idiot! And even worse, Reginald Owen plays a character so disgusting and pompous that I was very close to turning off the film - it was so terrible and incredible. I noticed that at least one reviewer gave this film 10 - which is very, very difficult to understand. Of course, the film has a great atmosphere and a good plot, but these two obviously stupid performances can not be overlooked, because they undermine the rest of the picture. Sorry, but this film yearned for rework!
