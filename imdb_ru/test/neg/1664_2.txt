Linda Arvidson (like Jenny) and Harry Salter (like Frank) enjoy a romantic date when her father Charles Insley walks; in a rage, he drives Mr. Salter out of the house. Fearless, he goes to her balcony and asks her to escape. Miss Arvidson is pleasant and goes to collect things. Then robber George Gebhardt arrives to rob this place. Despite the fact that he doesnâ€™t interfere with mining, does Gebhardt, the thief, manage to use Arvidson's chest to escape from the police <br /> <br /> Thought up comedy. Please note that during the scene on the balcony, Salter disconnects from the camera, so robber Gebhardt may enter the house unnoticed. And Arvidson travels very easily, as there seems to be nothing in her heavy chest; maybe she just wanted to fix the salter? Director D.V. Griffith, Robert Harron and Florence Lawrence are outstanding extras. <br /> <br /> ** Poor escape (8/7/08) D.V. Griffith ~ George Gebhardt, Linda Arvidson, Harry Salter
