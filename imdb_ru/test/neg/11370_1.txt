Directed by Jeremiah Chechek, who brought us big budget setbacks, such as The Avengers and the remake of "Diabolique", led this robbery of the concept of Die Hard, made on - what it looks like - the budget of Blair Witch. <br /> <br /> California nuclear reactor captured by Arab terrorists. But - are you ready? - terrorists are not Arab; they are really disgruntled American soldiers disguised as Arabs! We learn that they are not really going to blow up the reactor, they just make a statement. We are not sure what kind of statement this is, but it does not matter. So actually there is no threat. But then one of the terrorists decides to go alone and actually blow up the plant, because he is kind of crazy. So, perhaps, the threat is still there. But the army is coming in, and all the bad guys are killed. So there was no threat. Oh, and the good guy is killed too. Let it be a lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> If all this sounds messy and a waste of time, then you have an idea of ​​what Meltdown is. <br /> <br /> The script never stops to present characters or even to provide any personal data that could reveal them or emotionally attract an audience. Thus, we are left with one-dimensional symbols: “an expert whom no one will listen to”; deputy militant-sergeant; what-mucous-politics; Deputy dweeby-engineers. The story moves from one cliché to another in a formula made up of virtually every action movie you’ve ever seen. But at almost every step, when we think something can be at stake, the script shudders, and we find that there is really nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> Like the Die Hard, there is a policeman who is inside, unnoticed by the bad guys. The big twist is that the cop is here ... WOMAN! Oh, and she is also injured. But not everything is so bad, just enough to make her flinch a couple of times. Oh, and instead of a walkie-talkie that Bruce Willis, this cop has a magical mobile phone that works everywhere ... even underground! When he doesn’t scream at everyone else, Bruce Greenwood - his jaw of granite - tries to calm her down on the radio. He even joked once, but we fear that his face may break. In the end, this is a serious business. <br /> <br /> But basically it is a scene behind the scene when people argue: a military expert is trying to wait out (his reasoning does not seem particularly convincing, but he must be the clever guy in this film so okaaaaай); people in the White House argue with him; an army sergeant is arguing with him; A good Pakistani nuclear scientist argues with the main terrorist. The dialogue is absolutely B Movie completely and lines like, "stop the broadcast! STOP BROADCASTING !!!" you may have to slide off the couch if you are wondering if the characters really relate to this nonsense. <br /> <br /> It is possible to compensate for the lack of quality of production, the camera work in this fake documentary film remains nervous 21 annoying; even pretentious. Further attempts to accelerate the pace are made with the inclusion of meaningless black and white frames that randomly intersect with the main action. But this is also pretentious and annoying in the sense that Blair the Witch is sort of. In short, stylistic attempts look very dilettan. <br /> <br /> Music corresponds to the visual features - it is a synthesizer and a cheap sound. It seems like a porn movie, but with less melody and much more heart beat sounds. Graphic processing is also terribly bad: cheese graphics with a huge red font shout out to us “9:28 pm”, as if time really has some meaning. <br /> <br /> Meltdown can work as a marketing concept but it is clear that the script was a second thought. FX - part of Fox - put together this cheese production and spent several million dollars on it. Now this is what I call a crash!
