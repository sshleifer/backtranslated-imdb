this film is a heap of rubbish, and the attempt to base it on the first one is just a farce, the main thing that let it down for me is the use of one liner from the first one that classical actors once said: since Sam Elliot cannot be played, I mean, when Dalton's phones come out to 1st place, and he ends the conversation, staying calm, that was great, but when the fool calls the DEA agent home, and he ends the call with Cool, he doesn't have the same ring, now it really is, there are others, but I could not have to work hard to publish them, but I hope that you understood that they should call this copycat on the road ....... ...
