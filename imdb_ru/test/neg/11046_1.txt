Incredible. "Philosophy". "Depth". "Genius". "Masterpiece". People must have seen the other “Oldboy” because the one I saw was poorly written, poorly thoughtful, overly active, dirty work of Kraapol, which, even for a moment ignoring the funny scenes of violence that make it unsuitable for the eye of a child, could hardly satisfy the imagination and thirst for the sequence of the plot of seven years. <br /> <br /> The “depth” of this pitiful mixture was exhausted by one small piece of wisdom. “Laugh and the whole world will laugh with you, cry, and you will be alone,” like a boring prediction cookie that says what a great author, whether he is Shakespeare or, more precisely, IMDb, Kurosawa, had to be thrown into the bin without hesitation. Where this film also had to land, if we had not lived in an era when cheap, shocking and perversely disgusting, were confused with what was once called "great art." In short, disgusting. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 100. This is not 1 out of 1000 just because of the sometimes experienced camera work. But in no way is it enough to save this infant failure from worthlessness.
