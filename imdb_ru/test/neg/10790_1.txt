This film, although well-shot and superbly played, was terrible. It seemed to me that I was watching a car accident - of course, I kept looking, but I really wanted to turn my head. The plot leaves much to be desired, was extremely fragmented, and the final was terrible. Although it matched the tone of the film, I was hoping that something would improve this film. I still do not understand what references to rabies and a child are bitten by foxes at the beginning of the film. Fifteen minutes of plot, which really did little. It is very sad to see a film with beautiful actors and a beautiful plot spent on such a terrible, terrible story. There is nothing more to say about this movie. Save time and watch c-span. It will be more inspiring.
