This brief review does not contain spoilers, as the film spoils itself. It is wooden and pedantic. He has no saving grace at all. If someone invites you to see “Mr. Imperium” at his home, do not go. Even the name of the film is awful and foreshadows what the trash is. The whole plot is so bad that it can lead Mother Teresa to despair !!! It was not a stroke that led to the poor demise of poor Ezio, it was that he had to act in that ragged shape. It pursued him to the end of his days. Perhaps he was an enemy alien and wanted to take revenge on the Americans for his conclusion. He found the perfect machine for his anger in this parody.
