When you see Barry Corbin in the cast of a film, you can never be sure if it will be a classic or a trash. Guess which category SOLO appears to be from the popular science fiction novel WEAPON, SOLO plays Mario Van Peebles as a human robot who decides to think for himself and, therefore, aims at destruction. He is hiding in a Mexican village, obviously to save money on places and extras. I suspect that paying in pesos is cheaper than in dollars. William Sadler is ready for the trip, as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy Van Peebles. Of course, Van Peebles overwhelmed them all with ease, while Corbin watched all this with bewilderment. The film is a terrible robbery of THE TERMINATOR and CYBORG series and, obviously, has little to do with its source material. It is terribly written and acted, and a big fight at the end, if itâ€™s ridiculous. Van Peebles, a worthy actor elsewhere, screams while pretending to be a robot covered in synthetic flesh. Looks like he performs the dance of robots most of the time.
