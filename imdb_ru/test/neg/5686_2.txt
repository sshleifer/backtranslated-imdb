This film was rented for free, I had no doubt that this was a very bad film. I rented it for Thanksgiving because we eat turkey and then the family watches a horrible movie. So, you ask, what makes this film so bad that you gave it only 2 stars? Dialogue. The lack of dialogue makes this film ideal for a deaf audience. In fact, if you rent it, just lower the volume to zero and insert any heavy metal CD of your favorite artist. I know you will like it more. The plot of this holiday turkey was so overloaded with technology and reprimands that a translator is needed for the narration. Now for all of you, people who enjoy good sci-fi effects ... yes, they are not much better than video game trailers or directorial scenes in the worst cases. The actors, both of them, have nothing to look at either. They do not say anything throughout the film. Many technical aspects will make you laugh, like a scene where the hero ties himself to a rocket and launches it in a city at a distance of 70 km (it never showed how she landed). The scene before that, we see a robotic machine gun shooting at it from a distance of 12 feet, and it misses several shots. We are also told that the political separation between the antagonist and the protagonist is biotechnology (genetically improved people) as compared to cyber technology (automated people), but both of them seem to be cyborgs or improved people. What I was told was that it was a bad movie at the box office, it was a cover that looked like a cover for a video game, and there was only one copy, good new releases have many copies available.
