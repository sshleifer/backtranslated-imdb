It’s as if someone took a fantasy-style video game and put it in a blender, and the resulting jumble scene is what we have to live through. <br /> <br /> Now let me state how much I love Chinese fantasy movies. From fun and stupidity to those involved in the martial arts, to more dramatic and romantic types - I really like this genre. Films such as Chinese Odyssey: Pandora’s Box and Chinese Odyssey: Cinderella (both of which were written and / or filmed by Jeffrey Lau); "Bride with white hair"; "Butterfly and Sword"; "Green Snake"; Chinese Ghost Story; "Swordsman II"; "Zou: warriors from the magic mountain"; "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"; other. That is why I was looking forward to "Chinese high history." One of the characters in the film is “The Monkey King” (aka Sun Wukong), an extremely famous character in Chinese mythology, first told in the stories “Journey to the West”, an epic adventure written about 500 years ago. (The story of the Monkey King and his students is also in the center of attention of the films “Chinese Odyssey” and many others). Other familiar characters that appear in the film are Zhu Wuneng (pig character) and Sha Wujing. <br /> <br /> So how does it all go wrong? Well, let's look at an example familiar to Western audiences. What about the mythology of Robin Hood? Well known story from past years. For example, in our film about Robin Hood, Wesley Snipes starred as Robin Hood and Haley Joel Osment as monk Taka. The maid Marian is none other than Rosie Perez. Let's also give Sir Robin Uzi, because you never know when you might have to waste the Sheriff of Nottingham. They may also need missile systems, and while we are working on this, give them tactical nuclear weapons, because it will certainly come in handy. If you think that this sounds like a very accurate retelling of a fairy tale about Robin Hood, then “Chinese story” is a movie for you! As I pointed out above, this film is a mess. In the first 30 minutes, we meet not only Sun Wukong, Zhu Woonen and Sha Wujin, but also the monk Tripitaka (who is actually the main character), abducted children, the “millennium beetle demon” (who shoots a laser). rays), the underground god of the tree, the tribe of the demon lizard, the angelic girl in the intergalactic egg, the turtle of the Lord Chancellor, the king of sea dragons, the ever-turning magic golden staff, the demonic talker, the space wormholes and the Four Heavenly Knights. All this would not be so bad - fairy tales and myths transmitted over the years undoubtedly contain all sorts of fantastic elements. But I guarantee you that Chinese mythology does not include much of the material we are exposed to in the last half of the film. (Useful advice to filmmakers: if the guys from your computer effects MAY come up with cool spaceships and images of intergalactic war, this does not mean that they MUST). <br /> <br /> You know that your film on Chinese mythology is on the wrong track when the director asks (and I don’t make it up, this is a direct quote from the comment) “I asked the composer if we could have more rock n roll music when it turns into some kind of android-like stuff. “Is there a story here somewhere hidden? Yes. Yes, there is. Most of the adventures follow Tripitaka (in which Nicholas Tse,“ Police Generals ”,“ Time and the Tide ”,“ My Classmate-Barbarian ”play) and Meiyan, possessed by a lizard (played by Charlene Choi and a computer). Choi is the best thing in this film. You may know it as a half Canto-pop group "Twins" and from other films such as "The Twins Effect" (funny movie) and "Just One Look "(surprisingly good drama / romance / comedy). Poor Choi, being a demon of a lizard and all that, is hardly recognizable by her warts, teeth pulled out, p His nose and crooked back. This happens until computers master it and decorate it, which somehow aggravates the situation. It is tolerable, but all the actors were terrible. Several recognizable faces in the bit parts were wasted. <br / > <br /> At some point I was arguing with myself whether the “Chinese high story” was a fake, I was almost able to convince myself that this was when an intergalactic egg (played by a very cute Fan Bing-Bing) came out and lit Marlboro (!) During a conversation with Tripitaka, which dealt with the lawsuit cstva, dressed in a spider. Men's suit (!!). But this is not a hoax. Of course, there is a typical Hong Kong stupidity, but the film takes itself seriously enough, with a sufficient number of romantic and pretentious scenes (voiced by the violin and cello cellos) and lively actions and adventures. <br /> <br /> You might think that you can watch it at Netflix rentals, and it won't cost you anything. (Yes, but it will cost you, well). <br /> <br /> Anything good can be said? Of course. The colors are bright (this is the best thing in this film). And the filmmakers, of course, tried very hard. It is a pity that all these efforts went to the film, which is not much more than a bad video game.
