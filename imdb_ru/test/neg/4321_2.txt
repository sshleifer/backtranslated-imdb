I can't believe that I really sat this whole movie. A friend rented it because the jacket made it sound good. In his defense, the jacket was correct; there was a haunted room in which someone slept all night. From the jacket it seemed that it was on a par with Freddie, Jason or, maybe, “Shining”. This could not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of minimalist and / or surreal films, you might like it. If you're looking for a good horror movie or a couple of thrills, rent Jason vs. Freddie IV - you'll have a much better night.
