Just when I thought that nothing could be as offensive and / or annoying as the Billy Mays commercial, I had an intellectually amazing experience renting this piece of garbage. Peter Barnes and John Irwin should be held criminally liable for smuggling this scenario in public places. Actors should be blamed as accomplices, serving no less than a lifetime away from public view. <br /> <br /> This setting offers a disclaimer: “For dramatic effect, we took a poetic license with some facts” or some kind of inadequate statement to fully prepare you for an absolutely disgusting rewriting of a biblical story drama. What they added was enough to make your I.Q. drop three full points for every five minutes of viewing time. <br /> <br /> Taken "poetic license" invents characters so strange that you learn nothing but the names of a few, and, of course, ark. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Noah and Lot both live in Sodom, so perhaps Abram was vacationing in Switzerland while skiing. Lot's wife, played by Carol Kane, is a harpy, and when she turns into a salt pillar, Lot tears off her finger and drags it in something like an empty can of baby food. If it is “poetic,” I am a kumquat. <br /> <br /> When Noah, who now began to drink wine in quantities that can help swim in the ark, complains about the hard work of the construction project, he awakens. one morning to find out that God had supplied enough lumber to ease his burden. At least I think it was God. It looked like a delivery of 84 lumber neatly folded and tied. Maybe 84 Lamber is really an agent for God ????? Instead of bothering you with cargo, I will pamper you with a report about the attack of the pirates on the ark. What do you think is inappropriate? This film is filled with such insulting nonsense. After an indescribable time on the waters, Noah spies on a pirate ship heading straight for them. And who could be a salty sea captain? Well, of course, this is Lot! My only surprise was that his uncle Abram was not on board. If you're going to slaughter the plot line, slaughter it all. The piracy attempt was unsuccessful, and the nonsense was pathetic, not poetic. I think it was because of this mark that my nausea prevented me from punishing myself more. <br /> <br /> An ugly, meaningless idiotic distortion of something remotely resembling a biblical story. On a scale of 1 - 10, this film is a deliberate abuse of the mind. Stupid and insulting, you'll be more fun reading the Yellow Pages.
