Having cracked a secret database file for matching DNA sera, federal agent Frank Pu (Andy Garcia) discovered that the only person who could save his sonâ€™s life was a psychopath played by Michael Keaton. However, when the transfer of serum in the local hospital goes terribly wrong, a certain Mr. Pu must do everything possible to keep the madman alive in order to make the inevitable transfer possible. By the way, his name is actually Pu, I just want to call him by him. Despite the original concept at hand, this is an incredible and painfully uninteresting action movie. I have never been a big fan of Andy Garcia, and he has his peculiarities, that it is incompatible, this film ends worse. The sequence action is pretty frustrating, and the ending sucks. Having made a great villain in Pacific Heights, Keaton's psychopathic bad guy is a disappointment, giving the madman too ridiculous and charismatic to be mourned. Brian Cox is also lost as a firm and outspoken chief of Garcia.
