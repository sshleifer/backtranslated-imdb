I went through about half of this film and was very disappointed. It was just boring and completely unreal. In many films I may be unrealistic, but not when it should be a criminal drama. The process of collecting evidence and interviews was just an eccentric. I started fast forwarding to see how it ended. And then it became boring with this and just turned it off and returned it. The main character, played by Ellen Barkin, was simply not believable. Peta Wilson played very well in this film, but her character was good, and there was no one who could play her acting talents.
