The fear of darkness left me with the impression that several different scenarios were written, too short for a full-length film, and then clumsily glued into a monster of this Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> At best, the hero, Lucas the Scary. No matter how difficult it is to draw a bead on minor characters, they are much more sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Afraid of the dark, one could achieve mediocrity if he used only one approach and saw through it - and if that made Lucas just psychotic and confused, and not disgusting and repulsive. I wanted to see him packed in a shelter so that the rest of the characters would have a normal life.
