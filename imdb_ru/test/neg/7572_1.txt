and terrible, excessive action, you could enjoy this trash flick. Obviously, atomic bombs make life change in about a day or two (or, according to other viewers, wake them up). Or so it seems. And, obviously, massive atomic explosions off the coast of Spain do not force anyone to ask questions. If you think about it, the plot does not make any sense at all (why should evil nasal puppets attack the lighthouses?), Therefore, nuclear weapons are not allocated too much for no reason. <br /> <br /> Well, bypassing this, and the fact that the “monster” is a glorified thing you make from socks in kindergarten, you can really stand it. But this time, the complete absence of blood does not help, leaving the attacks of monsters in all their bare bottomless budget "glory." <br /> <br /> I doubt that you will be able to observe this, though, so it is best to stay away.
