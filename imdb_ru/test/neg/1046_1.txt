"Five characters in search of a way out" should be one of the most boring "zones" ever created. It was on Sci-Fi this morning, and, as usual, I changed the channel. I put it in the top five of the worst "zones" ever created. Bored and predictable, and not worth watching. Serling developed this topic to death (earthlings in the hands of aliens, who were often giants), and in this particular version it simply does not work. Anyone who has not seen this before will quickly understand it. This is another Serling philosophical mood, perhaps parallel to the plight of those in prisoners of war or concentration camps where prisoners may lose interest in finding out where they are or fighting their captors. William Wind, as the soldier who is the last to “look in,” is the only one who is interested in making efforts, and it will not take long to determine the result.
