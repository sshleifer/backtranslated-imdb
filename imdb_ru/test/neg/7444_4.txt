RATING STARS: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Old Detroit is back, and the giant corporation Omni Consumer continues to swallow everything in its the way, as the construction of the new Delta City continues, and a new threat arises in the form of Cain, a cruel drug lord with the illusions of Christ likeness, selling new deadly dependency on the streets called Newk. While he continues to struggle with memories of his past life, pursuing him, the tin hero goes to kill this villain - just to be cut into pieces of scrap metal. With Robocop down, the ruthless OCP business lady offers plans for her new android — a roaring, snarling beast of a machine that needs an equally unpleasant test object to put it into action — which Cain fits perfectly. After a brief glitch in his system, Robo returns to bring justice to the streets and get even with Cain. <br /> <br /> The original Robocop is a film that always manages to surprise you every time you watch it, no It doesn’t matter how many times you see it, one of those movies that is simply impossible to repeat. However, it is not surprising that the sequel was made - even less surprising that this sequel really fades in comparison with the original. The director of “The Empire Strikes Back” Irwin Kirchner created an unpleasant, slightly incoherent and too long film that cannot convey the magic of the first film, no matter how hard he tries. And it certainly does it, funny commercials from the first movie that do not stop, corporate satire, striving to be a little sharper, and action, violent and furious, as before, but with blood / blood, even angrier than in the first movie . The first film was named for some vile, blood-soaked violence (including bloated male genitalia and a fractured man), but although it was more memorable, the violence / blood demonstrated here is more sadistic and causeless in nature, with a very unpleasant and meanest tone . <br /> <br /> But in general, the film leaves a feeling of total apathy - why do you watch it, when instead you can watch the original again? ? **
