Take the cliché and insert Steve Guttenberg. Do I really say more? It really is as bad as one would expect. Sheriff Tom Palmer (Guttenberg) and Anna Montgormieri are trying to turn a group of useless, inept children into a winning football team. Without originality and directionality, this is a rather difficult task to maintain interest in this film. Despite my doubts about Guttenberg's acting skills, I can safely say that the game of the coach of the rival teams is actually worse than that of Guttenbergs. I thought it was impossible to imagine. This type of history of losers fighting at the top was made earlier and better each time than this so-called “movie”
