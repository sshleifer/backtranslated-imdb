Let's not fool ourselves, okay? We all know that this film was made because of the success of Angry Old Men. However, unlike those, this parody has no humor and very little heart. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven is the only shining light that can be seen. It breaks my heart that she was finally given a chance to show her skills to a new generation of movie goers, but in the end she was in such a terrible state as this one. There was a touching scene in which she was supported by a man in whom she fell in love. Her excellent performance was the only high-quality acting game in "Out To Sea". All others simply pass through the movement. 2/10
