We all know that the world is full of cunning, predatory horror films. Some of them can be funny because of their stupidity, terrible effects and unreliable dialogue. But Raptor, which could be in the same league as the equally meaningless TV series Carnosaur, does not even try to get any pleasure from it. It’s so poorly done, it’s really unbearable, even if you just watch it with the intention of spending a thoughtless day at home. Where to begin? Well ... the sets are pretty gray. My old drama group created more realistic scenes. Genetic labs look like they're from a university, and it looks equally incredible from the outside (even to hide, why don't you get close to a civilization where people can easily hear the dinosaur roar), while doctors just don't hear it doesn't look believable at all. Next in the list of complaints are the effects of the creatures; Well what can I say? Absolutely pathetic. Also, I think it is worth mentioning that a woman’s boobs should be mentioned as an effect. Both of the main female characters obviously had boobs, and that drives the heroes off their feet, since one woman is a respected police officer and the other is a sweet, "innocent" daughter of the city sheriff. However, acting is the most terrible tragedy. Eric Roberts can be excused for having tried at least a little to give his role something. That's where it ends. Corbin Benson should have killed his costume designer to make his dull presentation even more pitiful, while the lead woman looks SO bored (although she could be let go of this movie). Another character I’ll point out is a daughter who allows her tits to be filmed in a dirty sex scene (ten minutes of endless repeated shots of some guy bouncing on top of her). <br /> <br /> In general, and summarized as a unit. don't worry just don't
