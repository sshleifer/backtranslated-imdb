I first rented this film on the notorious day of September 11, 2001. Since then, I have seen him several times. My only complaint is that it is too short. "Strange Country" would be a complete horror in two hours. Currently, the operating time is only one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> Former Twisted Sister member Dee Snyder wrote, produced and starred in this 1998 shock festival in a small town in Colorado. He plays Carlton Hendrix, a crazy sadist who has psychotic ideologies on human evolution and the love of experiencing death. Hendrix is ​​not a wimp; he is a pumped six-foot "modern primitive." Someone who has tattooed and pierced his body to the extreme. When he first appears in the film, this is really a scary sight. <br /> <br /> The main hobby of Hendrix in life is to share your “spiritual awakenings” with your kidnapped victims. He visits the Internet chat rooms called "Captain Howdy", and then invites people to his home. They believe they are going to a party. Instead, they end up in a house of pain and suffering. Hendrix pokes his eyes and mouth and tortures them by inserting blades and hooks into numerous parts of their body. If it sounds bad, it is because it is. <br /> <br /> One of the victims of Hendrick is Genevieve, the daughter of Detective Michael Gage. Gage not only manages to save her, but also arrests Hendrix. Four years later, Hendricks was released from a mental hospital, fully rehabilitated to community disapproval. A group of goons led by Freddie Krueger himself, actor Robert Englund, decides to kill him. They fail, and Hendrix returns to his old self. <br /> <br /> I will leave the rest of the film to you, only to say that the conclusion is satisfactory and will leave you in a shiver. With the exception of Snyder, the acting is not very good, but it is working. The direction is also good. There are several humorous roles in “Strange Land”, and they are very funny. I also liked the soundtrack, it’s awesome and worth buying if you like rock. In general, this film is worth watching. If you like low budget horror movies with a sense of humor, check it out. You will probably enjoy it.
