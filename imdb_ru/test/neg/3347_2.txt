I have to, in light of the praise for this film from the audience, again take on the role of poop in the punch, as Lowell Weeker used to say, I scratched my head from a huge number of laudatory comments. "African Queen" is not. The aroma of the period is wonderful, yes. Acting is good, but no actor, no matter how great, can breathe life into a seemingly endless stream of completely tedious and insignificant conversation at a party and dinner table, and I don’t care how much of this is taken from Joyce’s text . Imagine that you spend an hour and a half on a fly on the wall at the Christmas dinner of a not particularly interesting group of people (it’s not clear to me that this is a family, as one person suggested) to listen to their worldly conversations at the table and you have the necessary experience of this film . Absolutely nothing happens. And nothing important is said, but said endlessly. As I said, the popularity of this film is a mystery to me. Speaking of secrets, look good, not this one.
