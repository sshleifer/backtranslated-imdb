It's not just that the film is lame. It is more than that. This film is simply unnecessary. Do we need another western? How about a western with blacks in roles? Sounds silly, implausible and unsuccessful attempt to modernize the genre? It. Incredibly lame and simple like-minded people. It's like that flimsy film by Baz Luhrmann “Romeo and Juliet”, where he put it in the modern era to attract young people and create some buzz with its updating of the classic story. Well, Baz Luhrmann failed miserably, as did this mess. The story is actually not bad, but the very idea of ​​removing racism from the racist genre by casting all African-American actors is in itself racist. He is also childish and simple (like Baz Luhrmann, he is a bad director). Hey (I hear you say) it was directed by Mario Van Peebles! He is also in the film! How can this be racism? Is not. I said that the idea of ​​casting all African Americans instead of Caucasians was. The film is not racist, it is just meaningless, stupid and very boring.
