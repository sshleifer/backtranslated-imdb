I sometimes let my children watch this rubbish so that they understand how pathetic the “participants” of the show are. They are pitiful not because they are fat, but because they expose their dignity for a few minutes of fame and fortune. <br /> <br /> In order for someone to appear on national television, he would cheat, mock and whine about being fat (completely through his own fault) nauseous. What does this say about us as a nation? Does this mean that your choice of lifestyle and its consequences are not our responsibility? <br /> <br /> “The biggest loser” is a suitable name, but it has nothing to do with weight. <br /> <br /> Absolute trash.
