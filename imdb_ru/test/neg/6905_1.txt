Words cannot describe how terrible this film is. Well, maybe they can. I'll hit: 1 - It's a pity. Hollywood makes more talking animals set in graphics. Obviously, the script and the storyline are no longer needed. <br /> <br /> 2 - Cruel. Children's film, but still one of the heroes is subjected to brutal attacks and murders. <br /> <br /> 3 - Stupid stupid. The film actually portrays farm animals as having human abilities. In Nemo, the fish could talk, but for the most part they are still fish. We hear only English as a translation. In Barnard, animals actually speak English, which other people can understand. <br /> <br /> 4 - Unreasonable - there is no clever storyline or even some clever humor. (Well, the 13-year-old dog on crutches was funny). <br /> <br /> 5 - Insensitivity to culture - the black actress actually plays the “Black” cow. Pink cow playing white actress. The black cow played a stereotypical black man. <br /> <br /> 6 - Clueless - There is no such thing as a male cow of which I know. I suppose we call them bulls? If we are going to expose our children to death, the simplest facts might as well be true. <br /> <br /> 7 - Boring and Borish. My 4 year old asked us to leave after 45 minutes. He almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this film will make millions, and this is regrettable, because it only proves to Hollywood producers that the American public as a whole is just full of suckers waiting to pay 8 bucks just to get some peace and quiet children for an hour or two. Unfortunate circumstance. Why should manufacturers spend real money when the return is the same in any case.
