After watching this movie on TV, I watched it in IMDB and, to my surprise, presented a user rating of 7.6! This is not a good movie. This is especially bad editing; the bad story path from one point to another was unprofessional and distracting. This is not very fluently done. I agree that the game was pretty decent, especially Kelly Kapovsky, and that the story was quite intriguing.
