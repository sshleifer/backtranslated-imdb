What could have been a great movie about a late poker pro (hobby before poker) Stu “The Kid” Unger turned into disappointment. <br /> <br /> We can say that the filmmakers worked on a short budget line. Everything looks shot on the cheap. The timing seemed a little out of place. <br /> <br /> Casting Michael Imperoli from the Sopranos was also a bad choice. He looked too old to play with the baby-faced Stu, he looked too healthy for the coke addict (if you look at the footage from the main event of the WSOP in 1997, the real Stu was so thin and he practically didn’t have the nose from too much cocaine so he wore these sunglasses to hide them), and I kept on waiting for Adriana to jump out and scream "Chris-that-fuhr !!!" <br /> <br /> In addition, they missed the fact that he had a son from past relationships, Angie, who committed suicide in the late 80s. <br /> <br /> Every time I saw Vincent Van Patten appear, I kept thinking that he was going to announce “Show melodies going to Stu's head”. as he does on WPT. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for real Stuey footage, check out ESPN Classic because they often restart the main event of the 1997 WSOP. Or try YouTube. Avoid this movement as a bad blow.
