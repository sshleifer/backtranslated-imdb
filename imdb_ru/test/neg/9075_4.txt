I chose this film because I was looking for a friendship triangle between a girl and two boys. Since I lived in this situation and got lost in it, I hope that such a story will inspire me. <br /> <br /> My main problems are: - Why is (a) and how (b) a triangle formed? - Why (c) and how (d) does a triangle degenerate? <br /> <br /> (a) The film offers a simple answer: “because it’s better!”. <br /> <br /> (b) here, this is an open triangle: the three share with each other. Mine was closed: everyone knows others, but three never together or do not talk about the missing: <br /> <br /> (c) The film does not offer verbal explanations, but prefers visual and emotional assumptions. The end comes with sensuality, sexuality arising in the triangle, or, more precisely, when for one member deep feelings are connected with intimacy, and, as for the last and the first, they can be separated. I agree with that. <br /> <br /> (d) In the film and in my story, silence is proof that something is going wrong. And, strangely and painfully, it is a tool for these sad times. There is always a telephone: I have lived through this terrible planned telephone call: “Call me back: am I waiting for you” ?? and when the time comes, the phone is silent ?? Option is also shown when the line is connected, but one refuses to talk? All these scenes were very difficult to see for me. <br /> <br /> If the film was very helpful in this, he also had many flaws: <br /> <br /> - I’ve gotten up on the boy’s family problems <br /> <br /> - why the movie’s scene is DVD cover cut from the movie? <br /> <br /> - how does mikael finally get to the hotel? <br /> <br /> - Does Clement always see Salome? he says no but has her address; and who is this girl with him at the bar: his girlfriend? How does she know about the address? <br /> <br /> - what happens with Vanessa as a result: is the ring on the final shoot a proof of engagement ??? with whom ?????
