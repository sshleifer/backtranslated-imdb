It used to be that video distributors such as Sub Rosa and Brain Damage Films would produce low-cost horror films, shot on video, for the selected hound market, which happily absorb them. This is acceptable to me, because you could see these films one mile away with their crappy box and trashy titles. <br /> <br /> Now we have Lions Gate, only they decided that it would be better to soak up bad juices, applying “professional” coverage on him and charging the same price as one of their high-budget ones, professionally made features. Do not fall into it! Of course, if you saw Dark Harvest 1 or 2, you already know what to expect from 3, but there is a place for films like this, and it is not on the shelf of the video store next to professionally made features. <br /> <I’m a fan of independent movies and watched a few low-budget videos that are still worthy of hire, but this was one of the worst films I’ve ever seen. The “game” (if you can call it that) was terrible. It was fun to laugh at a horrible line reading a minute or two, but in the end it was too much to accept and became unbearable. The story is bad, the dialogue is worse, the acting is somehow managing to be worse. The only possible saving grace for this is one scene of shock, which can still be terrible, but is the effect of reward compared to a splash of blood after the girl has been slapped or beheaded. <br /> <br /> It took me three times I tried to go through the whole movie, and I did it only because I paid good money to rent it, and I felt I should at least finish it completely. Stay away - stay away from this.
