Although I am not a woman, I can enjoy watching chicks if it is good. This one, however, is outside the bad. You have a history of the book, the girl divorced, a boy with problems appeared. BOOM's magic occurs, and his demons are banished when she realizes that her life has a new purpose. <br /> <br /> Now that I can believe this can happen, I'm not an idiot. This will not happen over the weekend geriatric pimple, it will take time. However, the producers here know that they only have 1 hour and 30 minutes, so they make these two changes happen, I believe that the night is hammered and the night with the grandmother and grandmother, like dogs in the heat, can be enough if I suppose romance novels were the Gospel ... but most people do not. <br /> <br /> Now, if this is not enough ... the producers remembered that clicking a chicken should make the viewer cry .. Well, they tried to make you cry when two older people stirred it because of failure ... so how could they hit you again? Why do I know, let's kill one of the characters for no good reason, except that accidental death will surely cause a tear in the eye .... and now let's give a teenage daughter a magical connection with her broken mother's heart for no reason other than the fact that it would be nice (completely unrealistic, but who cares). <br /> <br /> That's all ... the girl finds a boy, the boy finds love, death finds the boy and mother cries ... what movie is NOT
