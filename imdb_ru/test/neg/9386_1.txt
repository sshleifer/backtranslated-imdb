This show is terrible. I can not overcome the complete waste of great talent, which contains this show. This is not an entertaining improvisational game, it's just a cheap attempt to throw somebody famous comedians onto the stage and get them to play a poorly improved scene. I actually did an improvised job as an actor, and this show is not improvised. <br /> <br /> The audience laugh at that (if they laugh at this show at all, it looks rather false) this embarrassment from the fact that the guest star is lost like a deer in the headlights. People laugh at stupid, completely unrelated things. And if it's not part of the scene, the actors will tell them that this is wrong! I think that this show is shameful for art and makes me cry about shows like “Whose line”, anyway, who had great talent, great games for improvisation and, among other things, I didn’t want to change the channel.
