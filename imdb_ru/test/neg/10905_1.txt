I don’t often write reviews here, but I can’t stand aside and let other people suffer from this film without even trying to warn them. This film is terrible, and it’s not because “I don’t know what the director was trying to convey” or “I’m too stupid to understand the plot”; This film is terrible due to bad direction, script and acting. This is a "trifecta" because of the bad moves and the reason why the film was right on the video. He is trying to be something like “high tension”, “hostel” and “TCSM” with the cancellation of some of these ideas, but it just does not work. I didn’t have high expectations or even average expectations from the film, but I was still very disappointed. He had the potential to be very good with good decor and a good idea for the film, but it was wasted.
