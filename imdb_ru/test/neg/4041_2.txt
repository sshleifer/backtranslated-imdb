It is tempting to view this film as a bold avant-garde experiment. I like to think that the director was trying to understand whether it was possible to take all the conventions of a comedy film and create something that would be completely, completely, completely unfunny. <br /> <br /> The answer is judged by "From Venus", it sounds "Yes." It may not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but my brain seems to have put down the memory of others. This horrible click soars right on the border: bad enough that the thought still causes pain, but not so bad that my internal censors wipe it out of my mind. <br /> <br /> I find it hard to imagine that the Director and the cast thought what they did when they did it, or why they went further and released it as soon as they did. I doubt that someone connected with this earned a lot, but surely between them they could raise enough money to buy all the prints and burn them. <br /> <br /> This is a film in which there is nothing to recommend it. It is not even pleasantly bad. It's just not a movie in which nothing interesting happens. I seriously thought about taking it back and asking for my money back, and I never did it before. <br /> <br /> Do not even think about renting (and even less buying!) This terrible movie!
