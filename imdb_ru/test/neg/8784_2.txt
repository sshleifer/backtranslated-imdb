Will you be surprised that my ears and eyes were almost bleeding from watching and listening to this terrible movie? My eyes were almost bleeding from watching a terrible animation and a tasteless, meaningless, empty story. My ears were almost bleeding from listening to songs that sounded like a choir of howler monkeys sang. Then my brain almost melted due to the complete lack of intelligence in this film. This is the formula for each step. Talking animals is one thing, and the penguin, who can fly, just to stick to the idea of ​​“dreams come true”? Show more faith in children's intelligence, please. Next to Rock-A-Doodle, this is one of the worst bluth.
