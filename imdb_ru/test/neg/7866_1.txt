If this film were rated on a scale from 1 to 10, it would be necessary to create a new rating system, since this one should not even fit. The plot of the film (if you can call it that) revolves around Charlie (Stephen Baldwin), a former agent of the operational staff who is pursued by the brother of the man he killed while he was still working for the US government. If this sounds like an interesting script, please do not be fooled, as this film does not deliver what its plot offers in the action genre. <br /> <br /> Comedian Chris Rock once said that when an actor plays a bad film because of which he wants to send an actor $ 50, given that an actor must desperately need money to do such poor quality work. After watching this movie, you can send $ 100 to Stephen Baldwin. <br /> <br /> It seems that Baldwin did not put any effort into his role in the film. In the film, Baldwin has to run around the city of Los Angeles to protect his “cell” (wife) from killing a man whom he had previously killed by his brother. However, throughout the whole picture, it seems that Baldwin barely copes with a light run. His laid-back speech successfully deducts from any expectation that the film might have intended to portray. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those people who like to watch very bad films and laugh at their shortcomings, then this film is for you. However, if you are looking for a well-made action movie, it would be better to look for something else than rent this movie.
