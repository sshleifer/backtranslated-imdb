(spoilers) Horribly badly, I actually saw the film, to which this horrible film was a sequel. His name was Ator Fighting Eagle, and I saw him when I was only 8 years old. It made such a horrible impression on me that I never forgot about it. I was an MST3K fan for a long time, so when Cavedwellers came out on tape, I bought it. I realized with horror that this was a continuation of the film “Ator”, which I had seen so long ago! Ator’s costume somehow became more scarce than the last time I saw him. How can he wear this tiny bikini? He doesn't care that it shows the fact that he doesn't have ... a mistake ... a package? And poor Tong ... he has no lines and no girlfriend, and he has to follow these curly fools ator all the time. Has anyone else noticed that Miles O'Keefe is walking like a woman? It is not surprising that he is not interested in the sweet, albeit a little dull, Mile. I'm sure that the evil, but the insane bad guy Zor is more to his taste. I loved the cardboard swan Zora, covered with cardboard, and the way he spent all his time trying to touch some part of Ator. The battle scenes are so poorly placed that it is surprising that swords can ever come together. Dumb old man spends all his time standing in depression. He is drinking from a cup given to him by a guy who hates him and then looks surprised that they gave him drugs. Although he must be pretty clever - he invented a hang-glider in space in five minutes, and then led him into a break in the space-time continuum so that he briefly went to Bulgaria of the 17th century. This happened after he struck the puppet of a giant snake and, of course, saved the post Mila, while she sat idle, doing nothing. The real hero of the film was Tong, who several times saved Ator from his boundless stupidities and killed the evil Zora as a result of the deal. Kudos to Tong, the only competent person in the whole film.
