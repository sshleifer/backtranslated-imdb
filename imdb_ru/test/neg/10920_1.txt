Why, well, why is this garbage considered classic? I have seen higher body rates in Simpsons episodes. Virtually nothing happens in this film, and most of his playing time is filled with an almost unbearable melodrama right from a low-paying soap opera. <br /> <br /> The Trenton family is going through difficult times, and when Dad leaves, Mom and the little boy go to fix the car. But when they get to the ranch, they discover that the guard dog has gone mad. The rest of the movie is just that they are sitting in the car, while the slobbery Saint Bernard is circling them again and again. <br /> <br /> As for the child, I have never seen a more annoying child in the film in my life. And, obviously, he is completely Aryan, since fair-haired and blue-eyed children, such as the one that is prominently displayed on Kinder's chocolate bags, appear to be more attractive than people with brown eyes and dark hair like me. All he does is crying and whining. The same goes for mom. She gets out of the car, she gets in the car, she gets out of the car, she gets in the car. <br /> <br /> I know that this was done in 1983, but I was just sick of horrors where the characters make stupid, illogical decisions. If mom was just guided by common sense, she would be able to run away from a picky dog. <br /> <br /> It is written very badly and there is no tension in it. If you want to watch a good film about the "bad dog", then see "John Lafia's Best Friend." It's fun, inventive, has a better dog, more body and a more exciting story. Leave this trash.
