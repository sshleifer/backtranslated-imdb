Corin has already established himself as a talented and impressive image maker. All the posters for Mr. Lonely include the most impressive compositions of the film (although in the promotional material I have yet to see one special: a nun in blue clothes, teasing the dog with a stick, surrounded by a green forest with pouring rain). The starting frames of this film, in which Michael Jackson (Diego Luna) rides a small motorcycle on the track, are strangely irresistible and beautiful: “Mr. Lonely” by Roy Orbison plays the soundtrack, and the images unfold in slow motion. There is also an amusing and amazing sequence in which the same character depicts a dance without music (although the radio sits like a silent dog next to him) in the middle of a Parisian street; Korine splicing in sound effects and jump-cuts, which cause both a sense of worthlessness and stubborn release in the dance of the character <br /> <br /> the first instance of the segment of the case with the nuns is also strangely bitter. Father Umbrillo (Werner Herzog) is an autocratic priest, about to fly with several nuns and throw food in poor areas nearby. In the carefree and exciting scene, the Duke has to deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local who wants to go with them on a plane to see his wife in San Francisco. As the exchange progressed, the Duke extracts recognition from this man: he sinned, and his frequent infidelity is the reason that his wife left him in the first place. This scene, short and sweet, is gaining special weight after it learns its improvised origin: the sinner is played by the non-actor who was on the set when Corin and Co. filmed - and his adulterous acts gave him in real life a long, insurmountable guilt. <br /> <br /> Henceforth, the film is amazing; a series of interesting in its essence moments that add to the frivolous, confusing narration. While Gammo and Julien Donkey-Boy retain their aesthetic and emotional weight with the help of coordinated structural structures, Mr. Lonely feels like a victim of editing the ruthlessness of a room. Several scenes were cut out of the film, in which fuller pictures of some of the characters would otherwise have been drawn due to errors in the succession of the costume - the result, undoubtedly, due to the lack of a shooting script and Corin's inclination for improvisation. In particular, one remote scene in which Charlie Chaplin (Denis Lavant) and Madonna (Melita Morgan) having sex would lead to a much more emotional conflict in the scene that will appear later in the film (I will not spoil it, but it should smooth out any feeling of warmth or celebration, and, like this, only half the success). <br /> <br /> The two parts of the narrative, literally unrelated, are best viewed as two completely different stories with the same allegorical meaning; one complements the other, and vice versa. (This is somehow related to the conflict between ambitions and the reality of the current situation.) But the scenes of the Duke are not enough to earn a place in the film, and therefore any connection between these two allegorically connected threads becomes inevitably tense. - and retrospectively the inclusion is tedious. <br /> <br /> This is an ambitious step forward from Julien Donkey-Boy, who mostly suffers, at least in similar segments, from too many characters for the film. the length of the run, a flaw that would be even worse if the loud star names played everyone (as originally planned). <br /> <br /> With many of the self-sufficient beauty of the image and moments of real, genuine connection with the soundtrack, it seems that it is much more suitable for an art installation or a photo exhibition. As a study of mimesis and the nature of imitation, it would not lose its power - indeed, for me, it might be more impressive. The loneliness inherent in cult performativity (for example, the one faced by both the icons themselves and those who want to be like them) is well captured on images like the one where Marilyn Monroe (gorgeous Samantha Morton) seduces the camera Seven-year itch pose in the middle of the forest, or when Sammy Davis Jr. (Jason Pennicook) has a rehearsal after the dance, with his back to the camera overlooking an incredible, tranquil lake. <br /> <br /> Like this, such moments, and all those where the names of Michael Jackson's songs are randomly selected crawling around the scene, they are married to each other in the narration of the film, much less impressive than it should be. <br /> <br /> (For those who see it, I lost all faith during the scene of singing eggs) Too late. You will understand what scene I mean, because it sticks out like a sore thumb, like some ridiculous attempt at a new cinematic language for which Korin had previously been proclaimed.)
