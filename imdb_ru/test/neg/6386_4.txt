I entered this film, expecting / hoping for a dismal seventies style of driving, but what I got was rather a strange pseudo-west with too much talk and not enough action. It is clear that this film was made on a budget; the locations are dim and poorly filmed, and the acting leaves much to be desired. The plot is dedicated to the trio of robbers (father and two sons), who steal a cargo of gold after killing some miners. They encounter a cabin where a young girl and her stepmother reside ... and all this is told in the memories of a young girl currently living in a shelter. Clearly, filmmakers Louis Lichman and William Sachs thought they were doing something really shocking; but despite all the efforts, South of Hell Mountain is too boring to shock the viewer. The film lasts about eighty minutes, and most of it consists of boring characters, spewing boring and wordy dialogue. The only good thing I have to say about the film is music; which is good in places. The ending is the only good thing about the movie; and that's just because this is the last thing that happens. I would not recommend that anyone worry about this ... in the seventies, the garbage was much better.
