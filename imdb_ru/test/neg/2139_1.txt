I'm not sure what the director and editor thought about when they edited this bad excuse for the film, but all they thought did not help this film, it only hurt him, and it hurt this film. The action, this time, is not a problem, itâ€™s terrible editing, the scenes end for no apparent reason, while in the middle of a sequence of actions or people will be cut off in the middle of a sentence. I'm not sure what that story was, but it didn't matter, because what I saw was rather uninteresting. Just bad everywhere, a huge plagiarism of "Jaws" and not very good at it. The MST version was fun though. 7 for this, none for the movie itself.
