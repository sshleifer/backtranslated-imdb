It promised to be an interesting movie. The subject was certainly promising - the excesses of the Catholic Church during the Counter-Reformation. However, not only was this not developed (except for the introduction of two paragraphs), many things were not explained - that is, Roma, Anabaptists, inquisitors and their relation to the one true church. The policy of that time, that is, the relationship between the Catholic Church and its supporters, such as the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, was not explained either. Although this may have been obvious to an Austrian audience, the lack of explanation makes it confusing for Americans. <br /> <br /> But perhaps it’s good that they didn’t emphasize the story, because what they showed was rather inaccurate however. The stars of the film are instruments of torture, bloody executions, burning of witches and heretics, big shiny swords and beautiful gold reliquaries. With the same success it could be one of those films about swords and witchcraft like Conan, only in historical costumes ...
