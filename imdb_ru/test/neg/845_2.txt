In 4 words, Captain Corelli's mandolin was “completely out of tune” with the book. The novel provided a sufficient background for the character to understand the relationships and personal problems that the characters had to overcome; the script author chose to ignore the details. Ignoring them (for example, the role of the priest at first as a jester, but later as a spiritual leader, the bride’s inability to read until the socialist rebel taught her, the expert advice on Korelli bombs and his possible ironic demise), the story and characters fall flat. <br /> <br /> This was the first film I ever showed halfway through. Interesting cinematography; great actors don't make a film; the story does.
