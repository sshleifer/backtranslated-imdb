This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The storyline is a joke, the effects are terrible, the cinematography does not match the tone of the film, the dialogue is stupid, and the actors do a good job of spoiling everything else. People just do not behave in real life situations. My question is: who will finance this shit? <br /> <br /> The film begins with the fact that some miners fall on the mine after the fireman did not save them. Then we join several bikers in the forest who ride bicycles and do stunts. One guy falls and breaks a leg or something. Fireman arrives to help them. In the meantime, someone starts a fire. A few more bike stunts. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> I wasted my time. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie.
