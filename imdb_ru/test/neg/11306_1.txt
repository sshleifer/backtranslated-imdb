I liked Mr. Magu’s cartoons, which I saw when I was growing up. And I like the comic skills of Leslie Nilsson. Therefore, I thought that in this marriage a funny baby should appear. <br /> <br /> I could not be wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie was just awful. I don’t remember a single funny moment. This is one of two or three times (in hundreds of films over the years) I wanted to get my money back. You will leave this film dejected, because you will never have that time to use it better. In the comedy the plot should attract the viewer and serve as the basis for the jokes. This story does neither. He just lies there, panting, like a fish sticking to the shore.
