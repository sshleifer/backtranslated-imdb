I admit that most of the horrors of the 50s are not terrible by today's standards, but what the hell is this? When you see such a headline, you expect to see blood and a bloodthirsty beast. Instead, we have no blood at all and a beast that either wants to take over the world, or live in peace on Earth ... yes, that's what people wanted. <br /> <br /> In general, the story is in order, the astronaut returns to life and becomes one with the beast .... but the title really kills the film. The Night of the Beast would have made the fans happier, because in fact there is nothing to talk about blood. <br /> <br /> I like how in the films of the 50s there were endings that left room to continue, but wisely never made it, This film is not the worst I've ever seen, but it is almost there . <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
