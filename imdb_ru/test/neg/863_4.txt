I accidentally caught this movie on TV late in the evening. I saw the opening credits and thought it looked good. Well, I was very wrong. Although it was not painfully bad (there were some funny and tender moments), he lacked a sense of cohesion. <br /> <br /> It all started quite well with the fact that Kathy Bates started a middle age crisis when her husband left her singing idol killed. But Katie played so well with these disgruntled women - think fried green tomatoes. The problem was not Katie, but the senseless script that roamed everywhere. As if the authors thought what we would do next. The script also looked very contrived. <br /> <br /> Some others who posted comments on this film wondered why he hadnâ€™t received the cinematic release. I think the main reason would be to avoid embarrassment, and critics would kill him. <br /> <br /> Having said all that, I think the little woman who played Modi was fantastic and stole the movie, not to mention how beautiful she was
