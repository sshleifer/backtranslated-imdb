Stunningly boring, completely predictable and, in the end, just ridiculous. This largely sums up the disaster, which is an indecent proposal. Starting with a decent premise, it all just falls apart and turns into a complete mess. In fact, the story boils down to the question: “Will you allow your wife to sleep with another man for a million dollars?” Here, of course, the answer is yes, because otherwise we would not have a movie. Frankly, it would be better if we didn’t have a movie. <br /> <br /> Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore play our married (and financially problematic) couple. They go to Vegas to get rich. Yes it will work. In any case, the billionaire played by Robert Redford loves his wife very much and makes a million dollar offer. For one night with his wife, he will give them financial support. The consequences of this one night are what the film really is all about. Unfortunately, nothing else is interesting. The script is so predictable that you can pronounce strings of characters before they do. The performances leave much to be desired. It would have been better for Harrelson to stick to comedies, since this attempt at serious acting is completely inconsistent with the goal. Torment is not what he seems to be able to portray. And it's safe to say that Demi Moore will never have to clear the space in his house for any Academy Awards. Why is she a movie star again? In part, which must be full of emotions, it does not convey anything. Only Redford is saved mostly unscathed. He is respectively slimy, but courteous and undoubtedly the best actor of the group. But he cannot save this film. Horrible script, lousy game, slowness, zero entertainment ... Indecent proposal is absolutely terrible.
