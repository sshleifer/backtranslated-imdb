Well, “built” by Doris Day (like Ethel S. “Dynamite” Jackson) mistakenly took Ethel Barrymore and falls in love with dancer Ray Bolger (like S. “Sam” Winthrop Putnam). Elderly Frenchman Claude Dauphin (like Philippe Fouquet) also digs Doris. Fair?? What were they thinking about? - This wildly inappropriate musical features Miss Day, beautifully performing the standard "April in Paris", and others. Of course, there is nothing better than her records in Colombia at the time; and nothing comes close to the awesome and forthcoming "Secret Love" of the Day. Although the material does not serve him well, it's nice to see Mr. Bolger speak. Some musical numbers are nasty. <br /> <br /> **** April in Paris (24/24/52) David Butler ~ Doris Day, Ray Bolger, Claude Dauphin
