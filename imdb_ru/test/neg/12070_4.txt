Once again, Woody Allen seems to be completely devoid of any inspiration, except to recycle himself. Here we have a bogus documentary (like Zelig), the structure of the film is a series of jokes (Radio Days, Broadway Danny Rose) shot in the 30s (Zelig, Purple Rose, Bullets over Broadway) about low life expectancy (Harry deconstruction) who believes that being a genius frees him from an idiot (the same thing). Given this film and the deconstruction of Harry, one wonders if Allen justifies his own actions with foster daughter Mia Farrow; Yes, I was a jerk, but I'm a genius, so you have to love me. <br /> <br /> Allen has shot only two good films in the past ten years; the beautiful, but inflated, Bullets over Broadway, and the excellent, but largely ignored, Manhattan Murder Mystery. His other efforts range from trivia (New York Stories, Mighty Aphrodite), to sharp but experimental (husbands and wives), to a clean fight (Alice, Scenes from a shopping center, Shadows and Fog, Celebrities, Smashing Harry). His films no longer even try to narrate, and his humor seems to be aimed at funny, not funny. After Harry's deconstruction, I stopped watching his movies in cinemas; after Sweet and Lowdown, I can stop renting them.
