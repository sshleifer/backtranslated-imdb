I will be honest and say that I stopped to watch it halfway somewhere, and then moved forward with several interruptions. then I came back here and read many of the reviews already made .... <br /> <br /> maybe it's just me, and I can't help it, but this cartoon for North American society seems to be aimed at “let's save them from themselves, ”and Iraq immediately comes to mind. it seems to me that this is an excuse or part of another invasion with "good intentions." <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this woman is a man who does not like herself, and I am frankly irritated by her portrait of trying to arouse pity and “feel” her. Well, in this case, it could never happen, because, as the history teacher mentioned here, I need to know why her family was so rich that it was above average, managed to keep it (maybe they played both sides?) and send her to Paris !? Now, if it was done after the poor girl’s biography, I could see that I had certain emotions. but in its current form + release time is just a propaganda film; what is worse, after his cartoon, he covers the “soft” side of shades too well for his own good to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are such clichés regarding gays. Well, a woman who fights for her rights should not have at least some compassion for the weaker sections of society, how is she ??? from the point of view of a member of the ruling class, this message clearly indulges him. <br /> <br /> I give him only 2 stars, because his production and related things. The propaganda film is obviously interested in convincing and manipulating my thoughts, and, as a rule, it is well done, appealing to certain visual emotions that I cannot deny that I might have.
