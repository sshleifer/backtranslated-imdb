Without John Reese-Davis, I have to admit that it will never be recorded on my instrumentometer. But, despite this single fact, this is not a bad little thriller, given the low budget, low quality effects, tough game and aspects of the Sci Fi Channel. The effects of blood are very convincing, and the Chupacabra actually looks realistic ... no matter how you think, the Chupacabra looks like it's one beautiful Chupacabra. <br /> <br /> In addition to the positive aspects, it looks like Kolchak: Night Stalker (Darren McGavin, remember?) meets the Boat of Love, but despite the excellent cheese of this work, it still contains something resembling a plot, and actually trying to win your respect by making you laugh and roll your eyes. <br /> <br /> Despite the inconsistency of this work, I still managed to find some pleasure here. Maybe you too. <br /> <br /> He ranks 5.2 / 10 on a Made 4 TV scale. <br /> <br /> He ranks 4.1 / 10 on a scale of films from ... <br /> Fiend:
