I entered here immediately after watching this film, feeling that it is so terrible that at least its reviews can be interesting. But all of you, scoundrels, like it. And so, since I want the work to be done correctly ... <br /> <br /> From the first shot, the film shows its disdain for concentrating the attention of the audience, showing a completely unremarkable picture of an inappropriate bridge for a long time, a lot of time. Then there is a slow ride on a skateboard, which is at least a little cool, but then compensates for this glimpse of excitement by imposing the most disgusting soundtrack song I have ever heard. Some girl squeals in a whisper of French, like knocking sheets of plywood. Whoever decides that he should be there, never skateboard, I guarantee it. He seemed to be there to test the patience of the audience. <br /> <br /> From there, the film is 50 percent slower. Do you know what is worse than a free shot in slow motion? Useless slow shooting * nothing happens. * Here is the guy walking along the path. Here is a guy sitting. Here is a guy looking around. Here is a guy looking at another guy. After a while, I started watching the film at double speed, bringing it down when people appeared on the screen, participating in a real dialogue, which was rare. One day, surprisingly, I slowed down the film to find out what the girl was talking about, and found that the camera shows her conversation, but this sound was another terrible, terrible song, and her real voice was not heard. <br /> <It reminds me of the wonderful advice that I once heard about writing - if you have nothing to say, do not use fancy tricks to pretend like you're doing. Get back to work and think about what to say. All these camera stunts, such as slow motion and strange lighting, lenses and fancy music, are what the lack of content looks like and sounds like. Many people seem to have bought it and feel emotional seriousness and deep meaning, but I think they are projecting it onto a film that does not do any work related to its creation.
