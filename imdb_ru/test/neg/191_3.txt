I never heard of this movie when it first came out. It must have sank right away. : o) I saw it on cable when I was sick in the hospital, so I had almost no energy to watch it, let alone turn on the channel. Better choice than channel style. ; 0 (. Filmed on the spot, this travel film was supposed to be on the Travel Channel. The plot has been reworked from farces from the 30s and 40s aboard the ship. It seems the actors have been reworked since the 50s. Donald O'Connor , star musicals and Edward Mühler as a card shark. As for the basic composition, Walter Mattau still plays the same role as in “Guys and Dolls”, or was it the role of an orphan? But it’s just that I don’t take a man of his age with me. As for Jack Lemmon, he plays his p so straight up that he can barely fall and slide during the dance. And, as already mentioned, Dayan Cannon is incredibly attractive, like another swindler, swimming with his mother, who thinks Walter is rich, although he thinks she is rich. Elaine Stritch plays Dayan's mother, another correspondence of the fifties.The most funny thing is the feud between Brent Spiner as a powerful and snotty director of a cruise, who immediately sees Walter as a poor dancer and spends money. his time trying to get him fired, so he had to pay for free passage. In the end, although he gets his comeuppances. Meanwhile, Jack is idle, meets an attractive woman with mutual attraction, but their case is broken by Walter's lie that Jack is a doctor when he was actually a retired department store buyer. But, finally, two men go to the sea in a rubber boat to intercept her seaplane, and all is well. It seems that there is no primary player under the age of fifty.
