I saw it in my local supermarket, and I knew that Debra was in it, so I decided to buy it (without the support of this sexy woman!) The plot and actions in this film were terrible (except for Debra Wilson; and I am not just I say that because I love her, she was seriously the only actor or actress who had some emotions in their play and voice!) At first I did not understand why the wife did not return her car instead of working at random so . It was so stupid. And this is Los Angeles (NO ONE saw her kidnapped on a public, residential street - NO ONE ... yes, this is real!) Also in the park, when Charlie stole a woman’s cell phone (for some silly reason), they were obsessed with him (and at some point) when they did it, they took him under his sights - through a cell phone! In fact, I doubt that LAPD will try hard to do this for a stupid mobile phone! A lady could go to one of the many cell phone booths and replace her! Children's acting skills were also lame (I think they read from a cue card or someone behind the camera whispered their lines), because they were asked questions, they looked around, and then answered in a dubious voice (i.e., do "Miss Daddy?") Besides, how could all these snipers on trees and on rooftops in Los Angeles be if they have not been seen?! I see that they play in the USA at 3 o'clock in the morning. <br /> < br /> Debra Wilson's fanatics will love her role. She is the only actor with any real acting skills (Debra, honey, ne Stop making these cheap D-classes, go straight to the videos ... maybe this will change with the upcoming Whitepaddy movie.) She added some jokes there (for example, when one of her bosses comes up and asks her who she is talking to, she screams to his computer and says: “Damn it, Charlie!”) I gave him 4/10 ... 4 only because of Debra's good acting skills.
