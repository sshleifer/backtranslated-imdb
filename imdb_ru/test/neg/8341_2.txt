I saw the trailer for this film before watching the Titanic, and I have to admit that it whetted my appetite. The volcano seemed quite spectacular and full of promises. But what a wet idiot. Roots is not a word for the script, and the characteristics are often ridiculous. A silly daughter is just incredible - she should be 13, not 4. But then scientists, firefighters and minor characters no longer offer. This film is right in front of Cruise II and Twister, but only because these two films are absolutely terrible. This has some reasonable consequences, but overall itâ€™s 1 out of 10. Don't waste your time.
