“The Curse of the Forty-Nine” does not really deserve a long and detailed review, so I’ll just make some random observations on this: <br /> <br /> - Cool opening credits <br /> <br /> - No plot. <br /> <br /> - Is there anyone who has ever seen a horror movie before and cannot guess, during the first 20 minutes, who will survive and who is not among this group of walking stereotypes? ? <br /> <br /> - Hey, this new girl (Alexandra Ford) is pretty hot! <br /> <br /> - Richard Lynch (invented to look about 100 years old) and John Phillip Low have fun, mocking cameos. <br /> <br /> - Karen Black plays a more important role, but she’s not funny - she’s rather awkward. <br /> <br /> - Martin Cove is on the screen in about 40 seconds, but still got his name on the cover of the video. Did they pay him for this appearance or was it the other way around? <br /> <br /> - I hate cheap computer effects in horror movies. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4.
