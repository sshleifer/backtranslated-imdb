Fred Astaire re-elected with Rita Hayworth a year after their big hit for Columbia "You will never get rich." It was the film that put Hayworth on a Hollywood map, but her performance in this faded romantic musical hardly makes it clear why she suddenly became so popular. Down Buenos Aires, the owner of a tyrannical hotel demands that his four daughters marry in the order of age; Someone might think that the film takes place in the 18th century, but no, this is the modern year of 1942. Aster is a former player who has become a player who has returned to dancing to earn some money, embroiled in imitation of a fan of the letter to the beauty of the cold society of Hayworth. Fred looks at Rita with a fraternal smile, but she looks so much like a mannequin (in sync with the lips of her songs, like a doll with wide eyes) that all romantic sparks crumble quickly. However, they dance together quite comfortably, and Jerome Kern's score is not memorable, but not too bad. ** from ****
