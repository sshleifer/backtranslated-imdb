Could there be a worse movie? Even Ed Wood, in his terrible worst, could not come up with something so bad. Cheesy, stupid, wordy, ridiculous ... and these are good moments. I saw this trash back in the early 80s, when I was incredibly bored from the very beginning, and I actually sat through all this without breaking my head, although this would probably be a more pleasant experience. I really remembered it because it was so bad. In a sense, it saddens me because some of the best directors began their work with creating television films (for example, Spielberg), and for them it was a wonderful way to get their original material before the public, but such nonsense like this just completely killed the whole process.
