When I first saw this film in the theater, I was so angry. It totally exploded in my opinion. I haven't seen him for ten years, and then I decided that, damn it, we'll see. Now I watch all Hellraiser films to see where things went wrong. I guess it was a continuation of 5, which was the first to do everything, "I'm in a dream, oh my god, I see strange things, oh no, what happens, oh, it's a dream, oh, it's not a dream, oh wait “I see something creepy, oh, never mind” - a shit plotline. These sequels do not even require the box to be opened, or adhere to the rules of the first 4 films, which, if you saw the pinhead, you pretty much screwed up and are dead. The first 3 HellRaisers adhered to this storyline, which primarily made it so scary. Nothing fantastic, nothing strange, the box opened, they came. Kirsty was the only one who could agree on her, primarily because of Uncle Frank. Then, because she had information about tsenobitah. This film, at least, is trying to stick with it all, although it was a bad story, it was still a bit of a hell. No, I am sure that the fifth part was the first part, which completely and completely destroyed the series “Hellraiser”. Now they are reworking one, and I don't even think I will watch this. Oh whom I joke, I will probably be and probably will be disappointed .... again.
