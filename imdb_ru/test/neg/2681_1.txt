Taste is a subjective thing. Two people can watch the same movie, one of which loves it, and the other hates it. As for “Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,” I fall into the latter category. <br /> <br /> I am of the opinion that in 1978, John Carpenter shot one of the best horror films of that decade, which despite its flaws, still holds up well in the 21st century. He used many of the old horror film devices, but used them in original and effective ways. He had no complaints about the fact that it was something other than a movie about a runaway mentally ill, haunting nanny on Halloween night. And yet there were “ideas” in the film, but they were finely represented and did not hit your skull. He combined the myths of the eerie festival with the reality of what happened in history, and did it with surprising ambiguity. <br /> <br /> The “filmmakers” of this “film” will probably not even understand this previous paragraph. That is why we saddled us with this pitiful and inept piece of disposable celluloid. Direction, script, acting are the lowest layers imaginable. This is a type of film that is so dull and nauseous that it makes you want to crawl back into the womb and die. It’s also very, very sad to see a veteran British actor Donald Pleasant spend his acting skills on this puddle of a movie about spit. He seems to have exhausted all his energy and accepted the fact that this could be his last film. Maybe this is what killed him.
