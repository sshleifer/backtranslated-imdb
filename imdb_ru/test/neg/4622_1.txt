This is one movie that represents all the bad in the movie business. The actors are pathetic and the script is terrible. The special effects, if any, are made so badly that it would be better to do this instead of cartoons. Besides, it's great! I think that the filmmakers wanted humor in it, but I laughed only when I saw Patrick S. with long hair and bright costumes that everyone had. The scenes at the end were good, but they were not part of the film. At the end, you ask yourself: "Why did I spend my time and money on this nonsense, when I could watch the plants grow or the clouds move." I don't think I'm some kind of critic or something, but this is a really bad movie! DO NOT LOOK! DANGER OF DEEPENSE LOADING!
