Obviously, the comments above this fawn over the film were made by someone from the team. I do not remember ever seeing a film that is more offensive to talented actors or spectators. In my 30 years of watching movies, this is the only one I've ever left. Bad humor, bad jokes, bad jokes, bad editing, bad plot, etc. Note for the producer: it is never funny to hunt people for reasons of race. It's great that you tried to be politically correct by including all races, but you still hunt people by race, and that is disgusting.
