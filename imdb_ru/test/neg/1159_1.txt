Ed Gein, one of the most famous serial killers of all time, he was the inspiration for famous movie killers such as Norman Bates, Leatherface and Buffalo Bill. He is also one of the sickest and most troubling killers of all time, I watched a documentary about him, so I know his story well. When I saw this, I was curious, because I thought it should have looked like a documentary reconstruction, but I have to say that it was just a pathetic waste of time. Firstly, the facts are completely wrong, with some minor exceptions, and secondly, it was just a stupid Hollywood story when these horrible murders really happened and they just turned into a cheap dollar. Not to mention that if they were going to make it in a horror movie, it was bad! <br /> <br /> Ed Gein, he lives in a small town in Wisconsin called Plainfield, but he has a little secret that the whole city is exposed, he digs up corpses, and also brutally kills people. Bobby, the deputy, is searching for Ed Heine, but no one knows who the killer is, first he just finds the crime scene behind the crime scene. But everything becomes “personal” when Ed begins to get involved with the family and friends of the police. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film was just a mockery and completely offensive to a true story. I always thought that a bad acting game was a necessary tool for a horror movie, but for this story it had to be a movie with better actions, not to mention that it should have been a documentary rather than a silly cliche, a horror movie. Please stay away from this movie, it is completely pitiful and does not fit the story of Ed Gein. <br /> <br /> 1/10
