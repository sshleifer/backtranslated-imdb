I loved the original, I watch it every year. but the second part is garbage, and it should never have been done. The second could work if there was another place. The son was not the original or even did not behave like one of the children of Eddie. The third was too smart for Eddie, who downplayed his father. None of the other children where in it. It could have been much better. I don't know why they even tried to make this movie. There was no continuity from the first film. I will pretend that this does not even exist. Sadly, the actors did not even see that they were fools. Really bad movie. I just think I spent an hour or more on a bad movie, and I really love all the national lamp films.
