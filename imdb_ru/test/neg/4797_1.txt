I went to see this movie about Matchstick Men, actually buying tickets for Matchstick Men and moving on to another, because it looked like a funny movie with action movies, romance, thrills, jungles and exotic locations. They had it all, but just like in many films with the concept of the story. <br /> <br /> All I can say is WHY, WHY, WHY they made not just a direct story, and not some juicy story from the past. <br /> <br /> Here are all the films from what I saw in the film: Of course, Indiana Jones and The Romance with a Stone, but also True Lies, Proof of Life, this old 1980s film by Tom Selleck. , Bananas (Woody Allen) and Hero (from the use of digital add-ons). <br /> <br /> PS The only scene in the film that was cool is when the central character finds that her room exploded.
