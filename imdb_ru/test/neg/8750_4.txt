Despite all its flaws, I tend to be charitable towards “Things”. There is a nugget of interesting, creepy, claustrophobic history of Hitchcock style. Put it in the hands of a writer such as Theodore Sturgeon or (if you prefer the British perspective) Robert Bloch, or the guy who wrote “Triffid Day”, and you could have an unpleasant, disturbing little story about jokes that was the best thing in anthologies of horror books and unknown stories. <br /> <br /> However, someone decided to tell this story as a full-length film, a cheap one, the second in a row, and therefore most of the potential is wasted. Such a story really needs a sturgeon-like voice to bring out interesting character traits in the best light. His classic story “-Widget-, -Wadget- and Boff” is an example of how he can put together an isolated group of “ordinary” characters and, in a space of 40 pages, can turn them into the most fun, sympathetic and charming people you have ever seen. greeted. A good writer can, with the help of a few selected words, make the reader “see” some of the most vivid and memorable events that have ever been to impress his emotions. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a film in which some of the most Irritating and incredible characters that have ever been created are mixed and made to interact unconvincingly: “Where did this come from?” moments that just lie there. (That is, a blond psychic, stating that "You are all evil, and I hope that you are destroyed!"). We get a lead rhythm and slow blocking of movements, as well as boring sets and tough actors. I blame the director for the "hard and small" role. All of them are 3rd rank actors who have never taken a big place, but they are also “real” actors, and a good director could get better results from them. We are not attracted to lesbian overtones, which make the viewer feel uncomfortable and exploited without any feedback. (If I am going to use my basic instincts and feel guilty about it, I want to make things better than this one). And we get about an hour of creepy build-up, scattered in about 35 seconds, in one of the worst anti-climaxes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> What's good about "Thing"? Hmm ... well ... some of the pictures of the sorcerer's head, silently pronouncing his directives, were quite effective. A mean and insightful widow sounded believable (even if I wanted to put a sock in her mouth). The first scene, where the big, “simple” hand of the ranch silently turns on a fat cowboy and kills him, had a bit of a shock value, because the plot took the trouble to establish the big guy as a rather sympathetic character. And, as I said earlier, the idea that the insidious power of the past makes members of an isolated community confront each other is a good idea and can maintain interest far above the actual merit of poor work. <br /> <br /> What it most certainly is. <br /> <br /> But, as I said, I tend to be charitable, because the director probably worked with an unfavorable budget, frantic time constraints, and the best actors he could find for money. Heaven knows how future generations will judge light crap, such as The Cave, The Wrong Turn, or the remake of The House of Wax 40 years later. I hope they will be friendly to our own tastes in supporting our generations of cinema waste.
