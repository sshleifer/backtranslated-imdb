The characters were as extraordinary as it hurts. A little skinny geek, a funny African-American with a dull twist, a cool white guy with sympathy for cars and a handsome leader who ends up with a pretty girl. Actors are mediocre at best. Ecsept from Norton, who does a pretty good job as a bad guy. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is also a stupid and waste of time. This is generally a group of spoiled boys using the world as a playground, where every safe in a big house is what keeps them on the table with food. I mean, why make a living when you can rob people? <br /> <br /> And ... who the hell spoils the traffic lights in a major European city ?! And in the middle of the day FRIGGIN!? Think about all the damages, not the deaths of innocent civilians. What about all the ambulances and fire engines? <br /> <br /> I didn’t sympathize with the main characters, and if Mr. Wahlberg gets his blood gold or not, I couldn’t give less farting.
