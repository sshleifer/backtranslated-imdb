Throughout his career, Hitchcock has made great films; it was not one of them. <br /> <br /> A man knows too much, his daughter is kidnapped to ensure his silence, and at the denouement everything is decided to the accompaniment of a shootout and drama on the roof. <br /> <br /> Anyone who saw the Fritz Lang films of the 1930s - “M” - comes to mind will know how far this urban tale of crime and conscience lags behind what has already been done in this genre at the time. In general, most of the dramatization and acting skills are completely amateurish, which undermine any sense of threat, darkness and depravity that Hitchcock may have sought to instill. <br /> <br /> For what is worth watching, the sequence associated with the shooting at Albert Hall. As soon as this begins, it seems that the film was transfused. The camera work is lively, the cuts are interesting, and the way everything is combined with the culmination is virtuoso. Here you can see the future master: Hitchcock effortlessly organizes all the resources to get an impressive and memorable effect: when a scream is heard, you really feel and hear it.
