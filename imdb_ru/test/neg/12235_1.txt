This film is a terrible fake attempt. His attempts to parody various sports films are half-baked and not at all ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Even things that should be fun — for example, a kicker from India, who always wears a traditional dress on top of her uniform — is not. really funny. The fact that the football team learns and gets good grades, which makes the coach mad, also does not cause laughter. <br /> <br /> The plot that the traditional loser gets another chance, coaches a football loser in football. The team really had potential as a fake. This is a classic and banal sports theme. But, alas, the script was too weak for ANY cast. And this cast is no exception. <br /> <br /> Women in bikinis and underwear are freely used by women, so not everything is so bad. <br /> <br /> But Animal House or Talladega Nights, it is not.
