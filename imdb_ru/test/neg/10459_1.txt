As noted by other authors, it was a very, very bad film (given that it is friendly for children). FX was low grade, they should have spent $ 1 on cola. As is typical for these D films, most of the victims die and leave a riddle, with the exception of one happy soul and, of course, the main role. I hope this money cost Boxliftner, a really big step down compared to Babylon 5. It's nice to see what happened to Buck Rogers, but, damn it, it was not enough even for him. â€œIt was so bad, and on older actors one could even say that they thought it was also bad. Do not look. <br /> <br /> ***** Attention, the spoiler is lower **** <br /> <br /> This thing haunted everyone she was chasing, and yet Boxlietner left ... that was pure xs . And the ending? How the hell were the children there with him? It was too much nonsense.
