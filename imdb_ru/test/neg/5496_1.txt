R.I.C.C.O. dumbest movie ever made I can't believe my dad bought this shit. This film should not be made. If this film was widely known, believe me, it will be on # 1 spot of the worst IMDB. Acting is terrible, it's scary, and therefore horror. This piece of shit had no horror at all. This is a city action, which is funny, because I could swear it was a comedy. When people were shooting, I could not stop laughing. I am the only person who reviewed this, and I hope that I am the last. Only with this vote, I hope that it will come first in the worst case !!!!!!!
