The lame B-horror, who is too damn serious about his subject, concerns an aging dear who turned into a night-time tenant who came to rent a room from her. When this tenant is killed, the mother has to go out to feed her on her own, which causes some family stress, and also attracts some attention from the authorities. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is that this film was supposed to bring Funny. He could not do this, although he had some light bloody effects and effects of the magic of Shloka to please the crowd of viewers. I have seen worse, but I would not give this report - 4.5 / 10.
