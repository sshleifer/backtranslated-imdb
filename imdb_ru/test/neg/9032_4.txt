Have you ever wondered why these guys - Seagalu, Stallone, Willis, and others - manage to survive all those skirmishes in which they outnumber? I think I understood that. Enemies always miss, but the hero does not. <br /> <br /> Seagal has a gun here, and he shoots half a dozen weights shooting at him from several feet. One of the heavyweights has a shotgun. Or maybe two of them are there. It does not matter much. Perhaps a thousand shotguns would explode at him, and Seagal would still appear with an intact tail. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to the battle with Mano, forget about it. Villains may or may not be armed with swords, knives, or a blunt object, but Seagal, with his skill in aikido, tempura, sushido, playing a game, or something else, shrugs them off with several dismissive strokes. He is not only a master of these external skills, but also his physical strength is Herculean. Not once did he break someone's long bones as easily as we broke a toothpick. One day he will break a guy's spine through his knee. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you something. (I immerse myself in the spirit of the film here because Seagal uses this line “I'll tell you something” several times with “What does this have to mean?”). These guys fully deserve the extinction in any good xenophobic handbook. They are all black, speak with illegible accents on the Jah-MAY-can, wear dreadlocks that really need shampoo, they are tortured and killed with aplomb, and that is the worst part. They are not Christians. Like this. They practice voodoo. <br /> <br /> In fact, the voodoo element is close to being the most interesting element of the film. They were well versed in the ritual - cigar smoke, spitting rum, sacrificial chicken. They only left a possession dance in which the spirit rides on the dancer. They should have read Metraux for voodoo. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the plot follows the usual agreements. What Jacqueline Bissett has done with practicing voodoo at the Depth is done here for a friend Segal. What was done with John Wayne when he was stuck between the trucks at McCo was made for Seagal himself. At the very beginning of the film, when Seagal makes a short speech about having seen too much senseless violence in his DEA career, so now he is happy in retirement, and when we met his friends and family, I tried to track his partners to see if I could choose which of them would be horribly killed or maimed to cause his desire for revenge. <br /> <br /> The action does not require special comments. But Charles, the Jamaican cop, played by Tom Wright, is really good. Wright has a significant range. Here he is an associate of dubious loyalty, rather sinister. But in the Pentagon Wars, he has a comic role that he perfectly emphasizes. <br /> <br /> Jamaicans never flew like villains from the movies. I do not know why. This is a small film market. And if you go to Jamaica, then stick to Montego Bay. However, if you want Jamaican voodoo drug dealers to be heavyweights, and if you are set to another typical standard action movie, this should be a satisfactory representation.
