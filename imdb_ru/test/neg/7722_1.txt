This is one of the worst films I've ever been able to make. Don't get me wrong, I love a good zombie movie, but it was not one of them. <br /> <br /> ... It is possible that (at least from the first scenes) Zombies from space were called 'Titty'. It has absolutely nothing to do with another movie or video game (as far as I can tell.) <br /> <br /> The best aspect of the film is how the two main characters can be covered in so much blood and remain so confused. I, of course, would advise to give this one, to skip and stay with safer zombies, such as “28 days later” or “The dawn of the living dead” (remake, of course, if you are not in serious marching action).
