Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld can become billionaires of their shows, the huge leftovers and fees they currently require Even members of the cast and the whole group of Friends have reached almost 7 figures per episode. Letterman’s earnings per show can solve most people's financial problems, and a week or two will take care of many for life. <br /> <br /> But they are all based on reliable supply / demand principles and financial advantages that they receive. bring your employers.
