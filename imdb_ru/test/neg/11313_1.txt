This morning I suddenly remembered that this film existed. I caught myself thinking, “Oh yes, there was Mr. Magu’s film, isn’t it?” This is even more surprising because I remember how after this dispute around this film (the advocacy group for the visually impaired said that this film is degrading). I even went to see this film on its opening day, because I am a fan of Mr. Magu and Mr. Nilsson, and I thought that it would be an excellent choice to play Mr. Magu. I even remember the opening animation credits, because I thought they were pretty funny. <br /> <br /> But after that, everything becomes completely empty. I think this is a rather sad statement about any film that it is so lame, so soft and completely helpless, that nothing can be remembered from this. I understand that Leslie Nilson is not always known for appearing in first-class comedies, but I saw him in Spy Film, Scary Movie 4 and Police Squad 3, and none of these films were great. , but I left at least remembering * something *. Mr. Magu, however, is completely empty. <br /> <br /> Now I wonder if the whole controversy surrounding the film was not really caused by the studio that produced it, hoping to create at least a small amount of interest in the film, which is completely useless.
