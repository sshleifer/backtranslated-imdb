Inglorious bastards - Tarantino's worst movie he ever made. It is full of its usual ingredient, that is, quick dialogue, brutal and sudden violence, but all this seems to be déjà-vu. Directing is typical of Tarantino, and nothing seems new. It is as if it was copied from his only masterpiece Pulp Fiction. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there is nothing new or exciting in “Inglorious Bastards”, it’s just a military drama that isn’t funny or brilliant, like “Pulp Fiction”. Presumably, Basterds is a tribute to Tarantino's spaghetti westerns Leone, but it seems to be irrelevant and inappropriate, especially with the continued use of large subtitles and throwing an audience balance.
