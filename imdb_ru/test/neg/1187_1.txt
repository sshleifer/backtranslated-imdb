This review took longer than me to watch this movie. This is just bad. The plot is terrible compared to the TV series. It is flat, funny and boring. <br /> <br /> It is clear that LoG ran out of ideas long before this movie caught on in green. Viewers should read this as an example of how not to know when to stop. <br /> <br /> Bad editing, bad music, bad game. Zero dynamism, unsophisticated chemistry. <br /> <br /> A film that doesnâ€™t know what it is, shot without any love for some mysterious goal that makes you depressed and feels angry because you spent so much money. br /> <br /> Obviously, LoG made an offer they could not refuse, or perhaps their ego just overpowered them. This is a cold marketing push that might have been better if LoG were more fresh and more inspired. <br /> <br /> However, I knew when to stop, and did. <br /> <br /> Please! Someone is trying to convince me of the intricacies of this film!
