As many know, this is the debut of the feature film by Edward D. Wood Jr. as a writer / producer / director / actor. I have been a fan of Ed Wood for several years. Although I do not like it as much as some of his other films, it was probably the greatest understanding that a cinema that has become public receives Wood in its lifetime. Everyone knows that he was a transvestite. This film is about sex change and how a transvestite can create conflict in relationships with loved ones. This film was far ahead of its time in considering this issue and how it works with it. Nevertheless, the film still contains Wood's pitfalls: poor dialogue, meaningless shots and special effects. Add the usual Wood overdose, in which Bela Lugosi spoke, and you have Wood's first attempt to become a director. <br /> <br /> The plot is such that the police inspector goes to the doctor after he discovers the body of the transvestite, committed suicide for advice on how to avoid further problems in this direction. The doctor tells him the story of Glen, who is also a transvestite. Glen wants to marry Barbara, but can not bring herself to tell her about his secret. He also tells the inspector about Alan, who is undergoing a sex change, because he really is more suited to being a woman. Bela Lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add some brief commentary on what is happening (Lugosi’s role is not really well defined and turns out to be the most likely means for Wood to get a star in her film, and Lugosi to get some cash). <br /> <br /> In general, the film shows the distinctive features of Wood’s career. He was clearly shot with a very small budget, and there were quite a few random things in it. It definitely has the feeling “this is so bad, this is good”. However, I must applaud Ed for his progressive thinking in making this film. Transvestitism and sexual change were not extremely open topics in the early 50s. Wood took a big risk in making the film, in which transvestites are portrayed as people who are not sex deviants, and reincarnate into a more human face.
