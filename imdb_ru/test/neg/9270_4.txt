This is a very strange film, a nameless cast, about which almost nothing is known on the Internet. He uses an approach familiar to those who have seen similar Creepshow, in that he introduces a trilogy of so-called "terrible" shorts and blends them together into a linking narration about people who participate in the segments leaving the bus. There is a narrator who talks about relationships, but his conversations add absolutely nothing to the mix and only add confusion. As for the stories themselves, well ... I swear, I have no idea why this film received 18 certificates in the UK, which would bring it into line with the types of Nightmare On Elm Street and The Exorcist. There is nothing frightening here ... there is neither blood, nor sex, nor nudity, nor even curses to revive the events, this is what you could show on children's television, and no one would beat your eyelid. I can only think that if he got the rating he really deserved (PG), no serious horror fan would have been seen dead with him, so the distributor probably suppressed the BBFC until they lost. In any case, here are three short stories: 1. A man becomes dangerously obsessed with his telekinetic car to such an extent that he alienates his bride. 2. A man who lives in a dirty apartment, for obvious reasons, was frightened when a living organism developed from his six-month tuna casserole. 3. A woman thinks that she found the perfect man using a dating service on a computer ... until he starts behaving strangely ... And now, you have it. Some of them are quite funny because of their outlandish prerequisites (my favorite activity number 2), but you get the feeling that they had to be a) frightening and b) moral games, unfortunately, they fail on both sides. To summarize, this film is an unclear curiosity ... for very good reasons.
