A horribly and completely ridiculous ghost-horror film that misplaced Anna Pakin, playing a neurotic teenager fighting "things that go in the dark" that haunt her and her family soon after moving to their new home in Spain (?!) . A little more than the geographically transplanted plagiarism of "Shining" and, most importantly, "Others", the weak plot of "Darkness" is basically your typical horror trait "mill" with several predictable failures. scares the viewers beyond a mile (so to speak)! Looking back, I believe that I should not have set my personal expectations so high that this film was really good, given the well-known fact that it was postponed for almost three years before it was finally released on Christmas last year in American cinemas around the world. country to what was ultimately slightly warm ticket sales and very harsh reviews from critics. When will the directors ever find out that there is something more in the films (horror or not), and not just a comical possibility of some financial gain? (Turkey-zero stars)
