I will give him a second chance, but was very disappointed in the first. It will not hold a candle for other series. It has a lot of meaningless dialogue that does not add to the storyline at all. I agree with the others that it seems that it does not create an interesting story. It is slow and difficult, and I only know what the Comanches are planning to do. Maybe all this will be connected in the second installment, but I will have to force myself to look at it and find out. I have Apache lineage from the Texas / New Mexico area, but I do not recognize much of what is happening. Maybe I’m just not aware of the facts, but this doesn’t help me a lot in learning.
