First, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. This may make you want to see it, but this is not bad in a good way. It is boring, implausible, poorly executed, ridiculously written and does not have the steep consequences of natural disasters. <br /> <br /> Worse, it is extremely patriotic, with no trace of irony or fun, steeped in the sense of Japanese uniqueness and sacrifice. Everyone throws the Japanese at a difficult hour. Especially the Koreans. The most noble characters choose seppaku - descending with their ship as their favorite island shells. “Only the Japanese think so,” says the Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> If this film in any way reflects the opinion of the Japanese about their place in world opinion, the first thing they need to do to solve this problem is to stop making films like this.
