Some directors cannot do wrong in the eyes of national critics, and this is one of the reasons why you should never pay attention to them. This film is a great example. Critics like director Eric Rohmer. <br /> <br /> This film is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager (“Pauline”), which she takes care of in the summer, and about the relationships they have with several men. , It is talk, talk, talk and talk more. <br /> <br /> For those who are looking at the cover and hoping to get the title, there are some quick naked shots and a couple of obscene words, but otherwise it’s a harmless French moral game. My friend lent me this tape. He thought he was shooting some sexy French movie, and was disappointed. I was just as disappointed because it was so boring. <br /> <br /> As it turns out, such great reviews are almost incomprehensible.
