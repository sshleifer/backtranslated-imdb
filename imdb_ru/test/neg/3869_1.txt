“You know - I was in some cities where the girls were not so beautiful. In fact, I was in some cities where they are completely ugly. But for the first time I was in a city where there are no Girls at all "I am sure that the fans of classic classics remember this phrase belonging to Vin ... from one of the magnificent seven TRULY (from the first film) ... <br /> <br /> Now I would like to rephrase it here. You know, I saw several films in which the plot is not so good. In fact, I saw several films in which the plot is terrible, but for the first time in my life I saw a film in which there is no plot at all. br /> <br /> OK. Maybe my above statement is a little higher, but, to be honest ... how can you call the plot the shit that happens in this movie. The bad guy (oh, don't ask me to call his name because I don't remember, and he's not even that close to Calvera, whose name and character are unforgettable ...) trying to build a church in the name of his dead sons who were killed in some battle, and this bad guy kidnaps the poor villagers to force them to build a church ... <br /> <br /> First of all, how big should the church be to make hundreds of villagers to build it ... is this some kind of Egyptian pyramid or something of this kind e? but well, let's dwell on the plot and the completely forgotten character of the bad guy and say a few words about the Seven ... <br /> <br /> Good old Chris Yul Brynner, always calm, always quiet, speaking less but clever talk no more (unfortunately). Oh no ... he is as calm as he was ... but now he is calm so fake that you simply cannot buy him. (imagine he meets old good friend Chico, whom he must save after so many years, and there are only a few "hello, hello" and not even a handshake (as I recall)) ... honestly, it looks more like a meeting of two strangers in some kind of internet chat, not a meeting between Chris and Chico. This makes "new Chris" more like a robocop or a terminator, rather than our favorite wise rapid-fire weapons ... <br /> <br /> I will not stop here talking about other characters. There is simply NO ... (imagine if such a strong actor as Yul Brynner is so fake that you can forget it, what other characters will look like) ... <br /> <br /> There are a few more attempts to give us prehistory for each of them ... for example, one is the beloved boy of women, the second is a man with a dark past whose wife was raped and killed by Indians, and since then he has killed everyone and everything that moves ... but none of these characters make no sense, or none of them can capture your heart. <br /> <br /> I remember that I was a small child, and when Oreilly (character of Charles Bronson) died in the first film in which I was crying. Here I just didn’t care about each of them ... even if they all died with the whole film crew, it seems I don’t care ... <br /> <br /> So, please, go and SEE THIS FILM ... I recommend it, because you won't have another chance to see something worse than that.
