Hello everyone - despite this, I am participating in a doctoral program in Indonesian politics and returned this semester after six months of work, most of which is in Jakarta. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of movies in general, so I went out as often as I could and bought tons of local VCDs while I was there. This one I saw in the theater, since it opened when I was there, and, fortunately, it soon closed. <br /> <br /> Who was the target audience for this film? Spoiled wives and daughters of the Indonesian super elite whose antics are poorly and ineffectively parodied? The overwhelming majority of Indonesians, who could never afford even one dish, not to mention a full meal, in the film’s main restaurant? Or homosexual Indonesian men, whose dilemma in the Muslim society of the country is reduced to an absurdly simplified sermon "how to respect yourself." <br /> <br /> If all this was not bad enough, the soundtrack was either recorded or mixed so ineptly that even Indonesian speakers of their native language could not hear many lines. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are looking for an ultramodern movie about gays from the region of the world that seems to be the least likely to produce such an animal, forget about it. “Westler” of the early 80s or “My beautiful self-service laundry” from the same era copes much more with the problem of homophobia and does it better, demonstrating what continuous, verbose scenes don't tell. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a sad waste of money in a country that still can neither educate all its children nor preserve their health.
