This film is, frankly, one of the greatest films of all time ... if you suffer from insomnia. This is a reliable way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time. As the movie progresses, viewers become unconscious and gradually lose sight of any plot the film may actually contain. This effect is certainly due to the lack of sweet action / sweet babies. <br /> <br /> Also, Mr. Eisenstein obviously could not master the art of editing. A vivid example of this is the scene on the Odessa steps. For no apparent reason, an event that in real life would take a matter of seconds turns into a seven-minute nightmare for any sensible viewer. This lack of editing casts a shadow on any realism throughout the film. Honestly, I saw more realistic editing when watching cartoons. <br /> <br /> Some people who commented on this title called “The Battleship Potemkin”: “One of the greatest films of all time” and “Indeed a masterpiece”. Well, I am writing this comment to convince readers to avoid watching this movie at all costs. My best guess is that my fellow Potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words on their resumes. Of course, they wanted to say: "One of the greatest nap festivals of all time" and "Truly an epic failure." <br /> <br /> In conclusion, do not waste time. If you are interested in watching movies of a much higher quality, go to www.youtube.com and watch the montage of Halo 3. If I played the movie “Battleship Potemkin” in the game “Killer on Guard”, I would shoot him in the face with a sniper rifle and then killed it with a dead body. PEACE!
