The previous review is largely focused on what Altman was NOT with this film. I have not seen him since its initial release, but I rarely spent two hours in the theater, feeling as miserable and disappointed as in this film. If any pretentious public theater tries to make a sci-fi version of Ingmar Bergman’s film, it could be so detached. I can't bring myself to give something that Altman made “1”, but this is probably the career nadir that had some great ups and downs. I would come out, but as a paid film critic I could not. (Think about it the next time you're jealous of film critics.)
