I honestly do not know what kind of legal or illegal creature they - the authors - used when they wrote this terrible piece of thrips! <br /> <br /> Cast - sucks Story - sucks Editing - sucks The whole premise of the movie is that a girl with extrasensory / telekinetic abilities faces a female lesbian vampire, you just need to be in a bad mood to watch at least 1 minute of this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I came across to watch it - it was here! network as part of the purchase with two pictures and a film that appeared after it was real, which I wanted to see. I quickly went through all this and was just amazed at how stupid this film was at double speed! <br /> <br /> Do not shoot, buy or watch this film ... the vampires in the film do not do. Suck as much as the whole film and production! <br /> <br /> If you want a good vampire lesbian film - Hunger with David Bowie, Susan Sarandon and Catherine Deneuve are a great movie to watch / own / rent this piece of pure crap
