Released at a time when Duvivier again walked from strength to strength, the Black Jack, sandwiched between the extraordinary Ay Au Roya de Cie and the dazzlingly awesome Sue Le Quille de Paris, is a confusion in which Duvivier himself Hate that not surprising. There is almost nothing to write about this rags. We can see that: <br /> <br /> 1. Orson Welles admired Duvivier. This may explain why Vellesian actors appeared in the films of Duvivier: Joseph Cotten in Lydia (1941), and here the completely useless Agnes Moorhead. For the first time <br /> <br /> I didnâ€™t like the performance of Moorhead! On the other hand, Wells borrowed his Desdemona (Suzanne Cloth) from "Au Royaume des Cieux" Duvivier for his Othello. <br /> <br /> 2. In any film, Duvivier has one or two decent sequences, and this is no exception: searching in caves, where Duvivier's meaning from secrets works wonders (for a short time), and then chasing when Dalio hits in Touch Duvivier felt in the unhappy end. <br /> <br /> For the rest, as my dear correspondent writes, this is a black joke.
