I cannot resist thinking that this is “damage” of Franco to the “Marquis de Sade” “Thousand Days of Sodom”. Are people (in this case, women) kidnapped to serve as slaves to a privileged elite? Check it out. Strange sex? Check it out. Torture, including spanking? Check it out. Victims selected at random to be killed? Check it out. <br /> <br /> Thank God, Franco did not back down and did not present to the audience a movie of admiration for coprology (and even coprophagy), another perversion that constantly arises in the tiresomely long and disgusting saga of de Sade. <br /> <br /> I rather hoped that this film would fall into the category of “so bad that good.” But even acres of bare flesh and numerous sexual contacts did not compensate for the gloomy dialogue, terrible game, elusive plot and - just to put on a tin hat - duplication And English subtitles (missing the belt and curly braces) from women's costumes). Alsation gave a very professional presentation. <br /> <br /> Of course, I could be wrong about the corner of de Sade. In the end, I could not understand that the actor playing the senior warden in the “prison” was transgender. I should pay more attention to the size of people's hands in the future. <br /> <br /> According to another reviewer, the film was banned in the UK. Well, this is clearly not the case, although it seems to me that the nipple piercing scene was cut out to satisfy the censors. On the DVD I watched, it was only visible on the Spanish trailer (which, if you're interested, I looked to compare it with English). <br /> <br /> The DVD also has an interview with Jess Franco, although you will need a better Spanish than mine to figure it out. If I am not much mistaken, it is not duplicated and does not have a subtitle. And this indicates that the person sodomizing the character Franco plays is Ajita Wilson, disguised as a mustache. A look of irony, given that he had removed the necessary appendage surgically.
