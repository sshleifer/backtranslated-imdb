ASTROESQUE (2 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> I have no idea what is meant by the title ... even less, what happens in this movie half the time ... so far, it still kept me kind of interested. This is a low-budget filming of "El Mariachi", shot at 16 mm ... and, whatever one may say, the shots are very well composed and visually stylish. Director, screenwriter and author of comics / artist Michael Allred in the lead role ... I think it is not surprising that the film looks good. Unfortunately, some acting games go beyond the bad ... and the rest are competent at best. Allred himself breaks away from the best ... but only because in fact he says little. He just wanders around looking cool most of the time ... or running from crazy cattle who are trying to kill him. The sound is also pretty bad ... almost as if it was unfinished in some places ... maybe they could not afford to pay for the music they planned to use? Strange, vaguely sci-fi plot ... similar in pitch to "The Man Who Fell to the Ground" ... but most of the film comes down to the standard scenarios "Run away from the bad guys" and "kill them-to" -They kill -you plot. Ultimately, too inclined to success, but not without interest for adventure lovers.
