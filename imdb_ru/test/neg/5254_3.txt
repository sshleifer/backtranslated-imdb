We showed this film in a club as an example of how classic literature can turn into one of the most terrible films of all time. Just the fact that the back of the box proudly announced the plot, which will be installed in the "techno-useless" future, should have been a sufficient hint. I think that this word describes the film itself, because no matter how much technology they tried to use to save this film, the effort was absolutely useless. Not to mention that our club consultant told us that he allegedly could not find a distributor for two years. <br /> <br /> This cinematic failure abounds in obscene dialogue, which is worse than passionate teenage poetry. The character of Beowulf changes halfway, which in no way is trustworthy, and whenever he is in the battle scene, he constantly turns over like a hyper gymnast. There is even, as they say, a “black guy,” whose attempts at humor are completely irrelevant. And, of course, the daughter of the outpost leader Grendel is terrorizing a total fox. Viper, whose breasts are exposed throughout the film. A fox who wants to fight a creature, but she never puts on her armor. And her favorite weapon is a small carving knife. And, despite their difficult situation, she is still dressed for dinner in a dress with a transparent skirt that exposes underwear in short shorts. There are several scenes that could go through the soft core of pornography, and in the second scene they even reuse the footage from the first. I thought that the image of Grendel was bad enough, but then came the end of the film, which showed CGI, which may be decent for the 80s, but completely ridiculous for the company of the late 90s. I could go on, but you all have to watch this movie yourself to get a ridiculous effect. <br /> <br /> The other members of the club and I managed to have fun, watching this, taking a cue from MST 3K and making fun of it. all the way to the end. I'm still shaking with extra weapons: a constantly rotating pizza knife on a pole.
