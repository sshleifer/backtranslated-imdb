The producers of Golan and Globus should be ashamed to publicly release this piece of garbage. I know it will sound boring, but compared to this, the first 1983 Hercules looks like a mature and exciting epic! This sequel is moronic, cheap, non-redeemable, childish, fake, inept and ill-functioning. Landmark in bad cinema and one of the few films that I have seen, REALLY deserve the lowest rating: no stars!
