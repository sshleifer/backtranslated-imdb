My website (theflickguy.org) calls “Michael” one of the worst films of the modern era. The following is an excerpt: <br /> <br /> “Each of the slums for some time in his life, it was Travolta’s turn. I still do not know what was the point of this terrible film. Nora Efron was a competent writer and director, so what the hell happened here? Archangel Michael makes a new rotation here and is depicted as a fist with fists, smoking a chain, a voluptuous swamp fornication, whose greatest contribution to humanity (after sending Lucifer to hell) was he invented to “stand in line”. Yes, how ridiculous and charming. I do not find it offensive, I find it stupid. In his defense, I can say that the ending was a little unsatisfactory, like the rest of this painful attempt at telling stories. "
