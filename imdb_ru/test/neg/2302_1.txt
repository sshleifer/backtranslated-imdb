Therefore, I shot this film in the hope of learning about the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the beginning of its independence from the Belgian government. I was excited to meet the figures involved in his story, mainly Lumumba and Mobutu. I wanted to see how the new Congolese government tried to unite the various groups opposing colonial rule, the political motives of each of them, the reasons for Belgium’s decision to grant the DRC their independence, as well as how the United States and the former USSR were involved. Unfortunately, all my questions remained largely unanswered. I believe that this film was made by people who, fleetingly acquainted with the history of the struggle of the DRC for freedom, saw a story filled with drama and emotions, and decided to use it. Then they tried to insert all the dramatic moments into the storyline, briefly filled them with dialogue, went to the set and shot it. I may be mistaken, but if this is so, then this is all the sadder, because then the creators must have simply become too attached to understanding everything, and ended up overshadowing all the details in an attempt to create a comprehensive story. Whatever the reason, the fact is that the film could be a temporary line of statements and facts printed on the screen. The film tells about each major event and tells the viewer the main idea of ​​what is happening, completely smoothing out the actual details in order to deal with big things. For example, there is a scene when Lumumba is captured by an increasingly rebellious army controlled by Mobutu. In this situation, the soldiers have three possible points of view: one that sympathizes with Lumumba, another that condemns Lumumba, and the other that stands in the middle, sympathizing with and still obeying orders. Accordingly, there are three soldiers who speak on the stage, reciting lines that accurately show their point of view. Then, to avoid the real tension that these opposing points of view cause, the writers simply inserted random shooting, more army guys appeared, and they just ended up beating everyone. This is the degree of reflection of the film. In most cases, each character simply declares its main motives, the other characters respond with their own, and that’s all. There is little talk through action; even what they say directly indicates soreness. It is hard to believe that the people represented really behaved this way. In addition, in the tendency of this directness, such things as political tensions between the factions boil down to a simple recognition of the fact - we never know what kind of factions they are, what they fight for, their power, mostly for anything, besides that they exist. Symbols are also one-dimensional and flat; Unfortunately, I don’t know if Lumumba was actually a freedom fighter, passionately committed to the ideals of Congolese unity, but after an hour or so of that film, I certainly didn’t believe he told me about it. The DRC, like many developing countries, has a complex and important history, especially in the period before and after independence. But telling these stories will not be useful if there is no recognition of the confusion of situations. Lumumba does not pay enough attention to these details and ends up with little to tell the viewer, except for the most common contours.
