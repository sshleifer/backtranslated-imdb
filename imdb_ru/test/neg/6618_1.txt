Why didn't you vote for the best picture of 1998? It must be the best movie ever. It makes something like Citzen Kane look like shit, oh well, Citzen Kane wasn't even colored! I like this movie, it should be the best movie I ever invested in. I'm still shocked that he was not nominated for ANYTHING! <br /> <br /> If 10 is the highest you can give, I give 20!
