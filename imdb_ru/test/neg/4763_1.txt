The film begins quite promisingly, the use of images and simple short clips conveys a larger story, which usually requires a significantly higher budget than the one here. However, it continued to excite me as it continued, combined with another overly hoarse voice like Max Payne in a film starting to look not so good. I hoped that it was just an introduction to the story. <br /> <br /> History is what really caught me and led to this film. The idea that a research scientist created a virus that actually protects cells that it infects from other infections was an interesting scientific idea. Then those subjects who had the strangest disorders looked for a scientist and offered him their experiments in public, made me think that this could be one very good little film. However, the introduction did not go well. <br /> <br /> It seemed that the change of pace occurred when the film turned to recorded interviews with the four main characters of the film - the subjects. Although the acting was not excellent, it seemed that throughout the film there were many opportunities for character development, and the recordings were made quite well with a diverse mix of characters. However, they disappeared from the film. They were not used again after a few short clips, and I felt that there was a missed opportunity to provide some excellent character development, thinking about them, but this is not so. <br /> <br /> Images are becoming increasingly detached from history, often repeating to represent what is still happening. This separation and repetition is reflected in annoying and distracting comments. He began to repeat the words one by one. Short, meaningless sentences and statement of not very significant or interesting scientific statements. If it was necessary to describe something, four or five words would be used, it was too long, repetitive, circular, looped ... you understood the idea. <br /> <br /> Now this could be a reflection of confusion and character, slowly sinking into their own thoughts, wandering due to lack of food and water. In fact, it made me completely switch to voice, and in the final stages of the film I found that I had not listened to some conversations. <br /> <br /> Several times when an event occurs, the camera shows all the characters one by one for their reaction, which seems to be somewhere between confused and thoughtful. There are repeated transitions from the same scene to the same scene, for example, a sleeping character turns black, and then returns to the sleeping character. Listen, we know that the character is sleeping, we know that time has passed, please continue. In general, there are too many atmospheric reductions and long, dangling frames to fill the time. <br /> <br /> The game was not bad, and the characters were fine, but they were not exploited or developed. When they interacted, there were some really interesting moments. For example, when one of them asks if they are hungry, the camera looks at each of them and returns to the group photo, they pause, look at each other, return to the camera and slowly say “No”. It raised a chuckle or two. Their dialogue was slow, glossy, and it was either absent altogether or completely unnecessary, it seemed that there was no average level at which a place for dialogue could become a hit. <br /> <br /> However, there were some good scenes, but they really were hard to find if you didn’t watch them in isolation, and this is something that almost looks like what happened with this movie. The film was viewed as a series of scenes, and not as a full story. <br /> <br /> Nowhere is this more visible than in the main storyline. Characters are infected with a virus that kills animals, which was designed for them. We are told that this is gradually evolving to something dramatic, and that is exactly what we expect. What we get is that the characters eat loads together, they all tear together, water flows out of the mouth in unconvincing streams, then they all fall asleep, these are the phases that occur at the very beginning of the film. Then they all say “Okay” when asked how they are and that's it. This is a virus and nothing else happens. <br /> <br /> Much more could be done with this film, much more could develop a virus and protect it from all harm. He could investigate the major changes of these characters as they become infected and infect them, he could develop these characters, show them how to make decisions and do things that are related to their character, shown in the interview memories. <br /> <The ending does not even embarrass, does not intrigue and does not make you think. It simply shows what is happening, and that is all, albeit in a long, drawn out style with an annoying voice over it. I really struggled with this film and watched as several members of the press came out (including one well-known television critic, leaving within the first twenty minutes), I stayed, but regretted the time lost.
