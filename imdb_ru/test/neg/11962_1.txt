I knew that I had a LONG 90 minutes when the introductory voice over the wrong pronunciation uttered the word "scarecrow" (it sounded like the Scare Crew). And, of course, 90 minutes later, after I saw the witnesses to the terrible game, the tiresome drama, the stuffed blows, which were not going anywhere towards the intended goal, but in any case “hitting” about this, Ken Shamrock’s stupid illogical end that I saw my life (well, no, I take the last one, in about a week). After going through all this, I cried openly that I couldn’t just go to Lacuna a la Jim Carrey and just wipe it out of my head. Any thoughts that director Brian Katkin could make a good movie, given the right circumstances that I had after watching Slaughter Studios, are now completely and completely gone from my head. <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Tara Platt and Lisa Robert topless <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand (available until September 22 2005)
