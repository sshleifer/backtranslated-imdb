My daughter liked it, but I was horrified that the character in this film smokes. It’s not horrible enough to see “product placement” actors, such as Bruce Willis, who smoke in their films - at least children's films should be more attentive! Interesting: was it intentional? Did the big tobacco sponsor the movie? What is needed to prohibit smoking in films? At least films intended for children and teenagers.
