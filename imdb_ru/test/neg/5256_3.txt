This film is highly recommended, but I'm not sure why. Although I am not a fan of Adam Sandler, with the exception of the first 50 dates, where he departs from his usual evil man's routine. Damon Wayans is an undercover cop, and Adam Sandler is the guy with whom he pretended to be friends for a year to ruin him. Naturally, Sandler is quite angry with this betrayal. Cue angry cry and stupid face masks from the king of pop. They end up on the run and, of course, become friends again after a big misunderstanding (involving Sandler shooting Wayans in the head - he survives, so he is bulletproof). Should I go further? You will understand what will happen if you watch it anyway. When our DVD player continued to pause (hey, it was $ 80 from the supermarket, okay?), It was commented that the player knew that the film was boring and refused to play it.
