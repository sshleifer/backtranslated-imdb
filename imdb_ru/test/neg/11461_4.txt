The continuation of the above - and the last entry in the Haris series - is generally a bit more pleasant, but also more ingenious (hell, we even have a singing barmaid / hostess!): Peter Kou is easily the least charismatic about the various Egyptian high priests we saw during of these films, and that Martin Koslek, as his minion, is not interested in the process; Kurt Katch is thus burdened with a ridiculous accent, because the man who discovers the recently reincarnated Princess Ananca: the latter, in the image of Virginia Christina (later widely used actress), gets her most significant “role” and, indeed, the sequence of her resurrection from the marshes - the main point not only of this film, but of the whole series. Unfortunately, even here Cheney can do little, because, as I said, the emphasis is on Ananke; his Mummy (to which he most often returned to Universal - except, of course, for his signature role as Wolf Man!) remains, without a doubt, his least memorable monster for the studio.
