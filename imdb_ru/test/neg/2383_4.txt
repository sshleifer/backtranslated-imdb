Correction of Synopsis: The End does not show that Ben is traveling online for guys. He is looking for Arabic courses at the Presido Military Academy in San Francisco. Perhaps join the war in Iraq as a translator. (For your information, many of the disgraceful layoffs from “Don't ask, don't speak, were translators” (now they are mostly lacking) Ben also spoke Russian. A good time capsule in Manhattan, but quite a bit of unreality here. , a good laugh at the social skills of the Lame and the sad image of the “Grown up” twenty things that do not go beyond the student party regime. Also a brief study is always a scene change in Manhattan. (somehow she always stays close to the edge of BS). <br /> <br /> Watch together the films “The Englishman in New York” and “The New Twenty”, which are good for nostalgia. I think that the film “Twenty” shows how blurry there is between gay and passion, and evolving. <br /> <br /> These two films are “Time travel for gays, of course!”. Enjoy
