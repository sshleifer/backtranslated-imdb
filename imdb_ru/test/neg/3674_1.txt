Val Kilmer is almost nowhere in this film - he was lucky! He plays maybe 30 seconds of screen time, and his role is completely irrelevant. After watching the film, I could not tell you what “role” he plays in the film !! ?? Well ... they suck you in the first hour, plunging you into dark underground tunnels. Creepy movies made in dark underground tunnels easily drag most people to last the first 30 minutes to an hour. Then you will begin to wonder: “Why am I watching this?” I remember thinking how easy it is for a director and a director to easily use dark underground labyrinths to create a movie. Just shoot people wandering in dark tunnels, and you instantly get the "unknown". But this is where this movie goes no further! We all wonder what happens at night, but in this film there is nothing in the darkness except darkness. The story is even worse. Obviously, there is a story in the film that I learned about after watching the movie. But the film uses such a bad dialogue that it was clearly not shown during the show. I still do not understand what the writer / director wanted to say. Have any children been trapped underground in a lost sister in Russia? What for? Are they in our time - simultaneously with the characters? Are these ghosts? <br /> <br /> It was an absolutely horrible film that attracted me to write my first IMDb review to warn others not to appear.
