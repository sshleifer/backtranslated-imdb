In the hockey game that I play and watch, there is something called “speed”, and the real hockey scenes in this weak-willed film aren’t even suitable for shooting. Add to this the storyline, which is cliché, predictable and more stupid than stupid, with some of the loudest music of the 80s, which stuns your feelings in every scene, and you get “Youngblood”. Oh, Keanu as a French Canadian, whatever. Give me Dunlop, Brayden and Hanson anytime ... ONE of the TEN.
