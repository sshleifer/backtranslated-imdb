You get most of Stephen Segal's environmental concerns and some breathtaking mountain views along with scenes with cow boys (or, alternatively, use parts of any remains of the HORSE WALLET). Then you add a large piece of the OUTBREAK virus or similar (note that it should be more deadly and at least biological hazard level 4) wrapped around the fat leader of the Militia group. You add one teaspoon of martial arts, as well as explosions and shots to taste. Add classic red Indian herbs for added flavor. Serve immediately. <br /> <br /> What is the name of the film that you get? Patriot. Perhaps the worst movie of Steven Seagal. I am sure that Seagal tried to say something in this film, besides the usual “I cook” (but also a former cat), but his recipe was confusing, and the taste was terrible.
