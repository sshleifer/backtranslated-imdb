I think the problem with some of the reactions to this film is that - with some exceptions - they do not focus on the main separation, therefore, on the main split in the audience. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, there are those who are attracted to the visual design, beautiful costumes and various elements included in the film. Some fans of children's films love color and animation, as well as all not terrible "magic" effects that change the shape of animals and so on. Some cultural vultures like complex references, layers of different folk elements and the fact that they can watch Zhang Ziyi's singing and quasi-imitation in two different languages ​​in what was really intended for a children's comedy. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are those who say that the children's film should make sense, that the combination of fairy tales is not a fairy tale at all, and that it is easier to believe in magic when enough thought and care has gone deep into the technical aspects so that make it real. <br /> <br /> In other words, ideas can be beautiful; but when you put them on stage, they have to deliver. Here they are not. <br /> <br /> A good fairy tale - from any country - has a clear story, point of view and characters that interact strongly with each other. It lacks them all. Several sophisticated gestures to opera, Western and Japanese, can not replace a continuous theme. <br /> <br /> As a fan of fantasy, I have to say that I sat among the turkeys and loved some, but this one is really trying to do too many things — cheap. A room in Zhang Ziyi to try to add a bit of glitter to the exotic flower syndrome. Another problem is not that there is no plot; there is half the storyline, which means that you continue to retract, and then fall again, when another not very dramatic dance number begins. <br /> <br /> All the characters seem to know that they play the main roles in the movie. If you don’t like watching other people's amateur videos, this is not good. I would like to check it out on real children; I think they would throw it on Uproar in Heaven in about 20 minutes.
