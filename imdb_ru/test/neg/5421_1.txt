Oh, man! I really crushed Manhunt in space. I think this flopper is deservedly worse than Manhunt. It led nowhere, and the growth of the mushrooms was more exciting than this trip. <br /> <br /> Poor Cleolanthe She misunderstood. Rocky is smug and cracks down, and, fortunately, there is no mention of Winky about his "fun nightlife." Then there is Bobby. You decide who is more annoying: Bobby or Winkster? Personally, I throw them out of the gateway into a black hole no earlier than subject them to deadly flesh eating alien mutants. <br /> <br /> At least there is Vienna. She's just a space girl!
