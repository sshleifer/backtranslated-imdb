This film is really very bad, it is not very well made and is an attempt at something brilliant, but Iâ€™m not sure what. I watched it and was very disappointed. He promised a lot, but delivered nothing. The characters are small and wooden, and the music, if you can call it that, is terrible. There are, of course, all creatures and animated creatures, but they are so poorly made that it is unlike anything other than a third-level movie. This is a real shame that more attention could not be given to special effects, and not to the fact that everything and the end of the entire film, I agree, but in the film that is based on them, this is a very important factor. For me, a very sad attempt, and should be avoided.
