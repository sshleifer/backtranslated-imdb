The main problems of "Saw" are associated with huge script errors that only a non-critical viewer can avoid. The main question: what is the purpose of the killer that he lay in the middle of the floor? The film tries to show that the killerâ€™s goal is to harm and destroy his victims, he loves to play with other people's lives and feel control over their fears and morons. So why is he just pretending to be dead between the two main characters? Awesome chance: can a person pretend to be dead for more than one or two hours without moving a single muscle or even breathing without being detected by two people in the same room? There is no point in this except being the last (d) effect of the film. It seems that the killer always has control over the plot, and if it lies like a dead body, it is impossible. Finally, it does not work. The right place for the killer was to be a dark and untouchable shadow behind the false shadow (nurse), and not the floor of the white room. The director should not have shown the face of the killer, and perhaps the place where he was hidden. Then the film will be a good thriller. However, Saw is just a fiasco. Hitchcock, please come back.
