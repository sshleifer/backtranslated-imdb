I'm not a big fan of the Spielberg / Cruise version of this film. And so I have to add a more modest version of Latt / Howel. With Thomas Howell, there was more heart and more sympathy than Cruz in the lead role (at least in my opinion). Now it is difficult to imagine, until you drop everything that is in the version of Spielberg, worth more than a thousand dollars. There will be nothing, no special effects, sets and cruises. Because I doubt that in the version of David Michael Latt something is worth more than a cool grand. So comparing apples to turnips, I think I should go with turnips. At the very least, it gives independent films a chance in the epic science fiction disaster market.
