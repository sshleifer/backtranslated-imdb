OK, I watched this movie. Someone should kick me. WHY should Olsen twins insist on subjecting the world to this rotten torture? It was another movie in which we watched the Olsen twins travel to exotic places, meet nice guys, look cute and make everyone drool because of them. I don’t know about the USA, but in my country it’s considered extremely stupid to jump on the bike of the guy you met 10 minutes ago. although now I am convinced that these girls will never learn to play, I very much hope that one day we will see a film with an original, even slightly believable plot.
