The only reason any of the hundreds or so users watched this film was that they belonged to the film crew, were friends of the film crew, or were obsessed with Lance Henriksen or Lorenzo Lamas. I personally follow the "cult of Lance", so I was disappointed to see that, despite the fact that he is a headliner, he was only in name. Playing rich crime Newcastle, Lance is happy to watch, but all his screen time is given at the beginning of the film. Newcastle establishes a robbery 747, which includes Ketchum (Lama) and a group of forgotten characters. The biggest shock for this viewer was that the scenes before the robbery were not so bad. Except for the somewhat unpleasant and rather embarrassed view of Aviva Gale, who every time in every line honed the actress of the game in elementary school, the acting was decent in everything, and none of these lines made me cringe. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the robbery occurs, the film falls asleep. Not only is their plan the most ridiculous thing ever filmed, but it takes too long. This is not a very deep film, and you have to fill your 90 minutes, but these scenes are so boring that I almost fell asleep at two in the afternoon. It is especially difficult to go through one particular sequence in which we observe how each of the characters performs the same task over and over again. The film is called “Fast Exchange”, but the exchange is far from fast - it is too long and bloated to the extreme. Perhaps it would work if any of the characters had real personalities, but come on, there is only so much that you can ask from the live broadcast of the movie “Showtime Extreme”. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there are a few laughs, intentional and unintentional (Lorenzo Lamas seems to be a master of disguise, which makes a couple of incredibly strange scenarios), and Lance returns at the end of the film, albeit for a short period of time . This is a bad film, and I probably didn’t have to tell you this myself, but this is not the worst thing I've ever seen. I wouldn’t put him too high on Henriksen’s movie list because he was in some real gems with a lot of screen time, and in any case the film loses steam when the heist begins, but the best I can say for Fast Exchange - this is what the last two films that I watched before they were mainstream hostages and overpriced, pretentious collapse - and it was better than both.
