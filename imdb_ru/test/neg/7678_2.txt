This film is sometimes scary, perhaps no more than when naked George Kennedy tells his prostitute that he wants a little more sugar. Fortunately, his nudity is covered with a blanket, but the image is still worse than anything you can find, for example, in the Schindler List. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this film was inspirational; It inspired me to watch another movie. In one scene, when a flight attendant talks about male pilots, Kennedy asks: “Why do you think this is called a“ cockerel ”pit?” Charming. <br /> <br /> And yes, contrary to what some have written, this film is very, very bad.
