And again the posters lied to me. <br /> <br /> The marketing of this film was very different from the content; 'explosive'? When I read the synopsis for this film, I expected to see a lot of grotesques, each of which was poured, poured with blood and bloated with alcohol, covered with needles of heroin and doubled up from chronic masturbation; a clean-shaven hero, shining Gabrielle, will enter such a “lair of vice”. Instead, the film was the exact opposite of what I expected. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes of the film showed us that Middletown is a simple little place, full of poor people who are doing everything possible, whether it is to tinker a little to make ends meet, to drink, to forget the pain, or See how cockfighting (chickens, not penises) to pass the boredom. In other words, the townspeople were desperately ordinary. <br /> <br /> The only (intentional?) grotesque piece was Gabriel, a Presbyterian brainwashed preacher, played by McFadien, whose face is built to prompt the constant air of astonished rage. If I had been kind, I would have suggested that the preacher's Paislit rant was a witty comment designed to make us despise Gabriel and his faith. Unfortunately, Brian Kirk is so inept a cinematographer that you quickly despise everyone in the film, leaving the audience to suffer from more than eighty minutes of dark, battered fatigue. My only respite from this waste of celluloid was the “guess the accent” game, broken by the “find a place” rounds. Are we surprised that Gaibo ultimately steals his brother's child and strangles his father? Of course not; he is a preacher of the biblical and, therefore, psychos. All citizens are shocked at the end of the film, but I suspect that they have just understood which turkey they assigned their names to. <br /> <br /> The Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission has a budget to spend, but there are better projects than this weak enterprise. The only thing I can say in favor of this film is that he managed to replace “Superman Returns” as the worst film of 2006; one hell of achievement. <br /> <br /> v1: 20061114 v2: 20080107
