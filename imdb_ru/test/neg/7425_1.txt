There is something in the film with the participation of female bodybuilders, who every time displays me on the screen. <br /> <br /> I saw "Pumping Iron II", "Aces: Iron Eagle III", "Raven Hawk" and even the television film "Getting Physical", which featured some big names in sports. They were tolerant in their own way (mainly because Rachel MacLish was in them. ROWWR !!). <br /> <br /> Then I went and looked at Nemezis III: Predatory Prey, the only grounds of which were stars like Sue Price, Debbie Mugli, Sharon Bruno, and Ursula Sartsev. I love to give, I always will, but after that I’m kind of glad that I missed the first two Nemesis. <br /> <br /> Well, in any case, the first one. Most of the footage here is taken from the flesh (and I think, kicking and screaming) from Nemesis II. In fact, it looked a bit interesting from the evidence presented here. <br /> <br /> But even though Price and company are bending and posing, they have almost no chance of doing something else (for example, ACT!). In fact, this entire film is an exercise (“Get it? Haha ...”) with a side story, ambiguous characters and the creation of an open film (in terms of filming, as well as storyline). <br /> <br /> Nothing makes much sense, but even if it were so, there would still be problems - such as making such small details for such large ones as the lives of women such as these. What a crime. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was written and directed by Albert Pune, so what did you expect: cohesion? <br /> <br /> Only one star, considering all the hard work that Price, Muggli, Bruno and Sarcev, obviously put into their bodies, and NOT the “handicraft” work done in the film itself. <br /> <br /> Thank you ladies.
