Why do the powers continue to play Jennifer Lopez in unbelievable roles? She was gorgeous in Selena and pretty good at Money Train, where she played roles where she could be herself. However, such roles simply draw the line. I could never see Lopez as an FBI agent (see “Out of sight” about this unremarkable speech), but as a therapist? Give me a break! <br /> <br /> In essence, Lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist who participates in experiments with virtual reality in which she enters the minds of her patients to help them understand their problems. When she comes to the head of a comatose serial killer to help save one of his victims, she breaks all the rules by trying to crack the insanity of his inner mind. <br /> <br /> Lopez’s actions here are usually below average. I cannot overcome this shrill squeak of her voice. She is not Julia Roberts, but still she faces on the screen, as if she believes she is on the same playing field. Well, she's not even in the same stadium. Of course, she is a very sexy woman; however, it is not going to carry the film, and it certainly does not carry this one. With someone else who has played a part in this film, it would be great, especially if it was filmed with someone who could give the character more confidence. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, this film is visually stunning, the colors are awesome, and the storyline is not so bad in the sense of the B-movie. The sound here is also excellent. This film gets a few points for a rather original storyline and main points for how it looks and sounds. Unfortunately, the acting skills and bad cast reduce it by several steps. <br /> <br /> My rating: 6/10
