I just just watched this movie just because of Sarah and I also give these 4 stars only because of her, on the other hand, this movie was one of the worst films I've ever seen. The action was terrible. The script was boring. It was a film that contradicted itself. The film was sloppy and unoriginal. not that I expected a good movie. Just something to give me a couple of jumps. It didn't even do that. <br /> <br /> It is worst of all that, the more I think about the general plot, the less sense it has, and the more holes we continue to find. It's really a shame, since I'm pretty sure that somewhere there was a good idea ... <br /> <br /> Maybe Iâ€™m a bit harsh when giving the film 4/10, but considering the actors involved and the obvious talent of the writer SARA , this film really should have brought a lot more. <br /> <br /> This movie is just crap, I can't express it in a different way. From the very beginning it is known that it will be crap. <br /> <br /> History, dialogue, acting, special effects, make-up, almost everything sucks. I like movies about vampires, and I know that they will never be films that won an Oscar, but this film is not even worth watching, I can not believe how someone created this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not even about vampires, it's more about a dream / reality experience. The development of the film is incoherent, the motivation of the characters ... It does not exist, everything seems like a big joke. Maybe this is what they tried to do, but I sincerely doubt it. I wish I knew that they were trying to pull out, but it just turned out, this is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life (and I have seen many bad films, but nothing compared to this) do yourself a favor and not watch this. <br /> <br /> ps This is also full of cliches! Postscript 2 Bad script, bad direction, bad cinematography. Postscript 3 I bothered to comment on this as a service to all.
