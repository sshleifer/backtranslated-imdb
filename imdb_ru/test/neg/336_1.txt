I am proud that I can sit in everything. I think, "if I paid the rent, then I would at least watch it." I found an exception to this rule - Planet. I do not know what the exchange rate is, but, reading other comments, I can only guess that Â£ 8,000 should be about $ 150. I will meet, but this film reminds me of old Steve Reeves films of the 50s. He was a bodybuilder, became an actor. He was in these really terrible Italian, dubbed films, in which Reeves starred in the role of Hercules or some other muscular hero. When you watched them in your childhood, you could not understand why these films were stinky - you just knew that they did it. Mike Mitchell - New Steve Reeves. That's all ... that's what it really was - a new story about an old Italian film "Spaghetti with sand and sandals." And I'm not kidding - where was Reeves born? Glasgow, Montana. This film is not so bad that watching it is fun - just bad.
