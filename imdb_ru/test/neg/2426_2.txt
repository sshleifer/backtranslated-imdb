This movie is terrible. Acting is ridiculous and ridiculous. If you know anything about rugby, the game of the match is boring. In fact, any episode of the Power Rangers contains more realism than this film. An “action” consists of no more than one run and a shot of a guy landing above the line of attempts or attacking without a ball, and the fussy hand throws of someone who knows what. Impossible to say. There is nothing from the excitement, skill and construction of winnings that are present in rugby. As for the hack, this is a Yankee group trying to imitate a tradition that they don’t know anything about, much like the character of the white rasta who should be excluded from the film. The next time a rugby film is made, we can only hope that people who know rugby will see it.
