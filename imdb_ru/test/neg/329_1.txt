I have always loved horror movies. From some commonly known ones, such as The Exorcist, to some of the more underrated ones, such as The Black Christmas or Before Dawn. But who jokes, even calls this trash bi-film? This is a straight upside down Z-grade barrel. Acting is the worst ever movie ever. Indeed, I saw better in the episode "Young and Restless" ... SPOILER ... Look for when a woman comes to tell them about the legend of Jack-o. Sometimes she pauses for a few seconds as if someone flashes prompt cards, and she tries to read her lines. REVOLT! <br /> <br /> Yes, and besides a bad game, there is absolutely no blood or F / X. And Jack-o looked like a pumpkin lit by plastic. Watch Linnie Quigley in "Night of the Demons" or "Silent Night, Deadly Night", much better.
