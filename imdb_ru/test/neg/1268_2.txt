There are many so-called anti-war / anti-government. Political films that start now as a mei-criminal, end with the fact that “our poor boys are damn good, so let the world sympathize with them, it's not their fault” - such things. I was half afraid that it would be a different style in this style, even if it touches on another subject / aspect of the same theme. I almost did not go and saw it; In this regard, I almost did not write this review. What did we get here? By order of the United States, an Egyptian is sent to a secret offshore torture center, but another Egyptian must torture him, not an American: “You see, we Americans have clean hands,” and the Egyptians are bad. In any case, let them harm their own. Yes, an American with a conscience had to be a positive hero: indeed, many Americans have them, but here the concept was inappropriate. Yes, we all know that this is called “Emergency Execution,” and it began in the days of Clinton, and now it is used for reasons beyond the control of the causes. Otherwise, he was very beaten and nervous about the real US conviction for participating in torture; as if the creators were afraid to go all the way because of the fear of being slanderous or unpatriotic or something like that (take a look at the bulletin board! Anyone who apologizes faces heavy verbal artillery). Torture is a terrible thing, whether someone is guilty or not; in the 18th century, Frederick II, King of Prussia, canceled it for convicted murderers - although I must say that the life sentence for a child molester is much less than what I want to see. Well, what about torture? This film really did not reveal the horror and hopelessness. When you are under torture (now come to the capital for an accent, I don’t scream), YOU SAY ANYTHING, EVEN IF THIS IS NOT TRUE, EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T DETERMINE YOU THAT THEY WERE, IT WILL STOP. THIS IS NO, BUT YOU NEVER RECOGNIZE AND YOU KEEP TO SAY, WHAT YOU DID, WHAT THEY SAID, WHAT YOU DID, THAT YOU DIDN'T DO. Another thing that the film didn’t produce enough was that TORTURE IS EXTREMELY, IT IS NECESSARY TO UNIMINATE, AND THIS FEELING REMAINS YOU YOUR LIFE. It somehow changes the people inside. How do I know all this? Do not ask. <br /> <br /> Re-edit: two things: Arabic, which was used in the film, was not an Egyptian dialect. This is a little worse than showing the film in New Zealand with the locals as characters, and all have American accents. In addition, the terrible little preacher, who incited his ignorant audience to violence, told them things unknown to this religion that were to be revealed. Also, it was not explained anywhere that any Nincomput could become a mullah / imam; he does not need any special qualifications, and this is a break that needs to be corrected: many of them are acceptable because of their fundamentalist views and the fact that the great ally of the United States, Saudi Arabia, finances a great many of them. Thanks so much for this place.
