A New York lawyer plans to get rid of her old mother after meeting an attractive, affordable woman. Screenwriter Robert Klein, adapting his own novel (the type of paperback that children would buy for dirty parts), seems to have no knowledge of mental illness: for him, it's just an excuse for comedy and scatological jokes. George Seagal, who in the 1960s was mostly filmed in pictures of war and espionage, became by this time one of Americaâ€™s greatest comedians-sadists; his crazy reactions and rude answers only compete with the incomprehensibility of his mother. Seagal goes well with Trish Van Dover, and their moments of connection (although they are played for laughter) are really the only sequences that you can strive for. Ruth Gordon, like her, is pretty, just too much - and more of her is less. This is one of the worst directing and edited films I've ever seen with so-called professionals. The promising scenes, which ultimately do not play out for the full effect, are disconnected unsystematically from other moments that are shaking around endlessly, causing the coarse, fragile film to self-destruct long before it actually ends. * 1/2 of ****
