I saw this movie some time ago because some of my friends wanted to rent it, and they voted for me ... I tried my best to get this story, because some movie said it would be a movie for Rob Lowa, that Pulp Fiction was for John Travolta ... Well ... we all see that he not only failed, but fell far down. This is actually the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies ... just not worth watching for free on TV.
