I caught it on Cinemax very late at night ... there was nothing else, so I had almost no choice Outcome, terrible plot, slowness, waste of a good movie and time of actors In short, don't even worry about it. It is a pity that we can not give zeros as a rating; this one really is not worth even considering !!!
