First, I must say that I really love Udo Kier and always had respect for Armand Assante, but nothing could save this train wreck from the movie. Udo doesn't even appear much later in the film, and the action from All is just awful. The script is everywhere, the dialogue is wooden, the “action” is ridiculous, and the plot can be taken on a dirty cocktail napkin. I really wanted to find something redeeming in this film, but I found that I was holding my hands above my eyes, shaking my head and repeating again and again to myself: “Oh, Udo ..... why ??? .... why ?? ??? .. ". If you're a Udo or Armand fan, please don't watch this movie. It will just make you sad for them.
