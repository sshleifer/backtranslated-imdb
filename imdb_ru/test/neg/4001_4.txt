I usually love these thrillers "Stranger Within". Here are some good examples: Fatal Attraction, Lonely White Woman, and Listening. Done well, they can be very fun, and they cost an hour or two continuous shocks and fears. Of course, the opposite can be: done badly, they can be tedious and stupid. "The hand that rocks the cradle" is one of the last. <br /> <br /> Bartel, Claire (Annabella Sciorra) and Michael (Matt McCoy) welcome another member of their family. But Michael convinced busy Claire to hire a nanny. One day, a woman named Peyton Flanders (Rebecca De Mornay) appears, and because she seems perfect, Bartel hires her. Of course, as soon as it appears, their idyllic life gradually falls apart ... <br /> <br /> This film suffers from many problems, but the biggest of them is the treatment of the villain. Peyton is never believed. This is partly due to the way it is written and how it works. What she does should confuse us, is so contrived that it is ridiculous. De Mornay does not help much. She portrays Peyton as two different people. While it is true that she must be the perfect nanny, hiding her psychotic inclinations, De Morne’s performance creates a gap between the two aspects of her character. <br /> <br /> However, other actors are good. Annabella Sciorra is amazing as asthmatic Claire. Sciorra is very natural in this role, but, unfortunately, the script brings her. Matt McCoy is almost invisible. However, Julianne Moore is adorable as Claire Marlene's girlfriend. Moore is a firework, but unfortunately, it is only five minutes on the screen. <br /> <br /> Curtis Hanson is a good director, but you wouldn’t find out if you watched this fool. The film has some decent shocks, but it goes slowly, and the climax, although it causes some tension, is actually kind of ridiculous. At the same time, he works with a scenario that, at best, could be softly called pathetic. <br /> <br /> Believe me, when it comes to babysitters, stick to Fran Drescher. This one should have gone to the trash for video.
