I entered this movie with half-high expectations after falling in love with the cartoon series as a child, and it almost destroyed this love for me. Jason Lee, David Sevil in the film, terrifying. I understand that it may not be easy to act with CGI characters that are not really there, but I did find his performance terrible, along with all other non-animated characters. The chipmunks were adorable, but sometimes they were obviously obvious in advancing the plot of the story, and therefore they did not lead me to stay in the cinema for more than half an hour in the film. If you feel you need to watch this movie, rent it at most. It's not worth eight bucks to see it in cinemas, unless you want to laugh at the terrible game.
