When, when will Hollyweird write a decent movie based on computers? I can not believe that people really consider this film a believable story. <br /> <br /> No computer operating system can survive with such an annoying scrolling interface. On a movie screen, it may look good, but if you really try to use it for a while, you will go crazy. <br /> <br /> With regard to “tracking” people, the way she did it is simply impossible to do this way. Only network security will prevent this. The keystroke recording was at least ridiculous. <br /> <br /> With regard to software that was presumably installed, no system administrator would allow such a critical component of software to be installed on a production system until it is installed. tested, rechecked and tested again in a sandbag system. <br /> <br /> But the worst part of the film is probably the “virus”. There is no way that a virus that works in one operating system will work in any other system. As for a virus that can destroy a mainframe, it’s a couple of seconds that it just doesn’t believe. There is no way that an open remote connection would have the required superuser access that would allow system files to be deleted. <br /> <br /> I could continue, but I can not be bothered. <br /> <br /> porn has a more thoughtful plot that this pile of garbage.
