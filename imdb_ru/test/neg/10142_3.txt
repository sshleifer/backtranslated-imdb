I really liked every character in this show from the very beginning, except Reba herself. She looks more holy than you, and, frankly, a big bully. And it stinks, because it is in every scene and every episode. In later seasons, Van becomes unbelievable, like the deceiver of his former self. and Kira walks, mocking and feeling miserable. The first 3-4 seasons are pretty good if you miss Reba. Toward the end, it's pretty bleak .. Basically, in every episode Barbara Jean walks around being silly, Reba gets angry at her, but poor Ole Barbara Jean desperately wants Reba to like her, with the result that Jean Barabara tells Rebbe what she is cool every episode. I think it's pretty clear to see that Reba has a problem with self-esteem, and he wants to be considered this all-forgiving saint. It's really a shame, because besides her, the show had such potential.
