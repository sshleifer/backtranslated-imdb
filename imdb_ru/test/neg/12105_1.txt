Almost a master class, how not to direct the film. Starting with an erroneous, often incomprehensible script, Dr. Rey relies on a series of bad decisions that make the film a painful viewing. Unfortunately, the film never goes beyond a kind of old-fashioned, almost misogynistic gay camp in which women are overworked, OTT and middle-aged, while men are young, meaningless and always looking for sex hunting. The director was unable to determine either the tone of the film or the level of the performances. <br /> <br /> Of course, a lot of “acting skills” are happening. Dianne Wiest crawls into the pale personification of his performance “Bullets Over Broadway,” and poor old Jane Birkin loses his will in an attempt to give a comic idea. Although you need to feel sorry for her, because there is very little real comedy here. All this is similar to the version of Le Divorce from Merchant Ivory with a very low rent, which, frankly, was not very good either.
