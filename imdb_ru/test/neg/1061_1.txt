This film is strikingly poor. It was on TV when I tuned into the action scene and laughed at the macho's cheerful dialogue, waiting for Leslie Nielsen to appear. It took me a few minutes to realize that this is not really a comedy, it should be taken seriously. It should be remembered that someone actually sat down and wrote this film, and even worse - others financed it and gave it the green light. <br /> <br /> Rutger Hauer obviously does not read movie scripts before he signs, or he has serious bad debts. <br /> <br /> Strange, this film is so poor that you look at it, wondering how it is actually financed, and how it is television. the channel had to pay money for broadcasting rights. The dialogue between the hero and the villain, when he tries to shoot each other from the sky, is especially painful, because the dialogue sounds like it is generated by the Texas Intruments "Speak & Spell". <br /> <br /> Hollywood cash machine at this worst is funny though.
