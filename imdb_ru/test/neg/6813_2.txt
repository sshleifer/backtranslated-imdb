After reading the reviews, I decided to rent a version on DVD. <br /> <br /> I like classical music and I wanted to learn more about Bach. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. I think that I do not know enough about Bach's music, and I didnâ€™t have enough comments to understand the importance or what kind of music was played. <br /> <br /> This may be appropriate under the guidance of an expert on music by Bach, who can explain the film. <br /> <br /> I really tried and saw the whole movie jumping, that I could enjoy at least a part of it, but I did not. <br /> <br /> Watch at your own risk.
