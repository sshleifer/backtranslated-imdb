I would like to use the machine for time travel to return to the moment when I decided to watch this movie, and instead make other plans. I looked at the free Sound of Thunder program, so I can't complain about the price, but I would like for me to return my 103 minutes. The game was mediocre, and the special effects were disastrous. People should not make films about dinosaurs if they cannot afford prehistoric creatures to look as good or better than those in Jurassic Park. Spielberg spoiled us. Edward Burns as Travis Rieher was the only saving grace of the film. I noticed that women under the age of 18 rated the film the highest, and the only explanation was that they were always looking at Burns. Total 103 minutes long. This film was supposed to end in about 80 minutes. It just dragged on and on. Do not waste your time or money on this contrived film.
