I will not lie, I shot this film because it was a “feature film” with possible explicit sex. I got this scene and Katherine Deneuve’s chest (briefly shown), but the rest of the film is just plain long, pretentious European feature films with lines like “I had a mother or a father, I don’t know” (paraphrased). Usually delivered in long monologues. <br /> <br /> If you are curious about the transition of “art” to porn, it may be interesting to see using the fast forward button (I was still too slow!)
