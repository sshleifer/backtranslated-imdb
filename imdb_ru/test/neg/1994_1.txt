I just saw this old stinky cauldron on TV. Best of all, this is watched with a very large bottle of Dr. Dzherd's “Jungle” juice at hand, this cheerful cheesy feast is cheerful and terrible. On the other hand (very thin) plus, Raquel was in excellent physical shape, she looks good, and you can see her a bit since she plays a go-go dancer; she had great legs, that's for sure. There is also little interest in screen shots in Los Angeles frames. '69, and in the search for actors in minor parts that continued for the better. Thespun veteran Ron Rifkin (“Brothers and Sisters”) performs with curly early performances in the role of “Sailor”, the bartender “fagot-addict”, who gives Raquel the bad guy. You may also recognize the gunshot on the “hit and run” scene - this is a very early appearance of Gordon Jamp, who gave such a wonderful performance in “Soap” like Piece of Chelief Tinkler. <br /> The "plot" "Flareup", as it is, follows the difficulties of an exotic dancer (Welch) on the run from her murderous ex-husband (Luke Askew). This turkey is a classic Hollywood series - a script with coloring by numbers, pedestrian direction, frames, changes and effects, excessive stock music, plywood sets and relevant performances. <br /> <br /> The cast is as terrible as the script. Although Raquel is able to honestly perform in a suitable car, this hoarse old talker is so terrible that she has neither a chance nor an audience. One of my favorite moments occurs when Raquel wakes up in the hospital, sees a Vegas police officer who is chasing her ex-killer, and asks: "How did you get here?" - to which he, of course, replies "On the plane." About humanity ... And you can not take your eyes off the doctor (Michael Rugas), who may be one of the worst in the long and sad history of bad cameos. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone stand so badly in one place before. <br /> <br /> Raquel Joe's love interest (James Stacy) watches a film with a fixed gaze that lies somewhere between a stunned and embarrassed — and not surprisingly. This bomb makes the basis for virtually all the clichés made for television, starting with a stunningly scary turn of Raquel in a horrendous montage of a nightmare and ending with a clean “romantic” horseback riding trip on Leo Carillo Beach. <br /> <br /> ** The spoiler warning ** - almost the only interesting thing in the whole film is the denouement in which Raquel finally gets his own back, and cheerfully introduces the title, setting the villain on fire. Whoever is a stuntman, he really earned his money on it - he rises like Yorba Lind in extreme heat. However, even this rather impressive scene is compromised by the fact that one of the team members shot closer to the end. <br /> <br /> There are so many foolish things in Flareup that it is strangely irresistible; It seemed to me that this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It seemed that the answer sounds deafening: “Yes” ... until I saw the film that followed him, Roger Corman’s mega-dirty classic “big cage” Big Doll House, which takes Awful to a whole new level. I can wholeheartedly recommend these two schlokers as a double count. You will laugh silly.
