[POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING] <br /> <br /> It is unlikely that Seagal will ever again scale the elevation he did with “On the Land of Death” (mainly because no one will ever allow him to send again) but he sure is trying, right? <br /> <br /> This is a typically brainless and poorly written little fantasy that Indian folk remedies are much more effective than Western medicine. Seagal seems to really believe in this nonsense, although he never explains why life expectancy in America and Europe is much higher than in 1492. <br /> <br /> Somehow, he never explains how his alleged "water recharge" Engines "work in * On the Land of Death". <br /> <br /> Even the "action" in this one sucks.
