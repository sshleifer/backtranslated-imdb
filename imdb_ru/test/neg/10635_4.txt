How can it be a boring film about illegal Mexican immigrants who are being robbed and beaten abroad? Well, the "border incident" is. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, the career of singer and dancer George Murphy ended shortly after the release of this horrible film. Politics was certainly the way out for this future senator, who dies a horrible death in this slow-moving film. The stereotypes of a film about a typical Mexican working farmer farm look confused and terribly boring. <br /> <br /> The film became more intense when the personalities of Murphy and Ricardo Montalban were discovered as federal agents for the United States and Mexico, respectively. . <br /> <br /> At best, disappointing, we see similar problems in our own society today.
