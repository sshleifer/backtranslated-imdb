This film is a clumsy mess of various agreements on ghosts and unknown thrillers, none of which are fully implemented, and they are all rather annoying. The script was careless. Acting, the same. Scary FX was basically ridiculous, with the exception of one amazing jumper moment that scared me, even if I saw it happen a mile away. Now explain to me someone, why you need ghosts, and black magic, and objects of a secret ritual, and robbers of Count Krapula, and psychics, and family curses, and Irish superstitions, and milk cups left for supernatural beings, And possessed pupae, all in one movie? With all this, you expect more than one good moment of horror, but this film is lame, lame, lame.
