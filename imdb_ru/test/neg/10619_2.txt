This is a bad movie if I've ever seen it. In one of the greatest films of 1999, Detroit Rock City fights Runaway Bride and Wild Wild West for first place in a barrel of drug addicts. The plot is masterful. Four young high school students finally get a chance to see a hard rock KISS theatrical performance for the third year in a row. So when their tickets go to a super-religious mom who smokes, your buddies climb into Detroit, and I’m sure you can figure out the rest. <br /> <br /> Well, not really; The film tells how four members of the group (no, not Jean, Paul, Ace and Peter) receive these tickets: they lose their virginity at the confessional post; the rescue of your mother's smoked chatter and Volvo (from Steve Shirripa from a soprano, however); prevention of robbery in the midst of falsifying debts for a 12-year-old child; and, of course, strip down to the essentials for MC Ron Jeremy after completing a full blender with the remnants of bourbon. It sounds funny, doesn’t it? Maybe Detroit Rock City really makes sense with all this tomfoolery about how extreme these fans can sometimes be. And we understand that this film is a comedy; it must be filled with farce. But does Detroit Rock City aim for the right audience? He has an “R” rating, which means the only way of adolescence I represent is the audience, as I understand it, many will finally welcome this classic voyeurist with the help of illegal terms. <br /> <br /> Detroit rock city also fails in the late 1970s. The quality of the camera textures is too clear and too bright, and in films like “This is Spinal Tap” and “Sid & Nancy” there is no necessary talent. This would allow viewers to feel "at home" over time. Simply putting children in grunge style until the 90s and turning others into disco-inferno will not help. Environment means what you know; I doubt Detroit looked so glam in 78. If there is something positive in this film, then this is the awesome soundtrack of hard rock from the late 70s - early 80s. Van Halen, AC / DC, you name it, it's all here. Of course, we cannot forget about KISS, about the group that was successfully influenced. <br /> <br /> The film obviously does not cope, as questions about why Knights of the Satin Service (in fact, it's just KISS) are so unhappy with moms across the country. Of course, loud rock and diabolical makeup can be a part of it; Encouraging young people to explore themselves and have a good time can also be a fair reason. But what does KISS say in the music we hear throughout the film about this rebellious band? What distinguishes these rock and roll hymns all night and parties every day from the rest of the music? Most likely, these questions will remain in the classroom of musical intercourse, not in the films that should answer them, simply because it is KISS and they are awesome and we must do everything in our God-forgiven strength to see them. <br /> 1.5/5 stars
