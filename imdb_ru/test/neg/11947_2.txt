How bad was it to remake an almost Oscar-worthy film ?! MOSTHLY MARTHA MUCH MORE, has depth, sophistication and so on, and mostly: a wonderful and talented actress in the lead role (Martina Godek) This is a joke and a mess with beautiful Aaron and the whole atmosphere ... again, an absurd effort from Hollywood. There are more and more remakes, and the films are full of schemes. Is there anyone who can create a good and new script? Or is it a safe solution for creating remakes or films from proven animated figures? Nowadays films are becoming less interesting. Oh yes: if you want to watch a REALLY good movie, watch the original one. It is definitely worth it.
