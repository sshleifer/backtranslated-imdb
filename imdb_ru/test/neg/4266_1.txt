Worst thing I've ever watched. <br /> <br /> The film is clean rubbish. In this film, everything is bad. Direction, script, art, cinematography, the cast or something else. <br /> <br /> Can I say more? <br /> <br /> The main character is a boy. He should be about 20 years old, but the actor who plays the role looks like 30 years, and he is also a very bad actor. <br /> <br /> Editing tries to save it, but with this very bad material in their hands, they cannot work wonders. <br /> <br /> As I said, the actors are bad, the text is bad, which does not help the actors. <br /> <br /> I learned not to do a movie.
