Although this film will be released after three Star Wars, Krull and many others, this film would look obsolete in the 1950s ... 1 SFX mainly consist of 1970s video game effects, such as bolts, etc .; annoying after a while. You also get a SFX creature that looks like a poor man's version for level IV Harryhausen monster. <br /> <br /> 2 sets are mostly ruins in the countryside, with papier-mâché temples and miniature cities or monasteries that make Japanese monster movies of the 1950s look like impeccable perfection. <br /> <br /> 3 The plot is very thin - paper ... Hercules must find seven golden blows of Zeus stolen by conspiracies of gods and zombie tyrants. <br /> <br /> 4 actions basically consist of a backward, muscular Hercules (look at various facial expressions) fighting the cheap effects of video games from the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Milli Carlucci (third sister of Carlucci’s show business with Anna & Gabriella), who says everything, goes with 5 acting awards. <br /> <br /> 6 SFX makes other Italian films with second-level salad bowls, such as L'UMANOIDE and STAR CRASH, look like masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Well, considering that Ferrigno’s main actor’s feat was to impersonate a backward green monster dressed in a whig and green espadrilles, we must be indulgent. <br /> <br /> Look and forget about it.
