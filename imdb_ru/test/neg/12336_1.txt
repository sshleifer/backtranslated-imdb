We will see who the good guys are. Union And who are the bad guys, a rich man who steals elections, and his spoiled son. The director makes us see good from evil. All the characters hate the bad guys, so when watching a movie this can help us hate the bad guys. This is the worst kind of filmmaking - manipulative and childish. At the heart of the plot is a policeman who is between good and bad, and he is stuck in this terrible movie. It is boring and meaningless. The story of the star Quiche is really bad. And a good actor, Don Stroud, played to the limit, playing a guy that no one likes, and that we shouldnâ€™t like. It takes a long time for this trunk to take off and for the name itself to be established; then when he takes off, he falls after a minute. Boring. One of the worst movies ever made.
