After watching all the episodes of the Star Trek series many times since the 1960s, most of which are pretty good, and only a few of them are mediocre, I think this is the worst of them all. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think it’s so poorly performed that it can be embarrassing for the series. Not that the story was so bad, although it is not particularly outstanding in any case, but the game is simply terrible on the part of the two main characters, implying in this case other than regular characters. Barbara Anderson demonstrates her weakest role in the story as the daughter of a mass murderer who performs some kind of mission. She practically calls in the role from the phone and does not show any real emotional abilities. Although she was never used as a beautiful face in most of her film and television roles, usually in small roles, she worked much better. <br /> <br /> Arnold Moss, because her father gives new meaning to the term 'Ham' and is the only actor in the history of Star Trek of the 1960s who surpassed William Shatner in this area, and in fact Shatner looks great comparing. And he plays the role of Shakespeare's actor no less, which gives him more incentives to overestimate, and he does it. <br /> <br /> In addition to these two main roles, which are so weak, the story is such that anyone with any meaning can tell who the killer is in the first 15 minutes. I say this because I told my brother the whole story, ending at the first commercial break, when we watched the original broadcast of 1966 as a teenager. His answer was: “Yes, you are right. <br /> <br /> Skip this one and watch the much superior episodes of the menagerie that were originally televised right before that.
