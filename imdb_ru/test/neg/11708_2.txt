I understand that some old-fashioned material is expensive, and that this style of shooting (close shots to the camera, moving camera, large aperture shots, blurry) allow such films to be made at a price. As a style, it has its advantages and disadvantages, like any other, it allows you to create more periodical works. Like any style, it has its opponents and supporters - perhaps even there are those who believe that this method of shooting has an artistic basis. <br /> <br /> If only a portion of the money saved could be spent on the script for whatever style it was used, the film needs good writing and a good acting game. <br /> <br /> The acting in this film is mostly very good. The inscription is less so. It consists of a set of fragments taken from a book, and much of what is related to the plot is left to create a disparate set of episodes with little or no continuity. <br /> <br /> If you read a book, under no circumstances look at it. If you have not read the book, you are pleased, and you have nothing to do, watch it is not harmful, but be prepared to give up. <br /> <br /> This could be much better.
