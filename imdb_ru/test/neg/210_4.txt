One of those films in which there are no big turns, and you can largely predict what will happen. Matt Dillon was awesome again, but the others did not play a big role as they should. <br /> <br /> At first, it was exciting, but rather slow and predictable at the end. This is one of those. Anyway, when a good guy wins, no matter what happens. If you have absolutely nothing to do, you can try, I personally found that you should not look. The story could have been more interesting, and the director could have made it less like a B-film, with a happy ending.
