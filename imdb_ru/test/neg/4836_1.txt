and this is only January, but I am sure of it! <br /> <br /> Today it is one of the worst Swedish films I have ever seen, and, frankly, Swedish films are not so good in general. It was declared “original”, and perhaps it can be seen as such for people who have never seen an English-language film, for us who have been in the cinema for the past 10 years, it cannot but feel like Mons Marlind and Bjorn Stein in one from the weekend he sat watching the most successful films of recent years and tried to collect all this in one Swedish package.

And finally, Eva Rose is beyond criticism, both in character and in acting. The only reason Storm fails to get 1/10 is Erik Erikson and, what can I say, at least he is trying ..
