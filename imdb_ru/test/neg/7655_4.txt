The second woman talks about a mysterious man who lost his wife in an accident and now believes that someone wants to harm him. The girl who loves him wants to help him, but she is led to believe that his fears are caused by a mental illness ... <br /> <br /> An interesting story, a very good game, but the result is generally bad in many ways. The story is too simplistic, or rather, presented in a simplified form (although there are a couple of interesting plot twists). For example, people say that they love each other only after two meetings. I do not want to disclose anything, but you will understand what I mean if you watch the movie. “Come on, these were the fifties!” - you think. However, I have seen quite a few films of that era, and I know that some of them do not look so outdated in our time. <br /> <br /> Something that bothered me was that some of the scenes were shot to their fullest, making it almost impossible to see what was happening. Well, this is a film noir, but in some moments it is too noisy ...: o) <br /> <br /> In general, the Second Woman is not a masterpiece of that era, but also not rubbish. See if you have nothing else to do ...
