(Spoilers are more than likely ... nothing special that you could not understand yourself) Yes, this is really strange. I rented it in a blockbuster for the reason that on the back of the box there was absolutely no description of the film, just a list of groups that had songs in it. But after that I had time to find him, even here, on IMDB. I kept confusing it with “Night of the Demons,” but, you know, it’s basically the same thing. <br /> <br /> The details that I liked most about this movie were in the garage. This dark-skinned guy in the gym was cheerful, as always shouted. Even when it was not necessary to shout, he published “LISTEN NOW! CLOSE DOOR WITH CARS !!!! ”and now, they will drive cars in the forehead. But then he got the eggs and was killed by a zombie with a broom, I suppose it was. The other part that somehow caught my attention was the part with the crash outside the building with the guys they didn't want to come to because of the girl ... What important aspect of the film did it give us? What was it? Why was it there? Why did the movie end up with a guy breaking TV in the studio? I saw a zombie running toward the screen, but he was pretty far away. I mean, he could just turn off the TV. Yes, this film was shot on a whim, and yes, I hated it. Good day...
