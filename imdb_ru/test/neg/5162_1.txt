It's nice to hear about 3 comments that indicate what "Footballers' wives" mean for women. The name alone erases any perceived equality of women in the media industry or society, turning them into two-dimensional cartoons of cartoons about how men think women should behave. This postmodern moron farce. With the same success it can be called "Footballer-wife, who sits at home and knows his place." <br /> <br /> On the one hand, this may be a kind of parody of the British press, representing the trashcan. celebrities and their role in maintaining a patriarchal society. Thus, women can undermine stereotypes by acting like those stereotypes and have an image that was created for them by masculine desire. No, that would be ironic and clever. It also seems to me that I should praise him. <br /> <br /> Zoe Lacker is just too polite and excessive to be taken seriously. Just like the even cheaper Cruella De Ville. She just needs some kind of manic, indulgent, but at the same time self-evaluative laugh to show her true acting range. Oh, she does? Right. In any case, it simply sums up who it is directed at. Either “smart, smart” magazines that think it’s a booming vodovilsky proportions, or people who think it’s “real.” "Best actors"? OH MY GOD!! Stop watching this aftermath of mime and get a life. <br /> <br /> This is completely sexist and of so low quality that perhaps those who enjoy it think that they are "in" a joke. Do the actors really care or understand what they are communicating? It is so humiliating for women and men. They are not all egocentric, selfish, football-loving materialistic assholes who think that women are nothing more than another trophy that should be put on display to the public. It is so humiliating. I am sure that Mrs. Lacker easily confronts them in his “real” life and wraps them around his finger, as is easily done in “The Wives of Football” <br /> <br /> But of course this is not the case. really important. In the end, I mean only the T.V. So please let it stay away. This is terrible, and he will be remembered only in the same unbelief that the “Prison Cell H Block” was so fond of recalling. <br /> <br /> How did he appear? It is definitely not thin or complex. This can only come from the same type of recruitment that FHM read, and thinks that it is “good” to look at soft porn and “do”, like many women, will bow to their “will” and sing patriotic and racist comments when “their football team lost / won. This is absolutely stupid.
