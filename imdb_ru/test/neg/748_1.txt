This film began well enough, keeping the mood of the book quite well, even if the game was not top notch. The soundtrack was painfully bad. Saxophone and electric guitars? It was terribly inappropriate. The singer was very sad! In the second half of the film, the story takes a clearly darker turn. Too dark for Austin. Northanger Abbey became a dark and scary place, whereas in the book it was depressingly tame and modernized for Catherine's eyes. <br /> <br /> Who the hell is this Markyanka with a scary makeup and a wig? Absolutely extraneous and unnecessary character. <br /> <br /> One of the key elements in the book, The General, is not a Gothic monster, like characters from Catherine’s books. His monstrosity is much more difficult in that he depresses the mood of his children, and his attitude towards Catherine is based only on monetary problems. He does not lock his wife or kill her, but sends Miss Morland alone 70 miles in a hired wagon, not having enough money to pay for her way home. Only the care of her friend, Miss Tilney, who gave her a little money at the exit, saves her from being in a difficult situation. All this is seriously confused in the film. They make the general too gloomy from the start. <br /> <br /> Peter Fert was not supposed to sing! This part was painful to watch. His image of Tilney was not so bad, but it was dark in places. Henry Tilney from the book captured Miss Morland’s imagination during a trip to Northanger, but it was never dark. Firth would benefit from the best direction. The young lady who played Isabella needed the best acting coach. John Thorpe was accordingly odious. The striped striped vest and jacket was terrible! It definitely fits his character. <br /> <br /> I think the film would have been much better with a completely different soundtrack. It threw a heavy blow to the entire movie. If I watch it again, the sound will be turned off, and the subtitles are turned on. Perhaps I would give the film 4 points. <br /> <br /> The sound quality on the DVD was pretty bad. The picture quality was not much better. This is noticeable on digital television. <br /> <br /> When I think about how this film could be, I think of Persuasion with Amanda Ruth and Ciaran Hinds.
