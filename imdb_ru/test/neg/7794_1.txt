Do writers who conjure up such “comedies” have such empty lives that they have to embody them in such tragic shows? <br /> <br /> Why is the talented and gorgeous Busy Phillips among this garbage outside of me, I can not stand the Latin American girl, whose accent sounds very fake and so unfriendly and annoying as another African American girl with a piercing voice. <br /> <br /> Jokes are often stupid, a Jewish guy screams a lot, and the show never goes on; one particular episode with a soldier looking for love was just awful. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that there would be so many people working in the office in search of love, and only one person? Of course, all Women in tight tops and tons of makeup to fill the lack of talent. <br /> <br /> I really found Holly funny in her old shows, and I always admired Busy, but this show is stupid, empty and nothing will turn out.
