After a series of successful films "The Man and His Monkeys", which included such plots as "Anything but free", "Every way you can" and "Peter's Friends", the genre went through hard times. Trying to rejuvenate this once famous district, director Frank Marshall brought Michael Crichton's famous novel to the big screen. <br /> <br /> Think "Gorillas in the Fog" meet the "Throne" minus the box office of Bruce Boxleitner. This is a doomed romance of one man for his talking monkey. Bad accents did not help (Tim Curry fights Romanian), script baboon, hungry hippos, parachute primates and Bruce Campbell. Ape-sh * t.
