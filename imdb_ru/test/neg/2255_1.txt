Usually it all sounds a lot better in my head (so, forgive me for incoherent words), I’m hardly the biggest Tarantino fan (and I will * try * not to stoop to calling it a "hack" .... what quite difficult) I do not like to mock the film or criticize it before watching. Therefore, with careful hesitation, I went to the cinema today to watch the “Inglorious Bastards”. <br /> <br /> Now it would be unfair to call it “robbery of robbery” Tarantino is happy enough to take the title from Enzo Castellari, a clumsy dozen clone (less exciting), but not for plot points (that is, he takes from all other film genres) "Inglorious" begins with a Nazi officer and his long interrogation against a farmer who hides the Jews in his basement. This is such an anti-climactic moment, because its dialogue is outdated, and the result is indicated by a mile. Of course, one of the hidden Jews makes her run away (but more then her). We (obviously, easily satisfied) listeners turn to Lieutenant Aldo Rein's presentation (haha, this name is almost like the B-movie king of ALDO RAY .... haha ​​Quentin ... keep up the good work, and this character playing none other than Brad (Dallas) Pitt (sorry, Dallas was the only good thing he ever shot) and with a jaw sticking out, Mr. Jolie treats us to the hounds in the south, grinning Nazi murderer. Mr. Tarantino meanwhile forgets that real adults can attend, therefore he assumes that and haven't heard of the “dirty dozen”? <br /> <br /> The composition of the Raines platoon (viewed by John Cassavet) is bloodthirsty Jewish soldiers, everyone wants to get more out of Adolf Hitler. Tarantino, despite all his excellent knowledge, pays special attention to two of these people, appointing his best friend (and friend-respectable friend) Eli Roth (as a baseball bat owning a Jewish bear). Another person is Ugo Stiglitz (and I bet that more than half of the fans QT never heard that name before this movie) Keep up the good work arantino you have already released about 6 or 7 "image" (for the first 15 minutes) keep adding them, and it can distract from the plot (or lack thereof?). <br /> <br /> In any case, by shortening a long (and extremely boring and protracted) story, Raine and his people (“Inglorious Bastards”) ') and the only survivor from the first chapter, both have separate plots to kill Hitler on the Nazi propaganda film screening in the French cinema (which belonged to the aforementioned survivor, who now grew up) <br /> <br /> More boring (and meaningless) conversations follow two and back and forth, when Pitt dismisses the audience without paying attention. And any genuine expectation that leads to the murder of the most deadly tyrant of all time is discarded by the insistent demand of directors to put David Bowie’s song of the 1980s into a World War II film. <br /> <br /> My problems (and there are many) with this film are a recurring problem that I encounter with most Tarantino products ..... he rarely knows when to start or stop. I don't need a “tribute” after “tribute” to get a “joke” (whatever it is) that I knew about the Inglorious bastards, Enzo Castellari, Aldo Rae, Ugo Stiglitz (and the final crime of the entire film) Ennio Morricone ghost account from REVOLVER. I go to the cinema to see the stars ..... if the best thing you can do is the terrible Barad Pitt, I will assume that you (Mr. Tarantino) are the main draw here? I do not want the audience to direct the film. I cry to see YOUR vision, your ideas, your creativity .... NOT how you can confuse (again and again) endless scenes from endless films. It's time for the fans (on IMDb) to put some kind of “tough love” on your “idol” (God knows if you don’t have… studios?) <br /> <br /> Tired Old argument with Tarantino fans sounds like this: “ Well, if you can do better ... do so. "Let me tell you, if I were a 46-year-old director, with (unsuccessful) tension that QT has ..... I would like to offer YOU much more than warmed chaotic paraphrasing of the best films of World War II, than this joke. The directors he is trying to emulate have made films so bad by chance or due to budget constraints. It is cop again and again to hear his fans agitate for the fact that he lacks imagination as an “art”. I am sure that he is capable of the best (but after he gave him the advantage of doubt, again .... and not to mention the two and a half hours of my life .....) maybe he did not?
