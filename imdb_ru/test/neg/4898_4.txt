Barry Humphreys, the brilliant Australian comic genius, had a rare setback with this bumpy and sometimes unpleasant comedy that was torn out of the release in just a few days. A drunken, lecherous Australian diplomat, Sir Le Patterson, accidentally sets fire to Arab power at the UN and travels to his tiny country as a punishment, arriving at a time when a palace coup puts the throne of the new leader (American soap star Tao Penglis). Sir Les, with the reluctant help of Dame Edna Eviger (in both films Humphreys plays), almost accidentally violates the plan of the new leader for the release of the deadly, disgusting, AIDS-like virus in the Western world. Joan Rivers has a cameo in the role of a female president of the United States, on her sign that says President Rivers! Extremely bad taste mixed with farces and the usual disgusting satire of Humphreys in the film, which in many funny roles gives more pleasure than in general. Fans of Dame Edna TV may be perplexed by the presence of another Madge AllSop, unfortunately, the one who lacks Emily Perry's wonderful monotonous comedic magic in the role. The film was written by Humphreys and his third wife, Diane Millsted, and Mad Max himself, George Miller, became the director. For loyal fans of Humphreys like me, this is important. Everyone else, be careful.
