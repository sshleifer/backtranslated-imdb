The most enjoyable parts of this movie were clips from the original movie. The game was bad and the premise of sexual evaluation cards was disgusting. The effects were minor at best. There were no outstanding performances; Amy Irving was included in this film to try to get a part of the H20 Halloween viewers. The original was much nicer and nicer. I'm sorry to say that this will not be one of the top 10 years ... as long as it is at the bottom of my list. Don't worry about it guys!
