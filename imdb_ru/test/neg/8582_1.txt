I have always considered the amateur Man Ray and his artistic efforts very pretentious, and I never understood why his work attracted so much attention. Besides his Rayographs (which he invented by chance, and which are simply direct photographs of print), his real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to portray female nudity in a way that was rather accepted as art like porn. But, of course, this should have happened in the end, and there is no real reason why Ray deserves praise. A critical reaction to Maine Ray reminds me of a story about the Emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> "L'Étoile de merde" ... oops, "de mer" ... shows a lot of blurry photos and a recurring visual starfish theme that is never explained. Starfish have an amazing ability to restore lost limbs — and even restore entire duplicate bodies — but, if it has anything to do with the subject of this film, Ray does not want to talk about it. I was more impressed by the title cards of this film, which (in French) include rhymes, puns ('Si belle, Cybele') and a little portmanto. <br /> <br /> How often in the work of Ray in this film is really visible a beautiful young woman. Unfortunately, the photograph (to a large extent) is so blurred that we have little opportunity to evaluate it. I rate this mess one point out of 10.
