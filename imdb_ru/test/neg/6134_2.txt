I saw this DVD in a store near my house, and since I’m a stupid horror / alien film addict, I wondered how good it was. He even had two awards on the cover (I don’t remember which festival he won), so I thought, “Hey, that could be good.” So I bought it (for five euros) and came here to IMDb to check out some reviews. Here, either people beat the film to say it was bad, or people said that the film was a great feat in indie films, blah blah. Then I played a DVD, without thinking about any review I read, with an open mind and not expecting anything. <br /> <br /> Dude ... I don’t like being so critical, but the film was really bad ... Well, I’ll just tell you what I thought: <br /> <br /> 1-action / dialogue: the action was so confusing ... sometimes the actors did a decent job, but there were scenes in which I didn't even notice any effort! The dialogue was even worse ... I think it was the aspect that I most disliked in the whole film. The conversation between the characters seemed ... turned off. Not just bad, but far from the real events in the film. Monologues of a female character, although well-placed, became boring and annoying after a while ... But, of course, the most ridiculous aspect was ... "aliens" or "infected" ... I will not even comment on the one just going to say that it was absolutely ridiculous and removed the whole mood from the picture; 2-visual effects: the most powerful aspect in the film ... if you forget the terrible effects and flashes of light that they used to simulate explosions or what the hell they were supposed to be. The “camera in the car” aspect was pretty cool, but they didn't even use the environment to inspire fear or fear. They left it cheap audio and video fx and three "infected" characters. The film gets boring in many scenes ...; 3-Sound: let's talk about editing ... this film shows without any problems how weakly it was edited. From computer sounds, imitating forest animals, to "alien dialogue" ... ah ... <br /> <br /> So what I liked in the film ... (SPOILERS) was the only thing I really liked and it was actually quite scary there was an alternation of two scenes, where the car was still standing and you noticed something / someone walking in the distant. At first, I really thought I saw it, but when the character understands that “figures”, reaching her was her own reflection, I was surprised! Pretty creepy idea done well! Besides ... I had a terrible time. <br /> <br /> And I do not recommend it to anyone ... even a "teenage meeting" because you can't even laugh at it ... <br /> <br /> I give it firmly 2. Only some technical achievements have worked here ... except for this ... yes ... nothing
