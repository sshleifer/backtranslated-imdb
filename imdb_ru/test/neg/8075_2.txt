Stephen King's television films can consist of 5 or 6 parts, and no one complains, right? So why give Stooges only 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS mini-series, but would any of the two participants kill? The film described the events that should have been mentioned, and mentioned the events that could be omitted. I want to pay tribute to the performances of the stars ... they had a hard job, because they were not like the Stooges, but the spirit was there. After watching the movie, I pulled out a tape with American Movie Classics, in which everything was real, and laughed stupidly. The film was quite tough from an emotional point of view, especially after Curly had a stroke, and Mo needs to continue the business. When Curly started crying, I lost it ... As I said, the movie was good, but it could be and MUST be much, much better. Maybe it is appropriate, though ... The billet was torn off when they were alive, and now, 25 years later, it happens again.
