This film begins with the fact that children tell each other urban legends, such as a poodle in the microwave, and get something else in the chicken place. Unfortunately, this turns into your main anthological film. The first is about the janitor with a little secret. With this, everything is fine at best. Then it gets worse when the next story begins about this child who is obsessed with dead flies, and it goes on and on and on. It is a long way, and not everything is so interesting to begin with. After that you get a typical shock scene and it all ends. You need more than that in an anthological film. You need at least three stories, and one should not be so long that it becomes terribly uninteresting, especially when you consider that you can see how it will end for a mile.
