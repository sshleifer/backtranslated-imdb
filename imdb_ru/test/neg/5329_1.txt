Screenwriter Emilio Esteves demonstrates here a certain lack of talent in this intransigent, supposed comedy. The script is completely hopeless, not to mention the fact that it is unoriginal and poorly worked. Comedy just does not work. When Estevez doesnâ€™t use low-taste sex jokes, he lends his jokes and makes them very bad. You might think that the union of Estevez and brother Charlie Sheen would be cool ... but ... it is not. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is boring and unmixed, it never manages to cause laughter, and hardly coaxing the smile of its audience. Do yourself a favor and leave it on the video shelf. <br /> <br /> Thursday, June 25, 1992 - Videos
