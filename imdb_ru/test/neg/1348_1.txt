I was very disappointed with this movie. Mrs. Inglish, who says that she is a fan of the original film, seems to have taken a big piece of the artwork and turned it into a flat ho-hum line, you have come a long way in child production. I tried to like Mary Haynes Meg Ryan, but she was just boring. It seems that she did not feel anything in the business of her husband. There was no emotional struggle, no deep resentment. In the original 1939 film, Mary Haynes of Norma Shearer felt betrayed, shocked, vulnerable, confused and angry. The 2008 production was more about some fake sisterhood theme, (actually my wife's words), and didn't make you cry or even laugh. The only plays that were worth seeing were Debra Messing and Bette Midler. (I wanted more Bette.) There really wasn’t the main character in this movie. Sylvia Fowler’s character had too many subtopics. And Crystal Allen had no fire. Alteration of the Roman department store, meeting with Annette Benning, and Miss Mendes was Luke warm. Also the move was slow. Obviously, the 1939 version needed to be updated, but not this. The reason why the original version worked so well was that the characters dealt with "human" problems. Subject by the way is not outdated. The magic of the original film was that the film was about both sexes, while you never saw men.
