Although I'm a fan of Heather Thomas and I have some of her old bikini posters around here, I can honestly say that if the only film I've ever seen her was “Cyclone”, I would never guess why she did it as far as in show business. <br /> <br /> Directed by Fred Olen Ray (almost the same omen as the vision of buzzards circling over the head in the desert), this story about a woman (Thomas) who should protect a high-tech motorcycle from dishonest types as the movie "B" as it gets (or in the case of Fred Olen, "B minus"). <br /> <br /> The actor himself must tell you something. Not every film unites Thomas with actors such as Besvik, Hall, Combs, Donahue, Tamblin and Landau (!!). If you're lucky, very few movies. And even though they seem to be having fun, shouldn't some of this pleasure be conveyed to the audience? I vote yes, they seem to have voted no. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you ever wanted Heather to deliver an uppercut to another woman, use the word “F” and connect to the battery cables, you probably were looking for it. Myself, I will be pleased with the old repetition of the "Fallen Guy." <br /> <br /> One star, in the hope that when another Cyclone hits the city, Heather will run away. I know, I will.
