God, I never felt so insulted in my whole life than with this shit. There are so many ways to describe this piece of shit that I think that if I said everything that occurred to me, I would be banned from this site. <br /> <br /> How do I get started? Well, firstly, you do not need to know the original series to understand that this film is a slap in the face to the people who saw it. What did they think when the biggest slaughterhouse of an ever-created thematic song occurred, from the metal version to the awesome RAP VERSION? How does the Underdog and heavy electronic music style? The story is so simple that I will do what I usually do not do, and I will not even give a summary. Think like this: the dog gets superpowers, fill the rest. This is how predictable this movie is. And then there are jokes .... please kill me now. This style of humor, which may not even make the children laugh, is so bad, well, wait for this highlight after sneezing. That was a little fun. <br /> <br /> But what surprises me most is that Jason Lee (Ny Name Is Earl), Patrick Warburton (New Groove of the Emperor) and Jim Belushi (according to Jim) are all here. In the TV shows / films I mentioned, the actors, in my opinion, do a good job with their work, and, with the exception of Lee, are the best actors in this film, but that says a lot. The rest deserve the Golden Raspberry nomination for this shit. I am very sad to see such good actors buried in this disaster. <br /> <br /> In general, this is as bad as Dougal, which I also revised, and again my head would explode if I saw anything worse than this.
