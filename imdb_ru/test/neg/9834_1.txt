Well ... for the most part, and for all its gaiety, this film was actually quite good for the MST3K film ... but then they decided to destroy the little perfection that he had fifteen minutes before the final. * SPOILER WARNING * The film is very simple ... a rich mom's boy named Danny meets a bum named Bix, and together they go to a small town where Bix meets a pretty girl named Carrie (which is very cute). Now, the basic premise of this film seemed quite promising. All they had to do was follow the simple chemistry of any romantic film ... Carrie loves Bix ... Bix loves Carrie ... a creepy guy in town craves Carrie ... Now I know what you're thinking. .. Bix fights a creep and eventually decides to sit down with Carrie, and Danny returns home, and they all live happily ever after ... right? WRONG!! Because Kerry was killed by a city crypt, because Bix is ​​too cheerful to commit. (There are so many homosexual shades between Danny and Bix.) And then the whole city decides to lynch Bix, even though creep in the city could easily be the main suspect. Then, the city creep confesses that he killed Kerry without much hesitation ... (he must have felt bad, poor thing). Then Danny brought Beeks home with him ... it's a long and happy movie. Sad, huh? All I can say is thank God for Joel and Bots. Because they turned this hockey on horses into one of my favorite episodes of MST3K.
