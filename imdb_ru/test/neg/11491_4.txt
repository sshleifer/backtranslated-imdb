FREDDY FORSYTH invented a storyline that will correspond to the mood of the West in relation to Putin's Russia. Forsyth appoints to the nasty guy the president of Russia, who wants to return the country - not so much to Stalinist communism, as to Hitler's fascism. In fact, his Political Manifesto could have come directly from Mein Kampf, and not from Marx. In addition, Gagar has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve ethnic cleansing of pogroms in the Russian Federation. American mercenaries indulge the Russian president to realize his fanatical dream of genocide, but then enter Pat Swayze from Dirty Dancing ... and, yes, things get really dirty. He is a former US operative who has become a fraud, Jason Monk, who was enlisted by the British government to find out what the Russians are doing. As a banal sidebar, the character of Swayze, who is not a Monk (!), Brought to light Russian beauty Helen (played by the magnificent Martha Kondova) during her previous missions in the former state of Commi. Hardman Swayze does a decent job trying to defeat the evil Russians. But the young, unknown actress Martha Kondova steals the film, like his 18-year-old Russian daughter, Elena, who helps her father to eradicate the terror that threatens her beloved Mother Russia.
