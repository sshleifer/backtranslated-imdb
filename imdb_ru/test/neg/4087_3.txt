If, like me, you liked the first Bruce Almighty film, I advise you not to raise your hopes; don't really pay attention to any hope you have for this film, if you are over 12 years old and you generally have some meaning in the film. <br /> <br /> Without giving away too much, the story sees Evan (Nemus' enemy with Bruce anchor from the first film) to move home with his family to a suburb of Virginia to “change the world” with a new political path. This is followed by a rather contrived and rather “stupid” storyline, which is clearly intended for young children as the main target audience. Unlike its predecessor, Evan Almighty is a family-oriented film with an ambiguous comedy genre marked by the misleading position of a "sequel", which some consider to be a modern comedy classic that a slightly more mature, high-class audience can enjoy. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, Evan Almighty includes horrible cinematic values. Actions; not to mention Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman, it was tough, and many characters seemed to be added to spend an unnecessarily large budget allocated for production. In addition, the cast includes the acting legend of John Goodman, which appears in the role of the heel and is seen only a few times throughout the film; I did not quite buy this character and thought that the storyline in which he participated did not have enough depth even for a family comedy. Any other character in the film (especially the wife and children!) Deserves a mention for their acting game, so crappy that it can fill the royal size of Kiev. Be warned though; This is a typical Americanized cheddarfest associated with many popular family-oriented films, so I would advise you to protect yourself with the nearest grater in sight. <br /> <br /> It may seem that the film is not worth anything yet. It has some promising aspects. CGI was outstanding, and it was clear that a lot of time was spent on modeling the Ark and creating water effects and animating computer-generated animals to an end. Particles, renders and textures used were aesthetically stellar. Although a part of me could not help but think that they are not suitable for a film with such bad ideals and, in my opinion, are “too good” for this fragment of the movie and are showing the film everywhere. <br /> <br /> In general, I see this film as a catastrophe from the point of view of continuing what was a franchise with great potential, but unfortunately it did not justify the poor results in the Almighty series and approaching the end of the film I highly appreciated my expectations for the epic and some significant finale to fill in the mediocre content that I have seen so far. This was not the case, and I was deeply disappointed and confused by the latest loans. Since I was sitting with discontent, I could not help, but I think that the film was not as “Mighty” as I had hoped. In many respects, the film reminded me of the diluted “Night at the Museum”, as it showed similar styles and characteristics, but, unfortunately, was even lower than the leagues. <br /> <br /> I give this film 3 out of 10, as it is watchable, but it should definitely be avoided! If you MUST see this movie, be prepared for disappointment, as “softly entertaining” is the best thing you can hope to get when watching a specified movie.
