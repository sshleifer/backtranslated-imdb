We see Thomas Edison with a radiant smile on his face, trying to electrocute a 5-ton living creature. In the end, he achieved success, and so was born the first film about snuffing animals, artfully disguised as an amazing achievement in technology. This is scientific arrogance at worst, guys. There he meets a doctor who decapitates a monkey, just to prove that he can save his severed head for 22 minutes. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, there is an absurd excuse that the elephant was convicted of “murder” and sentenced to death, and that it was a fair and humane “punishment.” For all people who are satisfied with this sophistry please put a line to my right. I'm going to give you all a big team of “Three puppets” a slap in the face. <br /> <br /> Watch the film “Lawyer” (1993), a film based on a true story of the murder of a pig in Mideval. France. After 500 years, I still see a bunch of morons. <br /> <br /> What's next? We arrest the birds for stealing our blueberries? Are Tova thorn for assault and battery? Thomas Edison, I hope you in the eye creeps big fat worm. Oh, wait, that would be a violation, right? lol
