Sometimes funny, but generally boring. I recognized Robert Hegies of Welcome, Carter (aka Epstein) as a former celebrity criminal. There is a knee-slap scene, a gut of a Frenchwoman who reacts badly to American food. S. Bayo, S. Kellerman and Tom Arnold are billed, but play only minor roles. You will never know the characters, and itâ€™s hard to care about what happens to them. Not recommended.
