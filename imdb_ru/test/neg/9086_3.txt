Originally, Spiders was planned as a four-part series, and it shows. I do not like TV shows; They are usually funny, tangled and trite. This one is no exception. In the first part of "Spiders", "Golden Lake", a rich adventurer violates the plans of a gang of criminals - "Spiders" - to steal gold from the Incas. It turns out a silly love triangle with some actions of Cowboys and Indians. Sensational and exotic things did not entertain me. <br /> <br /> One can legally trace the themes from this two-part series to the later, much more superior work of Lang. And making the film is better than in other TV shows I've seen during this time, including Les Vampires (1915). In Spiders, the camera is not so static, and, fortunately, this film is developing rapidly. Toning and lighting are also adequate. However, nothing surprising. However, it’s almost indecent how closely this series resembles the series of Louis Feyiad; the criminal gang dresses and behaves the same way as in “Vampires” - only the names and, to a lesser extent, the situation has changed. <br /> <br /> For additional comments on the Spiders series, see the webpage for this.
