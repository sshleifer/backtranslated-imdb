The two redeeming qualities of this film were cinema and the storyline from which it was difficult to resist. However, the script, the direction and some of the scenes were just awful. I kept asking myself why such a good cast would make such a bad film. My only conclusion was that these actors should believe in the charity that underlies the plot of the film, but they knew that the film was filled with flaws. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been much better and achieved more. audience accordingly. What makes me think that with all the problems of the film, when some scenes look painfully bad, I still wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would be solved.
