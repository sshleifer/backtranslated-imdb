This film was made because the concept is well translated into a summary of two sentences that can be used to attract investors. That is, the package is interesting and sold. I mean, I rented it based on a resume. The problem is that there is nothing but the original concept. There is no coherent story, no full-fledged characters, no real comedy, no interesting scenery, no surprises and good performances (except John Herder, he does something with very little). As if people who lit up green never read the script, but only a brief overview. And if people like me were enough, he could even earn. <br /> <br /> For a potential viewer: do not waste time, there is nothing funny or interesting here. The filmmakers: hey, you made your film, so if this is not so great. Most people will never see themselves or their work on the screen.
