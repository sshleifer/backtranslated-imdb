This French film is supposedly about a creepy, dumb cop who is investigating the rape and murder of a young girl in a small town. However, the film is really about nothing, and you need to go on forever to say nothing. If a character takes ten minutes to get from point A to point B, the film spends ten minutes showing this walk, and these are “battle” scenes. There are also static shots that last several minutes, causing the viewer to wonder whether he accidentally pressed the pause button on the remote control. The script has enough material for a 20-minute film. The film lasts seven hours or so. You do the math. The actors were obviously amateurs, and it shows. Note to yourself: never watch the Dumont movie again.
