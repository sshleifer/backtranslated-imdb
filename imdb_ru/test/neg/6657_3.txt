There were more holes in this plot than the alibi O.J. Simpson! <br /> <br /> I noticed two references to Star Trek in the film, and yet, ironically, we have the main character, played by Andy Garcia, <br /> <br /> the Vulcan antithesis Philosophy: "<br /> <br /> the needs of many outweigh the needs of the few or one." <br /> <br /> Let's just say, trying to save his son from cancer, he puts most of the rest of San Francisco at an incredible risk. The character of Michael Keaton is also almost unrealistic. He neglects to kill with multiple possibilities and is still angry when Garcia interferes with his attempt to kill a group of policemen at the same time. The child's doctor is still responsible for her abilities, even after <br /> <br /> several times for a short time was held hostage, but <br /> <br /> put her on a wide staircase for 5 floors up, and she loses it. <br /> <br /> In this film, Andy Garcia’s baby is a bit of an anathema. He is the most responsive and real character, one of the bright spots of the film. In addition, he utters a line that must have been the result of chance, regarding the fight against cancer, which is parallel to Keaton's motivation to run. In general, the film was not a complete waste of <br /> <br /> (see “From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money <br /> <br />”), but it was disappointing, given the talent at hand.
