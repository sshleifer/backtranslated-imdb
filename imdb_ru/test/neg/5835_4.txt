I urge you to watch this movie and refute the above statement. That is, IF you can stop looking at her almost flawless face. She also fights and shoots a little, but not as much as I had hoped. The film is very slow and low-budget, although, at least, they tried to find an excuse for such a sparsely populated spacecraft; almost the entire crew is on "suspended animation", and the ship is moving on autopilot! And the heroine does not save any of them and does not bring anything useful to "home"; it seems that fooling this evil lady on a journey through space was the only part of her mission that could not be more easily accomplished by rockets that blew up the ship at the end. There are also several long, but rather tame scenes with a soft core, and a pair of alien monsters who kill about two people. * 1/2 of 4.
