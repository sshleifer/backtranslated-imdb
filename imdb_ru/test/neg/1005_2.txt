Three businessmen are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men. Three businessmen are taking revenge that turns into murder after another. Perhaps the story of violence that can happen to ordinary people. <br /> <br /> There are too many holes in the plot. Details were ignored to advance the story. The game was bumpy. The color balance was terrible, although I watched this movie on DVD. The small budget and tight schedule were obvious. All this seems to be an excuse for shooting in the final shootout, and the final was just incredible.
