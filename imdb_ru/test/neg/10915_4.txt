Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King! And this is a pretty good movie for everyone. Crazy Kuj очень is very scary, and the film is tense. But after the first few minutes, when poor Donna and her little son Tad were captured in their Pinto by a mad St. Bernard, I began to wonder why she hadn’t done anything to help herself. <br /> <br /> She could put her foot out of the door and push the car back (I mean, it was Pinto for Pete, and they were on the slope of the descent) and turn to a safe place, but then it would be very short film When she started the car, she turned it in the opposite direction and hoped that she could at least partially drive along the road? No, she is trying to make a three-point turn in a car with a bad generator. She still managed to get out of the car and for about 45 seconds to look around, trying to get to the baseball bat, which lay nearby on the ground - what a waste of time! I mean, if you are going to run after the bat, do it, and at least you will have something to hit the dog. But forget about the bat. Were there no tools in the car, for example, tires or something like that? I did not see how she looked into the well of the spare wheel of the car. In fact, why wait until you feel dehydrated and you do not begin bouts of bout with the animal? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film she was beaten and torn, but God, she was still in high heels!
