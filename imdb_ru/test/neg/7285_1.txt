I am sorry to say this, but I didnâ€™t like this film at all. It was too boring. So boring that I could not watch the rest. It is not as interesting as the Lion King or Aladdin. That's why I hate these stupid days, because these days are just not the same as before. The movies that Disney has released lately really sucks! I miss the old days when they made good films like The Lion King, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Cinderella, Aristocrats and Robin Hood. This film is really terrible. I really tried my best to be interested in this film, but I just could not. I don't think I could recommend this movie to anyone. I would recommend the ones I just mentioned above.
