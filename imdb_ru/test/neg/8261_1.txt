Ru Paul plays a secret agent named Starrboti. She teams up with another transvestite agent to fight the wicked Annaka Manners (Candice Caine) and bring her kidnapped niece back ... or something like that. Seriously ... I had trouble concentrating on the plot! The film seems to be made by someone with a serious ADDITION - quick, non-stop camera shots that prevent them from focusing on anything. The dialogue is sometimes incomprehensible, and when you can hear it, you want it to remain incomprehensible! Acting is actually pretty good, with the exception of Roux Paul, who overdid it in an awkward degree. Also, the film is full of disgusting humor in the bathroom, which is just disgusting and not even laughable. After 30 minutes I had to leave, because I was bored, sick and I just could not bear it anymore. I am proud to be sitting through everything, but it went beyond my limits! People compare it to the early work of John Waters. I disagree. The work of Waters is sick, but good - it just hurts. Avoid.
