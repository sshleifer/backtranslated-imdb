I read newspaper reviews about this film, and I must say that my expectations were very low before I watched Ocean 12. I really liked the first movie, but this successor is one of the worst films ever. I would rate this top 5 worst films I have ever seen. Why do I say that? First, the story is so subtle that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like the perfect action movie. Fragments to which the term “history” can be assigned are sometimes loosely attached, but most of the time the film simply moves without purpose or attraction. The whole story seems intrusive, and the scenario surrounding the story is even more intrusive, because sometimes it turns into a farce. <br /> <br /> Actors appear, but do nothing to earn recognition or appreciation. Most embarrassing leading ladies (Roberts and Zeta-Jones), who either replay or extremely simple. Damon, Clooney and Pitt are also not brilliant. Honestly, I really do not understand how they would like to be associated with something as bad as this movie. <br /> <br /> === May contain spoilers ==== Camera and editing, take a breath where I should start. There are many unnecessary camera movements that only make the experience painful. Combine this with highly unassuming editing, and you will start looking for a wooden spoon to cut out your heart. Especially the scene where the whole gang is taken out of prison to be taken away by car. Scaling the camera for each person just becomes boring, and when you are at number 3 out of 12, you get the message: wow, you are cool and can do simple scaling effects - NO. I understand that the scene with Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) playing Julia Roberts should be funny, but it becomes very embarrassing and you turn away to avoid confusion. Bruce Willis. What for? Please explain it to me! WHY ??? <br /> <br /> To summarize ... if you have to choose between working with the root canal and watching Ocean number 12, I recommend the first one. Make sure they make all your teeth while you are at it ...
