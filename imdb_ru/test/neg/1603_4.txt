Yes, there is a "sleeper" watching the Sleeper Cell, and that was me. After reading the comparisons with “24” (as on the cover of the DVD), I expected a dynamic action. But no ... this series simply attracts. In my half asleep half asleep, I thought: “He is going to ...” and, uh, it would have happened ... “I think this van will roll off from ...”, and here it comes. <br /> <br /> And so on. <br /> <br /> Why should Darwin in a very deep coating pursue a child? Maybe maybe provide some T & A? Hey, it works for me, so four stars, not three. <br /> <br /> This show is not "24". I watched "24". Sleeping cell, you are not "24".
