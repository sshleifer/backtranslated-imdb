Every film I have PPV, because Leonard Maltin praised him to the skies, blew up the pieces! Everybody from! When will I ever learn? <br /> <br /> Evi is a crazy Old Bag that doesn’t think anything about saying that she is dying of breast cancer in order to get her way! Laura is an unbearable Medusa, filled with the Holy Spirit (and her husband's protege)! Between these harpies stuck stupid as a rock, the boy of Medusa, whom Old Bag sucked the weeds into slavery! <br /> <br /> As I said, when will I ever learn? <br /> <br /> I was temporarily taken out of my discomfort when the Old Bag thrust its head into the sink, but unfortunately it did not die. I was again temporarily taken out of my discomfort when Medusa was mowed down, but, unfortunately, she did not die. Torturing an audience like this should be a serious crime! <br /> <br /> Rupert Grint without Harry Potter is just a pair of big blue eyes that practically bulge out of their sockets. The chewing of the scenery of Julia Walters (especially the scene when she “plays” God) is even more shameless than her character. <br /> <br /> At least this Harold is fucking some kind of prank instead of Maud. For this, I am sincerely grateful. And if you're reading this, Mr. Maltin, you owe me $ 3.99!
