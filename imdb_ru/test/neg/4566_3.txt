I believe that this is a teenage film of "alternate reality" ... More precisely, a character like Ferris Bueller in the role of a cheat-ring leader. Yes, I know that this is not intended to be compared with Ferris Bueller, at least not in the sense of “oranges to oranges”, but nonetheless. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: these are galaxies from even insignificant classics. This is watchable, but only if you do not expect much. However, the main character has some charm, but the premise wears out, because the letter is simply not clever. The film simply did not deliver enough laughter, turns, or tension to support my interest. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I continued to look ... I watched hopefully, suddenly something clicked. This is not true. So, no matter how stylish it is, I would not recommend this film. By the way, it seems strange to see Mary Tyler Moore as director. She really is mistaken, I hope that the salary was excessively large.
