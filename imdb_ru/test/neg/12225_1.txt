This is the worst movie I've ever seen. If I had not watched it for free, I would never have finished it. The creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves. It seems that it should be a film in the spirit of the film “The Terrible Film and Date” (a terrible movie, but 10 times better than this one), but failed miserably. The only jokes in this film seem to be based on farce. The guy falls, someone knocks the bus, etc. None of the ideas are clever, basically this is the worst premise for a movie. The plot (or lack thereof) is completely backward. The plot seems to be centered around the trainer and his family, but there are so many other things happening in the film that it is completely ridiculous. A terrible, terrible movie.
