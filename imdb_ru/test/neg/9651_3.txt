I assume the film is based on a hefty book. Given the number of characters and plots during Katyn, I thought that the filmmakers, perhaps the screenwriter or director, intended to create an epic film. But in fact, there was not enough time to properly spend on the development of characters or stories. An aggravating circumstance was the set of unrelated side stories that could be edited. <br /> <br /> Regarding the events that led to the mass murder of all these intellectuals and officers, I do not think the film explained any reasons why the killing was necessary. Was it political? Philosophical? Revenge? An interesting part of historical films is to see personal motives or emotions. Instead, the killers of Katyn seemed to be machine guns, fully controlled by Stalin, who is sometimes portrayed as a coal draft. The image of Russians and Germans seemed completely one-dimensional. (Is the Polish people really so angry with Russians?) Besides the fact that the choice of music and cinema was badly edited and biased, or at least unrealistic, it did not correspond to each other or the film itself. I donâ€™t think you can really shoot an epic war movie or military event on a handheld camera. (But if the director used a character-driven plot, perhaps focusing on one family, perhaps a convenient camera approach would work better.) And if you use really dramatic music, it should be better balanced with the type of shots done.
