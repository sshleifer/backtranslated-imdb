Oh god, I'm really fed up with all these typical Japanese horror movies about long-haired ghosts and ghostly children. "Ghost train" is no exception. It is clearly influenced by the "Ring", "Ju-On", "Shutter" and "Pulse". Two years ago, I was fascinated by such modern ghost stories, because they usually managed to give me goosebumps, unfortunately, there is nothing fresh or interesting in Ghost Train. Actually the film is really boring. goes missing in the subway tunnel as a classmate of an elementary school. Nana should investigate the mystery of multiple disappearances with the help of a young train conductor and the mother of another “disappeared” child. The film offers some slightly eerie moments, however the CGI effects are ridiculous and the climax is illogical. Skip this.
