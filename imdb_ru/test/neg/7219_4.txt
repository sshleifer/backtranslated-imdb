Let me start by saying that you know that a movie doesn’t run well when additional material makes a cover. With that said, anyone who says that this is the worst film ever dramatic, and who says that the film is great, is completely delirious. The film "this is what it is." And what is it ... A modest budget (4 million dollars, I estimate), the continuation of the studio. The film is not scary, but for fans of Road House it will be a disappointment. And that brings me to the first problem: just as Dirty Dancing would not be what they would be without Swayze, Road House is not without it. The facilitator lacks depth, character and attractiveness for the transfer of the film. I feel that the lead was thrown badly, and the producers had to lean back to get Patrick to do it if they were going to make a sequel. The other cast was uneven with prominent actors, such as Will Patton, and the extra day players who could not act out of the paper package. Busey, whom I saw, made outstanding characters, it seemed that he had just sent it by mail. Ellen played well, except for the fact that she was not at all believable, like chickens raised on baio. Sherry, a DEA agent in the first bar, was hot and a good actress, but her role was clumsily small and undeveloped. The writer completely missed all the opportunities to add depth and interest to the story and characters. Instead, choose a basic one-dimensional film. Which leads me to the biggest problem - the script ... I had a bad feeling when the captions ended, and there were three scriptwriters, separated by "and" and "&". It looked very amateur. And this is what was written. I heard that the original script was better, and then a rewrite was made and the sucking of the hard core began. Here are some tricky parts of the film that are worth seeing ... During the first secret meeting, the obvious drug deal is under the table. “Hey, let's meet in a crowded nudist bar, I'll get a piece of Coca-Cola out of my jacket, and you get the cash, and we'll put them under the cocktail table.” WAIT! "Pay attention to what you are looking left and right to make sure that no one is looking!" Secondly, I like when someone gets a shot in the chest, and then you see how he sits happy, like a lark, after 10 minutes. At the end of the film there are several unpleasant editing issues, especially during the fighting scenes and when the main character chases the doors and faces the patron. This brings me to the realism of the DEA training, I will not get technical training ... But jumping through the doors is not standard training ... Like typical female agents who bust their asses to do this in men oriented field, act like weak character ... Bored! Thanks for the chauvinistic view of the director's heir. There are other things that I could teach in school courses about this ... Accelerated battles, vulgar dialogue, a revised history ... and so on. But in addition to everything that you just can not like ex- Mister. Applegate, he absolutely lacks the modest Zen coolness that made Mr. Patrick Swayze such a bad ass. He just amazes me as one of those five-foot actors who think they are a bad ass, but just like Van Damnit, he faces a very bad ass (Chuck Zito in the Van Ne case) and gives him a lesson about "badassdom" Therefore, I feel that this is the main support of the film, if you are a bad ass, you are a bad ass, you do not need to try. Well then ... That's why your audience, average Joe ... will not shoot this movie. lm, and if they do they will write reviews like this.
