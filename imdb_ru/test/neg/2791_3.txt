The film begins with the fact that we see footage of a huge drought of the 30s in America. Then it tells about the terrifying-looking farmer Elia, who made a deal with Satan to get a good harvest. Elijah hired young people to work in his garden, killed them and used them as stuffed animals. He also fed the earth with their blood. After a while, 2 cops come to him. One of them was shot by Elijah, the other killed the farmer himself ... After that, today is shown, and some guy by the name of Shawn is told that he left the old farm as a legacy. He decides to go there with friends to see what happened. Little did Sean know that the next night was “Payback Night” ..... <br /> <br /> As for me, this film had a good horror film story, but the low budget and bad special effects simply destroyed It. "Dark Harvest" is a great example of lazy filmmaking. For example, we see a scarecrow (an ordinary guy in a funny cheap mask) chasing a girl. When he raises his hand, we see normal human skin under the glove, not rotting flesh. The mountain is also not very impressive. Our "cute" stuffed animals commit several nasty murders, but everything is very cheap and unreal. Surprisingly, the acting skills in this film are somewhat normal, or, rather, plausible. Some nude scenes are also presented to fans (even lesbian scenes), but these scenes do not save. <br /> <br /> Verdict: good music, good story, good game. But terrible effects, cheap blood and holes in the plot slow down this film. Not very recommended.
