If you've ever made a purchase at Wal-Mart, then you probably know about a $ 5 DVD cask in the electronics department. Well, that's where I found this movie. However, I was deceived! You see, on the cover of this particular DVD, there was a big picture of Sandy Bullock and even her last name was given as the headliner. I picked it up, thinking, “Wow, I didn't know that Sandra Bullock made this movie?!?!” So ​​I was ready to go home and watch Sandra Bullock's cool movie. Much to my surprise, Miss Bullock had a small role ... a very small role. She plays the girlfriend son of a CIA agent. Talk about supporting the actress. She could have no more than 2 lines in the film. Besides being deceived by the fact that it was the movie “Bullock”, I looked past this and continued to watch the “fascinating” movie. Negative! At some point, for special effects, the gun was attached to the camera. You have to watch this to laugh at what is really terrible.
