For the Mongolian speakers, the film lacked emotion and accent. I used too many non-native speakers, especially Jamuqi. Too many deviations from the real story. Scary awful subtitle !!! I wonder where and who made this subtitle? It was in English and Thai. I wonder how bad the Thai subtitles were if the English subtitles were too bad! The life of the greatest leader described is very uninteresting. There are the best films made by Mongolian directors with a very low budget since the 1980s. Honestly, I wonder if the film critics of the Academy Awards are lenient or how? The only good thing was some kind of good CGI in some battle scenes only moderately ... not beyond CGI
