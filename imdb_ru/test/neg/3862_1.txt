Imagine Diane of Cheers, self-centered about the intellectualizing character, and now imagine that she was trying to make a film about moire. That would be that. If you only looked at some frames without sound, you would think Hmmm ... it could be a good movie. <br /> <br /> Now, if you turn on the sound and listen at any time, you will quickly realize that the person who made the film knows nothing about the movies, except what they read in the book. I constantly thought it was a foreign film, it was so bad. <br /> <br /> If you don’t remember Greetings, think about Mr. Bins Holiday ... remember the character Defoe, who made the movie horror ... well, imagine this terrible movie without Mr. Bean’s salvation. This is what this movie is. I don’t say anything about what kind of film it is, except for trying to make a dark gloomy film about a hired assassin returning home ... at least that's all I could get out of it.
