I was also the wife of an abusive husband, even if in my situation the attacks were psychological, not physical. He presented a very respected, responsible and generous personality to everyone who saw us together, which, unlike me, led to the fact that others began to treat me as boring and unstable. Initially, I was so incredibly flattered that anyone like Gus (who worked at the bank and was very confident in himself) would even give me the time of day, and I fell on my head for his idea, and not the person he was. If I had a straight head, and I would first know him much better, I would never have married him. However, this is my mistake. It was not my mistake to be abused. I did not deserve it, and I did not expect it to happen until I was involved in intellectual games, criticism and isolation. He behaved as if I had no business that held an opinion that was different from his own â€” in fact, he went further. If I did not agree, he assumed that I had misunderstood, and more and more simplified his wording ... by the time I finally lost my self-esteem, I was unable to recognize the predicament I was in, and I had to be touched by reality from outside. My dad said Gus called me a bitch. Well ... another half a year passed before the rage that started at that moment finally exploded, and I collected something while he was at work and I left. ... and a few more months passed before I could realize the fact that I had been abused, and that it was not my fault, that he was doing what he was doing. ..... so please, anyone who suggests that this is the fault of the victim, THINK !!! If a cruel owner kicks a puppy when, in an alarming situation, he gets into the carpet, do you blame the puppy? by the time violence in a relationship reaches an apparent level of violence, the target of abuse becomes so wounded and impersonal (as in the Nazi concentration camps) that it is almost impossible to accurately assess the circumstances, because by that time the victim believes that offender. Have a heart, people. To mark victims of cruel treatment as stupid assholes is the same as kicking someone who has already been badly beaten. -------> and it helps how ???
