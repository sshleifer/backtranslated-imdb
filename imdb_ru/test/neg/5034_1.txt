It has been ten years since this film was released, and the sands of time have not improved it by a single step, again, like other comments made by Australian filmmakers, should have a little more drama than the middle-class aussies. places on bikes with not much was in dialogue. the middle class is not funny and not rich. There is also Misha from casting. why a young woman is going to marry a man old enough to be her father, it eludes me. This is such a shame about this movie, looks like a great place to relax you. Anyway, this is the hour and thirty minutes of my life, I can never go back. life is short to watch this movie.
