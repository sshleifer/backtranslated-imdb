I am probably one of the few people who protect and even enjoy Frisk, the project that put Todd Verov on the map, if he really is where he is. I appreciated that someone had the courage to take Dennis Cooper and not retreat from the material; Faith rightly rolls in it. Judging from what he has done since then, he is well suited for this type of material and probably should stick to it. Vacationland, a potential teenager coming out, is so mistaken that it turns into an unintended comedy, and I'm disappointed that I have to report it. <br /> <br /> First of all, our hero, high school student "Joe" is too old to play 18. When we later meet a man who is supposed to be Joe's teacher, this is confusing because the guy with the sweaty face looks much younger than the student he teaches. Mother Joe looks younger than he, and also does not "act" older. Secondly, in Joe’s introductory scenes, he looked like he was playing or was actually experiencing mental problems. To his credit, he got better when the film went on, and I realized that he was “playing young,” but it just didn’t work - it was weird. <br /> <br /> It took 15 minutes before something said about who, what and where these people are, and why we should care. The second scene in the film is a long business in the men's toilet room, which, considering where the story goes later, is absolutely superfluous; the plot with the teacher leads to nothing at all, even as a “rite” for our “young” hero ... one minute Joe nervously tries himself in sex in the bathroom (the scene is so non-erotic that makes you really curious that someone sees in practice), next minute he is an expert on sexual blackmail and violent double actions. Then follows an extended scene with a character that we will later learn, "Andrew," and that's all that we learn about him, except that apparently gay but not out yet. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of things squeezed in at 1:44 (which is about 20 minutes for too long - I can't imagine how he played with insanely long and meaningless deleted scenes of Joe walking around); storyline filmed in Gods and Monsters, with an elderly patron who publishes rhetoric, not approving of anything that an actor plays that clearly cannot remember his lines (it’s convenient to treat him in the way Dickens could come up with a slow week) ; almost four ways to mix-n-match between boys and their friends, a vagabond in a toilet for gays, a potential wise sage in the form of Queen Nell (and did not Queen Nell suddenly take over the role of a “prostitute with a heart of gold” as the most tired stereotype?) that exists only to degrade; blackmail, theft, murder, alcohol use and abuse of software for looping music to record the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> In this film you will NOT find any original interior frames; we are expected to be at the airport, the grocery store and the classroom, since all the scenes in these places consist of close-ups and poorly edited sound scenes to convey the idea that production should not have been able to afford. The one thing they could get seemed to be a real gay bar; either this is the worst bar in the world, or in Bangor, Maine, a total of about 5 gays, since there are never visitors in it. Another good chuckle sounded when the actors had to shout at dance music, which was obviously not coming from the speakers, but was just a buzzing loop-music of “score”. <br /> <br /> Plots and characters come and go, emotions are unreadable, and the dialogue, clearly inspired by Dennis Cooper, “speaks in a cinematic manner,” that is, in fact, people don’t say that. Since we are not given any information about these characters, it is impossible to care about what happens to them; it’s as if Joe and his colleagues are once out of the air and can simply stop existing after the captions begin (of course, the character of sister Joe, girlfriend Jennifer Gray, who is crazy about Bohemia, seems to just “stop”, we never know where is she in LA or what is her problem ... but then again ... does it matter?). Visually, the film sometimes looks very good, I suspect that it is more evidence of new advances in high-definition video than anything else. Although editing is rather awkward (there was one great editing; Joe poses naked and says: “I wanted to play sports, but ...”, and we took a picture revealing his “ass,” haha). The composition is also sometimes strange (it seemed to me that I was watching the SCTV parody of Persona, when the boys were talking together in bed, and visually it looked as if their noses were stuck together for the whole scene!). <br /> <br /> One feels that Verov is indeed refraining from creating a “more capricious” or rougher film, as he usually does, and perhaps he shouldn’t have to hold back (foamy toothpaste / sex fantasy worked well, I thought, although the tone is out of touch with the rest of the film) ... he produces and directs this “sensitive adulthood” story just like Herschel Gordon Lewis directed films without frizzled ... porno films without sex in them. I got some unintended laughter from it, and it wasn't boring, it just wasn't very good.
