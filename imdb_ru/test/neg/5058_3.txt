This is not a horrible movie, just tasteless. The plot is deeply flawed and implausible. It tries to be near genres and fails in everyone. It fails as a comedy, as a thriller of suspense and as a horror film. It is almost successful, like science fiction. The direction does not inspire, and Katie Holmes, the lovely cherubic person she is, should model youth clothes, not act. The only thing that keeps this film from being 1 out of 10 is Helen Mirren. Her performance is incredibly vile and (almost) worth suffering from the rest. Her ability to transform from domineering to artificially sympathizing, to manipulate and control her prey, shows a masterful range. In addition to Marissa Koflinâ€™s exorcising rendition, Mirren is the only reason to watch this film. Hard 3.0.
