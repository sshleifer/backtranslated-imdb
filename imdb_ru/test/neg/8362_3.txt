Congratulations to Cristina Ricci for shooting this film and pushing her mojo to this important topic and trying to make a great movie Ricci is my favorite actress: she is so gifted, so natural, her reactions are perfect, like the energy she constantly radiates , which gives hope to the often misused term "star". <br /> <br /> The film does not reach its goal for many different reasons, but perhaps most noticeably because of the seeming inadequacy of the story on the screen, which makes it a compelling narration ... more on this later. The cast is superb at first glance, but if you think Jessica Lang, like a Jewish mother, is too Protestant and not entirely correct, Anne Hatch does not come close to showing the sympathy and dedication of the psychiatrist from the book, and when you make a film, to justify the refusal of Anna Heche and Jessica Lange? But the real problems are in making the film: firstly, because of the inability to evoke any constant sympathy for the character Elizabeth Würzl, and secondly, to say something meaningful about the too common and terrible situation that this poor girl found herself in . br /> <br /> Unfortunately, due to the flashback design, Lizzy just looked like a more influenced teenager than most, but not as terribly ill as in the book. This is a serious problem. This story had to be told from beginning to end, and from the couch of the therapist. She is only eight or nine years old when her depression begins due to the destructive social factors, both of society and at home, and this is a decisive moment not only to cause her proper sympathy, but also to the seriousness of her work. She is so talented and so vulnerable and dissatisfied so early that the heart can not help her because of her victimization. This is missed in the film. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, you need to come to terms with what the film is trying to say: this is a biopic of one greatly injured girl, but also a film about a nation. who cannot come together; this is very clearly seen in the book, but, interestingly, not in the film, where those selected at Harvard are even more confused than ordinary students. The film, finally, can not convincingly explain any of these messages, and this is very bad. Is Prozac good or bad, or a mixed blessing, or seeming need in a country where so many people cannot function without a chemical crutch? These are tough and complex concepts for work, and the writing doesn’t actually attempt to address any of them in a more or less attractive way. The Challenger catastrophe is an interesting image, symbolizing dysfunctional America, but it does not give the effect that is supposed to take place due to its multiplicity and insufficient early development of control topics. <br /> <br /> Ricci demonstrates a tough and sincere and one of the best in her acting career. <br /> <br /> Michelle Williams is also great in her role.
