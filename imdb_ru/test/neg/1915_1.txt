I'm not sure why I didn't like this movie so much. Maybe I'm too old or too masculine or something else. Who was the target audience here? If they like you, then I'm happy for you. I personally found this little pill. The characters were uninteresting and unlikely, the script was just embarrassing, and some, though not all, of the actions were boring. Dark, tedious and sometimes nauseous - Of course, there is something better. <br /> <br /> On a related issue: why, when I see Chris Klein in a film, do I have a desire to slap him? Anyone else get this?
