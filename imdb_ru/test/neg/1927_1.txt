I watched this film to see the direction in which one of the most promising young talents in the movie is moving. Unfortunately, with this film, Lily Sobieski chose a path that was not only well thought out, but also completely free from any meaningful purpose. In this film, all the beaten tricks in the book were used to leave the screen, knock on the shoulder and politely ask if he could have your heart strings to give them a good push. Romance can be well done, and when this is so, the viewer is left to feel the love depicted on the screen. During the emotional climax of this film, I laughed. Cordially. To save time and money, I would advise, instead of watching this film, eat carote syrup and velvet. This is about the same.
