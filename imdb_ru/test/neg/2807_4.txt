As mentioned earlier in other comments, the main problem for NVA is that it cannot decide what it wants to be, the cheapest kind of farce or an honest parody of the East German army. There are a couple of moments that are very exciting, for example, when one of the recruits returns from a military prison in Schwedt with a completely broken personality. But in the end, Leander Hausmann follows infantile humor. It is not surprising that the film failed at the German box office, because it is historically untrue with the actual situation in these training camps, and led by an actor who, unfortunately, is unable to give a detailed presentation. <br /> <br /> However, there is the camera work of Frank Grib, who - as always - does a wonderful job. If it were not for his beautiful pictures, I would rate the film much worse.
