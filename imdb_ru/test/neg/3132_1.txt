There is something rotten in this film, and basically the way it turns an ominous and perverted character into a hero, using our sympathy for his supposedly horrible situation. Sampedro, like many who have lost hope, chooses suicide. The fact that he had been thinking about this for more than 26 years probably worsens his condition, but the belief that we should do anything, even if it means stopping life, is in my opinion deeply wrong. What a contrast with the inspiring example of the scientist Stephen Hawkins, who suffered much worse in the worst condition! However, with an inverted moral, the film enjoys hero worship, and people with whom they disagree are depicted in simplified idiotic terms. There is little room for thin, especially in a meeting with a priest (deliberately manipulating a real meeting, which was with a much younger priest). Thus, I believe that the film is on a par with Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will. The insidious idea is that everyone should have the right to commit suicide if he feels that he can no longer live it. It does not matter whether you are physically or psychologically damaged, there are obviously people who believe that you have the right to choose. The same people can advocate for an abortion. This is all part of the current trend - to remove the sufferers or sufferers out of sight, to clean them under the carpet, says mom. OK, and we are all very pleased with ourselves. So, we go along the slippery path, believing that some lives are simply not worth living, and then we will decide that, since some people cannot really decide for themselves, we will introduce a state that will decide for them. Enter Adolf Hitler directly from this other Oscar rival "Der Untergang". Hitler, of course, believes that he performs exactly what Nature does, getting rid of the weak. Under his regime, forced abortions were carried out among “weaker” people, the mentally retarded were quietly removed, and the Jews were “humanely” eliminated with the help of gas. He would have applauded this film, and why should he not fit in with his philosophy ... "some lives are simply not worth living." I am different from Ramon Sampedro, Hitler and all the people involved in the making of this film. Human life is sacred, it is not a right, it is a gift and an obligation. No one chooses to be born. Then who can choose death. It's not about religion, but about protecting the weak and helpless, something that this film can undermine!
