Now I understand that it took two months to shoot. Indeed? I’m pretty sure that my team can do it in less than a week. This film sucks so badly that I couldn’t even pay close attention to it. Just another proof that women with tits can't always save you from terrible writing, action and direction. Now I understand that there was no budget effort, but there is also no continuity and no real reason for not turning it off and not watching commercials or foreign news in a language that you do not understand. Oh, there are some decent looking women showing merchandise. However, there are not enough sexual women alive to justify watching this parody of the film industry. One of the longest 80 minutes of my life. I pulled it out with the help of my old friend Jim Beam. Do yourself a favor and prepare your weapon, because you can use it after this hacker job. Finally, the man (moron), who left a comment in front of mine, thought it was a great movie and loved it. Just another proof that brothers and sisters should not be created. Oh, BURN !!! - Captain J
