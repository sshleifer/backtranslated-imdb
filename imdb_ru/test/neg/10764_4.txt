When I returned to college, I studied marketing and, although I missed a lot of lessons and never paid attention to it, I will always remember the basic and most important principle of marketing, namely: this is not what you are selling; this is HOW you sell it! This principle fully applies to the "Devil's Triangle", as it is mostly beautifully packaged and tempting, but empty packaging. Writer / director Richard Wiener knew that he needed to divert the viewer's attention from basic inaccuracies, so he added some elements that never let you down when it comes to creating a creepy atmosphere, such as the sinister voice of narrator Vincent Price and the freak music King Crimson. And I guess that Richard Wiener's dirty little tricks worked very effectively, since in the mid-70s there was a huge stir with the Bermuda Triangle, and literally every film was made ?? Was it an inaccurate documentary or a dirty operating film? Coverage of the topic earned a lot of money at the box office. The Devil's Triangle floods you with unstructured and often irrelevant data, but the serious dramatization of the facts and, of course, the frightening harsh voice of the almighty Vincent Price create an atmosphere of fear and eeriness. The narrative constantly jumps back and forth in time and covers a huge number of "strange phenomena" and "mysterious disappearances" of ships and aircraft in the Bermuda Triangle for almost a century, but the messages remain extremely vague at all times and the eloquent Mr. Pryce invariably ends every chapter ominous with the words "just another unsolved mystery of the devil's triangle." After a couple of cases, the whole formula just becomes ridiculous and almost pitiful, but I guess it caused real mass hysteria back in 1974. The documentary reveals the most notorious secrets of the Bermuda Triangle a little more, such as five planes of military flight 19, which inexplicably disappeared all at once and a peculiar case with the ship USS Cyclops, but even in these chapters only a minimum of correct information is given. For example, the cameras never go under water to explore, for example, the depths of the Bermuda region, and the evidence of allegedly real witnesses to the drama suspiciously resembles staged actorial scenes. If you are looking for an informative and objective documentary about the Bermuda Triangle, I certainly do not recommend this film, but if you want to sit back and listen to Vincent Priceâ€™s hypnotizing voice for almost an hour, this is your chance!
