I did not see Ishtar, but I was not lucky to see the postman Kevin Costner. This is worse. Maybe the worst piece of trash I've ever seen, and if you look at my review for the Moulin Rouge? it says something. The bad plot, acting was poor quality and even in vain (although, yes, Michael Keaton was in some of the worst films I've ever seen), and this film has no redemptive value for those who have more than half of the brain. DO NOT SEE IF YOU EXPRESSED THE 4TH GRADE, as you consider this an insult to your mind.
