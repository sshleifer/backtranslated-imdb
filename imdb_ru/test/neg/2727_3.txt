Now such times, I really would like to be a more avid reader of the literary repertoire of Clive Barker, since very few things feel worse than the inability to fully understand the film of this stunningly "visual" caliber. Based on the story "Kabala", the story of "Night Breed" includes a monstrous number of generous and strange creatures and the atmosphere in the underground society of demonic ghouls. A normal guy becomes associated with a strange world called Midian, because of his dreams, and his psychiatrist makes him believe that he is responsible for a series of horrendous killings of families in recent months ... Thinking that this is true, he retreats to Midian - is under the rural cemetery - there he is reluctant to accept. Nonetheless, psychotherapy is exactly what Khomeboy healed with the devilish scheme to snatch the Nightbreeds community ... <br /> <br /> Wanting to love this film so much, I was very disappointed in the long run. I, unfortunately, did not read the story, so Barker's fantasy world and its goal and all these monsters were terribly confusing, and the premise was painfully uneven. I understand how the final version was cut to hell and even Barker's moderate dislike for the overall product, but I just did not “understand” it. Even if it is important to read a story, I feel that it should at least be translated into a film in such a way that it is understandable to those who are not familiar with literature. If Kabal is as confusing as this movie is, then Barker is really milking the dead concept. I could not but feel a little bored after a while, especially when everything was becoming more and more ridiculous (somewhere on the stage in prison, I realized how much I was bored) - as a police department, fearlessly entering the war with Midianithon, as it happens every week ! No one seems to think that the idea of ​​immortal monsters is a bit ... strange. I REALLY liked the visual effects and all these crazy jokes that took place in Midian, especially this female porcupine and such a big head SOB ... Definitely an epic film, considering the huge number of effects and convincingly painful decor. David Cronenberg fills his position well, crazy crazy with his cool mask with potato zipper bags, but we ALL would like him to do some work behind the camera to help save this bunch ... <br /> <br < > So, if you have a blunder to Clive Barker's material and you fully understand what Midian is, why they show creatures during the introductory sequence of headlines (a terrible idea!), And why these creatures live there and like some kind of punk kid divided telekinetic link to this y, you should probably check "Nightbreed". I'll look for “Cabal” the other day and hopefully I will get some perspective ... Or maybe I will just forget this parody completely ... Until then, this is a poorly built and rather tedious movie mess ... Instead, watch Risen from hell".
