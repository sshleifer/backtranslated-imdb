Generally speaking, I am a fan of the film industry of Jess Franco, but for some of these films I really find it difficult to understand the motives behind them, or even the reason for their existence. Like this sick puppy, for example. “Sadomania” has absolutely no cinematic significance, it is poorly made without any plot and shows some of the most shameless dirty shots ever filmed. This is another dirty film about women in prison, where daily routine games with rape, lesbians and violent torture. The guards are insane than prisoners, and the institution is protected by an impotent governor who is sexually aroused only when he notices a girl who has sex with a dog (!). All the girls are very beautiful and naked throughout the film, but you cannot truly enjoy this spectacle with all the perversions that occur. Doubtful moments include a barbaric hunting game (you can guess that it is a prey), a deadly fight between a guard and a prisoner, and an image of a poor girl injected with a needle throughout her nipple. Auch! Avoid this sick mess, and you will save yourself from having to take TWO baths to wash away the dirt.
