I expected Born to Kill to be an exciting high voltage movie. Instead, he has two good action plots (one at the beginning and one at the end) and Robert de Grass’s amazingly atmospheric cinematography (usually a “glamorous” cameraman and an amazing title of noir), but the rest of the film is rather boring Lawrence Tierney experiencing a psycho-blow But this is strictly a quantity performance, mechanically generating what the public expected from him after Dillinger (an overrated film, but at least better than this one). Claire Trevor's character is too stupid and not motivated to attract any audience, and the action (such as it is) remains so decisive inside this damned house in San Francisco that the film becomes claustrophobic and not truly exciting. This is one of those films in which supporting players — in particular, Elisha Cook Jr. (Tierney’s homoerotic itch of the character — is one of the few subtleties in a rather obvious scenario) and Isabel Jewell beat the main characters. It also does not help that almost half a century after Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins revolutionized the depiction of psycho-killers on the screen in Psycho, Tierney has such rough and obvious signs that he could have a PSYCHO tattoo on there is no indication in the film why the original novel was titled "Mortal than a Man", but perhaps James Gunn made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are in the film. "Born to Kill" is a real disappointment to Robert Wise, who already has several quality films in the background, and he would continue his stellar career.
