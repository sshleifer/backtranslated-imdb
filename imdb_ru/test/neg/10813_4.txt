I totally agree. This is the "Black Dungeon" and a well-battered plot. The best scenes I thought were divers exploring caves passing through impossible underground passages, some of which were beating in the heart. The scenery was great. If they had completely managed without the main “alien” bad teeth of the bad CGI guys, the film would have been much better. All they had to do was never show the monsters, but make everyone think and follow Jack’s descent into insanity, and it could be Hitchcock’s high-profile thriller, perhaps award-winning. The game is not bad. But these rubber bits just reduce it to the standard rate.
