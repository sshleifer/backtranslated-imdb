First of all, the first thing that came to my mind after I finished this movie last night was “Why is the name 8MM 2?” Because I saw the first one, obviously, and what does this have to do with the plot of the first movie? The only thing that looked like was that the couple had to go to the porn industry, and there was not even a need for a plot, because after you see the ending, which I will not spoil, it simply does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> The diplomat and his bride are in Hungary and notice a woman bathing naked in the pool, she is very attractive, so when they see her in the club, they decide to have some fun and there is a pair of threesomes. But everything becomes extremely tense when the diplomat mails the photos in which they all deal, fearing that it may be made public and jeopardize his career, they pay the guy who sent the photos, the diplomat goes crazy and “kills” the guy leading the murder case. He and his girlfriend decided to find a girl with whom they had an affair, but things get deeper and darker as they delve into what they were drawn into. <br /> <br /> What could have been a good thriller turned out to be an inexplicable and poorly thought-out film that was sad. As I said, the name really has nothing to do with the first one, so don't give in. It's just a sexy thriller that doesn't make any sense, but it's good for those nights only, because, frankly, this is one of those movies where it's so close to porn that it can also be labeled as a soft core. <br /> 4/10
