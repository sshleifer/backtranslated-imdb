Trading on the hit success of 1975, this film is a cheap story about a plantation where Massa goes down with slaves and Missus comes down with a big black stallion and Massa’s son. In fact, there is so much recession that I really don’t know why someone bothers to get dressed. <br /> <br /> So, if you want white women to roll their naked bodies tied up to slaves, or you just like a movie with boobs every five minutes, then this one is for you. <br /> <br /> There is a funny / sad story here, but it only comes at the very end in order not to interfere with all the hot, sweaty sex happening on the plantation.
