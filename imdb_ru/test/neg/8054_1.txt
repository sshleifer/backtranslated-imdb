Awful really everything you need to know. First, think about all the things that can be bad in a movie. And then try to make a film that is bad in all these ways. You made a "Vacation." The state of Maine should feel insulted: this is too good a place to serve as a backdrop for such a banal, senseless, boring slok. I am a romantic, and I always want films about two people who find each other to succeed, and I tried my best to find the good in it. This was hard; very difficult. I could not find a glimpse of emotional connection among the characters of this exercise in a boring longing. Except maybe one or two bad guys. <br /> <br /> Maine is a good country of rest; This movie is not.
