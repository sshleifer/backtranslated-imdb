Having seen this film, I could not help noticing the parallels between it and another film called “America 3000”. Both were very bad in the mid-1980s after the apocalypse disasters on celluloid. It is obvious that in both films there are fake decorations, wooden actors and stupid monsters. The only difference between the two is that the leading nastiness here (played by Angelica Yager) has a very strong accent. Avoid this if you do not see the MST3K version. Joel and the bots barely saved this turkey.
