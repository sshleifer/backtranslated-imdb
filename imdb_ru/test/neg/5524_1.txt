As already mentioned in other reviews, another of the countless number of alien clones, this time with the addition of the huge Terminator vibrator, adds a bit of a classic SF Story Who’s Goes There? the flashing red lights make the rampaging killer droids unable to detect frightened people standing three inches from them). <br /> <br /> Good, history: after a series of people running around in a spacecraft and killing each other, we get a signature. <br /> <br /> 25 years later. <br /> <br /> The crew of a relay station orbiting around Mars, to be released within 48 hours, discovers a huge spacecraft on the course of a collision. This is Siberia, the ship that we saw in the opening sequence. Not the right time to turn off everything useful at the relay station for repairs. The approaching vessel does not deviate from its course and transmits the message "NOT FOR EVERY CIRCUMSTANCES enter this ship!" Warning. After a lot of screaming at each other, the repeater team fixes something together and removes the station from the road at the very last moment. But the ship changes course and ram them in any way - by putting one of the crew members on a pointed, pointed thing. The satellite begins to "lose integrity." Bits relieve pressure. Many screams and running around, in which only two people from the crew are sucked back into space. (Why are they ALWAYS sucked backwards?). <br /> <br /> After a few keystrokes, a wheelchair-bound technician (called “Wheeler” - the only detectable joke in the whole movie) concludes that Siberia is draining their whole strength and they need to go to board and turn off its engines. They all go aboard and take off their helmets. "DO NOT enter this ship!" obviously means getting on board a ship and exposing itself to possible fatal infectious diseases. One of the teams heads to the Main Computer room, where they discover a dead, frozen guy compressing what looks like an American Express card, but it turns out to be a minidisk. Another team finds some switches. Surprisingly, the dead guy is the father of an attractive female team member, who is likely to survive after a collision with a frantic alien. They turn off the engines, but this means that the ship's reactor will explode. Creepy Shot of the View Shot starts killing people. There is some talk that Siberia has discovered a new ore, a source of potential energy worth millions, which means that the more corrupt members of the crew immediately put themselves in danger in order to master it. POV shot is back with a whistle! whistling! walking noises on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, this gives you an idea that the killer is wearing corduroy pants, and the effect is lost. <br /> <br /> After that, everyone just runs and kills in order of ugliness and acting ability, until only the obvious survivors survive. - together with a cute dog that managed to lead to the death of at least two crew members. Why veterans hardened in space roam in the mouth of certain death in search of their pets, cats and dogs, has long become a mystery for such films. Other stupid moments include the fact that everyone forgets to act on falling oxygen levels until the onboard computer’s voice reminds them (it’s not that the low level of oxygen in any way suppresses any of the massive fires that this load triggers idiots). If the Killer Droid ID is so smart, he can steer the ship on a steep curve and try again to push the relay station, why he didn’t turn off "NOT IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. Enter this ship!" To kill, then shout GO AWAY! it was not a very good way. <br /> <br /> Musetta Vander is the only person who can play a role - everyone else just blows his nostrils, baring his teeth, shouting and pointing his gun at each other. This is such a scenario; full of exclamation marks - the only thing that made me look until the end was the hope that the script would require her to take off all her clothes or get wet without putting on much. Unfortunately, this is not the case. One of the features of this film (except that there is more blue on the screen than in any other film) is that there was no nudity.
