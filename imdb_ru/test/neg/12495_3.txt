CyberTracker is set in Los Angeles in the near future, where bodyguard Eric Phillips (co-producer Don 'Dragon' Wilson) rescues Senator Robert Dilly (John Aprea) from an assassination attempt by a group known as UHR, Human Rights Union, who are angry with Dilly for that he heads the Computerized Judicial System, in which robots, called CyberTrackers, are sent to determine and administer justice guilty. In any case, Eric rescues Dilly, who is very impressed, and decides to find out if he can trust Eric in his dubious actions, such as the cold-blooded murder of a traitor, being a good frank guy that he is Eric, not impressed when Dilly kills a woman asking for him be silent. Eric runs away and intends to save Dilly, however, Dilly has many strong friends, and he uses his influence to substitute Eric and send his cyber-trackers in pursuit of him ... <br /> <br /> Produced together and directed by Richard Pepin A: I think movies like CyberTracker give movies a bad name, I didn't like it at all. Jacobsen Hart's screenplay is quite predictable, he doesn’t care, he steals most of his ideas and those from other top science fiction films, and the dizzying mix of martial arts and fantasy doesn’t mix very well. There are several fights, several car chases and a few shootings, but all of this is pretty soft and easy to forget. The film lacks imagination, given that the film will be released in the future, and it examines the robots, technologies, methods of managing society and, in particular, its judicial system. Saying that fantastic Robocop (1987) brilliantly mixed its brutal actions and clever social commentary, but CyberTracker does not even try to make any relevant social statement or portray any meaningful moral law enforcement message, the script basically uses this concept to There are robots and shootouts that Robocop did the same, but also managed to include a good story. In CyberTracker, very little of what I can say was interesting, and this is what films are right about? <br /> <br /> Director Pepin does everything well, but nothing stands out, it's all pretty easy to forget, and it's not particularly interesting. The sci-fi elements are nothing but the robotic side of things, and in general the film does not look that futuristic. The scenes are fine, there are a few exploding cars and a few skirmishes, but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> Technically, CyberTracker is average, for a film that is supposed to appear in the future, it already looks obsolete, and the special effects are bad. The game was bad, I wonder if Don 'The Dragon' Wilson signs the checks with that name? <br /> <br /> CyberTracker is a waste of my time, there is nothing original or exciting, and the action is instantly forgotten. Bad and that's all that needs to be said is not recommended.
