One of the most pleasant surprises of this early 3-band Technicolor short film was that the ballerina that appeared here was called Maria Gambarelli! I was half wondering if Blake Edwards called the character Elke Sommer played in “Shot in the Dark” after this now forgotten artist (although the spelling of the name of Sommer’s character was actually Gumbrelli). I watched it on YouTube mainly to see Judy Garland’s early appearance when we watch her in profile when her two older sisters sing La Cucaracha. This was the highlight for me, which otherwise showed some dances (for example, Miss Gambarelli), which was enjoyable, and some unfortunate comedy between Andy Devine as a great bull fighter (yes, that's right!) a bull that provides one that is obviously a man in an animal costume. The only fun part of these two - when they cry - Buster provides a scarf to the bull - during the sad part of "La Cucaracha". In addition, the lame saw Ted Healey without his puppets dealing with the roar that continues to take Healey for other movie stars. (Healy himself did not know that Zeppo had left the Marx Brothers since he put the Quartet between The and Marx!) Speaking of Marx, it was interesting to see Harpo without his wig, although he wears a hat to hide his bald head. It was also interesting to see Ida Lupino among the cowgirl girls at the beginning, although I also recognized Toby Wing from her role in Murder in Vanity last year (at least when announcer Pete Smith recognized her). Oh, and Smith himself was not funny with his narration of the sage. Other famous stars that you may or may not recognize are also present in cameos, and not all are also contractual players of M-G-M! So, with all of the above, La fiesta de Santa Barbara is worth a look for anyone interested in the early appearances of Judy Garland films or the early use of 3-band Technicolor.
