THE RAP, the book on which this film was based, was one of the most complex books I have ever read. Yet I could not postpone it. Obscene, rude, dirty, obscene ... You name it, it was it. It also had some of the best features of any novel Iâ€™ve ever read. <br /> <br /> As for the movie ... it was deplorable. I mean, is Tim McIntyre like Vasco? Vasco was the coolest muta ... spoke of WASCO ... McIntyre, since Vasco is similar to the role of Tim Conway as Charles Manson. <br /> <br /> What happened to the main character in the book? Little Arv. He's not even in the film ... Brisk walking was NOT the main dude in the book. Why even call a loan this thing THE RAP? In this film, neither the spirit, nor the atmosphere, nor the abominations, nor the drama of the book were captured. <br /> <br /> For me, it was not only a disappointment, but also a waste of time and celluloid.
