Presumably, director William Shatner was referring to a much “darker” movie when it came to Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, but Paramount's claims, considering the huge box office, taken by his predecessor filled with humor, insisted The new film also has a lot of laughter. So we get, perhaps, the weakest and most stupid of the six Star Trek films with the original line-up. There are a lot of bad ideas, as well as some good ones, and if you are set up for charity, you can watch “The Final Frontier” as well as the episode from the series. On the other hand, Lawrence Luckenbill is a great actor, he gives one of the best “guest stars” in any Star Trek, on a large or small screen, right here with William Windom's Commodore Decker. His image of Sibok, Spock's stepbrother, constantly shoots a film when he threatens to fail, which happens all too often. Charles Cooper is also good, like the fat old Klingon general Korrd; It is a pity that his role is not as great as he. If the story of Shatner’s intentions is true, then I have to apologize to him, because I was ready to lay the blame for the incessant nonsense and not very convincing fighting scenes right at his directorial feet. The reason is that I always felt that of all the regular players, Trek Shatner was the least “tuned” to everything that makes Star Trek work and that makes it special for its fans. After reading his memoirs “Trek”, it became obvious to me that he viewed the series as another action-adventure series, in which, as it turned out, there was a science-fiction production. He preferred the vision of John Kuhn, rather than Gene Roddenberry; Coon was known for his work on the popular Western TV series Wild Wild West. Shatner also mentioned that his favorite episode of "Star Trek" was "A Slice of Action", a silly episode of the second season, written in collaboration with Kuhn. So, finally, having the opportunity to shoot the Star Trek feature film, will not Shatner follow his instincts and create an action-action game with a lot of mocking humor? Well, someone did, because this is what the “Final Frontier” turned out to be in the end. Shatner himself is definitely returning to form as the Great Ham, and, as Leonard Maltin points out, the film suffers from a bad “sweetheart” event. In the initial scene in Yosemite National Park, it’s hard to say which is worse: super-funny special effects or abominable dialogue. Talking about the equipment failure on the Enterprise went all the way from Wrath of the Khan, and by this, the fifth film on the track, they fell to the ground. Just like the idea of ​​a "skeleton team." One new development is the seemingly romantic relationship between Scotty and Ukhura, and suffice it to say that the flame of passion between them is definitely not felt. This is a meaningless plot and adds nothing. The climate scene where “God” occurs also adds little; the question of whether this was a good idea is controversial, but the scene itself does not make much sense. (The abilities of the “God” being seem to differ depending on what is needed at the moment.) Approximately half of this is a tired repetition of the climax from Spock's Search. Leonard Nimi manages to save Spock's integrity, even when he utters such non-similar lines as "Pull yourself together, Doctor." And Deforest Kelly, as usual, is superior to Shatner and Nimy; he really played the role of an actor in the final films about the track. So this campaign is not terrible, it is just not very good. Before the transfer of the relay to the “next generation” there had to be another original role-playing film “Track,” and it was much better suited for this task than Star Trek V: Last Frontier.
