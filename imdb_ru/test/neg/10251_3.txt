Yesterday I watched this TV show and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I didn’t have high expectations when it was a telecast, but the whole movie was painful without end. I felt that it lasted 3 hours, but only I was bored to death. Every minute there was a long struggle, and I really tried my best to stay away from the switch "off." <br /> <br /> The film tells about a doctor (Dr. Vergese) who gets a lot of AIDS patients. and most of them die during the movie. Vergese is hard to live, so his family is punished by his disappointment. However, this film has problems with showing both sides, it mainly focuses on his conversations with patients, and sometimes we see footage from his house, but we don’t get much. Difficulties to show more than one part of life Vergese does not improve with a bad game from Naveen Andrews, a man whom I (hopefully) do not see in any good film of the future. <br /> <br /> I I think that he got 7.6 because of this topic (taboo?), but I am sure that there are the best films on this topic on the market. Stay away from this film, it does not deserve more than 3/10. <br /> <br />
