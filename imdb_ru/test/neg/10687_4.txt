If, like me, you are actively looking for the rarest and strangest (and often the worst) that world cinema can offer, then you should not look beyond Hong Kong’s supernatural horror in the early 80s. Often mixing bizarre black magic with kung fu and stupid comedy, and usually filled with a lot of creepy crawlers (snakes, worms, eels, centipedes, etc.), these films seem just as bizarre. <br /> <br /> Succubar is definitely an example: a mountain tribe whose women do not let their men err by imposing nasty spells on them (which, if they leave, cause them to become filled with wriggling creatures and die an agonizing death) so martial arts and a lot of real animal kills (most of which are committed by a geek who has absolutely no relation to history), this film is just weird. <br /> <br /> A long scene in which tribal women who hunt snakes and insects, casually throwing creatures into baskets on their backs, are very fascinating; the tribal feast, at which the poor bull is beaten on the head, and then torn to pieces, is absolutely disgusting; and at the moments when the worms crawl in open wounds and tear to the floor, squeamish ones lose their appetite for a while. <br /> <br /> However, it is the chewing of live animals that really gives Succuba the legendary status among fans of local filmmaking. To look at it is disgusting and yet strangely irresistible: the geek buzzes at the snake, caresses the thick juicy toad (disgusting!) And eagerly devours the mouse (biting off the head and then pushing the others away). /> <br /> Not a very good movie (damn, in fact it’s not even a mediocre movie), Succubare is recommended only to people who think they have seen it all. This one gets 4 out of 10 from me, which is probably more than he deserves, but I reluctantly respect him for making me feel a little bad.
