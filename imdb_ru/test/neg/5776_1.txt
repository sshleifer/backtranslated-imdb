Seeing the cover of this film before I watched it, my expectations were not high, especially since it was among other crappy horror films in the blockbuster (along with films such as Junior). <br /> <br /> Well, not only that. There are brainless stereotypical characters in the film (rich souls, bitches, sheriffs, local residents who know what is happening in the city, etc.), but there are such horrible dialogues , actions, directing and cg effects. Jeremiah Stone's dude was funny. (* SPOILER *) I never understand why he bit off a finger from nowhere when he was holding this chicken hostage. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is as terrible as other shortcomings. From what I could learn from this, Jeremiah Stone was a gold digger during the Gold Rush and a notorious criminal. He had a lot of gold, (* SPOILER *), and he cursed anyone who went for his gold before he was shot by the locals after he killed some girl, but he not only survived, but also bit off own finger and ran away. So, today a group of ignorant morons learns about this gold mine and, of course, locals are warning about the "Curse of the Forty-Nine." And what do they do? As expected, they ignored the warnings and eagerly searched for gold. They get gold, and all sorts of c ** t continues. Fortunately, (* SPOILER *) the bitch cut off her head. <br /> <br /> That's it. Looking at the cover of the film, you can tell what kind of film it will be. It's so terrible, it's fun. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 stars out of 5.
