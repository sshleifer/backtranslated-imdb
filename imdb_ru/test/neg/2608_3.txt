It had its moments, but in general, when I watched this cartoon in my childhood, I was bored. The only thing that made me look was that it was a cartoon, perhaps my first acquaintance with anime. This is also one of my least favorite animes, I remember another, in which a giant ship participated in space, which did not make sense, but was more pleasant, because they were in space. I also remember one with these people dressed up like birds, which was a bit strange, but more interesting. Although I don’t really like car races at all, I didn’t do it and I don’t, and this is probably one of the reasons why I didn’t care about this show, although today I’m an avid anime fan. The characters were also a bit stupid, and then there were terrible scenes where virtually no action took place, which was probably used to reduce the cost of the animation and add to the show. The gadgets in the cars were cool, although they gave me entertainment. In general, I think this show is rather unsightly compared to new anime and some from the same era, but this is just a personal opinion, I am sure that many reviewers like the show, which is cool.
