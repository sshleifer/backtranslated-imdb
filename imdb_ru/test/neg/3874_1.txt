This film had potential. The script was good and presented an interesting dark atmosphere with themes of suicide, patricide, regrets and, as Chris says, “10 years of going nowhere.” This is a sharp contrast to the original MAG7, which was bright, humorous, and even the bad guy was attractive. <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting change in tone, and if they developed more characters, perhaps I would have liked it. <br /> <br /> But instead, they spend too much time on unwarranted (and ridiculous) battle scenes, poorly edited together. At some point, you see a horse fall, and after 5 seconds you see the same scene again. But few people would have noticed this, since there are already 2 dozen horseback rides (I am not exaggerating), and by that time we had already slumbered. <br /> <br /> Which leads me to the title of my review. This film was cut off due to animal abuse, so there is a chance (if you decide to watch it), you will get a diluted version, baby. There is a bullfight where the matador strikes the bull, and suddenly, when the crowd bursts into applause, there is no bull, only the matador in the empty arena. Like wow, maybe the bull was a Jedi, I don't know. Most likely, the scene was cut. <br /> <br /> There is a cockfighting scene later, where, in the original version, one of the birds is terribly disfigured in front of a crowd of cheering Mexicans. It was cut. But we still see enough to be quite annoyed. <br /> <br /> But the worst scenes to date are the throws of the horse. One by one, you see the horse’s legs twitch, sending thousands of pounds of horse to the head. In one of the scenes the horse is thrown, and then, while she writhes on the ground in paralytic convulsions, the explosive breaks down right under her neck. <br /> <br /> This film was shot in 1966, when Hollywood was just beginning to regulate the cruelty of animals on film. This is probably one of the last clicks where you can see how this happens. So, if such things float on your boat, check it out and you will get light sensations. But if not, then you will either be annoyed or bored.
