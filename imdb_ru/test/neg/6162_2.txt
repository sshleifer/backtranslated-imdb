David Duchovny is said to have spent six days writing the script for this film. This rings true. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I saw Gigli. It's not as bad as Gigli, but it’s like saying that Saddam Hussein is not as bad as Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Tom Warshow lives in France with his French wife and 13-year-old son. All this time he was pretending to be French. He shows his wife that he is actually American. For some reason, this was an amazing discovery for her, despite the fact that she always commented on her husband’s American accent. In addition, their son - remember, he was born in France and never knew that his father was American - speaks excellent English without a hint of a French accent. This is just one of several huge gaps in this film. <br /> <br /> The main part of the film is the memory of Tommy’s youth in New York in the 1970s, when he explains to his wife why he was hiding in France. His best friend in childhood was Pappas, a retarded adult who was badly played by Robin Williams. I believe that the Spiritual thinks that the "mentally retarded" is someone who is simply stupid, because Pappas leaves the place from time to time, and in other cases he is just Robin Williams. Yes, Williams actually fits into his weary improvisation, although he has to play a man who is mentally retarded. <br /> <br /> Tommy's mother, who is played by the wife of Spiritual Thea Leoni, is a distracted nurse who is upset about the recent death of her husband. Leonie does a good job, but she basically just smokes a lot and screams at Tommy about things that don't seem too important. The script did not give her a lot of work. Tommy also made friends with a woman (whom he calls "Lady"), who is in prison and offers him advice through her prison window (this detention house is called "House D" for short, hence the name). Tommy does not hesitate to shout loudly about his personal problems on a city street, so this imprisoned person can give him advice, and he does this many times without concern. <br /> <br /> I do not want to bore you with a full summary of the film, but in this film there are plenty of holes in the plot, which is trying too hard to touch, but it seems bad. Very bad Very bad. Towards the end of this train wreck, the script is getting darker and darker and ends with a ridiculous shitty ending. <br /> <br /> Critics tore "House D" apart and rightfully. I can't believe that some people really like this movie. This is a painful film, and I felt weak afterwards - not from emotions, but from how awful it was.
