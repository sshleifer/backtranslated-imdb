“On a clear day that can be seen forever” is nothing more than an update of the Epoch of New Time from the history of Pygmalion / My Fair Lady: a professor is trying to transform an ordinary girl into a woman from high society. However, this time, instead of using language skills, the professor tries to do this through hypnosis and past life regression. <br /> <br /> You know that a musical has problems when reviewers constantly mention sets and costumes before they mention plot and music. Songs are instantly forgotten. (I'm afraid that “don't get me involved in church on time”). And the plot is not going anywhere. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, there is no "there." The characters roam the plot, not reaching from point A to point B. Professor Shabo several times declares that he will get to the core of Daisy's problems, but it looks like he never does. <br /> <br /> All meaningful conflicts are avoided. For example, a moment comes when Shabo University demands that he either stop his reincarnation studies or leave his position. Now there is a conflict! Will he give up his career for Daisy? Alas! Nothing comes of this development. One or two scenes later, the university changed its mind and ordered Shabo to continue working. So much for conflict. <br /> <br /> The talent was certainly compiled for this film: directed by Vincente Minnelli. The author is partly Alan J. Lerner. Starring Yves Montand, Bob Newhart and Jack Nicholson. And, oh, yes, starring Barabara Strieszand, who was almost on top of her game at this point in her career. <br /> <br /> But it all collapses. Lerner’s attempt to reincarnate his greatest success, the previously mentioned “My Fair Lady,” is doomed to failure, just like Daisy’s attempt to revive the greatness of her own past. <br /> <br /> If you like movie musicals, there is a much better choice than this one.
