You know, this is one of those films "The Emperor's New Clothes." It's so weird and weird that you HOPE like it, if you're really in the movies. Well, I think this is bologna. Similar films that hide under Dada's cloak or surrealism make me crazy. Someone has this bad dream, perhaps caused by the fact that he ate the aforementioned bologna just before bedtime, remembers most of it (unfortunately) and then film it, and we should all be surprised at their creative genius. Sometimes I have strange dreams that make absolutely no sense at all, but I don’t feel the need to film them, put them out to everyone else and call it art. Strangeness in itself does not mean that something interesting. True Dada or surrealistic expression has SOME intentions and intellectual thought. If other people do not understand this, it does not make it deep, it just makes it incomprehensible. Fancy for the sake of strangeness, in my opinion, is not good, not to mention great art. And comparing “Tuvalu” with “Delicacy” is the same as comparing “The Godfather I and II” with “The Godfather III” - the same genre, and NOT in the same league.
