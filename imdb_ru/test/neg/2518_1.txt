I, like most other people, saw this film after hearing about him from Patton Oswalt. Oddly enough, it was easier to find than I thought it would be. However, it is not surprising that I found it used. <br /> <br /> The plot is masterfully summed up in the title. This is the bed that eats. No more, no less. There is an attempt to add a storyline, but not very good. <br /> <br /> The demon's blood was on the bed, and as a result, she became obsessed. He devours everything that happens to him, absorbing and then dissolving it in what seems like an orange Fanta. There is an artist who fell victim to a bed, but was sick and ended up behind a painting in the room where she lives. The narration is told completely through it. <br /> <br /> This film fails terribly in everything, even the fact that it is bad. However, this is not without its own brand of charm.
