Several commentators noted the improbability of the conspiracy, in particular, the tremendous amount of trouble that Father McKenne would have had to do, and the absolute impossibility of some of the calculations that he should have done, including what Langdon was going to decipher every hint in minutes. McKenna is a brand name; After a few seconds, he gives orders, and after a few minutes he (literally) runs and is responsible for the operation - in real life he will be in shock. And, as usual in thrillers, the killer does not kill the heroes, giving his only weak explanation that they are not on the death toll, as if it were any other innocent bystander whom he shot. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly awful movie (the jet plane of the commander of the United States and beats off aliens, haha), and this effort completes it. For such an implausible film, Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who did not consciously laugh when the killer went to get his award in Volkswagen? I wanted to shout: "You will be blown up." Who did not know that the heroine will find the body in the laboratory? Who did not notice the villain? Technically, the film was terrible. The dialogue was often defies deciphering than clear, while the races through Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. Moreover, many scenes looked like dirt. One of the redemptive traits were pictures of Rome and what looked like the Vatican — an achievement, because I am sure that the Vatican officials would not want this perch to be killed in and around St. Peter’s Cathedral — and the interiors were convincing. Rome is a magical place, and I liked to see it fleetingly.
