If you like bad movies, this is a real pleasure. Kaufman and Peters walk in robot suits, avoid slavery, only wander aimlessly and find true love of robots. I think this is the first film that made me think about leaving. I must point out that I was 12 years old and could be entertained by shiny objects.
