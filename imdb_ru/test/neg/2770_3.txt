My question is, what was the worst element of this movie? Was it acting? direction? Script? Perhaps it was a waste of Alan Ladd and Jack LaRue. LaRue and, especially, Ladd are capable of bringing extreme viciousness to the role. In this film, it was hard to tell who the bad guy was. Of course, Ladd was playing a good guy under cover, but even as a good guy, he could be very scary. So the net result was a potentially good movie without a sense of conflict.
