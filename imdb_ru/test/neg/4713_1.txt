I remember seeing it in my local blockbuster and picked it up because I was curious. I liked movies about mythological creatures. I like movies about werewolves, vampires, zombies, etc. This is based on a half-breed, half human, half leopard, which hunts people in Africa. <br /> <br /> The movie is terrible! The actors are terrible! There is no script at all! This is all improvised! All this is filmed at night because they say that this is the only time you see it. This is obviously a bull * bleep *! They shoot at night to be scary. But they could not scare me. After the first person was killed, I put it back in its case and carried it back to Blockbuster. One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now you probably say that I have no right to watch a movie if I have not finished it yet. Well, this is one of the films that did not deserve to be watched throughout the film. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10. This is really BAD!
