With such horrible films like this one, not to mention the creation, it is very easy to understand why Hollywood has such serious problems with bad stories and bad remakes. <br /> <br /> I think the viewer should laugh at the back ends of the “black” jokes, puffy eyes and “trinket”. This is so incredible “upstairs” and so bad that it even passes by the mark “So bad that it’s funny again” and plummeted to “absolutely embarrassing for everyone who participates in it. <br /> <br /> I am very, very sorry for every minute I spent on it. I want my time back! <br /> <br /> Save the agony, do NOT watch it. The only reason I can give at least 1 point in the rating is that 0 is not an option.
