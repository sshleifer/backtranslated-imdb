This film is just not for me. I like horror and splash movies, but this film has little to do with horror. The effects are cheap, and when they bite one of her legs, it looks so fake. The same applies to other effects, such as tongue torture and intestinal sex. They could have spent a few extra dollars on effects. <br /> <br /> With a lot of sex (pixelated as in all Japanese movies), this is just a sick porn fetish and there seems to be a market for sick things like that. Although it is more bloody, for me it is suitable for such names as Squirmfest / Purge and Genki. These films show girls who eat and play with any liquid that comes out of your body, eat beetles and fish in a rude way, and have sex with all kinds of strange animals, such as toads, eels and ... One look at the covers will show horror fans to view elsewhere. There is no horror here, only sick and degrading sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Horror fans should avoid this and better check Guinea Pig2: Flowers of flesh and blood, or even the August underground Mordum. Although they are not great, they at least offer a terrible experience, and Nick Daruma absolutely fails in this department.
