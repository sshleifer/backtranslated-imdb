We saw it in a bargain basket at a local Asda: £ 1.50 per DVD. After reading all the hype, pasted all over the cover, saying how “funny” he was, and he had a really good, well-established cast, we thought that this should be a great movie. <br /> <br /> So, we bought it, took it home, put it in a DVD player, leaned back in the chair and waited for the fun to begin ....... and waited ....... and waited ..... and waited some more. <br /> <br /> About 90 minutes later, although it looked like 3 hours, the loans moved, and that was it. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment - even paying 1.50 pounds seemed like a scam. God knows what Kane, Richardson and Gambon thought when they said “yes” to this thing. As for Moran: I really liked The Black Books, Sean of the Dead and his comedy tours, and I felt that in this film he was not in himself. He tried too hard to play for the sake of laughter, probably thinking that if you save the characteristics of your character from the Black Books, it will work here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this turned out to be a failure. After a while, the gag fell off, and it just became an annoyance. It's a shame, because I believe that, given the right role, he could be a very good film / character actor. <br /> <br /> In any case, to summarize: the actors in The Actors could not play !!! <br /> <br /> ** / *****
