Well, this is the standard Hollywood Schmalz, which can be seen within a mile. This is nice piecemeal, but just about, so predictable. I must admit that I did not like it very much, but it is rather difficult to please me, and many of my friends liked it. <br /> <br /> It's pretty cute, and the actors give good performances. This is a good background, and eye candy is pretty good. But annoyingly predictable, unoriginal and really rather boring storyline holds back the film. Personally, I can think of a better way to spend a couple of hours in my life. <br /> <br /> There is a bad press in the Chick Fixing genre, but there are some really good tiptoe films; this is not one of them.
