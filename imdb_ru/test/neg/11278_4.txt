For this film, based on a TV show and a serious finale. I thought it was a lousy way to finish a serious one. 'M * A * S * H ​​Goodbye, goodbye and Amen' was pretty good, but not this one. Unless you really love the show (“Like Me”), skip this movie. <br /> <br /> I was a devoted fan of Even Stevens, but the plot was too useless, and Dave Kulier, man, this guy didn't do any good ... well, never. They should not have used Tim Meadows, he is a great actor, but he was too good for the script. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was pure cheese. I would give 4.5 / 10
