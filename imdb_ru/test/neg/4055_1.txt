Whenever I see such a video, I have to ask myself how it was funded. HBO or Showtime, or something else, must pay for the production company to go through the motions - hire someone who can or cannot speak English to succeed and come up with something approaching the plot to pay strippers with terrifying tits so they jump up and down on the rough wax torsos of guys to find people who will design and light the scenery, buy the rights to trash techno music, etc. those who serve ispo a ldalnym producer ... He should have stabbed all these girls, right? And bro is not mistaken about the "Spanish" girl, but calling the policemen "stunning" is terribly generous. In fact, I would go so far as to call them something much more like "disgusting" or "crazy." Watching how these women writhe — sometimes * obviously * with a strong analgesic effect — was so far from erotica that my testicles actually rose inside my body. Gross. <br /> <br /> Why waste time with this, when there is so much free hardcore porn available on the Internet? I wonder whether the popularization of Internet video will slowly kill the erotic video industry ... One can only hope, right?
