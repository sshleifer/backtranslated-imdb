I'm trying to find something valuable here. The best I can put together is that Truffaut wanted to make the film as tedious, painful, childish, annoying, illogical and brainless, like an experience of love. If that was his goal, then he succeeded, but the solution to his exercise is really hard to watch. <br /> <br /> There is one scene that shouts about parody: Belmondo compares Deneve's facial features with the peculiarities in the landscape. All I could think of all this time was the "glacier", "ice floe", "two lone fishermen carrying surpluses of the army on a frozen lake in Minnesota." <br /> <br /> The only other attraction is the resurrection of Buffun's Theory of Climatic Determinism. The tropics are represented as paradise, and the situation is getting worse and worse as they become Calvinistic French Switzerland. That was pretty funny.
