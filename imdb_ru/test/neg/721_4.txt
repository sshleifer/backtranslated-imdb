This DVD was lent to me by the director of the film with which I work, in which I play the actor playing Prospero. Knowing his own style, I did not expect anything like the “classic” interpretation of the text. <br /> <br /> What I discovered is sometimes startling, sometimes evocative, but often tortuous and tedious. Like most experimental music, I found that in such films the building blocks of powerful filmmaking are created, even if they have not found their most useful form in a more consistent format. <br /> <br /> So we have a caliban, which is more a clown than a threat, and which even Miranda seems terribly afraid (which is strange, because we know that he tried to rape her at least once). Stefano and Trinculo, which are more annoying than fun. Strange young Prospero, similar to Amadeus. And a huge loss of character development and plot due to creative editing and highly stylized pose. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that I have no problems with the image of Ferdanand or Miranda. His dazed delight and her slightly strange innocence are in fact quite appropriate. <br /> <br /> I’m not saying that this is a bad film, but an experimental one. The one that is at great risk, but intended more for students of art and cinema, and not for those who are interested in “The Storm” for its own sake.
