Dr. Lucio Fulci is a director of horrible horror films who are starting to feel the effect of shooting too many bloody scenes. He visits his local psychiatrist to see if he is losing his balls; it turns out to be a bad idea, because the psychiatrist is actually a crazy killer responsible for a series of horrific murders. Taking the opportunity to make Fulci his falling guy, the insane doctor hypnotizes a terrible hacker, thinking that he is responsible for the recent series of murders. <br /> <br /> At first glance, it seems that the Cat in the brain is a fantastically awful treat from the spaghetti god Lucio Fulci. Completely defeated by a chainsaw, ax attacks and other bloody murders, the film certainly sheds enough claret on even the most seasoned hounds. But when someone is eyeing, it turns out that many horrible scenes were shot from earlier films (mainly Fulcha’s own “masterpieces”); remove them from the equation, and one will have a graceful basic plot idea that is completely wasted, some desirable nudity and horrible ideas from Fulci himself and David L. Thompson as psycho-psychotherapy. <br /> <br /> As the film develops, it becomes an incomprehensible mess when “borrowed” footage of blood is inserted randomly, without any attempts to convincingly write them into the story. If you have seen the “Touch of Death” of Fulci and the “Ghost of Sodom” or the “Secret of Murder” of Mario Bianchi, then you have already seen the best pieces of “Cats in the brain” before. <br /> <br /> After a lot of bloodshed, the film turns around pretty quickly, leaving the viewer in bewilderment and deception. Watch a movie if you are a follower of Fulci, but I would advise you to look for films from which “good bits” were taken.
