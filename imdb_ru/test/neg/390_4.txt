The best scene “People across the lake” is a really eerie night scene with the participation of the house, the murder and the lake. After that, with horror, it's pretty strong. The family (mom, dad, sister and younger brother) is fed up with the (slightly) dangerous environment of the suburb and decides to go live near the title lake. Since then, the film tells about too many lame and happy family pigs by the lake, and sometimes some corpses appear here and there. The couple of scenes in which they discover the bodies are quite convincing (in terms of eeriness), but they contrast sharply with the rest of the events (involving only the everyday things of the family that settled in). The truth in business (the mystery of the one who commits the murder) is learned too early, leaving only the family ignorance, and the viewer yawns during an uninteresting finale (showing the opening in the basement and running around the house), for example, if this thing made for television suddenly remembered that it was supposed to be a horror movie. This is not very badly done; The content and story are just not interesting enough. The only highlight in the cast is Barry Corbin, although his performance / character is too stupid to take them seriously. Blonde cutie Tammy Loren (daughter) can also become a recognizable figure for avid horror lovers, as she also starred in the movie “Master of Desires” (1997), as well as on television for the television, such as “I Saw What You Did” (1988 ) “Stepford Children” (1987). Although in this film she has nothing to do. Skipling, but watchable, if that.
