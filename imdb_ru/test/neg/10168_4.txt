Two years after this film was shot, Jury was released. Do not waste your time on this. See "Juror" instead. The juror is essentially the same story as the Jury Trial, with a better play, better directing and a much more exciting aura. William Hurt was not believable like a cop out of control, and Armand Assante could not be more like a mafia boss if he dressed him in a clown costume. You're not interested in Joanne Wally's character to be upset about what's going on with her. In addition, the way she interacted with the jury was not convincing or interesting. Kathleen Quinlanâ€™s role as a prostitute / murderer was not sufficiently concretized and, frankly, was unnecessary for the plot.
