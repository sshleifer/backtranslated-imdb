Every film made by Quentin Tarantino was getting worse and worse. I would like to believe that most people would agree with this statement, but given that the Inglorious (sic) Busterdies (sic) "have 8.5 / 10 of more than 100,000 ratings, it doesn't look like the audience goes makes some sense. Even his best work, Reservoir Dogs, was not a “masterpiece”. The problem is that claiming that you like Tarantino’s work has become fashionable. Once this happens, you get a lot of people ready and willing to jump into another team. They will ignore the ridiculously awful game and the completely smug essay to become part of an exclusive club called “everything”. This film is so terrible that I swear it must be some kind of perverse Tarantino joke to see how much torture his fans will endure and still praise him. As another reviewer has already said: “Tarantino’s previous films were from a guy in love with other films. This is from a guy in love with his own essay. " I could not agree more. This film is nothing more than an indulgent and ridiculous text combined with acting ability taken straight from a school play. But, thanks to the overall screening of the film, I am sure that it will still remain one of the best films ever made. Bravo, Tarantino. You made one of the best practical jokes of all time.
