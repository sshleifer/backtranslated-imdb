When I first read the novel, I have no objection to filming the scripts, how it is written differently, if it adheres or at least includes the plot. For reasons known only to Hollywood, important parts of the story are completely ignored, and another storyline is added. The reason why this novel has passed the test of time is undoubtedly connected with the interweaving of characters and the plot as a whole. To interfere in this structure is to destroy the complex balance of the storyline and, consequently, the narrator’s intention. Although the question from the point of view, the casting of this film leaves much to be desired. Characters described as very thick should at least look like a character to have confidence. The days of slavery cannot be ended, or, of course, the actors of this caliber would be in revolt, on such a parody of history. Marian Halcolm’s face is described as manly in appearance ... Tara Fitzgerald’s very feminine appearance doesn’t ring true. Again, Laura Fairy is described as “fair,” if not “unearthly,” so with dark hair she does not quite match the impression from the novel. .... Badly done, Hollywood! <br /> <br /> J. Hunter
