It hurts me to see how a terrific movie turns into some kind of lame, repetitive and lazy series. It is filled with conspiracy holes, and the plot is misleading, in BAD way. Whoever the authors of the injections, who decided to turn such a wonderful film into this garbage, he should have done some research, instead of filling it with one-liners and empty new characters, and classic jokes from the first film MORE, MORE, MORE AND MORE »AGAIN. Of course, they are becoming a bit more creative, but it's like watching the same episode with a slight twist. Just like listening to Creed or Nickleback. Kuzko has to prevent himself, Isma has a complicated plan, but he decides to go the easy way to save time and just use the potion, someone asks for the monkey and the beetle, Bucky appears in the background, Kuzko flirts with Raspberry, she misses him sounding like a bitch, Ismám is disguised as the "Amzi Principle," and she calls for Kronk, and he forgets that she is Ism. I admit, this show has its moments. Another problem is that Isma looks younger, and Pasha looks ... weird. Also, no one can replace David Spade and John Goodman! These are the ones who made Kuzco and Pacha Kuzco and Pacha! Sorry, but I give this show with two fingers down.
