An inexpensive, cheaply made police thriller that tolerates some fair humorous bits, pleasant chemistry between two leads and, especially, the satisfying turn of James Remar as a narcissistic, psychopathic (and, naturally, indestructible) villain. Obviously, low-quality picture, both visually and dramatically, with a rather humble Bert, but not imperceptible. (**)
