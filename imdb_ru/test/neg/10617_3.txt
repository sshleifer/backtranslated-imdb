I watched this film, which seemed to me to have a promising start, but then I just became disillusioned at the end. The problem with this film, I think, was that the director tried his best to make this film strange and original. There were too many memories and too many bad "effects" that annoyed me throughout the film. I love Debbie Harry and Isaac Heys, but they disappointed me in this film, they could have done a lot better. This film seemed promising at the beginning, dragging in the middle and then disappointing at the end. The film can never beat the genius of Stanley Kubrick when it comes to controversial issues, oddities and originality in the movies.
