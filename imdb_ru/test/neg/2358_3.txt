If I had no expectations from this film, he could get 5 or 6. In its current form, I give it 3. The game is bad, the actual accuracy of the drugs discussed in it is not enough, and I do not feel any sympathy for the characters. <br /> <br /> I watched “Adam and Paul” just before watching this movie, and I laughed and cried several times. This film did not even touch a similar chord. Human Traffic directors may have some Ecstasy experience, but there is no demonstration of actual semantic knowledge related to drugs. In fact, I find it rather offensive and counterproductive in an effort to make current drug laws less politically oriented. <br /> <br /> Watch Requiem for a Dream if you are looking for an amazing, touching film about drugs.
