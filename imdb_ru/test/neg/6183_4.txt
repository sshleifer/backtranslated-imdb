I read all the welcome posts about this confusing semi-noir and was puzzled by the high estimate that in the brutal light of 2007 it seems to be a very inaccurate product of the late RKO conveyor. All these endless documentary footage about fish, waves, fish, waves have nothing to do with the central conflict and simply affect the running time. Editing is completely careless: the scenes end, and they are followed by other scenes that have nothing to do with what preceded them. Dialogue carries untidy traces of origin dressed: cumbersome metaphors that could never come from the limited imagination of these modern people. But what is truly amazing is how terribly the triangle is overvalued on all sides. I love Stanvik, but she growls, distorts, and vomits wildly â€” an undisciplined performance a few steps below her standard. Douglas, exaggerating in its attractiveness, turns into a potential murderous frenzy and becomes as boorish as Ryan, growling and screaming unnaturally. The less interesting second pair, at least, provides recognizable human behavior: Keith Andes, whose character is Neanderthal by today's standards, is nevertheless smooth and persuasive, like Stanvan's brother (much younger, is believed), and Marilyn Monroe, is natural and unaffected. On the windy coast of Monterey (and all these shots of Monterey, although largely irrelevant, are interesting as a document about how the city looked), among all the overheated hysteria, these two are islands of sanity. And the last point, and a spoiler: maybe Bryn Office was obliged to do this, but would anyone believe in a happy ending for a second? Stanvik may have temporarily regressed into an obedient wife, but I give the wedding a month.
