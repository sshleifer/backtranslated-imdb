I’m starring a movie collector with Miss Weaver, so I only bought her because she’s in it. I find it really strange that her early career is filled with so many horrible films. She started with an incredible promise at Alien, but then she had a lot of bombs. These bombs include this film, “The Deal of the Century,” “One Woman or Two,” and “Crescent Street.” She also appeared in the Year of Life Danger, which was not a bomb, but her work was less than known. In the interval between “Alien” and its continuation in 1986 “Aliens”, the only film she shot that was worth everything was Ghostbusters. I am sure that before the release of “Strangers” everyone thought that this woman was leaving. Fortunately, she was not. <br /> <br /> Returning to eyewitnesses, the film is boring. This creates no expectation. William Hurt looks like a cardboard stand, and the atmosphere just dries out. Sigourney is decent, but nothing worth remembering. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you want, but don’t live up to the expectations of a decent movie. Watch the best films with these two stars, such as The Casual Tourist and the Working Girl.
