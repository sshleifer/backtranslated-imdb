I think we should think what wonderful characters are the salt of the earth. Unfortunately, this is unconvincing and time consuming. <br /> <br /> As with any film set in Newcastle, there are numerous shots of the Tyne bridge and frequent attempts to show what wonderful “heroes” are Jordi. The viewer is never allowed to forget where the film is being shot, as if the rest of the world was taking care of Newcastle and its inhabitants. <br /> <br /> If you like well-watched work, competent and original work remains clear.
