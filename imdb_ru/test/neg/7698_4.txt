Nowadays, Ridley Scott is one of the main directors and producers and can command huge amounts to direct films, especially since he has films such as ALIEN, GLADIATOR and BLADE RUNNER. So from this partial list of his credits, it is obvious that he is an amazing talent. However, if you look at this very early effort he made at the film school, it will probably be difficult for you to say that it is meant for greatness. This is because, despite the fact that it has good camera work and style, the film is hopelessly boring and unattractive. However, given that it was not intended for general release, and it was just a training field, then I tend to look at it gently - hence the estimate 4. <br /> <br /> By the way, this film is part of the CINEMA 16 DVD European Shorts. On this DVD is 16 shorts. Most of them are not very good, although since they contain a MAN WITHOUT A HEAD, A COPY OF COPIES, RABBIT and WASP, this is an amazing DVD for fans of short films and should be bought.
