This film is about a group of people who are infected with a powerful artificial virus. They are pursued by government officials in the desert. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is quite interesting, but this is hampered by the fact that the delivery is very boring. The film does not in any way interact with the viewer at any level. Of course, the tiny budget is a problem, but not the reason for the failure of the film. Much more guilt is that this is a very difficult delivery. There is a lot of narration, but unfortunately, the narrator has an annoyingly overly dramatic voice. With these people, it seems, little is happening, and long before the end you will be rooting for government officials - the sooner they kill the main characters, the sooner the film ends. A much better title for this film would be “Four people running across the desert with some helicopter shots.” In general, very tedious.
