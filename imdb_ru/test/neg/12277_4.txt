The CBS radio program called “We the People” helps to find an American home for the Viennese refugee Charles Coburn (as Karl Brown), an experienced surgeon and a bully in the pool. He arrives with his beautiful daughter Sigrid Guri (as Leni), who “learns” to become a nurse. Having moved to a small dusty village in the Midwest, they are greeted at the station by the hefty John Wayne (as John Phillips) and his uncle Spencer Charters (as the nanny Atterbury), the veterinarian. Miss Guri is unhappy in the dust bag and wants to leave. Immediately. But the prospect of romance with Mr. Wayne may change her mind ... <br /> <br /> God answers many townspeople’s prayers for rain, but this may not be enough to save the farm town. The entire city is recommended to move to Oregon. Wayne wants to stay and endure it. Coburn gets an invitation to work at the best clinic. And Guri learns that her fiancé, allegedly dead, will arrive to declare her his wife. She feels obliged to accept; but he has a dark secret ... This film does not flatter Wayne, who seems to be a way out of his element. Being paired with Guri, promoted as another Garbo, does not help. They have a nice scene in Wayne's car ("Jalopy, Italian car"). <br /> <br /> **** Three Faces West (7/3/40) Bernard Forhouse ~ John Wayne, Sigrid Gurie, Charles Coburn, Spencer Charters
