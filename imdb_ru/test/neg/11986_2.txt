I really liked the game Far Cry, nice graphics, good level design, interesting and intelligent enemies, a length above average and even a somewhat decent plot. I am not by default against selecting movies from games. I thought "DOOM The Movie" was fun. But what Uwe Boll did here is to take the game, change all its good aspects and turn them into something terrible (well, of course, not in length, the film lasts only a merciful 90 minutes). Characters are even more stereotypical than in the game, which is a real achievement. The whole story is told without any twists or riddles. A few cryingly funny scenes tell you every piece of the story. And come on "Genetically Modified Soldiers"? they could come up with a more appropriate name. <br /> <br /> However, this film should receive an award for the most idiotic love scene. I have never seen anything like it. I could not believe that they were trying to be serious, “we have to get out of wet clothes,” “I think I have hypothermia” (although everyone wears T-shirts), “we need to cuddle together to keep warm” ”Is that your gun? “But ... but ... were there any people who deliberately did this? There must have been a screenwriter, a director, actors, a guardian, an electrician, some kind of cook! There was no one who jumped on this stage to stop it evil? Was this film made by destructive, inhuman, genetically modified people? I won't start to talk about how many logical mistakes, inconsistencies and flaws there were in writing the scripts, but even for a devoted fan of action movies this can only be an insult. <br /> <br /> This movie actually asked him to It’s rated as 2 out of 10, so I’ll do it in my favor. But it remains for me to explain where the second star came from. Special effects? Nope. Playing the actors? Actually, no. Links to the game? Do you want it. Wait! used the font from the game for titles and titles. It was great. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie for bad night movie screenings, select “2012 - Supernova”, this one is just sad.
