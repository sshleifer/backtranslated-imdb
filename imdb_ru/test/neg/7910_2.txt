After a humiliating experience in an airplane, Nashon Wade (Kevin Hart) sues the airline and uses the money won to open its own full-service airline. It is distinguished by the fact that it has sexy flight attendants, a dance club on board and no less than Captain Snoop Dogg in the cockpit. <br /> <br /> Soul Plane is a very racist comedy, except that it is only occasionally funny. Soul Plane was described as the "urban" version of the Plane. The problem is that the Soul Plane is not even close to the Airplane laugh. The jokes in the Soul Pane are too offensive and for the most part unoriginal. I would have lied if I said that I did not laugh, because there were some funny moments. However, I expected more and left the theater disappointed. <br /> <br /> I would compare “Mental Aircraft” with “Airplane 2.” The last one was just a rehash of the first film, and the first one was just a rehash of an outdated, rude joke. There is really no creativity behind the film, and there are only a few funny places. However, I do not think that Soul Plane is “bottom 100” bad. Right now, the film takes 82nd place, and this is a bit dramatic. I'm not saying that this is a good film, but not terrible. Duration just 86 minutes, so watch is not so difficult. For silly comedies, you can do much worse. <br /> <br /> No one in the cast is very good, but they all seem to be having fun, and that helps. Kevin Hart was very annoying, like Nashon. He had a few funny lines, but he is a very bad leading man. Snoop Dogg, who was a little ridiculous in Starsky and Hatch, completely failed here. Tom Arnold was truly tolerant, and this was the film’s biggest surprise. The most annoying man in the film was Ryan Pinkston. He was not funny at all and will never be funny. The funniest actors were Missy Pyle and Mo'Nick. They gave the best lines, and they made me laugh the most. In the end, Soul Plane can meet all the requirements if you are looking for a silly comedy, but it will probably be better if you just skip the movie. Rating 4/10
