My age: 13 years old <br /> <br /> James Cole, played by Stephen Seagal, is sent to help Detective Jim Campbell, played by Keenen Ivory Wayans, to uncover a series of murders during which the victims crucify. Since Cole arrived at the scene, he has noticed that the killings have changed a bit, and he believes that the killer has changed. It becomes personal when his ex-wife is killed, and Campbell finds his fingerprints on his body. Campbell investigates the mysterious Cole and learns about a very dubious past. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Steven Seagal. I like action movies, but he's the worst actor I've ever seen. Watch this movie is not very fun, incredibly stupid, and, obviously, the acting performance of Stephen Seagal is absolutely awful. Keenen Ivory Wayans is not so bad. The only redemptive thing in this film is a random good action scene, although most come from insanely stupid reasons. The plot in this film is absolute nonsense. I didn't care about it at all. All the "flickering" of Segal's past character was stupid, all the mafia fights and restaurant fights took place with little or no reason. Skip this movie. <br /> <br /> Australian Classification: MA 15+: High Level Violence <br /> <br /> Rating: 35 out of 100 (fairly generous)
