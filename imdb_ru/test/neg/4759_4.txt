Funny comedy, giving direction with his hands. I like one of the comments here: "Can't be done today." Well, neither "Philadelphia Story" can not without a car chase or two. However, does this mean that the picture is worse for clothes because of old-fashionedness? I don’t think that “Susan slept here” was good for any generation, and she should peacefully decompose in memories of Debbie Reynolds buffs. In this story of a screenwriter who looks at a much younger girl for “script research”, there is no brilliance. Dick Powell makes his farewell appearance on the screen in what must have confused him. Reynolds is pale. Produced by Harriet Parsons alone, which gives her famous mother Luelle several meaningless traffic jams. * 1/2 of ****
