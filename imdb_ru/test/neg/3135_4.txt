First, I would like to admit that Choker Bali was not my cup of tea. This film was clearly not targeted at the masses. This is the type that critics would like to watch. The hype and publicity were misleading. <br /> <br /> I was expecting something very dramatic, such as Devdas. Understanding that history and time period require this, I discovered that the film is extremely slow. <br /> <br /> I am a devoted fan of Aishwarya, and with regret I can say that I thought she was mistakenly accepted. The role of Chocher Bali demanded an actress who could portray herself as subversive rather than innocent and naive. All others gave good results. The image of Tagore on the state of a person comes up against celluloid to give the film an interesting topic.
