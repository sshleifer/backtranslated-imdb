Besides the fact that this film was shot (I guess it seemed like a good idea at the time, considering that BOTTOM was so popular), one thing that puzzled me about GUEST HOUSE PARADISO, is that what happened to the lighting? In this film, there is absolutely no artificial lighting, and I watched it on network television, so this was not the case with dodgy tape. In fact, the film was shot so gloomily that it was impossible to see what the hell was going on. But if there is something in the dialogue, perhaps this is not a bad thing.
