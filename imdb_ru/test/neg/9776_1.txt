*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** A certain group of Afrikkaner-Hillbilly types are in the desert in search of Diamonds when they find a solid mound in the middle of a sandy desert area. Spoilers: The most stupid starts to beat the embankment and hacks it. Then he looks into the hole and sticks his head in, and SURPRISE! eating something. The other two dimwits are no longer visible alive. Scott Barstow looks like a pizza delivery boy, but he plays some expert scientist with a medical degree (which means he should be about 35 years old, at least). Bairstow must join Camp C and help them find diamonds. The truck that Bairstow picks up to take him to Camp C has a lot of weird stuff that usually fills films like BLACK PART, THING, etc. The truck travels through the first truck and they decide to investigate why this truck didn't see another truck when they were driving to pick up Bairstow, since they were driving the same road ??). Thus, they find the eaten bodies, and there are several decent special effects for bones with small pieces of flesh on them. The main lunatic in the group, Karl, decides that they must find the killer. Thus, the truck drives through the desert in some tracks, and as a result it has a short circuit, and the team gets stuck in the desert. The stupidest guy in this group picked up a bunch of bones, using his jacket to carry them with him. When he sleeps (in the same jacket), the creatures eat him alive, and the other guy runs up and sticks his hand in velcro, and this dummy also loses his hand. So far it sounds exciting, except that a few minutes later Dr. Barsaw realizes that there are indeed hundreds of thousands of ants who use bones to hold each other so they can go to a new hive (because the miners broke into the old hive). Now, the last time I checked, ants could move on their own, without having to kill people to use the bones for the structure. If all they needed was something complicated, they could put together a bunch of sticks and use them to create a form. This whole story is very, very stupid, and the explanation of the ant is the only one. The rest of the film is about how the group is killed until they find a new ant nest and kill an anthill (a kind of), and hundreds of thousands of ants leave on their own. legs. Found a spare anthill (off-screen) and sent for analysis, which creates a reason to continue.
