This film stinks mostly. The only reason I gave her 3 was because the graphics were almost charming. This is complete disregard for the plot and the absence of even a slight superficial development of the characters, because of which he looked just like a set of good drawings. This is the worst anime that came out of Japan. I can not believe that they actually put their names on this garbage. What a breakdown in sales of this stuff for $ 20. If you have not seen, do not worry. If you have, I feel sorry for you.
