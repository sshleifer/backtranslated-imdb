The crazy stupidity that the Bullwinkle cartoon ridiculed a quarter of a century before, NO HEROE HEROES prove that you can make a good movie (MANCHUR CANDIDATE) without copying a single piece of quality from the object of your robbery. The action is barely recorded on a cable television scale, the plot is less detailed than the old Sgt.Rock comic, and only the bad guyâ€™s mustache in the style of Boris J. Badanov is absent from the Commission. This film achieves an unusual ability to be too bad, too stupid, so that it can enjoy any nasty thumbs.
