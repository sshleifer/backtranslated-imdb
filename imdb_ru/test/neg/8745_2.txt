I suppose you could say that this film has a grain of potential, but no more than that, because the boy spoiled it. The plot is almost incomprehensible, sluggish rhythmics, and the action is miserable. And what the hell is a trading rat? Worst of all, however, the culmination of this film is the anticlimax of all anticlims; plus the name does not even seem remotely accurate. The only feature of this film is a pretty dark-haired woman ... well, the blonde was also pretty, but she was annoying and not as good as a brunette. In any case, as in many films, this film can only be seen on MST3K.
