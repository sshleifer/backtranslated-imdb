I finally got a DVD of this performance and was excited with curiosity, since I read so many people praising him to the skies, especially Angela Lansbury’s portrait about Mrs. Lovett. I saw a Tim Burton film a few months ago and thought it was excessive and too bloody; Fortunately, this version is not so terrible, but it suffers too much from many other reasons for it to be the least satisfactory to me. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the casting. George Hearn is adequate and, at least, demonstrates some expression (unlike the infinite wooden face of Johnny Depp in the film). Angela Lansbury, quite simply, annoying. At least there is enough strength in her voice to convey this thought, unlike the shrill and inexpressive voice of the little girl Helena Bonham Carter, but the trick seems to be just a word in the dictionary for Miss Lansbury. It is impossible to draw yourself into the story when one of the main characters spends all of his time, robbing and winking at “look, mom, I play!” Fashion and be too aware of the audience. This is not typical of stage productions, God knows - I have been a regular participant in many productions at the Stratford Festial for many years, and stage actors usually do not behave this way (at least, those who want to keep looking a permanent job is not necessary!) ... <br /> <br /> Betsy Joslin. Oh, dear, oh dear, oh dear. Has anyone except me noticed that she cannot sing this role even in a vague and appropriate way? And her play for the daughter of George Hearn is simply terrible, considering that she was married to him at that time. Shouldn't she be a pretty sixteen year old girl? Yes, I understand that this is the whole essence of acting, but she never convinced me that she was younger than thirty-five years old, and the phrase "lamb, dressed like a lamb", it seems, was only invented for her. Her slaughter of the "Green Finch and Linnet Bird" made me grit my teeth and was ready to immediately turn off the DVD player. This song was so well played in a Tim Burton movie, and it was a sad shock. The song requires Julie Andrews vocal range in the 1960s and a clear voice that is comparable only to that of a soprano boy. Any vibrato kills him to death at all, and Miss Joslyn spent all the time fighting so hard that I thought she was about to fall off her ladder because she was so shaken by the effort to keep the coloratura notes in a mezzo voice at its best. case. Let's take a look at how it vibrates for at least a quarter of a tone, at least on the top three notes ... It's just not the role of the coloratura, and perhaps the astute director should have told her about it - but the fact that perhaps she was married to a star, perhaps the director's hands were tied. <br /> <br /> Chris Grendaal was adequate, but again, obviously too old for this role, and there is no chemistry between him and Miss Joslyn, which makes the whole area completely flat. I was reminded a bit of past performances of the Wagner's Ring cycle, where, because of the vocal power required by singers to roar over the sound of a full Wagner orchestra, they had to play based on the ability to penetrate vocally, unlike any appearance. or acting, or even a good voice, which is why you have a caricature of the tremendous Viking mountain horned Brunehilde with a triple chin and beard when the libretto calls for ethereal beauty that is always young and charming. The acting of the “juvenile” leashes is exactly the same - if you close your eyes, you can almost believe in Anthony Mr. Grendandal, but as soon as you look at the screen, the illusion will vanish. (And by no means one can believe in Johanna Miss Joslyn ...) For me, the rest of the performance was completely lost, because three of the four main characters were clearly missing. I cannot give a proper overview of anything else, because they are so distracting that they spoil the rest of the production. I really can not understand why people are delighted with this unsuccessful and shy shooting of the scene. Surely in the cinema there is something more than just throwing the camera in the first row? If I want this, I will go to a decent play, preferably to the Stratford Festival, where, at least, they work together for production and do not constantly rob for the camera. I give him three stars only because the quality of the production, except for the tricks of Lansbury and Jocelyn, seems adequate, if not impressive. <br /> <br /> Probably the best thing to do is to buy a movie soundtrack and make a recording of this play, and then combine them to make a decent whole. This is what I am going to do, and I will try to forget that I have ever bothered to rent this completely unremarkable production.
