I saw and had the original black and white image of 1959, in which Shelley Winters and Milli Perkins were shot, and no matter how many times I looked, I can't help but cry. <br /> <br /> This version was (obviously) set as in 1959, but there were so many errors in the layout. Spiral staircase? Objects that did not exist at that time period existed in the film. Doris Roberts, unfortunately, can not play in the drama, she is a comedian, and this will not change. James Koko was a terrible Mr. Van Daan, and Mr. Düssel reminded me of my college professor, not the dentist he was supposed to play. In the original film, Ann went through a “glove” to go to Peter’s room, which seemed to take more than a minute. In this crappy remake, it took her less than 10 seconds. The first reviewer was right ... This remake is just a remake. What the director intended, throwing comedians in a similar drama. Sorry, but James Coco can't play drama. Max .. Shell was better in Deep Impact than in this film. Mad Mrs. Frank was just crazy, I could not stand her. Referring to and comparing with the 1959 version, I like it better; it copes better with the role of the suppressive mother. Out of 10 stars I give this remake 3. Don't waste time, get the 1959 version and the box with Kleenex.
