Being a big fan of horror films, I always managed to find something good in the film, but this film simply did not attract my interest or attention. This story revolves around the father, his daughter and girlfriend, since his wife died several years ago. These people are faced with a terrible situation in the city, which they stop and visit, and all the elderly people in this city unite against these people and almost kill them. This film reminded me of a film called “Children of Corn,” because it really involves children, who are Satan and who are his instruments of terror. There are a lot of chants, mixing mambo and toy tank, which completely destroys the whole family in their station wagon, as well as dolls that kill the husband and wife.
