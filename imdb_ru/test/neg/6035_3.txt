Reeves plays Haji Murad, a hero in Russia in the 1850s. <br /> <br /> This is a badly dubbed film in which June Forey plays some voices. Unfortunately, someone who ever thought of synchronizing voices with lips was blind, since words never coincide with lip patches. Anyone who says Japanese movies are bad has never watched this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is instantly forgotten, and so I forgot it when the movie was shot, and I sit and write it down. Perhaps this has more to do with the fact that the film is one of many that Reeves did in the hope of moving from action to more plot-driven films. Perhaps it was good for Reeves, but deadly for an audience that has to go through holidays like this one, where the whole court is intrigued by very few actions. <br /> <br /> In the defense of Reeves, he was a good actor, he was just unlucky in choosing good films. They all looked great, but very few of them did not put those who were watching them in a coma for the duration of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie will lead you into a coma. See it only if you have a need for sleep, and all other softer means have failed.
