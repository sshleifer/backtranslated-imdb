I love old "monster films" for the sheer value of the camp. It does not disappoint if you find such things amusing. <br /> <br /> The game is nonsense, written in the 1950s. You get used to it when you see enough of these ... the dialogues are very stupid and eventually forgotten. You're just there for the giant bird. <br /> <br /> “Science” in this movie is funny. A monstrous otherworldly bird floor that can manipulate antimatter ... intending to wreak havoc and there are people ... an alien that came to Earth to nest , what's happening. <br /> <br /> Much has been said about the ridiculous puppet with birds. It looks like a new chick ... bald and ugly with disheveled feathers. It even croaks like a hungry, angry underworld. However, the bird scared the shit of my three-year-old child, who had big scary bird nightmares for the evening. It's a bit creepy. <br /> <br /> I was very sad because of the scene where they shoot an egg. (For some reason, the egg is not protected by a protective screen from antimatter.) But I am a bird lover, what can I say?
