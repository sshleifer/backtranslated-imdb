another way to create. self-promotion, bad script, justifying the director of horror. The winner is as far from the new icon of horror as Mary Poppins (link to Disney score). what is going on here? you have Marilyn Manson opening and closing this piece of shit and all that. can it even be terrified? terrible, yes, but horror is tension. David Lynch must sue them for stealing a human elephant prosthesis. please stop these fans want to be directors now. directors already have enough competitors in the film industry. Going online and talking about how good your film does not mean is true. stop madness I work in the industry, and yes, itâ€™s interesting to work on these films, but in fact it is rarely interesting to watch.
