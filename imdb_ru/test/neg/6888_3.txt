I checked out this video, expecting to like it. Wanting to like it. I like foreign films, I love beautiful cinema, I know that critics liked this film (including my favorite, Roger Ebert), and I don’t mind “slow” films. <br /> <br /> Well, it's beautiful. This is the best thing I can say about this. The plot is very thin, the shots are very long, the views are very significant, the actors are very sincere, and it looks like a very long film. I fell asleep halfway though I woke up, rewound the tape, tried again. It was a test, but I got to the end. I did not like it better for this.
