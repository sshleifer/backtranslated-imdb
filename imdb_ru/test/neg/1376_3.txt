I have only seen most of the series since I left the TV as background noise in the hostel. <br /> <br /> I was a fan of Mencia, but this show does little for me. From time to time he says or does something to draw laughter, but he has this aura of complacency that completely destroys him. <br /> <br /> I always thought he was funny because of his angry person’s raging routine this is not very common in this series. Instead, he is just smug. I think it just reflects how funny his comedy is: stale and uninteresting when it’s not in the right mode of delivery. I saw him sometimes at this on his show, but for the most part he just sat there, smiling and looking complacent, and this didn't suit him very well. <br /> <br /> Although only my opinion.
