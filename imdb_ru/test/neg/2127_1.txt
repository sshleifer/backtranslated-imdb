Yikes <br /> <br /> I have seen quite a few bad movies in my time, many of them in the company of Mike, Tom, Crowe and others from MST3k. It was the same with this, and although the film itself seemed rather funny to me, without the comments MST3k would not be so much fun. <br /> <br /> The film is a prime example of really bad films coming out of Europe in the eighties. Terrible music, terrible game, terrible plot (which is not enough), terrible dialogue and really, really, really, terrible editing. Cripes <br /> <br /> It can be called a turkey, if not for the fact that it is by no means unique. This is almost the same film that almost every Italian director is out of balance. <br /> <br /> So, try to get the version of MST3k. This is a pretty funny episode with Mike and the gang in pretty good shape.
