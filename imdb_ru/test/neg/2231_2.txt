I rented this film, knowing that it would be bad (I saw only one good continuation of Disney, and it was a toy story 2), but it turned out to be far below my expectations. I'm a Disney fan, and I just don't believe in the sequel to Disney movies. For someone who has not grown up with the classics (either watched them when they went out, or shot them from birth), this is a sweet story. I just feel that the plot was too long and was predictable. Most of all, I was annoyed by the voices of the girls-ladies and tramps. They were too tall. Although most reviews say it's not so bad, I think that if you're a real Disney fan, you shouldn't waste time on it. <br /> <br /> I hope Disney will not become more sequels of any other classics in the near future.
