This film was probably the biggest waste in 2 hours of my life. Since the opening of 10 minutes I was ready to leave. The clich√© hit you in the face, and the plot was not only predictably stupid, but also full of holes than Swiss cheese. I am thinking of suing the lost 2 hours and $ 6.25, and also the fact that I am now more stupid to watch these empty films. T-Rex should be, so to speak, in their graves.
