My friend and I went to watch this movie. We have the opposite opinion about Fujimori, but after watching this film we agree with the following: the easiest way to get an inaccurate documentary is to tell about a foreign country in which you were not present when the events occurred, no matter how talented or how you invest in a movie. If you really want to learn about the history of other countries, see something made by the natives of this country, otherwise you will not be able to move away from your bubble. And those who are trying to impose their views and opinions about something that they donâ€™t belong to really abuse their power. Worse, the director decided not to talk about the embarrassing CIA involvement with the Fujimori regime. She decides to evade the consideration of a single topic, which her country can explain a lot to Peruvians. But this is not surprising, because both the director and the CIA violate the sovereignty of Peru, trying to influence democratic processes at various levels. <br /> <br /> If the director is really interested in helping Peru, she would have financed the native to make a documentary. In any case, there are many documentaries, films and books made by Peruvians on this topic. These include Ojos ke no no ve, Diaz de Santiago, Montesinos-Fujimori: Las dos Karas de la Misma Moneda, Montesinos: Poderozo Caballero, etc. Director of the Fall Fujimori Must spend her time analyzing the many problems in her own country, or at least her country's participation in the affairs of other countries.
