Spoilers !! <br /> <br /> I hate this one, but after that itâ€™s better than others, they just keep getting worse. Hopefully, Gibson is smart enough to stay away from the next one. Much the same with humor, that is, with the toilet, children, etc. How far we can see how their relationship develops. Drugs, bad guys, why South Africa! I found that an incredible, maybe South American country in the Golden Triangle would have made the script better. It seems that at the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s there were bad blond guys like Die Hard, powerful ducks playing Ice Land Gary Busey in the latest weapons, and so on. D. Hollywood is repeated again. This one with a similar story should go from above. The attack on the police, the scene at the beach condominium and the scuffle at the end, and the way through the Gibson girl killed by the copper attack were too strong. As in many parts of 2, they deteriorate, and 3 or 4 in this series are gaining speed down. 3/10
