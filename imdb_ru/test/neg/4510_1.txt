Rarely have I seen a literary work so poorly translated to the screen. The hysterical cast of b-movie and sitcoms simply makes the characters seem like bad Jewish stereotypes. Worst of all, Melissa Gilbert, whom you hate from the first scene and for which you never feel sympathy. Such performances should be noted and used against actors who want to work again. In general, a meager, low-budget film for television, which gives a bad reputation films made for television.
