Wow, where do I start? After suffering from this pitiful rental for $ 1.00 (thanks LOT, Family Video) I just needed to make a few comments. I did not bother to write down the names of the three actors in the film, but I hope you will understand who I am talking about. <br /> <br /> A monster truck terrorizes the countryside and chases two buddies up to college. their doom. They face a hot girl in slutty clothes. I mean, it sounds fantastic in theory. I laughed hysterically at the DVD box while I was walking towards the girl behind the counter in the video store. <br /> <br /> Acting: the hot girl played by Aimee Weather clearly laughs in many scenes where she should be scared. The other two main actors in the film, the fat joker and the vanilla straight, are both terrible. The fat man thinks he's Jack Black. He is not. Another actor, our hero, is overly worried and misses all his cues and looks like some kind of common character that you could see in the film “Made for Nickelodeon” about skateboarding in the early 90s. Listen: I do not expect good performances in such films, but at least the actors can make an effort not to annoy. You may be an incompetent actor, but still be pleasant (i.e. John Wayne). At least this Aimee Gal is attractive. <br /> <br /> Scenario: Holy ****, who thought this dialogue was funny? I would not have the courage to play it in front of my drama class in elementary school, especially to present it as a film script. Incomprehensible bad. More on this later. <br /> <br /> Production: OK, this is one of the places where the film definitely succeeds. Product quality is surprisingly high. The appearance of the film is very good. Apparently, the only talented person who worked on the film was the director of photography. <br /> <br /> Well, here are my biggest problems: 1) The guy driving the car never drives faster than 25 miles per hour. /> <br /> 2) The guy driving the car drives far away to the village before he realizes that there is a fat masked man in the backseat. He allegedly carefully records the mileage of gasoline and maintains his vintage car in good condition, but does he not notice the wannabe Jack Black weighing 300 pounds in the back? Come on. <br /> <br /> 4) Characters never change clothes. There are two scenes in the hotel. Supposedly, the souls are available for our characters, but for 3 days while this movie is going on, none of the characters will bother to change their clothes. <br /> <br /> 5) Comedy. Carefree comedy does not mix with horror. Period. You cannot let our characters escape from the monster truck in one second, and the next second they will verbally fight each other, playing some light, light / comedy music. This type of stimulation virtually destroys any tension in the film. Films like The Evil Dead 2, in which comedy and horror are mixed, understand that stress can be eased, but never taken off with humor. Monster Man does not understand this. <br /> <br /> It annoys me that what could have been a VERY funny horror movie was destroyed by the director, who thought he was much smarter than he really was. Well.
