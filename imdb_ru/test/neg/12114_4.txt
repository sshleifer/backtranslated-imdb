Of course, this film was backward. But you expected the moment you looked at the box. This is film B, and this film is delivered to the T & A factor. In truth, it was funnier than expected. Although it was by no means a comedic genius, such as Animal Party or Orgazmo, as for films B, it was worth it to see if you still like that thing. <br /> Christians and morally oriented parent groups are soft entertainment for adults. If you do not want your children to watch sexual content and naked bodies, then you should keep your children away from this movie.
