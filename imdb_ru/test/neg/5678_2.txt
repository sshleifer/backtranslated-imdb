I was a big fan of "SNL" in the days of Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Dana Akroyd, Gilda Radner and many other unforgettable stars. But every time I tried to watch it for the last ten years, I was very disappointed, and sometimes even disgusted with it. Ten years ago, I believed that the show could not survive, as it became so devoid of humor as I could understand, and yet it continued to drag out, which I always found in horror, wondering how anyone in the world could find his shit humor is generally ridiculous. Whenever I tuned in over the past decade, I was never glad that I did. In fact, I was always annoyed that I was not sleeping and wasting my time. For me, the absolute minimum came a few years ago, when a popular young male actor who I really liked was a guest. One day that night, he played a big star, perhaps himself, and as a guy, I think that the character “Mongo” played by Chris Kattan was again in the back seat of the car with him. This was followed by the fact that Mongo was forced to climb up and down, up and down on the actor's lap, and he screamed hysterically when he was probably raped. The audience laughed at them, and I shake my head, surprised that they find it funny, surprised that NBC even broadcasts such a thing. Over the past years, I have repeatedly tried to approach the show with an open mind, hoping that it can regain a sly sense of humor, which I adored for many years. But just a week ago for me it is not. Not even close. One exception: during the 2008 presidential campaign, I thought Tina Fey was fantastic, and she was the only performer who made me tune. But these parodies of Sarah Palin, although hysterical, were still not enough to save the remaining 90 minutes and I would always regret not turning it off as soon as I heard the familiar “This is a Saturday evening !!!”
