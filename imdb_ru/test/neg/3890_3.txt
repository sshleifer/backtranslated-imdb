Before I start, the “minor” correction: IMDb claims that Richard Gere is 180 cm tall. Wrong! I passed by him 10 years ago, and he cannot be an ant ** more than 165. I am 183 years old, and he looked like a child next to me. <br /> <br /> Should have called "Wheatlands"; appropriate title to complement Malik's previous (and much better) Badlands film. This film shows that not all directors have as their main purpose to entertain. In fact, some of them have as their main goal to show wheat in all its glory. <br /> <br /> The film is depressing and relatively unattractive, with a mandatory tragic ending. None other than the average and predictable drama of the love triangle, where two thirds of the male sex did not survive the film. Praised for its visual quality; while it has that realistic 70s feel for it, there are limits to how exciting the fields of wheat can be. You can shoot them with 1500mm cameras, I don’t care, but they are still wheat fields. <br /> <br /> Gere, which at first glance seems to be erroneous as a kind of production worker who has become a wheat field. -Worker, pretty solid, while Brooke Adams seems distant and cool for most of the film, making you wonder how much she loved both pieces. But for those who are looking for a film that displays all the gorgeous colors of a wheat field, look no further: you have found your dream! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my “biographies” of Richard Gere and other Hollywood intellectual heavyweights, please contact me by email.
