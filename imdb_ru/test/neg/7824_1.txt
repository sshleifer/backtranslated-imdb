This movie was terrible. I thought everything would be fine, but it got worse and worse. From the initial scenes, he seems to be moving in the direction of another safe, predictable romcom, but the moment he arrives at the house, he simply disintegrates. None of the heroes has any depth, and the only person who was almost believable was Tom, although the way he was so easily distracted simply irritated me after a while. The dialogue is ridiculous, and the structure of the film is almost completely absent. In an insulting comedy attempt, the writer / director introduces a new character or event in almost every scene, none of which is realistic, which makes it very confusing to keep track of what is happening. The plot is hardly a reason for a movie: the boy loves the girl, the house sits with his father, meets the girl, destroys the house, gets the girl. A complete waste of time.
