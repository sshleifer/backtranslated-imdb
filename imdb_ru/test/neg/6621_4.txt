Before I sat down and watched this movie on HBO, I didnâ€™t expect anything but a few laughs here and there, and all together - a silly and common story. Well, that's exactly what I got from this, except for the fact that I was somewhat pleased at the end of the film. I did not expect this to happen, I thought it would be another hour and a half that I had on hand to spend. Well, it was, but still it was worth it. The whole plot was very stupid, cheap, and some of the plots were very, very stupid. Otherwise, he still had funny moments, although not so many. <br /> <br /> In general, if you intend to rent it, do not do it. Watch it on TV. I gave him 4, I was generous, because it made me laugh, but still it was still pretty stupid.
