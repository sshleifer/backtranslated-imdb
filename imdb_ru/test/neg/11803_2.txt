I was surprised that the creators of this film really came out, saying that this film was a true story. Most of the scenes seemed to me fake. For example, when one girl was eating her sandwich and there was a roach in it. While she was eating a sandwich, the camera from the opposite side showed that there was a roach on it. It's funny that the camera just shot on the sandwich when the girl ate it. Another scene is when a gang opened a closet for clothes, and a cat flew out of the closet, or should I say that they threw it away to give it an effect. This film was not realistic at all. It is highly doubtful that the events that took place were true that evening when the "Experiment in St. Francisville" took place. I believe that there may be ghosts in the house, but not on the night when this film was shot! The end was funny when Tim and the other girl were chained in some kind of basement. Paul and Madison found them and saved them! I would prefer to see the Blair Witch project again, and then watch the film The Experiment at St. Francisville again. As I said, if the filmmakers did not say that it was a true story with real events, I might like it more. You better get more entertainment from the Blair Witch Project (although this is not a true story) !!!
