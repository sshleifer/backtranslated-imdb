Imagine a remake of The Defiant Ones with black chicken and white chicken attached to each other. Put a story on some Caribbean island ruled by drug dealers, and the revolution has begun. And let the black woman be from the Huggi Bear women's stable, and the white woman be diluted by Patty Hearst, and you will have a Black Mom, White Mom. <br /> <br /> In those lingering days of entry by car Theater this object must have been a big old hit. All the hot buttons of the seventies are pressed in it. Even though they both fill their clothes better and will receive several whistles from the men in the audience, no one is ever going to take Pam Greer and Margaret Markov for Sydney Poitier and Tony Curtis. Well, Halle Berry and Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> Margaret and Pam are prisoners, where the guards and warder lustfully look at the arriving new fish. Margaret - a rich girl from the state who accepted the "revolution", while Pam - your main dear call girl who served the local drug lord, got tired of him and tried to leave the island. <br /> <br /> Margaret's revolutionary comrades ambush a bus carrying them from the women's prison to the city, but they are lost in the escape. Both have different plans, but, like Sid and Tony, they cannot fully agree on whose agenda comes first. At some interesting moments, the police, drug dealers and revolutionaries are looking for these two ill-fated chained buddies. <br /> <br /> Just so that you donâ€™t make a mistake with ideas, the head of the revolutionaries and Partner Markov in kanudling is called Ernesto performed by the Philippine actor Zaldi Zhornak. This whole mess was shot in the Philippines, which started its own film industry. <br /> <br /> Good photography in the Philippines is all Black Mama White Mam can recommend. But if you're a fan of really bad black movies, then this one is for you.
