To paraphrase the comments of the previous reviewer, if you are a Stooges fan, avoid it at all costs! My main question, being experienced comedic fighters, what Moe and Larry were, why they insisted on trying to continue the action when it was so obvious that their home studio, Colombia, was clearly not interested in giving them serious writers and old comedy directors? This film plays like someone who imitates the trio palely, and you can see how Moe and Larry are working hard to make every piece of slapstick relevant. Joe De Rita, despite his education in vaudeville, is simply not suitable for replacing Curly, Schempe or even Joe Besser. If this is what Moe and Larry left to choose from, they should simply close the store and enjoy their retirement years. Leaving us fans the best memories of the much better films they shot earlier. Always leave them laughing - this is the motto of comedy and always leave while you are on top. Consequently, Seinfeld leaves the comedy, right there, instead of rushing to the inevitable decline.
