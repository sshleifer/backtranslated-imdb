Kerry is a good <br /> <br /> good actor, and he proved it in Man on the Moon and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. But hey, what can an actor do without a good story and the right director? He can play "Number 23". <br /> <br /> Bad <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is a bad, overvalued director, and he argued it in almost every film he shot. What he did with Batman was just a disaster, but probably the movies about Batman should have looked good. Well, they did not. Instead of gothic and creepy we got Disneyland. Of course, “Falling Down” was great, but can you spoil the movie with Robert Dyuvall and Michael Douglas And with a great script? No, you can not. <br /> <br /> So, a good actor and a poor director finally met and made “Number 23” ... <br /> <br /> Ugly (23) <br /> <br /> I know that it’s stupid to start with, but ... The Fingling plot (almost half of this film) looks just like an introduction to another chapter of Max Payne2. VoiceOvers, the quality of the most detective story, the quality of the characters, even the colors, mood and music, editing and sound mixing too! It may work for the game, but of course it doesn't work in the movies. <br /> <br /> The stage setting is so bad that it becomes funny. It is not even annoying. Kerry reads walking upstairs in the park? What for? It `s naturally? No, but it looks good. Why did the blonde suicide cover the walls in her apartment with white paper? If she just wanted to kill herself? There is no logic in it, but it still looks good. Guess it doesn't look good. It looks unnatural. <br /> <br /> All female characters are flat. Why is this so? Who cares, let's continue the story. <br /> <br /> Who is this fingling? A private look at suicide? Hardly believable. <br /> <br /> Scenes when Walter Sparrow argues with his wife about the weather can actually become the best part of this movie. Instead, we get the Molder / Scully routine. Disappointment. <br /> <br /> Interiors have no signs of people living in them, except for significant items (shoes, photos, etc.) No luck. <br /> <br /> Dialogues are not so bad. But what about VO? Well, that's another story. “There is no such thing as fate. There are only different options. ” The captain is obvious for salvation! “The number was after Fingerling. And now he will be after me. ” Cliche. And so on. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the average housewife would have burst into a public building in the middle of the night. Successfully and calmly. <br /> <br /> The story of how the dog drags the main character to the cemetery. This is such an old trick and so convenient for the writer that it should be banned. I mean it! <br /> <br /> Memories and editing, similar to “what happened in the last episode of the X-files”, is not the best way to present the most interesting part of the film. It's true? <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this story deserves a better fate, but it is not. It makes no sense. What has been said in chronological order is weak and unbelievable. All the time when we catch undeveloped characters, this is a chain of situations that are nothing more than a badly written fiction. It can be fun, but since the whole movie is very serious, it is not. For many coincidences, this is just bad for every story. And the "mystery"? It is predictable and easy to guess. <br /> <br /> Loss of touch with reality is a great theme for a good movie, but I have never seen anything like it in Hollywood productions. If you're interested in this topic, just watch Polanski's Aversion or something from David Cronenberg, Spider or The History of Violence, both of these films deal with similar issues that Number 23 wanted to show. Wanted, but could not.
