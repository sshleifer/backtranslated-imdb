I and a friend shot this movie the other day. At first glance, it was another film for teenagers, which we also hoped for, being fans of simple horror and comedy. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be intended to disappoint the viewer as much as possible. It quickly accelerates into something that has great potential. Unfortunately, it never leaves the earth. We watched something that looked like an hour, when I finally half asleep, managed to say: “Dude, this film sucks.” In fact, it was only 35 minutes ... Dude agreed. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the film is simply not funny. This, undoubtedly, should have been ridiculous, but it failed. It failed so much that I was upset. It reminds me of myself. I had the potential to be who I wanted, and instead I watched cheap horror / funny movies all the time. I feel sorry for the creators of this film with all my heart. It's so sad. All this potential .. and nothing.
