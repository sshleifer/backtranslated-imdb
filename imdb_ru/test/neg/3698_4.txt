This is the film that BEGINS to show on TV at 3 or 4 in the morning, if at all. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that the creators of the film responsible for the “Attack of the 50-foot Woman” thought they made relevant statements about women and the fuselage and dangers of the demon rum, all of which were enclosed in a science fiction allegory. <br /> <br /> Or perhaps it was a tax write-off. <br /> <br /> In any case, “Attack” turns out to be the best for the viewer under the following circumstances: a) severe intoxication, b) seen on a double count with any of these films about Jacqueline Suzanne (maybe, “Once “?) Or c) just at night, when you feel insecure and the world around you is too perfect. Go to the "Attack" and you will feel great, guaranteed! <br /> <br /> This is good for laughing at the expense of the hockey scenario, the rubber special effect and this four-eyed sheriff. And I think that the last line should be engraved on a monument somewhere in Washington, DC - it's just so memorable. <br /> <br /> Four stars for “Attack of the 50-foot Woman”; Buy a copy, mail Gloria Steinem - she will love you for it.
