I apologize for the rain at all the parades. Just a little about me: I love and know a lot about Asian cinema, especially about Japanese, Chinese and Indian. Admittedly, I'm new when it comes to South Korean cinema, but if it's the best of the best, sorry. I just want you to know that I’m not at all limited when it comes to evaluating foreign films, and I don’t fit into the “dumb American” stereotype. , , well, not quite. <br /> <br /> I can not believe in the appreciation of this piece of anything. This is a disgusting * and * funny movie. Hammy's action is all done badly and overdone, as if asking the attention of an uneducated viewer. Awful camera work demanding meaningless close-ups derived from MTV aesthetics. <br /> <br /> There are more holes in the plot than in a giant piece of Swiss cheese. No one expects the thriller to be 100% realistic, and for the sake of entertainment, I would gladly close my eyes to minor inappropriate details. But, excuse me, what is happening here, what * can * withstand even a brief analysis? This story of an incredibly confusing and crushing act of revenge is worse than the most terrible tabloid story, which can be read in one line in the supermarket. (I don’t want to spoil your “pleasure” if it’s a word, so let's not go into the details of the plot.) The battle scenes are cruel, incredible, completely stupid (the main “hero” takes dozens and tens). Opponents at the same time, after he ONLY trained while in prison, punching the wall!) There are two really “outstanding” features of this film: evil and incestuous sex (brother for sister and father for daughter, well, we has evolved since the time of Oedipus, right?) and graphic violence. Cut off parts of the body — arms, teeth, tongues — along with spilled blood on an industrial scale (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes needed to die to make this film?) Do not have an aesthetic function / motivation at all. <br /> <br /> Holiday for S & M is inclined, admittedly, but, even for those, the holiday is neither worthy nor sophisticated. Heaven, even Mel Gibson’s recent and much-discussed work on an almost similar topic was not THAT bad. <br /> <br /> The invariably good press that this pretentious, bloated, too long piece of free blood comes from the Korean coast gets me wondering what's going on. I do not consider myself an absolute sample of taste, and often I am willing to admit that a film that I didn’t like can be better than I could imagine. However, I have no doubt to call it the way I see it: bad, bad, bad. No redemptive qualities. My 2c? Find something better that you can do with your time.
