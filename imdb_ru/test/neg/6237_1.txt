What the hell was the point of this boring movie? at first it looked quite interesting, but quickly collapsed on the face. It is supposed to be based on a true story, but in order to scream loudly, there are no more scriptwriters left in Hollywood? The man I saw in some of the best films ever made, defoe can play almost anything, and when I see that he's in a movie, I have no problem renting it, but I start to wonder. the great actor also slips away; perhaps their hard or they just lose their feelings. the dialogue was long and terribly difficult, especially at home with the family. I wonder if the actors thought they had a hit? maybe ... uh ... Oscar?
