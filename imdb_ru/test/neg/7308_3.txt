In fact, this happened: the royal mother-in-law and father-in-law had breakfast with the couple the day after the wedding and distributed money to her in public. This worried young Elizabeth so much that she never forgot about it. We must remember that she was only 16. She was so ashamed that she had been afraid of sex all her life. Perhaps it began to appear as a trauma. Also the constant intervention of her aunt and mother-in-law. As you say, she kept all her children away from her, criticized her teeth and manners (which she considered inappropriate for the empress), and when Sissy finally went to Venice with her husband and children, her eldest daughter died in this miserable and premature death. She never recovered.
