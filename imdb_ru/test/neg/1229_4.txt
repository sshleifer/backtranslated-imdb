This is a bad caricature of the Lonely Pigeon and Larry McMurtry. <br /> <br /> I like your books, and Lonely Pigeon is in the top three. I admire how you see yourself through your characters with such unshakable honesty, balanced by the fact that you never take it all too seriously. Therefore, I am spoiled. <br /> <br /> Why did you come to this? <br /> <br /> Luna Comanche does not meet your standards. I see that you are credited with writing the screen, but it is so unlike you, I prefer to think that it is written by someone else. <br /> <br /> The dialogue makes me claustrophobic, it’s a pity that with someone it’s not possible to get a naturally stated sentence. Part of the "genius" was painful. McCrea beyond recognition - mainly because of the meaningless words emanating from his mouth. <br /> <br /> Well, I miss Cal too. <br /> <br /> The most important missing factors are Gus, Cal and the people they are: their courage; the core vein consisted of ethics and honesty; their lack of self-deception. Difficult people leading a hard life with a certain unquestionable grace. <br /> <br /> Some wine must be applied to the difficult direction here and in everything. All actors needed dialect and dialogue. <br /> <br /> Although I try to present Robert Duvall as McCray, he speaks better about this dialogue, but not much. He tries to sound like a cowboy of few words, shy, crafty, witty, but half does not succeed ... <br /> <br /> What makes him so much different from the "Lonely Pigeon"? Can a writer forget his characters? You fooled some people, Mr. McMurtry, but not this one.
