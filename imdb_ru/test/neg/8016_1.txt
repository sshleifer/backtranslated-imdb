This film is almost a complete waste of time. I am studying a book for my level of English A, and the film only contributes in one direction, and this shows that the whole script unfolds in a rural idyll. The acting is wooden, the filmography is ridiculous, and the so-called dramatic scenes in the film made most of my students (including me) laugh at their lyrics. The book, although not my favorite literary choice, is much better than the film, and the sound track is just annoying. Do not watch this film if you are not looking for an eternal, high-quality storyline, turned into meaningless, media waste.
