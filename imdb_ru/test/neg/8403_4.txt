The disturbing film, which, as it happens, ends with an extremely close reunion of a naked man and his young son, but in its confusing structure it contains a poetic imaginary visual study of the innocence of idealized amnestics. <br /> <br /> The plot consists of two strands, the weaker of which is the gradual disclosure of the Graham / Pablo state. Nevertheless, this is a visual description of his state and his winding path to a partial awakening caused by his affair with Irina. <br /> <br /> This is a strong thread, and the specificity of the plot is carried, seemingly tied to a collection of characters: Graham's best friend who can reveal the cause of his condition in an awkward memory, his manipulating boss and his crazy mad scientist from the comics they are all interested in being lost and dependent. <br /> <br /> Failure of the film is a conflict between the two streams. One of them is visual, winding and sublime, and the other is structured, like an inept thriller, all explanatory dialogues and unresolved samples of symbolism. <br /> <br /> However, I liked Novo. He continues to flirt with the abyss of taboo and dodges into something beautiful, as in a career, with a double bass player and two women, when the installation for the scene of cheap pornography becomes a segment of peace and rejuvenation. I still have not received a tooth. <br /> <br /> A strange, clumsy and unfortunate story, but with an almost redeeming beauty.
