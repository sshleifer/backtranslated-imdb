With a few nominal actors (Lance Henrikson, David Warner, Joe Don Baker), why did Jeffrey Combs get the lead role? Henrikson would be perfect for the title role, as was Warner, Baker or even others in the film, such as Charles Napier. The combs were wrong at this, and did a poor job of it. Everything he did seemed fake or contrived. <br /> <br /> The script is bad. This meant that if Lance Henrikson (or another person) had played a major role, he could have saved the film (struck it out of my “waste of time” category), but it would still be a bad film. Screen playback was completely absent. The director had to admit it and help the film.
