I assume that people discussing this nonsense are close friends of the director or something like that. This is bad, and not in the song of Michael Jackson. Comparing the pace of this film with the progress of the snail would be an insult to the snail. This film has been lounging around, it seems, for ages, and all this introduces us to some not-so-scary zombie children with stupid makeup and some kind of vendetta, blood lust or something else. Believe me, you don't care. Just the thought that a mother will move her two daughters to this half-ruined and dirty house is absurd. And even worse, I found that I simply did not care. Background about zombie children? Snore. Threat to mom and / or daughter? Don't care <br /> <br /> In short, WOW was so boring. Do not worry
