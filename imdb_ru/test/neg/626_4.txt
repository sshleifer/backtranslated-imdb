The first adventure of Irwin Allen in all star performances was one star disaster. "The History of Mankind" contains some of the most incredible casting solutions of all time. Virginia Mayo as Blonde Cleopatra, Dennis Hopper chews landscapes with Napoleon, Peter Lorre dines for several weeks in the scenery as Nero, Marie Wilson as Marie Antoinette as a road show Marilyn Monroe, these are just some of them. <br /> <br /> The film is also known as the last film in which all three brothers of Marx participated, although they all play different roles. Chico plays a monk who is the confidant of Christopher Columbus, Groucho cuts Indians from the island of Manhattan in the role of Peter Min, and, most surprisingly, Harpo Marx in the role of Sir Isaac Newton, who discovers gravity when the apple hits him in the bean. <br /> <br /> Combining all of these images is a story in which humanity itself is judged. Soon a super-H-bomb will be discovered that will allow people around the world. Judgment Day is coming. <br /> <br /> But humanity has its supporters and opponents. For the prosecution stands Old Scratch, who for centuries revealed in the man the worst in the form of Vincent Price. But man has a good side, and he is better than Ronald Coleman, demonstrating a man in his most civilized manifestations. Coleman and Price defend their position before the judge, played by Cedric Hardwick. <br /> <br /> These three people have some of the finest speaking voices that English has ever known. When a film is about them, when they exhibit exhibits for their work, it is pleasant to listen. Then, when the focus is on individual stories, you want to scream in agony. <br /> <br /> Why did Irwin Allen ride, I'm still trying to figure it out. Was he intentionally backing this up with some of these decisions? If it was a satire, it simply would not have come off the ground. <br /> <br /> It was Ronald Coleman’s farewell film, and although I’d ​​hardly like to get out of it, I can’t think of any person who could make a better case for civilization. <br /> <br /> Therefore, when you see the “History of Humanity”, go ahead through some of the exhibits and each time you find treasures when lawyers are brought before a judge.
