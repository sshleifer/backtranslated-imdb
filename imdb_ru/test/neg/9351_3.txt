Long ago, in a galaxy far far away (sounds familiar), water became the most valuable commodity (it sounds familiar), and a small minority controls its distribution (which is surprising, just a heart attack and die from this surprise). A group of ice pirates (water renegades, wet thugs? ... oh wait, this last one was used) is trying to find a way to an incredible limitless supply of water with a beautiful, but spoiled (druis?) Princess in tow and a group of idiots stalking vile villains. <br /> <br /> This film can be a truly great comedic parody (Star Wars, Dune by David Lynch), but was simply not processed correctly. I think this is a low-brow humor. It's actually not that funny, and that's a shame, because it has Angelica Houston, Ron Perlman and Robert Urich (hence the three stars), who are not exactly idlers in the acting department. <br /> <br /> Definitely rent and definitely drink straight.
