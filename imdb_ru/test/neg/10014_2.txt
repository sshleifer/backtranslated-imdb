At the bottom of the scale of the film "Apocalypse" is this piece of food called "The Final Executioner" ... at least where I'm from. The former policeman teaches the guy to seek revenge on those who coolly killed his woman and friends ... and thatâ€™s all. Lots of fake explosions and repeated shootouts. It has one of the strangest costumes I've ever seen in a film, and a massive fortress, which, obviously, is managed by only 7 people. Great job on dubbing, too, guys (!) The best moment: when our hero loses the sword battle and is about to pierce his neck, he just pulls out his gun and an explosion! Why not do it before? It's a secret. That is why someone would like to go through this first. I still puzzle over this myself now. 2/10
