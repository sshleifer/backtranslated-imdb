I am shocked that all the “hated” ratings are six and seven, still above average. I think this is the case "the emperor has no clothes." I understand that this film was shot with a very small budget in the early 70s ... Despite this, it became difficult for him to sit and watch. The DVD I saw had some subtitles, but about 75% of the speech does not have subtitles. Some of them are hard to understand. The Jamaican pato was nice to hear, but after a while you’re trying hard not to “shut down”. Some shots were good and the realism was even if some of the speeches were not very good (Jimmy Cliff did a great job). In the movie 1:43, the main points are Jimmy Cliff (Ivan) singing for the stage, and a few shootouts and fights. Probably 15 minutes or so. The rest is pretty boring. By the way, at the beginning of the film there are some strange changes in Ivan’s character, which seem to be an editing error, which made me laugh a little. One reviewer said that this film was cut out so many times that there are few copies of the original theatrical version of 1972. The final was quite interesting, showing how the media from a young age influences people, it can also be a general comment on the influence of the white man / colonialism in Jamaica. Other major themes are poverty, corruption, church, ambition ... In conclusion, the soundtrack is definitely worth it, the film is much smaller.
