This picture appeared on the screens of movies on June 6, 1980, starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber in the role of Captain Comelius Butt, J.D. Hinton as Buzz and game partner of the year Dorothy Stratton. The picture begins with the endless roaming space of the police in search of criminals. There the ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown spacecraft. Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz enter, trying to figure out who owns the unknown ship. In case of failure, they call upon Captain Comelia, who orders his team to fight back. Enters the gorgeous Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of the Galaxie, created by man, a robot. Now a few thoughts on this picture. This film was a stupid plan, and this is one of the reasons why I donâ€™t like fiction. If you are doing science fiction, you would have noticed that laser sound effects were borrowed from an early science fiction film called Battlestar Galactica, which was broadcast in cinemas in 1978. Many of the door sounds that you hear in this film come from another science fiction film, released back in 1966, called Star Trek. Now for the reason that I bought this film, Dorothy Stratton. She is gorgeous in her solid costume. I think her talents were wasted in this picture, and she should never have been involved in such garbage. Connie Selleck was also considered for the role, and her talents would also be wasted. In one picture only, I give this film a caress star, and in Dorothy Stratton I give it 10 caress stars, although she did not deserve to get into a trash movie like this one. If you like these pictures, you can get a DVD version on Amazon.com.
