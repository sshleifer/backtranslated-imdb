As a rule, I will not watch films that I have not seen for some time, so I insert or remove them to give a full and fresh look at the film. In the case of Thunder Sound, I remembered my oath never to watch this movie again, so I’ll just remember. In fact, I did not think about how terrible this film was until I read someone else’s review and did not recall the experience that I had in 2005, when I actually saw it in the theater. My movie friend made me watch it, although I was not interested, and wow. (Later, I made him watch “Basic Instinct 2” in the theater, reminding him that he made me see this nonsense. So, I think it calmed us down.) I definitely had my share of deep laughter (due to the film of course) that didn't make him happy, because he really wanted to see it. In the time travel / butterfly effect movie there was so much bad graphics, I had the loudest chuckle whenever they showed a dinosaur (God, I liked to see this dinosaur and they are actually afraid of it - it was fun!) Or just just Ben Kingsley. It's great, Kingsley can remind us of what human actors can be: move from “Gandhi” and “Schindler's List” to this. (Even Meryl Streep can appear from time to time in “Devilish”, so they are forgiven.) For several months, I pulled MST3k with my friend, consistently referring to this movie to any inexpensive science fiction film or Kingsley Flick. Yes, the film would be a great movie to see a drunk (or otherwise drunk): a terrible excessive game, a “special” effect that even Nintendo64 would turn away from and funny plot twists. The biggest disappointment was that Razzie didn't even nominate this film for an award.
