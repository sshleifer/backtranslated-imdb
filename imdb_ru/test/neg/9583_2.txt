At first it seems a rather innocent choice - the name “employee of the month” may sound like “Office space” and the show “Office clerk”. I think no. It's not even a dark comedy. The director of this film, whoever the guy was called, was a complete jerk and was sick, perverted. There is no pleasure when you are lured into pity for a complete loser who cheats on his wife, steals from his first-class work and lies through his teeth 24/7. The second I enter the room, when my family watches her (and, believe me, they watched her more, because they prayed that at least some relief, perhaps even some fable, late, sent a warm message of good justice and when the good guys look good). All the good guys were killed so long ago that they did not have time to look good. The memorial was not made. <br /> <br /> This movie has a madness. He does not respect the elderly, the dead and women - and the director is trying to make people like him. <br /> <br /> I gave this film two films just because the soundtrack was good. But even that was not so memorable. If you're lucky you didn't see it in cinemas, definitely my friends - don't do it at home.
