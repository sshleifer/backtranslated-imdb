This is one of the most stupid and useless films ever. It really does not match the status of the film. It is VERY cheap (apparently filmed on videotape), it acted terribly and just rotten. I could not believe how cheap and inept this piece of shit was. It was like a home video! I mean, I suppose that the guy I know in several houses down for sure dug up my video camera and did this shit in 2 or 3 hours. This is so bad. I noticed the name where this “Asylum” came from, and I will NEVER shoot anything with that name again !!! When you rent a movie, check if it belongs to this “company”. True, the truth is one - if you like badly played, amateur films, then you may like this loser. It is absolutely boring and scary !!! You have been warned !!!
