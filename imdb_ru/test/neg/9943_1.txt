I watched hundreds of kung fu movies and heard something good about this movie, so I decided to try it. What I saw was one of the worst manifestations of filmmaking I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can't help but feel that the director wants every muscular guy from Hong Kong to be in this film. Everyone replays to stupidity. Even Conan the barbarian had some politeness. In this film, there are simply developed men screaming in every scene and stupid women who have no self-esteem. The narrator's character had to be killed for sucking so much ... she really did not deserve to live to the end. The whole movie was a melodramatic mess, with terrible play, bad directing and bad acting. They should simply rename this film to â€œStupid one-armed caveman with a blade." That is the question ... why do some directors use quick cuts for some action movies? Answer: To hide the shortcomings of the actors. Almost every scene was closed and quickly cut without any stream. The film did its best to show the intensity, but it became almost ridiculous. Please stay away from this movie if you have any taste in Kung Fu movies ... or any taste in movies.
