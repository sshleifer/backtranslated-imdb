Well ... at the time of writing, 65 people voted for this film, resulting in a rating of 5 out of 10. I assume that only the film crew voted. So I'm here to somehow condemn it all. <br /> <br /> Never before has the movie aroused more public interest than this movie. Given this, I laughed out quite loudly - but the film / story absolutely did not want me. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of bad movies. LOT. But, man, this one takes them all. <br /> <br /> Talking about computers of the 96th, about ridiculous actions and chases on wheelchairs, we have young Tarantino who can not finance their ideas. Yes, life is a cruel joke.
