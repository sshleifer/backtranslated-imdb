I like Errol Flynn; I like biographies and action films. It showed all three of them .... but I didn’t like this movie. It lasted too long, although the last 20 minutes were excellent, especially in photos with great shots from a low angle. However, it seemed to me that it took six hours to get to this point, and I really can't say why I feel this way. <br /> <br /> The action is interesting, with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland all right. In fact, it was nice to see that De Havilland actually supports Flynn instead of her usual role as antagonist to him. However, in this film something is missing. <br /> <br /> The film was strongly criticized for its historical inaccuracy, but I don’t hear the same criticism for many other films that did the same. In fact, this is rare when the film is historically accurate. For some reason, this revisionist story offended most critics. If the film had made General Custer much worse than it actually was, they probably would have liked it. Well, too bad. Critics prefer villains to heroes in their own way. <br /> <br /> I really would like to have more fun, but I will take on many other Flynn adventures about this.
