“New Generation” is the third entry in Amityville, based on the plot of the writer John Jones, on a subject taken from a house on Long Island, which causes spectral suffering and death for its new owners. First a lamp, then a clock, and now a mirror. However, this is also the first Amityville since The Possession, which is directly related to the real events with which the whole series began. This time the homeless man was given the eerie mirror of Case Terry (Robert Partridge), an artist. Soon people start dying around him, which ultimately leads to his discovery that the mirror once hung in Amityville's house - indeed, that very night a man named Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in Amityville II) killed his entire family . Unfortunately for Terry, his discovery of the mirror is not entirely accidental, and he soon learns the truth about his past, the truth that he had buried since childhood. <br /> <br /> This 7th issue in the often worn franchise is a disappointment for me. Things began to pick up stupid and uneven, but entertaining “The time has come,” and considering how much this film is trying to extract its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - it should have been better than it was. <br /> <br /> However, at least I have three trips to the same well, with another evil artifact from the Amityville house, with another explanation of malignant paranormal visits. One of the biggest weaknesses of the Amityville franchise is the unshakable determination of each set of producers to completely ignore all the other episodes of the series. On the one hand, it is perfectly reasonable that they do not want to be attached to anyone's continuity, but at least they could recognize the storylines that have already been made, and it is just possible * not to repeat them again and again *. <br /> <br /> In the way the story unfolds, something quite loud, no doubt because of the inevitability that this repeated festival brings. Since you already know what will happen, a carefully thought-out build-up is slow and tedious. Or maybe it’s still tiring. Directed by John Murlovski, probably could have done more to increase the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror, and not just make it flash red and emit rattling "evil" voices that lack any subtlety. There were times when the characters seemed completely indifferent to their otherworldly qualities. If they don't take it too seriously, why should we? <br /> <br /> What a shame, because the “New Generation” has more than capable actors. I was going to not look at it until I saw the name "Julia Nixon" in the credits. She captured my attention just as always, and, in any case, I was annoyed, her role was not more extensive. Terry O'Quinn was equally charismatic and, again, underestimated. Partridge herself in the title role clearly fits the type of hero with pointed woodcutters in the early 1990s, and although I’m not sure that he really gave him the necessary advantage, it’s not as if someone here played Ibsen. /> <br /> The sets also deserve attention, from the dramatic artwork that fills Suki’s room to the claustrophobic corridors presented in the memories / supernatural episodes. The correct view of them is especially important, considering how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulate fragmented memories. It is clear that Murlovsky is more a visual director than an actor or horror director. Unfortunately, in the end it is a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The “New Generation” sees that the same race is held for the third time in 4 years. Add to this the lack of direction where it was really necessary, and all efforts do not withstand as tall as they should. Nevertheless, one should recognize his strong ties with the source material and some good actors not necessarily at their best hours. Honestly, the ideal person for this is one who has not seen any of the past sequels “The Possession”, for whom history will not be such a large journey through déjà vu.
