Beats me, how can people describe this teenage exercise as a film noir. Yes, there is a gun, a bottle, a lady, and lead - this is a private eye, but this is not what the genre does, guys. This thing is like a warmed-up series of television cops — lots of bloody beatings and lousy continuity — mixed with memories of Chinatown. Pretty hard to watch in the first 10 minutes. You want a modern feeling, see something from John Dahl.
