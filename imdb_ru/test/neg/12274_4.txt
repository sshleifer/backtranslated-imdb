I expected a lot more from this movie than what I actually got. The acting was just awful for everyone, and the story was far from impressive. It took me a lot of something, which I didn’t even watch, because it was so nervous. An example of an action is when Paxton's character, Vann, is upset by a South Vietnamese colonel because he throws out a piece of sand from a “sand card”. It was impossible to understand what he felt, and his actions were robotic. Worse, I have no idea how I should relate to Bath. He is clearly represented as the main character, but as soon as he gets to Vietnam, he begins an affair with a Vietnamese English teacher. The only thing that was in the film is that it was not particularly boring. I give him 4 stars out of 10.
