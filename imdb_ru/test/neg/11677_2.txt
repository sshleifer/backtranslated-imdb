It would be pretty easy to make this movie funny: a call girl was shot in the head by a North Korean spy, but she survived. The bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her crave for knowledge as well as sex. Unbeknownst to her, she is leaving shooting with George Bush Jr.'s cloned finger in her purse, a key that can unlock the ability to use nuclear weapons. Just call it a romp, and at least a few people will appear in the theater. I'm not sure how many people went to watch this four-year film when it was opened in New York in April of this year, but I sincerely hope that not many. It sounds like a light and playful kick of a kick, but he has an art-house claim and he is really incredibly boring. Many of Pinkâ€™s films in the past have been successful in their artistic aspirations, but the aspirations of this film simply depress the time that passes between the sex scenes. And then the sex scenes are not even good! I have seen some rather outrageous things in dirty Japanese films. I have never seen this country produce something with sex so boring. Spice channel more creative. The only decent thing in this film is the body of the lead actress, Amy Kuroda. Otherwise it is pure torture.
