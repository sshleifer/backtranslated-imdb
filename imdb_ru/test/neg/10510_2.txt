I really do not know where to start. Just imagine a movie that is so bad in every way, from acting to props and history, that it makes you angry. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and that says a lot because I have seen some bad ones. when I watched this movie, I knew it was a sword strike, but I thought he had kung fu and vampires, a combination that I thought could not fail. Until I put it in my DVD player. How Ron Hall managed to spoil something as cool as vampires and martial arts, I can't do it. first acting skills I did not expect much from the very beginning, because it is an action movie and an action movie, but the game here is so bad that I could not help worrying about it. expressions and vocal tones were completely out of place, there was absolutely no emotion in almost the entire film, and when it was so funny, it seemed to me that I was watching Mad TV. Master Kao, who should never have been born first. In general, I have seen the best way to play primary school games. Then there is the action. not even up to par with what has been done in the action movie recently. but still the action was not completely failed, as Ron Hall really seems to possess some martial arts skills. but even his skill is eclipsed by the nonsense that he does, for example, by the part of the film where he begins to rotate, and then the camera switches. I almost ripped the pillow in half. and the fight scene, where his prison buddy fights vampires, waving his arms. WOW.OR How about that part of the prison where Derek suddenly knows magic and can sing preforms that make tap water holy water. and as for the props. pistols like Walmart toys, teeth stolen from Halloween costumes, and words cannot describe how bad computer graphics are. I could spend hours talking about everything that happened to this movie, and believe me that this is just the tip of the iceberg. it's only getting 2, because it made me laugh. although I laughed at how bad the film was made, laughter is laughter. I would say stay out of the killer vampire if you donâ€™t want to laugh at a horrible movie or plan to be tortured for a long time and want to practice
