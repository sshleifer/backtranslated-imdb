Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) leads a group of people to the mountain to help find their missing daughter (Erica Durance). What they do not know is that she was killed by sasquatch (Taras Kostiuk), and he is still there ... waiting for them. <br /> <br /> It was late at night when I inserted it into my DVD player. I seriously would like to go back in time and stop me. Most people will tell you that movies such as House of the Dead or S.I.C.K: Serial Insain Clown Killers will be movies you would never see. Wrong. It will be. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of shit, but this is the only shit that haunted me. I wish I had never watched it! The game is actually not so bad. It's just writing, directing, tempo and all that! I'm actually a fan of Sasquatch movies. But not this one. <br /> <br /> Please listen to my warning. Do not watch it!
