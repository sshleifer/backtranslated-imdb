You do not need to spend a lot of time watching this movie for a television movie or a pilot series or something else to understand what is in stock. Incredibly bad music debuts from the start. Seriously, if this isn't the worst topic I've ever heard, I certainly can't remember that. While acting talent is available here, from Jeff Bridges to Karl Betz, Vera Miles and Sala Mineo, the script is terrible, and the story is contrived, filled with tasteless stereotypes and Ken Kesey's obvious robbery. Why does Hollywood always have to tell the tales of the sixties, as if all the so-called hippies were of the same type as idiots? It is a pity that such an interesting epoch in our exceptionally conformist social experience is usually depicted as rubbish, so the least offensive of the genre is now considered fairly reliable, when almost none of this comes even close to how it was business The best I've seen so far is a memoir called “Looking back” from a guy named Becker, but who else have you heard about him? Nobody in Hollywood, that's for sure. They are too busy pushing like this moan of a film to worry about reality.
