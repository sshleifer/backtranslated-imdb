The success of Anna Kokkinos with "Head On" now begins to look as if it depends entirely on the script, and Alex Dimitriades is an excellent performance. The extent to which this latest “Book of Revelation” is derived, pretentious and completely non-original (with the exception of Tristan Milani’s fine cinematography) seems to confirm this. <br /> <br /> Alas, there were already quite a few Australian films devoted to such topics, some of which were condemned for “sexism” (and / or obvious sex scenes) in the 1970s and 1980s and beyond, and perhaps they should look again at this piece of fluff. Of course, creating all of this in the world of ballet and slowing it all down (and in his choreography, like the experimental number of the Dutch ballet of the 1960s) really offers Great Art if you haven't traveled a lot - and only if you have never moved further Theory of Art 101. <br /> <br /> Add to the claim, the terrifying arched dialogue (“you will do as we order ...”), and the whole Shebang falls on its well-funded face. Then there are the "sexy" bits: straight from Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Considering Colin Friels' pleasant but truncated performance - how about a real urban primal thriller? <br /> <br /> All in All, with the “Book of Revelation,” the feminist project was postponed for another decade — and through voluntary and deeply imitative (male writers such as Henry Miller, William Burrows, and even Bukowski) some kind of collective in Melbourne, Oz, suffering from a form of educational and ideological amnesia! No revelations await us here.
