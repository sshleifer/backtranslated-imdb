I loved the magnificent Greek landscapes, but the story was even more difficult for the film to follow. I can’t imagine how someone watching a movie can have any power over him if he hasn’t read the book, and then, like me, they will probably wonder why the Australian Allison turned into French Anna , and many other seemingly meaningless changes to the story. The riddles in the book seemed to have been cut down or omitted in the film. I saw it when it first came out, and I had the same problems with it since I read the book several times. I recently watched it with my granddaughter (very smart at 20 years old and usually in the movie I like), which was mostly amazed at how young Michael Kane and Candice Bergen were in it, but otherwise could not imagine why will look it apart from the landscape.
