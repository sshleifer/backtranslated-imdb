Hey, what a great idea to open a movie - to show someone's home movie. Theater schools must be full of idiots! there they take drama lessons, hoping to become the next big thing in Hollywood, when all you have to do is send your home movie to the studio. Hey, I think I'll send a video about my wedding and call it “GREAT ROMANCE” EVER VISIT, or send a tape with my honeymoon and call it “THE BIGGEST SEX”. Oh, wait, I'm single and never been to a honeymoon trip! Don't worry, I'll send you a video about someone's wedding / honeymoon trip <br /> <br /> !!!!! SMART SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> You think that with this discovery, SHARK HUNTER can only improve, don't you? No matter how shocking this may seem, the home film is the best directorial, the best written and best played part of the film, alas, from here everything descends when the family goes to sea (actually a pool covered in mist) in three and dad are eaten by the CGI fin, and their son Spencer swears to get revenge on the fin. Cut to today, and the French are using an underwater exploration base for oil exploration. The only thing that ... And it is so obvious that you can not help but notice it - it is not removed under water !!! The director made no attempt to even use the unconvincing technique of shooting the scene through the aquarium. The underwater research base was blown up by a shark (maybe Greenpeace hired her?), Who killed everyone inside, and Spencer, now an adult, was hired to hunt down the shark that killed his parents and a group of French. What else is going on? I have no idea, because I decided to look at something else. <br /> <br /> No offense if someone from the cast and crew reads this, and I hope that Matt Codd will be a big fish in Hollywood. Do you think you know about Matt's sharks? You have not seen anything
