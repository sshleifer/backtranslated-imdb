Since my first video recorder, it has been a tradition for me to collect several incarnations of the old chestnut Charles Dickens, and I recorded it on tape and “Christmas Carroll” this year. Fortunately, when this video was launched on the Hallmark Channel at an ungodly hour at 3 in the morning, I did not have to edit the commercials. This was, however, only saving grace. <br /> <br /> The letter was painfully boring, with almost no tricky scenes to protect it from something more than a sneaky baby like Beverly Hills 90210. In this, a good man who was rejected for her celebrity seems the only a logical explanation for her becoming a talk show hostess like Scrooge. It wasted Dinu Manoff, who simply plays the bitch goddess with another bitch goddess Tory Spelling (which, by the way, had more layers of paint on her face than in some colonial houses), and Bill Shatner is probably one of the few funny things in this, otherwise dreary adaptation. <br /> <br /> Some of the best features are missed as ghost entrances Marla's aunt's entrance might have seemed incredibly funny in the hands of a decent writer, but this Christmas turkey apparently didn't have it. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling may be a wonderful person, but she has all the acting skills. dummy skill, and that in itself makes a bad show. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was nice to see Gary Coleman’s work again, but the script gives him nothing in common except to roll his eyes and give a truly lame dialogue. <br /> <br /> the most flagrant was the transformation of the Skrogedom into Tori “sweet and easy” as convincingly as the passionate conservative. Now, if someone wants to write the final tale of Scrooge about George Bush and Karl Rove, we can have a refreshing change from the usual bad Carol Clones. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you're a fan of Miss Spelling and / or 90210, this could be your cup of Christmas mood. I would prefer strong scotch and cold beer to wash it down myself. This one that I can just throw away before he is with me here for a long time. <br /> <br /> God save us all!
