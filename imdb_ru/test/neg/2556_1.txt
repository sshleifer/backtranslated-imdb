Like the previous commentator of this film, I also sometimes found myself in tears during this film. Sometimes you wonder how a movie appears with such terrifying horror. From the very first moment when our main character wakes up in his New York apartment from the dream of subway trains intersecting with galloping horses (which the Irish immigrant did not have), it becomes clear that we have problems. And it does not get much better. <br /> <br /> Back in Ireland in the 1950s, we find ourselves in a world where everyone speaks without intonation and exclusively on the subject of the Irish Civil War. Pupils go to school to learn about civil war. Drinkers in the pub share with each other in accordance with the devotion of civil war. Memories are held for those who died in the civil war. The city is divided between those who believe that we must remember and those who want to forget ... civil war. Every glance and conversation is permeated with meaning that goes back to civil war. <br /> <br /> On the video frame “Broken Harvest” it is clear that the film is a parable about the troubles in modern Ireland. The only parallel that strikes me is that one topic really dominates today's Dublin conversation: housing prices. If his intention is to offer some insight into Ireland’s obsession with its past, it fails miserably. It is amazing how few Irish films dealt with the Irish Civil War and its legacy. However, in order to tell us about the long-term consequences of such a traumatic event for the psyche of the nation, you will need a much thinner and smarter film than this one. <br /> <br /> For those American viewers who suggested the film resembles the atmosphere of Ireland in the 1950s: it is not. The 1950s, Ireland was a terrible, impoverished pit of sexual repression and suffering, from which young people fled their crowds. However, there was more than one topic of conversation.
