Low-budget "movies" like this give me hope as a novice screenwriter. In other words, if there are people who are willing to finance such nonsense as this, then surely much more than a glimmer of hope for a person like me who can really write stories. This film is right there, or should I say "there" with Edd Woods of the world. History, if you can call it that, and dialogue, not to mention a sofomor, is a parody of the genre itself. Someone had to squeeze a stake through this bitch while he was only on paper. It follows that, since the literature is largely murdered, this film must follow. In order to have a good or even just a decent film, you must have at least a decent piece of writing. The legendary Curt Siodmak comes to mind. They used a lot of his stories for low-budget films even then, but today they are still perceived as good, serious entertainment, that is, Donavan's Brain. The actors of this “job” should seriously think about returning to work at their respective hamburger joints or shoe stores and forget about any future weak attempts to appear in front of the camera. Avoid this like the plague itself !!!
