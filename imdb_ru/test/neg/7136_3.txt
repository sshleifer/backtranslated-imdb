Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) goes to Tokyo to investigate the mysterious disappearance of her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and gets caught up in the same mysterious curse that killed so many people. Together with a group of others, she tries to solve the curse and end it forever. <br /> <br /> Grudge 2 rechecks everything from the first, and causes only a couple of panic attacks. The first Grudge was an ordinary film at best. The room was decent, but the game was wooden, and some scenes were really ridiculous. Grudge 2 is even more stupid and less scary than the original. In addition, Scary Movie 4 made it almost impossible to be serious about these films, and it was difficult for me to maintain equanimity in “scary scenes” that should cause more laughter than fear. The way Takashi Shimizu ruined his own franchise is inexplicable, but he managed to create a decent atmosphere. Unfortunately, he kept the film at a slow pace with a bunch of boring characters and disgusting scare tactics. Obviously, he made this film for money, and I am glad that he did not succeed. <br /> <br /> The script was pretty bad, mainly because it didn’t make sense, and they didn’t develop characters at all. In the film, there were three different stories, and each of them was somehow connected with the “insult”. Communications were weak, and a handful of people were killed without a real reason. They do not very well explain the rules of the curse, and as a result, it became a bloody ablution due to the fact that everyone was dying, although the PG-13 rating prevented things from becoming interesting, so even some death scenes were rather lame. The dialogue was weak, and none of the characters was cute or developed enough to truly care for him. <br /> <br /> The game was on a par with everyone else, and it was much worse than the first. Amber Tamblyn was annoyingly wooden. She moved across the screen very slowly, and all her emotions seemed fake. Sarah Michelle Gellar was fine, although she only had a cameo. Jennifer Beals showed the best performance, she had some good scenes and she was quite effective. Ariel Kebbel was fine, a little soft. The rest were either terrible, or simply too forgotten to be mentioned. Overall, The Grudge 2 was a disappointing sequel. A lot of things were missing and not worth watching. Rating 4/10
