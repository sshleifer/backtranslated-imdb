As a child, I never understood WHY someone would watch this very shitty show. It was pretty stupid, and I always wanted Sprydl and Jim-Jim to have some kind of fatal accident (it was annoying). <br /> <br /> Now, almost 40 years later, I have a new attitude to the cartoon. Although I still think it was complete nonsense, this only applies to the American version of the show. This is because I read a book about anime and found that the shows we watched when they grew up were completely different from those that were originally shown in Japan. You see, the idiots responsible for spreading the show thought it was too cruel, so they cut it out of the episodes. This is bad enough, but what they did was incredible - they actually split the episodes into pieces and glued them together to create a show that did NOT look like the originals! For example, one episode may consist of parts of episodes 3, 6, 18 and 27! As a result, I really don't know if the original show was really bad â€” it could be brilliant. But who can say, considering all that we have to observe, is an Americanized mess !?
