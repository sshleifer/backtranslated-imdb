When I heard that the film was supposed to be released, and I was very curious about the topic it was about. But when I saw it, it was the biggest hoax in my life. Technically speaking, the sound is bad, you can say about the men's dialogues that were remade in the studio and that are poorly achieved in the final mix. Secondly, the photograph is mediocre, in some parts of the film soldiers are shown with night-vision goggles, and the way the filmmaker achieves that the “dark night” covers everything as if they were on a real military base with lights, there is no mention of moonlight , my God! Thirdly, but not least, most of the actions are really bad, it is completely implausible in the role of the spouse of one of the soldiers, her performance is rather bad. <br /> <br /> Great disappointment, disgrace to the jury who decided to send this film to represent Colombia at the Oscars.
