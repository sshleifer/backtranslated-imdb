A very bad movie, with very few good moments or qualities. <br /> <br /> It starts with the pregnant Linda Blair, who runs through the corridors to escape from monsters or people with pitchforks. I can't say for sure. She jumps through the window and wakes up, and we see that she is very pregnant. The extent of her pregnancy varies greatly throughout the film. <br /> <br /> She and the annoying and possibly backward little boy, who, I thought, was her son, goes to an abandoned hotel on the island. Italian horror filmmakers find the most annoying boys in their films! David Hasselhoff and his German virgin girlfriend are already on the island (you know, as they say, the Germans love Hasselhoff ...). He takes pictures, and she translates an esoteric German book about witches, I think. <br /> <br /> An elderly couple who bought him also went to the island, a real estate agent and a woman I thought was their daughter. Obviously, she was an architect, and Linda Blair and the boy are the children of an older couple. I think they all went to the island together, but in reality it seemed that Linda and the boy were separated from the rest (they were probably removed separately). <br /> <br /> The hotel seems neat, of course, from the exterior, but it did not lead to much effect. An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak constantly appears in front of the boy and sometimes sings something in German, which he eventually writes on his tape recorder, Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> People begin to kill, either in a dream or sucked into hell or something like that. Some of these bloody scenes are fine, but not enough to recommend a movie. Although the copy I was looking at said that it was not cut on the lid of the box, the death of one character whose veins explode really seemed to have been cut. Most of the scene shows pictures of the reaction of another character, since we ourselves do not see anything. The most terrible scene - the one in which a person or demon with a really dirty mouth wound rapes someone. He looked particularly nasty. There is a funny and terribly bad scene in which Linda Blair is obsessed. I would like a horror film to film her, they would do something original with her role and allow her to leave the Exorcist behind them (except for the annual horror agreements). <br /> <br /> In a strange, mostly Italian, tradition to proclaim oneself the continuation of something that it has nothing to do, it is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2. That is, it is supposedly a continuation of Casa 3 - Ghosthouse, La (1988) is not (this is also a better film than this). La Casa 1 and two were The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - again not related to Witchery and La Casa 3 (and much better than those). There is also Casa 5, La (1990) AKA House 5, which seems to be a continuation of the fake La Casa series and the series House: House (1986), House II: Second Story (1987), The Horror Show. (1989) AKA House III and House IV (1992). How's the horror show? In fact, this is not the case; he claimed to continue, so he demanded that the real recording of the series be renumbered in order to cause less (or more?) Confusion. Strange as it may seem, Horrible Show is also AKA's House of Horrors, and La Casa 5 is also AKA's House of Horrors. Do you still have a headache?
