If this film were just terribly poor, everything would be fine, the problem is that many take it seriously. In short, a few points: <br /> <br /> - There is no history, no focus, no guidance, and all the questions posed cannot be answered. In general, the film is extremely boring and boring (I have been to African countries torn by war several times, and it was very painful for me to look at local sufferings and hopelessness, but it still does not make sense). <br /> <br /> - The questions raised are pure manipulation, and the truth is that these are not questions, but statements. <br /> <br /> - I’m not a filmmaker, but what’s the point of putting, for example, the issue of arms smuggling, if the only item presented to the audience is a statement from a local reporter? The director did not even bother to show us, at least, the sequence in which he would wait near the airport, trying to make out the heavy trucks leaving the territory immediately after the plane landed. <br /> <br /> - Fish history takes less than 5 minutes and is supported only by a sequence in which the director makes a documentary film shown during a local conference. Did this guy ever work? <br /> <br /> - Absolute poverty always manifests itself in endless sequences, but what's the point? You can go almost anywhere in Africa with a hand-held camera and, unfortunately, shoot the same images. Where is the big news? <br /> <br /> Shooting prostitutes who watch and cry over the images of their murdered friend and fellow prostitutes is worth the worst emotional manipulations that can be seen these days on trash and on real television. <br /> <br /> - The parallel between the famine that devastates the country with more than two million starving people and the export of fish is absolutely meaningless, dishonest and makes no sense except to manipulate the audience in typical anti-globalization and anti-Western feelings. <br /> <br /> In France, an interesting discussion took place after the academician published a very detailed commentary on the film, which led many journalists working in Africa for decades to learn some details a little more. It turns out that: <br /> <br /> - Fish waste drying in the sun and collected by some local residents is not intended to be consumed by people, but collected for export for good enough money to feed animals. I think I'm not the only one who got the impression that the director suggested the exact opposite. <br /> <br /> - The smuggling of weapons is a reality (but again, where is the main news ??), but not in this way, this film explains the problem. If empty planes landing in Mwanza are actually involved in smuggling, they actually unload their cargo elsewhere in Africa and then go to Mwanza to pick up the fish so as not to make the return flight empty (this means that they really land in Mwanza ...). <br /> <br /> People eat fish locally, contrary to what the film offers (about 40-60% of what is pulled out of the lake), and thousands of people earn their living. Good for them! This is a private business of this kind, which one day will lead African countries out of poverty, and not because of Western moans and endless foreign aid. <br /> <br /> I can not say how shocked, I see the success of this film!
