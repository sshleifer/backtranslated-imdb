There are only two reasons why I watch this show ... I already spent time on previous episodes and Col Tigh. For all supposed fiction fans who love the new BSG, let me rest! Go read some classic sci-fi novels of real great people, or watch some landmark films and TV shows from days gone by, and you'll see what hacks these BSG authors. Their only trick is “who is the fifth cylinder”. Bad writing and really, really no point in character development. If Adam resigns or tries to come to power or starts crying again or discovers his inner father, he should have been again ... ahhhh! And Roslyn as an annoying character who was ever put on a ship. Remove the gateway with it. I would not care if it took another six months before they completed. These imitators of the writers were without cunning in the first season. If you do not know this, you simply do not know how to write.
