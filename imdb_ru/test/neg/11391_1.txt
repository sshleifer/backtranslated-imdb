This is a terrible adaptation of the French film Ma Vie en Rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). The only scenario that I can imagine is that someone (Sinise? Bates? Butler?! What did they think!?!) titles of writing - or talent! - to his name) to translate topics for an American audience - which they both agreed on - is stupid, stupid, stupid. Then she enlisted the signature of other friends, and they did it as friends - of course, not on the merits of this pathetic fictional “everything except the kitchen” scenario. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of French cinema, but Ma Vie en Rose is a subtle, thoughtful and thought-provoking approach to solving sensitive cultural problems. I would like it to become more widespread among English-speaking viewers - and if this means that Americans are redoing, then so be it. But the fluff! a bit of respect for the questions and intelligence of the viewer - and the best guide for actors who, it seemed, could not decide whether they were working for Tennessee Williams or Jerry Lewis!
