Altioclar's populist approach is evident in all its names, from worst to best. He does not care (or has no idea) about art, all he cares about is to make people think that they enjoyed watching his films. The problem is that the efforts are too obvious, and since the events unfold with all senseless exaggeration that detracts from them, the efforts fail. <br /> <br /> In this “Turkish” film (who knows where the original was or where the originals were made, as it seemed to me extremely Hollywood), Altioclar is trying to be something like Tarantino. (Mr. Tarantino, if you are reading this, please watch the film for the best comedy in your life!) For this he does not use subtle movements, all he does is use extreme things and it becomes unbearably absurd and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Levent Uzumdzhu, as a forensic guy with cow-licked hair, is just jolly. I hope to meet him in person and ask how he himself relates to this film. Because I really found the role offensive to him. Demetar Evgar, feeling her genitals, is also out of place and didn’t do anything except to make it look fake. Another specifically idiotic aspect of this film was the 100% wrong tempo setting. When things need to be filmed slowly, the scenes suddenly flow. In other cases, you want to sleep, watching a slow mockery. <br /> <br /> If Altioclar is so much in love with a lame Hollywood appearance, he should instead use Michael Siksarrou as his own name. Even such a move will not be so funny as what he did in this film. First, he must learn not to imitate directors whose levels he will never reach, then realize that he is not in Hollywood, and then take private lessons from Zeki Demirkubuz or Rekh Erdem about how to put the flow of ideas into the plot. This useless movie cannot be saved even by these, but perhaps it can make films for future viewing by taking the following steps. <br /> <br /> By the way, I have seen some notorious failures, such as Propaganda and Otostop, and I still cannot say that this film was the worst in Turkey.
