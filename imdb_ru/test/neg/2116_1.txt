I think this movie can be called a redirected rage movie. <br /> <br /> Joe and Bob's characters were relics of the Second World War generation, who did not quite understand that their children opposed the war, took drugs and listened to rock and roll. But I think that their real fury was that America began its long fall from the heights on which the war left it. <br /> <br /> Joe himself is a low-profile Archie Bunker who speaks all things that made him angry, live his life of quiet despair, until he teamed up with Compton, the guy who wants revenge for the hippie who killed his daughter . <br /> <br /> Honestly, most of the film looks stupid, the characters are worse than one-dimensional, they are ridiculous. Peter Boyle was capable of the best.
