OK, so she doesn't have a caller number. When you are stalked, you get it! And no mobile phone? When you are persecuted, you WILL GET ONE if you are one of the few working full-time parents who are the head of the family that does not yet have one. This mom gets a big zero in the parent department. Therefore, her mother is in the hospital, and she decides that shopping will help her. Just a dumb movie. Glad I have a Tivo and FF button on the remote. And with a minimum of 10 lines, I just can't say so much about such a bad movie. I think I can ask why she continues to open packages, that she has no idea who they are. The son really didn't add anything to the film either. The police were big zeros too. Now get to the nearest Verizon and get a bloody cell phone. @@
