Great actors, good shooting, a potentially interesting plot and what should have been a good dialogue. In this film, nothing more good. Perhaps the writer or director thought they could make a thought-provoking film out of annoying characters as deep as a cup of coffee. <br /> <br /> Within 10 minutes I did not like the picture of Kim, written by Carolyn Feeney, that it distracted me. While Kim should not be a sympathetic character, I'm not sure that I should have committed physical violence against her. The first (of many) weird things that happen is that Wes (David Strathairn) moves from “I miss $ 50” to “She stole $ 50” in about 3 seconds. It was unbelievable, since she (Kim) never had access to his wallet, nor was she the main pickpocket - there was simply no reasonable reason to suspect her. Most people have lost / lost money and believe that ... we lost it. The same goes for Kim later. All very unrealistic behavior in what should be (I think) a look at real people. Kim's character, at least, suffered from bipolar disorder. Wes had huge problems with inadequacy, Nancy was just boring, and Matt was delirious (especially in music). I actually turned it off about 2/3 of the way. However, to write a valid comment, I forced myself to turn it on again in the hope that something would come down in this film. No, sorry, it was still bad. Make a point to skip this.
