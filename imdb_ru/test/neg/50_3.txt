My parents made a lot of horror movies when I was a kid. We loved to watch them, even when they were bad, they made for some pleasure. It was one of these films, it was difficult to watch, since I only saw it once in my childhood, but I donâ€™t want to search for anything, so I can take a deeper look. In this story the legend of the old horror actor dies. I think I remember that he behaved like an excessive Vincent Price, not being pretty and stylish. He commits murder and dies, but what is it? Is the movie already over? No, because some children for some reason, grab the body and prepare for a fun night when they are killed by ham from behind the grave. I remember that the killings were not special after the first couple, and I remember that this film was rather disappointing. He seemed to have a good premise, but he simply could not deliver the goods, as he needed more steep kills, and this super horror actor had to add a bit to his repertoire.
