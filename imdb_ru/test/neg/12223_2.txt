Ten steps are basically a good enough prerequisite for a terrible short plan, but the execution is just awful. The dialogue is terrible, and acting is so often seen in Irish short films. Really very unpleasantly bad. The girl must go down the 10 steps of the cellar to replace the blown fuse. She calls her father, who entertains her boss at dinner. The mother, the “actress” with very dubious acting abilities, answers the call and tells her not to call in a loud abusive voice, as dad “is trying to impress his boss.” The actress who plays the boss's wife very successfully imitates the poor acting role of the mother when she tells them that their house is being pursued. The rest of the film consists of a father who persuades his daughter to go down the stairs by phone. The ten steps use standard methods in camera movement, lighting, and music that can be expected in a below-average horror movie. Poor.
