Most people have the luxury of introducing the name of the film and learning about the film before watching it, but, unfortunately, I just never was one of those people. I would not even read this synopsis for fear of spoilers, but there are two sides to it, because if you ignore such warnings and even give the film a chance after it fails in theaters, you enter at your own risk. and you can just end up with a bad taste in your mouth, and this is exactly what I feel for this stupid film. Honestly, the only thing that is good in Shakalaka-Crap-Crap is some of the songs (and seriously excluding the title track). Even Kangana Reno’s ever-promising talent (Metro, Gangster, Woh Lamhe) is seriously wasted here when she plays Ruhi, a woman who has attracted the attention of both main male characters played by Bobby Deol (who plays AJ without a music producer) and Upen Patel (who plays Reggie, the novice artist who crosses the path of AJ). Selina Dzheitli provides the right amount of OOMPH needed for the socialite that Reggie threw (which she helped to gain access to the recording industry). This is not like a mix or movie that should include Anupam Kher, right? Well, you're wrong, because he's in the role of Reggie's father (another lost talent). <br /> <br /> The film could not have been so bad if he had not interrupted the script of Deola’s character. The moral message was too preaching (revenge had a deadly dark side), and the ending was too bloated to ask yourself why you got into such a stupid movie from the very beginning. Truly, this is the embodiment of shit.
