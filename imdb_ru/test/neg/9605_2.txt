I usually don’t spend my time writing comments for such junk, which I forget almost as soon as I see it, but since I only saw this film yesterday on one of the Showcast Comcast channels (I think 346), I decided to make an exception. <br /> <br /> Besides the fact that I liked to watch Carol Alt, I can’t give any reasonable reasons why I watched this movie to the end. I am always surprised that pretty women are ready to star in such horrible films as this, but I suppose she thought this film would lead to something better. I hope she was right for her sake. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is too typical exuberant laughter, or just a piece of garbage, depending on your point of view. Although there are some decent moments of action in this film, they are not very well connected with the story, such as it is. <br /> <br /> In the production, as I recall, Carol Alt was put down by a housewife who believes that her husband, a police officer, is cheating on her. There was also something about the fact that their child died in an accident, and she accused him of it, but before this storyline went somewhere, she shot him dead. <br /> <br /> On the same fateful night, a wounded stranger comes to her door and she seeks it, and almost immediately her house is under siege by government puppets and mercenaries, intending to seize a stranger who seems to have almost superhuman combat skills. <br /> <br /> This same type of material has brought decent entertainment many times, primarily in Matt Damon’s “The Bourne Identity”, and could have done it this time, but this particular film was undermined due to the low production value and lousy script. <br /> <br /> This film really falls apart at the end, when the mysterious stranger turns out to be a cyborg (!), Whom was programmed to become a police officer, and after finding out that Carol Alt killed her husband, he tries to kill her! Up to this point, the film has not been particularly good, but the final does destroy it, trying to turn a modest action movie into a comedian Terminator / Robocop. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the violence in the film was a bit excessive at the end, with a mad cyborg knocking the eyes of poor Carol Alt, before he finally bit the dust. What was the point? However, what's the point in this film? It held my attention and entertained me for about an hour, until the very end, when it reminded me that I was not watching a first-class film. However, it was not even a second-rate film. <br /> <br /> The final scenes seem to hint at a sequel, which, I think, never happened, although I have not carefully checked the Network for this. Needless to say, I'm in no hurry to watch the continuation of this film.
