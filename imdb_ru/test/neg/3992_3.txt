Just as Lamberto Bava was his father’s poor-looking appearance, Mario (who was in any case an extremely overrated director), Michel Soavi is a poor-quality director in model Dario Argento. The “Church” has at least one thing to recommend it — an incredibly detailed artistic direction — but absolutely nothing else. The film is verbose, filled with one-dimensional characters and almost put me to sleep a few times. There is a fine line between “art” and “pretentious crap,” and although the “Church” is not completely useless, you had better look at something else. <br /> <br /> 3/10
