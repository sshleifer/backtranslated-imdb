Wasted is just a waste of time. MTV is releasing specifically for television films at the moment. My friend recommended it and I rented it, it goes without saying that I will no longer receive recommendations from her anytime soon. This film shows a roller coaster of drug use. The problem is that you really do not care about any characters because of the lack of loyalty and their own discipline. In short, this film is tired of watching, from the horrible camera angles to the quality of dialogue and pace. The “digital” format is trying to implement realism, but it distracts attention. If you want to get the real realm of drug use, see Requiem for a Dream.
