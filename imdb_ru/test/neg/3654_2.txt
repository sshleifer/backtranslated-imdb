This film resembles a student project on him that wants to make a project “Blair the Witches” in accordance with the theme of the saw. But this is not successful. Cinematography is bad, and acting is even more so. Characters, in my opinion, do not look trustworthy at all. Editing a movie doesn't really work as intended. There are many bad effects that I suppose are put in there to try to add a terrible effect. But for me it just causes a feeling of indifference. <br /> <br /> I would stay away from this movie unless you are a dedicated movie fan who likes to watch “different” and indie horror movies. However, I believe that this film is not worth watching, for the average person. You will not get pleasure from the bad effects and feelings from the video camera, which this film gives the audience.
