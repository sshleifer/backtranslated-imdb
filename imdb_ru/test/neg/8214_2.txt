My poor cinematographer (and the president of the Open Cinema Society) attacked us last week. He could not deny the mad gleam in his eyes when he pulled him out of a brown paper bag and announced that he had prepared for us: “The Most Dangerous Game,” shot with a budget of about $ 2.95. <br /> Of course, in 1962, $ 2.95 went much further, but still ... <br /> <br /> In any case, there must be something in this film that can not like it. It is replete with serious technical errors (my favorite was the “recurring musket,” which shot twice in two minutes without reloading). A hero is a person who stands nearby while his wounded friend fights with a minion and is killed. <br /> <br /> Learn more? OK. The plot is a ruin, without continuity. The film spends five minutes on the “star of a special guest,” which is the physical embodiment of the madness and paranoia of the villain, but never shows it again. The hero chokes with an unconscious hero, but does not mention this when he wakes up and meets his master for the first time. The silent servant girl was seized, put on a stand ... and then the film (and the hero who put her in this predicament) seemed to “forget” about her. <br /> <br /> Learn more? Well, kits are cheap, and special effects are cheaper (cosmetics is an exception to this). Most of the plot has a monotonous voice-over offscreen voice of the voice-over hero, which has a less dramatic effect than a recital at Denny's restaurant. Most of the dialogue is ridiculous and unnatural, as if it was translated from Japanese. (“I demand our conversation to be enjoyable !!!”) And the color values ​​tended to change drastically from frame to frame, as if cheap film stock and problematic lighting equipment were in order of the day. (Please note - this last case may have been the cause of poor print, not the film crew). <br /> <br /> But here and there were a few pleasant moments. The makeup effect was strikingly good. Unlike the rest of the film, the actors looked interesting, especially the dumb servant girl and the countess. And, despite everything, there was a certain eerie atmosphere, very unpleasant and disturbing. <br /> <br /> What was the idea of ​​this film? I thought a little and understood that director / screenwriter Pat Boyette was mainly trying to film the story of the old horror comics "EU". This explains the unnatural dialogue, fragmentary character development (in the comic, physiognomy = character even more than in the film), the internal logic of this story (“horrible stories” with all its might included the opposite) shock "ended and was not great for psychological realism ), excessive dependence on the narrative voice (which is contained in the inscriptions above the panels) and interesting makeup effects that imitated the terrible pictures that old EU artists did so well. <br /> In fact, I would be ready posp That when Boyette saw his lead man during the casting, he immediately saw that this guy was so close to being the equivalent of lanky, flabby figures and sagging in faces that artists like Johnny Craig and Jack Davis, painted like real people who could exist in the real world and still exist, he used costumes and lighting to highlight the animated aspect of visual effects, and turned everyone into living EU comic characters. (See the empty beauty of the leading lady, the strong bone features of the graph, strange bronze skin and sharp chin, platinum on a high bony black minion, etc.) <br /> <br /> This explains the film’s flaws. Boyett knew how to "create" things, but he did not know how to handle the three dimensions and moving bodies. Boyett was able to tell a terrible story in the framework of comics, but the nuances of cinema and live actors eluded him. Of course, he would not be the first person with this problem - look at what Joel Schumacher did with Batman. But he didn’t have a big budget to hide behind. <br /> <br /> In any case, I believe that Boyette went away from a train wreck and probably spent less time thinking of “Dungeon of Harrow” than people who publish on the billboards of this film. He did, of course, in the dim boundaries of what he intended to do, and you should respect him for it ... even if you don’t care about the Harrow.
