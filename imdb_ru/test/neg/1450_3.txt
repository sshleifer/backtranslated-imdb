Pros: Mary Bolend is delightful as always (I never get tired of her rudeness of the top, especially in "Women" and "Pride and Prejudice"). RESTROOM. Fields' short role is fun, although the famous pool table scene stretches a bit because it seems to last ten minutes. The crazy antics of the movie, typical of that period, are great. In addition, a bow to the wonderfully grounded hostess of the hotel Alison Skipworth; I would really like to see her more (she reminds me of Marie Dressler, another person worthy of high praise). <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Gracie Allen. An annoying, unfunny presence, the annoyance of which was unmatched before Adam Sandler appeared. This almost falsetto nasal pain with a touch of unknown origin is aging in its very first scene. This is the first of the Burns-Allen films that I have seen, and although I (as a big fan of classic comedy) try to play at least one movie with every major comedy star, this is definitely one team that Iâ€™ll not be called to. Her terms and interpretation of the material are completely rejected. Insanely ordinary talent. <br /> <br /> Essence: a good comedy, but jokes are few. And only an hour later you can expect that this is not a Hollywood comedy. Recommended only for fans and fans of Fields who want to see all their work.
