The fifth collaboration of Marlene Dietrich and director Josef von Sternberg, BLONDE VENUS is a film that looks great during the game, but does not attract the viewer. Dietrich's intricate story line, torn between two men, becoming a mammoth star of a cabaret and fighting for custody of her child, is mixed and often felt as pieces of three separate films, half baked together. Dietrich unwisely plays a rather passive, reactive role for most of the film, and her character remains aloof from the audience, while Herbert Marshall is unconvincing as her hot-tempered husband, and Cary Grant is largely wasted as a courteous admirer who throws himself in from the picture. There are several intriguing scenery in the film (The Hot Voodoo Room is the high point), which is impressively surreal for this era in Hollywood, although it doesnâ€™t do anything in such a boring, incoherent film.
