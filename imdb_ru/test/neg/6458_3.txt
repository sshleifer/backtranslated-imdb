The role of Buddy Ackerman for Kevin Spacey is not tight. He played a version of this character many times in other, better films. This is successful because it gives his game a certain resonance, without which Buddy would be as flat and incomplete as all the other characters in this meaningless little farce. The script leaves little time for the plot or character development, like a porn movie in its rush, to get to the "good things." The difference is that here the “good stuff” is not people pleasing each other, but hurting, making it suitable for watching young adults. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is nothing wrong with a porn movie, if you want to watch people having sex, and I think there is nothing wrong with Shark Swimming, if you want to watch people undergoing physical emotional and psychological torture. But if you need a sharp satire, interesting characters or something else that even tries to attract more than your basic hobbies, you should probably look for something else.
