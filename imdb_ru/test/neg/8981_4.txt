This is largely due to the plot of the CAPTAINS. Although he is quite an adult, this is partly the story of a rich guy who, as a member of the crew aboard a cargo ship, receives Shanghai status and becomes a person in the process. Moran with the title - a boyish young woman, also brought up on a ship belonging to her father. When the cargo is on fire, she and the crew are evacuated to our boyfriendâ€™s ship. However, the captain is thinking about smuggling, and his intentions are not honest about Moran. It is inevitable - our boyfriend falls in love with the brave Moran, and she - with him. In the end, evil is suppressed, and lovers unite. Some interesting dialogues indicate that Moran does not belong to either a man or a "woman." (Sappho's nod here). Dorothy Dalton, respectively, sexless, like Moran, and not too attractive. Valentino succeeds in a romantic, combat role. His sexual physique and physique are shown to benefit, and the role is quite masculine. He is very attractive. This is not a very good movie, but it passes time. What it truly demonstrates is the beauty and sexuality of Valentino.
