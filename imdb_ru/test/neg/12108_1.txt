If you want a truly traumatic experience, then this horrible film (if you can call it that) is for you. The film is worse than the postman, Sizzle Beach USA, Batman and Robin, Kazaam, fair play ... well, you understand my point. This film, shot by the French television sensation Patrick Sebastien (Jerry Springer from IQ 25), can truly be considered the worst movie ever made. I really hope that Troma or someone in America will spread it so that u.s.a can experience the French stench.
