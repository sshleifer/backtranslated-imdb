The story of the creation of Underdog and adventures fighting Simon Bar Sinister in the format of live action. First we took Showshine from the street and brought it to the research laboratory where Simon Bar Sinister works. He resists when the Sinister tries to inject a chemical into him, and an accident happens, he gets superpowers, and the lab explodes the wound of the Sinister. On the street, the shoe shines faces Riff Ruff, another dog, and he is picked up by Jim Belushi, who was a security guard in the lab. Belushi's son discovers that Shoe has all these abilities, and eventually the Purge becomes Disadvantaged, which will again fight Ominous. <br /> <br /> As soon as you decide that there is a real dog under the dog, you sort of limit yourself to whether the film is going to work or not. For me, half the film works, and half does not. The part that doesn’t do is where you see the Shoe Shine, the dog, like a dog with its owner. Some of the reporters are funny, but they just drag out when we meet Sweet Polly and her mistress, and we go through all the typical things, let's see what you can do. It is a deadly 20 or 25 minutes and effectively kills the movie. It is terribly boring and it seems that it takes an eternity, which, given the film, say, 75 minutes without credits, is something you don’t want to do. <br /> <br /> Good roles are everything. with Simon Bar Sinister (Peter Dinklage - blast) and all that Underdog comes into action. Someone somehow somewhere managed to find a way to be clumsily loyal to the spirit of the cartoon and update it. Of course, I could be wrong, since the middle part is so boring, but I think not, since I look forward to catching the end of it again by cable. <br /> <br /> In general, this is probably as terrible as some people say, but if you can wait for a cable where you can stumble upon good details, this is a good cartoon to adapt the film. (But waiting for the cable is true)
