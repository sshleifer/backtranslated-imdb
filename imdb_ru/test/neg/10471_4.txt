.... well, small town, ignorant sheriff? Check it out. Sheriff's hot daughter? Check it out? Bad guy hot sheriff's daughter, who does the sheriff hate? Check it out. Corporate developer who eagerly invests profits in people? Check it out. Ordinary developers accidentally revealed the primitive monster, and then were forced to hide it? Check it out. Do natives warn of mass death and destruction if things do not return as they were? Check it out. Amateur CGI special effects that could have been created with a Commodore 64 computer? Check it out. Seriously, almost all the clichés of your typical Sci-Fi Original film were combined into the classic film “so bad, it's good.” There is only one scientist / expert who is trying to share his knowledge; There is a paleontologist with three students who were ambushed by my “Bone Eater” quite early in the film, but they are mostly extras in the film. And I can honestly say that I predicted almost all of this; down to who survived and who did not (although I must say that about an hour ago I had the wrong time for the death of one of the characters). I swear I could make this movie myself if they gave me all the characters. Despite all this, the film is fun to watch, if only for some other reason than playing MST3K with friends. If you are set up for some kind of thoughtless fun, this is a great movie to watch, so I give this film a surprisingly respectable four, despite the fact that in all respects it deserves a much lower rating. But on the other hand, you would not tune in to the movie SciFi Original, if you were looking for a movie with a real plot, meaningful characters or good special effects, wouldn’t it?
