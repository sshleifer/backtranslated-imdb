What can I say about this movie, it is truly one of the worst gay movies ever released from the UK. I can only imagine how people like Diana Quick and Georgina Hale needed money. What a story is so erratic that you quickly lose interest. It should be based on real events. Well, all I can say about this is that this is an insult to real characters. The DVD is currently coming out in the UK. It is available in either a split-screen format, which should make it even worse than the full-screen version I watch. Gay movies can be much better than this, and we deserve more.
