Thanks to stupid horror films such as Troll and the indescribably cruel cult favorite Troll 2, it has become almost impossible to accept films with kobolds, gnomes and various other types of little green hobgoblins these days. Only recently I was watching a 70s film for television "Do not be afraid of the dark", which basically is a rather scary and serious film about homemade little goblin monsters, and yet I could not help thinking back about laughing potato-headed creatures dressed in trash bags that were going crazy in Troll 2. The same thing happened to me now. No matter how hard I tried to enter “Inhabited” with a clear turn of mind, I unknowingly continued to compare the supposedly creepy and formidable garden fairies with poorly fashioned Nilbog goblins! However, even without all the prejudices, “Inhabited” is a distantly entertaining, though not memorable, horror film right in the video. This is a gentle, soft and politically correct plastics of family drama and mythology of Northern Europe. The annoying and murderous little creatures in this film are not ordinary goblins; they are “Huldre”: evil little Norwegian demons who live underground and try to expel happy families from their homes, working on the youngest children. It overcomes the Russell family when they move into their dilapidated dream home in a remote small town. The cherubic blond daughter of MILF actress Megan Gallagher begins to behave strangely when she walks in a pretty playhouse in the backyard of the garden. She claims that her friends are fairies, and although the sinister master also warns of strange events in the past, Jean's parents simply think that the girl has problems adapting to her new neighborhood. When she continues to rattle about the fairies, they make an appointment with a famous psychologist, Dr. Werner, while Huldre slowly emerges from their botanical shelter. Not much special to mention here. The pace is acceptable, and the attempts to create tension are pretty pretty. You understand that this is a terrible film for the whole family, so no bloody murder episodes are shown graphically here. Heck, even the pet's corpse remains behind the scenes. This is the hundredth pointless horror film in which Malcolm McDowell pops up, and he almost always portrays an unreliable, greedy and selfish authority.
