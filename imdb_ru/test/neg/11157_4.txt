While watching “The End of Days,” I had a feeling that the filmmakers might have tried to make this film unique to the usual Hollywood action movie. Of course, they failed, but you have to give them credit for trying. This time, Peter Hymes tried to make a filmmaker, instead of just shooting another flat film. He tried to bring the atmosphere to the film by putting out the light and adding tons of blood. This method may work if it is used correctly (see “Se7en”), but here it’s just a cheap trick to try and scare us. Hyams is a worthy action director, and he offers no more than the simplest shooting and battle scenes, with the exception of the dull one, the sub-paragraph f / x and the end of the “battle”. As a photographer, Hyams demonstrates real abilities, demonstrating some good frames and movement, but this is nothing short of solid work. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Andrew Marlowe - the greatest enemy of the film. Partially, the script actually shows the creation of a good religious thriller, and sometimes it even shows some quasi-intellectual thought (the scene of temptation between Arnold and Gabriel Byrne), but these small advantages are choked with a river of negatives. The usual dialogue / characters, holes in the plot and convenient plot points that simply point to all the characters in the right direction are just some of the standard black Hollywood black holes that Marlowe’s script falls into. The shadow of a good movie could disappear very quickly. <br /> <br /> The film is, surprisingly, a good cast. Arnold, who still has an attitude that exceeds his whole life, is trying to play in depression, on the verge of a policeman with no more than average results. Stick to becoming an invincible hero, Arnie, this is what you are good at. Gabriel Byrne is the strength of the ensemble, bringing a pleasant atmosphere of cynicism to the role of Satan. In the villainous role, ripe for replay, Byrne restrains himself, and this adds a bit more threat to the character. Kevin Pollack, as usual, is able to bring at least a few giggles to the film, but he coped better. Also look for the starry little role from Rod Steiger. <br /> <br /> Hyams looked like he was trying to separate it from the faceless mass of Hollywood action movies. He was going in the right direction, but he had no script or originality to take him there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
