In a career of ups and downs with all kinds of films, this is Altman’s one attempt at science fiction, and this clearly shows that this is not his strong point. <br /> <br /> The film is almost incomprehensible. This seems like a disastrous combination of the pretentiousness of an experimental theater and a big studio trying to jump on the bandwagon after Star Wars (not that this film is generally modeled after that, but you can imagine that the studio signed in the hope of a completely different Paul Newman ). The story does not exist, the characters remain for us throughout the journey. <br /> <br /> Altman has a pack of dogs that feed on dead bodies throughout the entire film, clearly seeking to do something like DOT. But since the film is so poorly thought out, starting with the lack of a plot, in fact, he doesn’t say anything at all. <br /> <br /> The created product is confused, the photo is blurred by fuzzy blur around the edges and the score is terrible. However, Quintet has one redemption function. Not only is the film clearly shot in the snow and on ice, but it's also cold in the interiors. You see the actors breathing in every scene. You really feel cold.
