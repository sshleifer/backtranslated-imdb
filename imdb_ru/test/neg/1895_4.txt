Considering that the film was beautifully shot and acted fairly well, the script was boring. walk and we have not seen anything before. Never in this film did I feel that these people were really in danger. There is no noticeable climax and very standard resolution. I think that films of this type are overdone and should be rested. After all, have ALL of you on the planet seen the Schindler's List?
