Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor come together in this potential comedy that nightclub owners are squeezed by organized crime. Eddie Murphy wrote and directed this disgusting ego trip, and therefore no one to blame himself but himself. This is really a bad film, so devoid of energy and humor, that it serves only as an example of Murphy’s contempt for his audience. It would have been great to keep on beating this film, but I will show him more mercy than his audience showed, and I’ll stop now.
