I enjoyed watching Lost from the very beginning and experienced some bad actors in badly written episodes, because when Lost is good, it's really good! But in this episode, in which the death of Mr. Ehos is featured, there were so many protracted scenes with protracted close-ups of a bad game that I found myself pressing the fast-forward button. This episode stood out so far that it was the worst. In fact, the differences in the quality of Lost were so controversial that I often wonder how many writers they use. <br /> <br /> I will continue to watch, but I hope that everything will get better, and I hope that I will no longer secretly wish for the actors subpar in the series to die.
