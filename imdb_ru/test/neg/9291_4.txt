The barricade finds Alice Fei without songs as a refugee trying to escape from China and without a passport. She has a lot of trouble, I will not say what, and even the American extraterritoriality will not help her. <br /> <br /> I mention this because of one of the grievances experienced by the Chinese, including thugs who are attacking the American mission in this story, deeply rooted in the Chinese depth, was that it was the American citizens who committed crimes brought before the American courts created by our consulates. However, we were not the only country doing this. <br /> <br /> In any case, the story begins with it on the train to Shanghai, which is trying to use a cunning Russian accent. The accent intrigued Warner Baxter, who is quite embellished. <br /> <br /> The gangsters, however, interrupt their journey, and they both seek refuge in the American consulate chaired by Charles Winninger. He is the best in the film, and I just want to get the best story, because I liked his character. He is a widower and a proud member of the consular service, appointed in 1900 by William McKinley. He asked for a transfer in ten years, and this is the last thing that he heard about. As aide to Assistant Secretary of State Jonathan Hale, he is a real forgotten person. <br /> <br /> Baxter does everything right in the role that someone like Clark Gable would have done in a dream in MGM. Heroism would be more natural for Gable than for Baxter, since the mission is barricaded and protected from thugs. <br /> <br /> Alice Faye could really sing one number. Why Alice’s song was cut out, God and Zanuk know only. One thing I’m still trying to figure out is when the residents of the mission find the last refuge in the basement with the hatch, and who is left upstairs to pull the rug through the basement door? <br /> <br /> The barricade had the potential to be much better than it was. But careless editing and loss of faith in the project made the 20th Century Fox project release unfulfilled. Looking at the Barricade is like eating a badly cooked meal.
