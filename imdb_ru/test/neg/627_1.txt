Beautiful, stereotypical, good-looking cast, the plot fixes on a wide and tangled arc leading you along a series of garden paths (without accompanying fairies), before slamming down to the end, in which you feel that you are leaving - is empty. > If you need a film that culminates or ends in a satisfactory blow, it will be a disappointment. Despite the conceptually revealing sexuality of the main character, I felt that he was androgynous, he lacked a clear male personality, rather as he lacked a pure French persona. Despite the fact that he deliberately lies naked (or rather, sat naked) at the end of the film, the viewer is as ignorant as the character is about the motivations of this little thing called the plot. Probably the stereotypical English-language point of view, at least if you take the side of the film.
