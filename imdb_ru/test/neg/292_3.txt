Recall: Simon heads a small team of special agents, which specializes in finding and returning missing people, no matter what. Their last mission is about their friend's granddaughter. It seems that she was caught in the network of a particularly cruel criminal, and everyone who was looking for her was missing. But now librarians are engaged in this business. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is a pure B-action through. The key phrase for this is unlimited offer. The stock of ammunition is unlimited, they do not need to recharge even once. There are no bad guys, so the heroes have something to shoot at. There are an unlimited number of breasts, many of which are naked, in a vain (and, as always, unsuccessful) attempt to distract from the holes in the plot. And there is an unlimited amount of bad play (almost like in this, how about this, Erica Eleniak's performance glitters), and actors who don't seem to care more than salary (and why should they, when nobody else seems to?). <br /> <br /> And, as in most B-militants, the number of bad shootouts is unlimited. But it looks like a ridiculously bad look. I think I saw more realistic gunfights when I played cowboy in my childhood. <br /> <br /> But again, I didn’t expect much either, how could I from an action movie called “Librarians”? And it does provide what one would expect. 90 minutes of more or less bad action with some scenes for connecting the points between them. But I'm not sure if I can call it entertainment, it didn’t hold my interest for a very long time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
