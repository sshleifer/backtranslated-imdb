“Go Fish” has earned Rose Troach a fair or erroneous reputation as a filmmaker with a big promise. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to understand how she could create a film consisting of stereotypes associated with lower comedians. The whole movie seems empty. I struggled with this all the way. <br /> <br /> This is supposed to be a view of the nineties human sexuality. Well, not much more here to be learned than from "In and Out." By now, most of us really know that there are men who are sexually attracted to women, and there are men who are sexually attracted to men, and there are even men who are sexually attracted by both sexes. <br /> <br /> Rarely was this revelation depicted on a screen with such a small amount of mind and style. <br /> <br /> Sorry.
