There were very few good moments in this movie. Only a couple of characters were worked out and not very well. There were quite large openings for the passage of the truck. The pace crawled like an old man. There were many moments in which the film never returned, like Coco's undressing. What happened to her? What about sister Garcy? Is she better now? What about Leroy? We absolutely did not know anything about him. What about an electronic pianist? How about a rich girl who has an abortion? What happened to her? It was an interesting story. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not a very good movie, and I recommend another musical that was in this movie. LET'S MAKE TIME TIME AGAIN !!!!!!!
