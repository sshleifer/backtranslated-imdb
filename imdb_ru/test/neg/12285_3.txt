1st viewed August 7, 2004 - 3 out of 10 (directed by Deer-Brett Thompson). A silly, kids-focused film about three children captured in their favorite cartoon with their parents' experiment. The scenario left much to be desired in this Hanna-Barbara, like the meanness of some Saturday morning "live action with people in dinosaur costumes that children show" when some stupid cavemen were sticking around. Nothing much to admire, and nothing to say. I'm just amazed that I found it in the Blockbuster video store as bad as it was, and the way stores get rid of old VHS films. I guess they couldn't even sell it, so it went back to the rental desk.
