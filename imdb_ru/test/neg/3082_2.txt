A “commitment”, as in the case when Heather Graham was OBLIGED to save her husband / marriage, and then OBLIGED to be sent to the psychiatric ward if it is impossible to do this: what a clever, clever use of words. <br /> <br /> One of these meaningless philosophical films about desires, in which narration is a series of very wise observations that border on poetry (club poetry of the 90s, better known as “poetry cheat-chic”). Oh, that's for sure ... Written / directed (or "heard") by a woman (Liza Kruger, whoever the hell you are), this is a meaningless, sluggish film about the road, full of New Spiritual nonsense and characters that are intended in order to be interesting, but just noticed or just boring. The Latin Americans in this film, as part of the poor urban minority, are generally glorified in all their obsessively mystical primitivism as a “spiritually superior” people, which is the “highlight” of the political correctness of this film. <br /> <br /> The whole story is lifeless and ceases to be so only when random good actors appear (Kay Place, Baker, Wilson). On the other hand, we have Casey Affleck, who is one of the best examples of why nepotism is on a par with first-degree murder as a crime. I have rarely seen a more apathetic "actor"; a skinny, ugly jerk who sleepily sneaks in his lines, as if he says them in a half-asleep quasi-dream, plus this weak voice, one of the weakest male voices that I have heard in my life. (He must have gone to the Toby Maguire Acting School in Lethargy.) To play this idiot in ANYTHING, he says a lot about ANY film, i. E. ANY director or producer. Consequently, Lisa Kruger is a worthless waste of space. We also have that jerk who played a major role in The Werewolf with a fake MST3K; I think his name is Goran Vishnich, but I'm not sure. Check out his ridiculous accent and dumb speech.
