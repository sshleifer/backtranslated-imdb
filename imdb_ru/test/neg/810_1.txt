If I could give this film a negative rating, I would. Humor is the most cruel I've ever seen in a movie. Terrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered terribly through no fault of their own. There are 2 plots, none of which support half of the film. Where is the "depth" that others see in this film? That no good deed goes unpunished? What can only heartless succeed? The film starts well, but black and white is very capricious and well done. The acting is very good, and the witch convincingly makes cruel humor even more terrifying. If you think that the 3 Stooges are too good for each other, if watching the beheading of an abduction victim with a Bowie knife is a real slap in the thigh, if you thought Schindler's List was funny, then this movie is for you.
