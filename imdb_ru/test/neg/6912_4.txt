When I watched this movie, I returned home from work in the afternoon. I love horror movies and saw some really stupid ones, but it takes the cake. The plot presented to the audience at the beginning of the film seems a bit intriguing, but as the movie progresses, the script makes a wrong turn with terrible cliches and a bad presentation, which in turn makes the film completely boring and boring. I do not want to continue to criticize the script and plot, because believe me, this is not the worst part. I have to say that overall the game was not terrible for novice actors, and I was impressed with Taylor Locke, it was one of his first films. The worst part of the movie was the special effects. They smelled low-budget and really spoiled the audience entertainment, even if he was remotely interested in the plot. I recommend that you watch this movie in order to understand the full power of a bad script and plot. Only then can you truly appreciate good writers and directors.
