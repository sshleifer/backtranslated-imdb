Very strange. But it should be so. This director is his own person. There are even tensions, if Polanski, Bergman and Kafka, at least in episode No. 6, peep one. What made all this so strange and reminiscent of the three artists listed above was that he went everywhere, you never knew where he was going, and you could have ended anywhere, and finally, when this was all over, you could go on. The ending is hardly the final, no one can tell you what these two characters will do even in the next frame. About the director should say one more thing: it is not surprising that Kubrick found him charming. In this episode, many Eyes Wide Shut, one way or another, in the direct approach to the character, realistic elements of fantasy of both. Placing the camera with Kubrick without any drastic effects is much more vague and hasty, and not fussy. However, back to the beginning, but this guy has something to say, and he says them well. However, for some reason there is not a single scene that I would like to see again. But he definitely didn't feel detached in the least, watching him once. But I continued to feel that three or four other ghosts of the director were moving through the parade, eroding everything. The caveat is that it was only episode six: the other nine may give me completely different options. But since this episode revolved around peeping, the absolute area of ​​the film, I will say this, it did not go through any of the usual routes, it definitely went its own way, carrying the baggage of many good directors.
