Jonathan Demme is such a character-oriented director that, seeing how he pulls Brian De Palma along (that is, imitating Hitchcock), it becomes almost predictable when he cannot find much uncertainty in this cool secret. Working on the script of David Shabera, from Murray T. Bloom's novel, Demme tries to hook a chord somewhere between the dramas of paranoia by Alan J. Pakul and thrillers featuring Hitchcock. Roy Shader plays the role of a retired secret agent mourning the murder of his wife, who is now busy evading the bad guys who are going to kill him. It works immediately, but the script is full of fragile threads, and any excitement dies quickly. At Niagara Falls there is a visually impressive climax, but Demme gets little from his line-up and even less from this deception of history. ** from ****
