Although I am usually a big fan of John Turturro's work as an actor and director, ILLUMINATA is a big disappointment. Although there are several charming moments in the film, he generally fails. Worst of all, the movie is confusing. Where is the movie? Italy or Italian troupe in New York? Why make a historical film, if it does not convey the situation? If you want to see a well-made, inspiring historical film, including about the theater, watch Tim Robbinsâ€™s CRADLE WILL ROCK movie. This film has a lot of advantages, including John Turturro's excellent performance.
