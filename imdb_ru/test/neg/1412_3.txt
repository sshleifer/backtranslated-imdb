I went to watch this movie mainly because it looked good in trailers. Robin Williams and Barry Levinson should be equal to greatness. Instead, it just continues the bad Williams film series lately. What is wrong with the film? More similar to what's right: the band’s team copes well with Robin, and, as usual, Christopher Walken is fantastic. However, this film was simply not good. I really recommend watching it if you want to see what it would look like if John Stewart ran for president and won. To say that he won is not a spoiler, since he was in the trailer. The idea and the idea is really funny, but that's all. Most of Robin's jokes are simply recreated from his old comedic episodes, and there are very few high-profile laughing moments, and most are just stupid. Like most comedies that suck, all the funny pieces fit into the trailer. There are no surprises, but come on! Some films are read as a novel by Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn! People expected it to be Robin’s return to greatness. Instead, it’s more like Flubber.
