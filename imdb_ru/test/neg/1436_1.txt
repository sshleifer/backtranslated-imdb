Sometimes it seems to me that modern horror films rely on human torture to scare people. If so, then horror films have a sad future. Dee Snyder is trying to make you feel scared and frightened, this film does just that, but not in a good way. Now there are moments in the film when there is a chance that Snyder will save this film from falling into the pit, but let's be frank, this film did not fall into the pit, he was already in the pit, and Sinder tried to escape from this. When you finish watching this movie, you remain sick, depressed, dirty and insane. I have a feeling that was the intention of this film. What is lower than dirt?
