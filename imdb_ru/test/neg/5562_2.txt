Yes, absolutely horrible, And it comes from someone who loves bad movies - but there is a limit. I like all kinds of horror / suspense films, and I have seen some great works by European directors. Unfortunately, Broceliande is not among those wonderful works of film. The work of the camera is worse than amateur. Not fashionable, shaky camerawork MTV "the operator needs Ritalin", which is used by many directors to hide the lack of talent. This is just a bad frame composition and terrible image composition. An action is a farce when it is not quite two-dimensional. Dialogues are unnatural and unnatural - even more so than your usual mediocre horror / suspense movie, plunging into pseudo-studies. I think that what put me off most was the horrendous fighting scenes at the end of the film. It was bad to the point of being ridiculous. I saw what a small budget can do, and it can work wonders. It was just a bad movie. Very very sad.
