I know that Jesse Franco is responsible for a variety of films, and I mostly star in his horror films, as lousy as they are at times. I guess it was a painful curiosity that attracted me to this, and I wasn't even curious enough to finish it. Maybe by the end it was better, but if you are not in lesbian sex scenes (of which there are many), then you may want to go. So, what exactly can you say about the film, which depicts a woman who pisses in a bowl on the kitchen table (standing)? Just ignore what is used later, you probably do not want to know. If this sounds intriguing to you, then this is your problem, but again you might like this movie. I myself, not a prude, I saw a lot of disgusting films on my day, but at least they were made well and it isnâ€™t. Sometimes too much, just too much. Bleah.
