There are bad films, films that are terrible, and then there are a tiny, rare set of films that are so terribly bad that even after they only watch them once, sheer horror makes it impossible to forget them even decades later. This is exactly such a film, and it is hard to believe that the original film in this series was actually quite good. Let's see, George Kennedy, the mechanic of the original “tough guy” with a cigar, was somehow upgraded to an airline captain, and after Concord went through a rocket attack (don't ask), he resorts to tricks like firing from a cockpit window , despite (supposedly) flying on Mach 2, all the while making wild evasion maneuvers with high G that could rip the wings from any real airliner, not to mention the influence of passengers! But the worst part of the film, at least dedicated to plane lovers like me, is that this atrocity "took off" in one of the coolest, sexy, and technologically wonderful aircraft that have ever flown. Concord (or simply "Concord", as its pilots say) deserves much better, this abomination is equivalent to taking a high-class beauty, such as Audrey Hepburn, and putting it in the continuation of Porky. Fortunately, the release of a very fun "Plane!" The following year, the entire “Airport” franchise was deservedly stopped, as anyone, even contemplating the fifth series, would have been laughing to the death of studios and movie fans. <br /> <br /> 1/10
