A smart marketer - he, Jess Franco, naturally also profited from the huge temporary success of psychedelic spy movies, such as, ultimately, Mario Bava's sensational film “Danger: Diabolik!”. Franco is the ideal person to make such a film, as he could freely embed in as many dirty, kitsch landscapes and absurdly grotesque plot twists as he wanted. And he partially understood this very well, as the “Girl from Rio” revolves around an organization that hates people, headed by a funky-clad lesbian who is going to turn all people into obedient slaves! Unfortunately (for them, at least), the devilish plans are in conflict with the daily activities of the boss of the syndicate, who is being feared, played by George Sanders. All the necessary ingredients are well represented, but this is an amazingly weak and unsatisfactory adventure film. The plot is rich in imagination, but, apparently, only on paper, since the action is rather tame. The film is also very colorful ... but not too bright and especially shocking was the complete absence of vicious sex. Of course, there is a little nudity, but too little by the usual standards of Franco. All the characters hurt in the head, so I least expected (or hoped) more perverted shades or mad themes. Franco obviously had a bigger budget, as usual, and I must say that he spends that money well on more convincing sets and talented actors. In particular, veteran actor George Sanders (“Village of the Damned”, “Psychomania”) is one of the best players who have ever appeared in the play Franco. It is a pity that even he can not save "The Girl from Rio" from a huge disappointment. A legendary cinematographer from Europe, like Jesse Franco, could and should have done more with this concept. Shame, shame, shame ...
