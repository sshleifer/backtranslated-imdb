There is no heart or soul in this film; This is an attempt to snatch a cult film from the remnants of other, better directors, mainly David Lynch and Tim Burton. Rifkin seems to think that if he is overloaded with a kind of rotten visual style and fills the street with dirt and debris, he makes a statement. But this is not a statement about anything - except for the director's shrill scream: “YOU LOOK AT ME! I AM THE ARTIST, LLP ". But he doesn’t have an artist’s imagination, just a good memory of things that worked — for example, actors in a trap — about other directors. All of this would be almost acceptable if this film were not a boring, boring routine that had to be lived through.
