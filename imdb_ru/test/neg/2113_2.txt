If I were British, I would be confused by this image of incompetence. Is the Special Branch Defense Agent unable to protect himself from a sick, unarmed and unprepared attacker? The Ministry of the Interior sends one “scientific adviser” to investigate the possible biological hazard of the fourth level, and this “adviser” does not even have to wear a mask and gloves? Completely unprotected London police working side by side with technicians in full biological hazard suits? Does the “counselor” and his bodyguard carry the lair of a sociopath experimenting on humans without any support? Puh-leeze! The question arises whether the manufacturers could not afford to hire any technical consultants or for some strange reason, they consciously decided to portray the principals as hopelessly incompetent. Even my wife, who has no experience in medicine or law enforcement, rolled her eyes in disbelief. After the first episode, I was discouraged; Now that I've seen two episodes, I give up.
