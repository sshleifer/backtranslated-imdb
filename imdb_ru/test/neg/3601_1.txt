This is the worst waste of time I have ever experienced. even close to the first. It is difficult to understand the storyline - the plot was weak - at best. It all looked like three stories trying to somehow tie them together and make a film. There were a few good lines here and there - and the message attempt was wonderful, but they traveled from Houston through New York to get to Dallas. It was really hard to tell how long the present time was. The film lasted just over an hour, and we felt that we sat and watched the movie all day. Maeve points to honesty, but the son does not need to do all the things that Kronk felt he should have done. Do yourself a favor - see Kuzko again.
