I went to see this movie in the cinema because of its potentially interesting plot, good cast, director who previously starred in the highly acclaimed film “Once Were Warriors”, and I like films about noir, shot in Los Angeles Forties and fifties . I would say that it’s pretty easy to please me in this category of films; I appreciate the classics of the genre, but I will sit and enjoy decently, if derivative efforts also. However, I found this film completely unbearable. <br /> <br /> Despite the good situation in which the story can be put, no one seems to be doing or saying something remotely interesting or interesting for just two hours plus this sad mess, Good actors are wasted in endless dialogue scenes, from banal to embarrassing. The narrative is sluggish and unbearable, and none of the events it depicts are processed well enough to do anything other than the death of the viewer. No drama, no atmosphere, no tension, absolutely no entertainment value, and in the end I just didn’t care what happened because I didn’t believe in anything in the film. <br /> <br /> L.A. It was confidential a year later, and regardless of whether one version of the story is more believable, the latest film deserves all the praises for its superiority in each department. Mulholland Falls, by contrast, fails in every department, a fact made all the more tragic because of the amount of talent involved. If they ever show it on a plane, I’ll leave anyway.
