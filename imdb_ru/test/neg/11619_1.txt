I can not believe that this terrible film was shot by the same people as Lepa Sela Lepo Gore. Watch this and skip this. The plot is confused and the characters are mostly two-dimensional stereotypes. I suspect the editor went on vacation in the middle of the film, because fast, intermittent cuts are starting to appear, which only confuse the questions, and do not explain them. The ending also does not make sense. <br /> <br /> This is a predominantly propaganda film shot so that the Serbs can feel sorry for themselves and vilify America for the 1999 NATO bombings. our allies during the Second World War claim that the whole world is unjust against them, and completely ignore everything said and done by Slobodan Milosevic, for example, the war with three neighboring countries. They seem to intend to make a political film, but show only a few seconds of Milosevic on the TV screen without sound. The nationalist agenda clearly replaced any consideration of art that did not take place with Leppe Sela. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I recommended this film to a teacher when he played at the Seattle International Film Festival last week. He also referred to bad editing and a tangled plot, and I had to apologize for bad advice. You have been warned.
