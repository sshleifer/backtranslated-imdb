I have to say, I found this film very disappointing. Yes, I know that Maltin gave him 3 1/2, and others very much appreciate it. But, well, the operatic sequences were terrible. I understand that Jeannette MacDonald is an acquired taste. Yes, in the short episodes that I saw her with Nelson Eddy, she is extremely preferable to him. But by itself ... God, I do not like opera and despise the operetta, and it is basically unbearable. At some point I had to cover my ears. Gable is just fine, and Tracy is thrown away. The plot annoying in JM never tells Gable that she loves him and the opera, and why can't she do both? Instead, she silently (or not) suffers from the compromises she makes. The supporting cast is clearly memorable. In addition to the star three and Jack Holt (and, I believe, his mother), they are all just the background and forgotten. The EQ sequence is the only thing that saves the film. And just. Yes, it is quite spectacular and touching. But “oh, God is great,” seems very far-fetched. I immensely prefer "In old Chicago," when there are spectacles connected with old disasters. Save yourself from it.
