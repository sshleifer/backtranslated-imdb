I entered Blockbuster, thirsting to see the good old action movies about fashion. So I looked through the action section until this movie caught my attention because the cover was written in bold SANDRA BULLOCK. The action film with Sandra Bullock in a movie with an R rating !? HOORAY! Although I admit that I prefer it in a comedy, but if it is something like “Speed,” I was sold. Unfortunately, Sandra is not really in this film, her role is insignificant: “Panicked Girl” (she is fifth in the list of actors for Jebus's shaking!) Apparently, this was her first movie role (and after watching this movie decided that the same amount) Sandra is the only living person in this film, everyone else could be zombies in a horror film. This film deceived me by saying that Sandra was the main one. I fell in love with him, like Biff from Back to the Future, when Marty shouts “WHAT IS IT ... !!!” God, I wish I had watched it instead. <br /> <br /> Sandra is the only bright side of this film, every time she shoots for the camera, she seems to pick up the shock oars and shout “CLEAN!” to make this movie, but it’s even, no matter how tried hard More on Sandra later. <br /> <br /> The film is boring. Very boring. Think about the most boring moment in your life, and then imagine that you survived this moment for 110 minutes (for me this is a film). This film even somehow makes the boring effects of “Fight with a weapon” and “Bullet time” so boring that Elephant Tranquilizers are exposed to shame. And the idea of ​​this movie about Bullet Time is a close-up of AK in slow motion, which makes you laugh, as the caps jumping out of it represent every second of your life as it slowly ticks. And I knew that I was watching a bad movie, because I quickly suffered "THROUGH ACTION!" Plot? was the plot Music? Even by the standards of the 80s, this is bad, but at least this is the only thing that kept me from falling asleep. The acting? Sandra Bullock was good and. umm, move on. This is good, so how is this rating R? No, unless R stands for Ridicules-snooze-fest. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the cliche of the 80s, when the film opens with a bird's-eye view of the city (shakes guitar or power ballet) and ends with a gun, fight in a gloomy factory complete with steel aisles and various pipes . Both of which this film satisfies. At the very least, this film sets the era from which it was unnecessary, as Sandra’s hair screamed "1980s !!!!" And in the movies, the fists are really spinning when you watch how a killer stripper kills a nerd in the bathroom and puts his body in a box, to which you sadly answer: "This is probably the greatest action the poor guy ever received." Another moment Hammy - is the beginning, when some Secret Agent Dude surrounds a crowd of people, and, apparently, this film thinks that people jump into the air and fall to the ground after death. All that is needed for this scene is the dead song of Mario or maybe the sound effects of Contra, but Nintendo may have filed a lawsuit. <br /> <br /> And it’s very sad when the main character of this film breaks the other badges of the film BETTER. In front of the scene with a big weapon. Yes, the hero stands in the boxing ring (“Rocky”, anyone?), Dressed in leather fedora (not also “Indiana Jones”) with ominous searchlights behind him (Terminator 2 nd, before having T- 1000)) What is really REALLY sad is that people on Youtube or Dailymotion can shoot higher quality videos (no less with a crappy webcam) than this movie. I'm serious, most of the Rant videos recorded with a bad sound and blurry image are more interesting than this movie. I can’t even name the film by name, because its name brings back terrible memories of watching this cruel and unusual punishment (a flagrant violation of human rights!). The only bright spot in this dark bottomless abyss - Sandra's career began to be removed thanks to this film. But about Sandra. Why were you in such a nightmare? Salary is better worth it. The DVD also adorns you with the little story of Sandra as a film that tells how she is the only one of this film, and eventually she became a householder. This explains why this film uses her name as bait for unsuspecting moviegoers, Kraft, a small beast. <br /> <br /> I don’t have so much experience with bad movies, but I know BADLY when I see it. I could bounce back from Labyrinths and Monsters with the good old Bruce Willis comedy. But even Bruce could not cheer me up after this movie. I have not yet seen Ed Wood or Uwe Boll, but I think that now I am happy for them. Because I can't even understand the movie worse. "GAG". "The Executioner." ,,
