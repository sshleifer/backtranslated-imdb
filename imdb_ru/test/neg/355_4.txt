As a physicist, talking about black holes and cosmology makes my heart beat faster. However, I found this presentation too slow and not sufficiently rich for the interested amateur (who, most likely, will see it). If you have something more than curiosity, go to the library and look at a few books. You will find that they explain current scientific cosmology in much more detail, and at the same time give you more surprise than this film. Also, to set a record: Hawking is NOT considered to be “the greatest mind” or “the smartest person in the world”, as is commonly claimed even among user reviews here on IMDb Hawking himself commented that “this is rubbish. This is just a stir in the media. They needed someone to fill a role model for a disabled genius. At least I'm disabled. ” To be honest, he is probably a genius, but among the greatest scientists in history, people like Einstein, Newton, Gauss, and many others easily get even more appreciation. This is not to not respect Hawking, who is undoubtedly a great scientist, but not to not respect others who have done even more than he. If anything, watch a movie if you're really in science. But if not, I think you will be bored.
