I was very disappointed with this series. He had a lot of cool graphics, and that's all. The level of detail was minimal, and I always had the feeling that the audience was patronizing - there was a lot that seemed to me, “This is very cool, but we will not explain it in more detail because you still will not get it. Let's just show you some beautiful pictures to entertain you. “The host will reject interesting words such as“ sparticles ”and“ super symmetry ”without trying to explain what it was. We should have found it on Wikipedia. <br /> <br /> Moreover, I know a little about superstrings (for the nonprofessional), and I found that their explanations were confusing and could be much better. They could have chosen MUCH better examples to explain the concepts, but instead they used examples that were confusing and even more obscured the subject. <br / > <br /> Also, I was so sick of repetition. They could have easily combined I did the episode in one episode if they cut out all the repetitions. They must have shown the Quantum Café clips about 8 times. The owner repeated the same thing over and over again. I can't remember how many times he said: “The universe consists of tiny vibrating strings. ”As if they were trying to brainwash, forcing us to simply admit that“ superstrings are the best thing after sliced ​​bread. ”<br /> <br /> Finally, the show ended with an unpleasant feeling of“ competition ”between Fermilab and CERN clearly biased towards Fermilab. It should be an educational program about quantum physics, and not about whether the United States is better than Europe, or vice versa! I also felt that this was part of patronage - “The audience needs to see some kind of conflict in order to remain interested.” You are welcome. Give me a little more than that. <br /> <br /> In general, 2 thumbs down :-(
