This is a stupid movie. When I saw it at the cinema, more than half of the viewers left before it was half over. I stayed to the bitter end. To show resilience? I caught it again on television, and it was much funnier. So far, by no means a classic or even consistently cheerful, but the family has grown up with me. I still love Jessica Landi. If you have nothing to do and it's free on tv. You could do worse.
