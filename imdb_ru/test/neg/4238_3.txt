Maybe at one time this film was special. But five decades later, it seems strange, just another cinematic relic of the terrible 1950s. In this fluffy story, there are many stereotypes about the three gold prospectors who opened a store in a penthouse in Manhattan, trying to attract rich husbands. <br /> <br /> I am not against this petty topic. But the premise of the film is lame. And the performance is worse. This is a romantic comedy, but I laughed at her a bit. The plot of the story about an extremely short-sighted joke is the only smart element of the story. In general, the dialogue is as flat as the delivery. And the script structure is confusing. The plot continues to jump back and forth among the three ladies. As if the writer could not quite mix the role of the ensemble. As a result, the plot seems changeable. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Monroe was a good choice for her role. But Lauren Bacall was too old for the role she played. And Betty Grable, with her squeaky voice and terrible hairdo, was just annoying. <br /> <br /> Color cinema is common. But there were many shots using the projection of the rear screen, which contributed to the obsolescence of the image. The visual effects get worse from the costumes that smell of the cheesy "glamor" of the 1950s; they are just awful. The audience should endure a fashion show, a plot that reinforces how the director of the film was impressed by these dirty, joyful rags. <br /> <br /> And then this orchestra. In that, perhaps, is the worst discovery of a film in the history of cinema, in the first part of the film there is an orchestra playing some dark melody. At first it seemed to me that I was watching an introduction to the nearest sights. But no, this is actually part of the film. And the orchestra plays, and on and on. This has nothing to do with the story. What were they thinking about? <br /> <br /> I liked Marilyn Monroe with her hoarse voice as she made her way through the plot. But the film would be much better if they shot two other roles in the ensemble, shot this orchestra, enhanced the comedic dialogue and downplayed these gaudy, silly costumes.
