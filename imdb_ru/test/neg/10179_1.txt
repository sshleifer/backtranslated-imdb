Presumably, the film is about a magazine sending journalists to investigate UFO reports, one of which is more or less tolerant or agnostic throughout the case, and the other is an Australian, a seasoned skeptic who laughs at the stupidity of UFOs. It's all a scam, some sort of racket. On the grounds that this film is actually a hoax and a trap for the promulgation of Christian teachings and the Christian explanation of UFOs, which I heard about earlier. This is a special explanation, which in itself is not at all biblical, but was invented by some modern theologians who can fit everything and everyone into their mythology. Paranormal? It's real, just demonic, unless it happens in a Christian context, then, of course, it’s from God. Simply, if it is not from God, it is from the devil, stupid! So, I suppose, since Beethoven’s 9th symphony was not inspired by God, it had to be written under demonic influence. Or so the logic would lead to the absurd. <br /> <br /> We were told that since the Bible does not tell about life on other planets in the Universe, therefore, it does not exist (version of the error Ad Ignorantium) and that God created the Universe so vast, so great to show us your almighty power. I think of Karl Sagan’s remark that if God created such a huge Universe and was stuck in life only on Earth, it would be a huge waste of space. <br /> <br /> So what is a UFO? This is demonic activity, and they relate to a speedy Christian event, a break ... I mean Delight. Before the grief, true Christians will disappear from the face of the earth in a massive manner, which will lead to mass panic, confusion, car and aircraft crashes ... whatever. Therefore, Satan, knowing this, sends his demons to create the illusion of an alien spacecraft and alien abduction, which can then be used to explain this inexplicable event. All of Satan’s plan, which, of course, will keep people from looking at God or Jesus and fall on the lies of antichrist. <br /> <br /> This special explanation also symbolizes theological confusion, explaining one mystery to another, as opposed to the scientific method of explaining the unknown, the strange and the mysterious as much as possible, first known, if not known only. <br /> <br /> It's like jumping straight to an alien. abduction when the child went missing and went missing. I think that at first I will look at more mundane explanations, for example, that a child escaped, was lost or kidnapped for ransom or stolen by a predatory pedophile, before calling aliens, or supernatural, or Satan, or someone like that. <br /> This kind of deception or trap by fundamentalists is not new, as young people often lure to Free Rock concerts, which can start with something harmless, and then suddenly switch to open Christian music and then the sermon and the altar call. This kind of blatant deception, as you might think, would rather be a game of Satan. But maybe because the Christian faith will soon be fatal, these guys feel that something is going on, any deception, cunning or scare tactics are acceptable to try to keep the faith that faces serious opposition from both secularists, as well as competing beliefs, such as Islam, the fastest growing religion in the world, which could well replace Christianity, since Islam is much more cohesive and united and logically more stable than Christian fundamentalism m Although this should give little benefit to humanity, since it will replace one intolerable system of thinking with another. <br /> <br /> And of course, the film ends with more or less the option of Pascal’s betting. An atheist Australian is told, who is skeptical about everything. Well, if you are right that there is no afterlife, and death is nothing but rotting in a grave, do not worry ... but what if you are mistaken? <br /> <br /> Basically, statements implying that reality is going to disagree with nothing but an atheistic point of view or Christian fantasy are a false dilemma or a delusion of black and white. Even if atheists make mistakes, it does not necessarily make Christianity the right one by default, and if Christianity is full of holes in its theology, then materialist atheists are, therefore, true by default. <br /> <br /> For all of us know, Native American spirituality may turn out to be the best description of absolute reality, and we could all wish to have a little better attitude towards the Earth and its creations. <br /> <br /> This film must have the correct print on the box: Attention: contains religious propaganda and is not intended for informational or entertainment purposes.
