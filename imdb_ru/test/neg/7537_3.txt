Two teenagers in the north east of England are desperately trying to raise money and buy season tickets for their favorite football team. They experience a series of "comic misadventures," but in the end they come with a smile. <br /> <br /> The trailer for this film sells it as a comedy and includes most of its carefree moments. Nevertheless, the tone is becoming increasingly gloomy, and the end result is a depressing story, populated by familiar stereotypes. The two "heroes" have no problems with lies, deception and theft. Their opponents are a soulless teacher, a father’s pantomime villain, a psychotic skinhead, and a benevolent but incompetent social worker. Other female characters are a teenage drug addict, a pregnant schoolgirl and a battered wife who seems to smoke herself to death. There are no cute characters, and viewers can only feel pity or contempt. Local actors Tim Healy and Kevin Waitley both play against the font as villains, but the script and the direction of their characters are so one-dimensional that they have nothing more than the value of novelty. <br /> <br /> Chris Beatty and Greg MacLaine give good performances in two young leads. However, they are mistaken because they have the wrong accent. Anyone from the northeast, it is obvious that they are both from Sunderland / Durham, and yet we must believe that they are natives of Newcastle. Like Jordi himself, I can assure you that the accents are not the same. Take the phrase "Let the poor guy speak." We say: "Let pooa lad speek", and they say "piwer lad spiyk", with two completely different vowel sounds. This discrepancy creates a ridiculous double irony in the scene on the football field of Sunderland, where two guys are trying to disguise the accents of Newcastle, which they do not have, and "pretend" that they come from Sunderland, which they obviously do. In a tender comedy, this kind of criticism can be seen as picky. However, the dark tone of the film makes it clear that screenwriter / director Mark Herman is committed to harsh realism: it means that “close enough” is really far away. <br /> <br /> I was hoping for humor and optimism in this film. and instead found tired old clichés. Tyneside is not a gray wasteland, populated exclusively by losers, and, telling us about this, Herman should have known that he might be offended. It is interesting to compare the film with the "Little Voice" of the same director - also largely depressed and inhabited by one-dimensional characters, "Little Voice", at least, has a talented heroine and does not fall into poverty to the same extent. I heard that Belter took a seat next to Billy Elliot this year, but this film is a much more pleasant and life-affirming experience. <br /> <br /> By the way, I may be too old, but I lived on Tynside for 42 years, I never heard anyone outside of this film use the expression “Pure Belt”.
