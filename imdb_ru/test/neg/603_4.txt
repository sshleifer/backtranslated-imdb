I found that this movie, basically, POSit was low-budget, but this is not a problem. The problem is that the film is just lame. In fact, it does not make much sense. Yes, he explains why it happened, but this is not what I mean. there was simply no reason for that. the film also moved very slowly. the last ice age was faster than this one. Also, I think they are a bit overdone for the killings. This meant that they were too rough, but the killer seemed to simply spend too much time smashing his victim on the head or stabbing his victim. Maybe I'm petty, but I just didn’t like the movie. It all looked like a lower version of “When a Stranger Calls,” and perhaps that was the point. But what for me? When A Stranger kills 4/10 *
