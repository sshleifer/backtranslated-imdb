Stupid chatter, performed in an amazingly amateurish and inept way - or perhaps several, since the incredible lack of continuity, tone, realism, believability, uncertainty and much more is combined with Walter Pijon's attempts at beef to create curiosity of cinema, which can be compared with some other colossal Fritz Lang's failures. (I thought that the German ambassador actually played Lang, but apparently not â€” they could be twins.) If you cannot predict the end at a few time zones, you are not really alive. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to this DVD and was completely surprised and disappointed with such terrible shit (even with George Sanders and John Carradine - maybe I can wash my hair by watching Viagaio in Italy instead and in which time). <br /> <br /> Does anyone want a dvd to be used once? (Maybe a film will be made about making this terrible movie and how many talented people could be wasted.)
