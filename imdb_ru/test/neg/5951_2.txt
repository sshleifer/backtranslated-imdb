I fully agree that the reconstruction is killing something that would otherwise be a great show. I admit that I saw 1 or 2 episodes last season and it was not clear that all this was reproduced. But when I recently caught one episode, he suddenly jumped at me, and I immediately lost interest. Then I noticed a disclaimer at the beginning before the next episode. Has anyone watched the show close enough to tell me if they really made the "acting" and reproducing parts more artificial, or did I just not notice before? I usually feel pretty good at these things, but the recent episode was so obviously artificial that I almost stumbled. Now I am not interested in watching, and completely disappointed in it. It simply has no real value, if all of this is scripted and acted. And, at least in recent times, this seems VERY poorly written and effective. A comment above that says who cares if this is a reconstruction, I do. Without visual truth, this is just a bunch of "you know what happened, once, this guy." This information is best read in the book.
