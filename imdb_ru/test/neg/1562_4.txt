Plot: Four people hit the elevator. One of them is a business man, an annoying person who is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone and is a walking example of overloaded stress and hostility. Then there is his colleague, a woman who is much more pleasant in her character. The rebel teenager who just burst into the coke machine and with his presence drives the businessman crazy, and the rest of the cast is an elderly guy who just stole 100,000 drams ... <br /> <br /> all about they cope with their problem, over time and without any success in reaching the outside world, when the lights go out and how the cables start to break one by one .... <br /> <And yet, this is not too exciting. Characters stereotypes. The story is stupid and unlikely (how many things can go wrong in one elevator?). You donâ€™t really like characters, you just hate one of them. And all the plot twists do not contribute to excitement, they are just stupid excuses to fill the dialogue for a few more minutes, as the writers lack inspiration and ink in the feature film in the elevator. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that the "Phone Booth" will be better ...
