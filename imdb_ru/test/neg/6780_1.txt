I had high hopes for this film (not like the apocalypse was now or 8 1/2, but quite high), and when I saw it by cable, they were all broken. Starting with acting skills (poor, almost mediocre, terrific spending of good actors and talents) and the story itself: since when has a squad of 5 people go on patrol in the supposed "hot" zone ??? Before suicide ?? This is one big mistake that costs the film dearly. Very good actors play a very bad role, for example, Sean Penn, who recently repeated the annoying way of talking about “I am Sam”, and Michael J. Fox, which misses a good opportunity to beat Charlie Sheen in Platoon, playing just “average”. But the most annoying character was Diaz (played by John Leguizamo, another stupid waste of director's talent), he was a cheerful, frightened and insecure person, even more annoying than Jar Jar Binks (yes, you heard that), the sequences of battles are medium, the only thing that really stands out is the initial sequence, with Michael J. Fox trapped by his feet in the VC tunnel. De Palma has a weak job here, and if it weren't for films such as Scarface and The Untouchables (these are great films), I would call him a bluffing director: too much advertising, bad shooting. <br /> 3/10
