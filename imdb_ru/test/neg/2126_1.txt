What can go wrong with a film that has a group of Italians pretending to be Flordians, and some obscure lava-octopus-crustacean thing, like hellish caviar-devil-fish?!?! <br /> <br /> I tell you that things are not going right! <br /> <br /> This is a very good episode of MST3K, because it's pretty damn right on the ball, which is unmistakably done, considering that this film is part of a garbage with a lousy and boring plot. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for the MSTied version. 1/10 for the version without MSTied. <br /> <br />
