The Women (2008) from Diane English, unfortunately, such a waste of talent. With Annette Benning, Candace Bergen, Bette Midler, Cloris Lichman, who I like and like in everything I saw, and Meg Ryan, Jada Pinkett Smith, Debra Messing and Eva Mendez, who may not be my favorite actors, but good to see how a movie can be boring, predictable, embarrassing, sloppy and just plain bad? This was done by Diane Inglish, who is known as the author of the very successful television show Murphy Brown, and this is her first film for which she wrote the script. The film was a labor of love for the English, who for many years tried to bring it to life, and I respect that. I even found scenes with support players, Bergen, Licheman, Kerry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable cameos, funny, clever and enjoyable, but overall the film is a second-hand sex and big city that was released by a few months ago. I didn't find Sex and the City very good when I saw him, but next to The Women, he was just great. At least, “Sex and the City” saved us from a long and tasteless scene in the maternity ward of the hospital, where one of the heroes had a child, and her friends supported her. Poor Debra Messing, what did she do to deserve the nightmare she went through, and we, the audience with her? Such films as "Women" give the whole genre, chick clicks, notoriety. There is nothing bad in this genre, but why is it so difficult to create a really good comedy about female friendship and deprivation, marriage, motherhood and professional self-expression? These are all compelling and important topics that can be touched by any modern woman. Why make films with such lines, dialogues and situations so banal, predictable, not funny and offensive, that they will be forgotten as soon as the movie ends? <br /> <br /> After watching the new movie, I checked the original The Women from my local library, and I really enjoyed it. 70 years ago, this story was told much better, and my interest was unchanged. The old film had real star power.
