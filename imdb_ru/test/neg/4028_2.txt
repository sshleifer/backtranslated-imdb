This whole movie is so terrible that it's a complete mess. The story is so stupid that I can't believe that someone actually sat down and wrote about it and thought it would be a good movie! Acting is probably the worst b-movie ever made. Iâ€™ve seen a lot of science fiction bi films, and some of them are actually pretty good, but some of them, like Venus, should never have been done. <br /> <br /> Some directors think that just because they collected something and somehow got on the shelves of a movie store that they have achieved something is good, and people should watch them. . This is not always true, and it is definitely not the case with Venus. This film loses in all respects: a terrible game, a silly plot, very weak special effects, the ugliest costumes, unrealistic dialogues, bad leadership, etc. You can just say that it took only about $ 20 to create this film, and I can give it too much credit there! I urge you to stay away from this movie train wreck for your own good!
