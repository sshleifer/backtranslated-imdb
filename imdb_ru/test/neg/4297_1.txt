As a lover of flying and war films, it is ranked first on my list. This is historically completely inaccurate, and the actors sound and behave as if they had just left the school play. Acting, writing, directing, production standards and casting are all rubbish. The only salutary grace is some of the flying sequences. If the people they portrayed were fictional, I would rate them by 2, but if there is one thing that annoys me more than anything else in the movie, it pretends that this is a story and that the great people with whom they try to be, actually did it! Itâ€™s almost as if they were trying to write as many WW1 famous personalities as possible. There are a lot of great flying WW1 movies, and this is NOT one of them.
