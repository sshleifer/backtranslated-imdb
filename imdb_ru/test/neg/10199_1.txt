One of the worst movies I've ever seen! After watching, I'm leaving, like, what happened? I'm confused to this day, can anyone explain this film to me, please? both the quality of the game and the quality of the image are so bad that you think that you are watching someone’s school project made with a home video camera. First, I can’t believe that how some people can give 10 stars to this film. Because, this is an incredibly bad movie! This film is not scary at all! There are not even typical horror clichés either. The plot and the action of this film were terrible. This is not a fantasy, surrealist or horror, it is just a terribly bad Turkish film. And finally, there were a lot of unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters. When I watch “Gomed”, I fall into such a hopeless, sad for a young Turkish film director. Please do not make a "movie" like that!
