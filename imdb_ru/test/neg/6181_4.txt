So, I watched this film this year on Sundance, and I was extremely unimpressed. It took a good fifteen minutes of the footage, before any editing or line of dialogue appeared, and it took another 30 minutes before the scenario with a meaningless fist gave way to a working story that did not depend on Ryan Goslingâ€™s smile or the invented moralizer. However, after the first 45 minutes, the script has turned into a watch that is capable of looking, although not completely entertaining or thought-provoking. Highlights certainly include both Gosling and Morse as an actor, Gosling is an incipient star, and Morse is an extremely well-established actor with a good sense of diverse emotions. Like the testimony, after the show, I spanked a little about the film with some of my friends when David Morse walked right behind me - he looks like the nicest guy in the world, but he is strong 6'2 "and probably outweighs me by 50 pounds. I removed my foot from my mouth and quickly changed the subject.
