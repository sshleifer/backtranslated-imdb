It seems that the plot of this film has a lot of potential that is worth seeing. The game was flat and the story lacked depth. There was too much dependence on camera work, which had some high rates. I have to agree with other negative comments. I wish I had read them before buying the DVD. Perhaps the film is worth watching for free, and you are bored to tears. There could be a lot more plot development, with why there are homeless people in Moscow (that is, post-Soviet “capitalism”, rampant drug use (that is, an increase in heroin trafficking in Afghanistan), more reasons for the revival of Russian Orthodoxy after the fall of the USSR, archeologists themselves or even more in the fight against nihilism.
