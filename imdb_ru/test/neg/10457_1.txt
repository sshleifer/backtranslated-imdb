If you are like me and you sometimes like to watch horrible movies (I think it looks like a slowdown in a car accident), you can't do more than that! The plot is meaningless, the special effects are funny, and the action is one of the worst that you have ever seen! 4 knock down! WOOOHOOOOOOOO !!! Seriously, I have no idea how a director and "actors" can sleep at night! It hurts to look at it, and yet itâ€™s ridiculous to hysterics, and I highly recommend it to those who want to punish themselves for something. If you can watch this shit without frowning, you are better than I have ever been! I wonder if the producer knew this garbage, in which he invests himself (and his money)!
