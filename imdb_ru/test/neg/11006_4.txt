Directed by John Madden from the film “Shakespeare in Love” gives us another pretty bad film in “Ethan From”. The plot is centered around a new reverend entering the town of Starkfield, where he learns the story of the sick wife of the local disabled Ethan Phrome and a one-time romantic date with the maid. Adapted by Richard Nelson from the novel by writer Edith Wharton, Pulitzer Prize winner, this film is not at all interesting due to the terribly weak script and the bad direction that turns the scenes, which should be sharp, into a ridiculous Schmalz. However, in addition to the film, there are other aspects that work: the cinematography is well done, Rachel Portman brings an excellent rating, and although no one is at his best, Liam Neeson, Joan Allen, Patricia Arquette and Tate Donovan work well in their roles. But overall, Ethan Frome is only marginally worthwhile and easy to forget.
