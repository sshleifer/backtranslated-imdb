To call this film a worthy or pleasant horror tribute is too optimistic. Damn it, you can't even call it a good deception of the genre, because it's far below average (it's funny, but not “ha-ha-ha, you know). But still I would say to look at it. If only because of the huge amount of detail in it. By the way, all those people who complain about this movie here in their comments can only blame themselves. When you see the DVD cover of this movie, you should already know that it will not be on that the same level as the Piano, for example, so don’t come to complain later ... <br /> <br /> Evil Ed could be something but fully Tyu screwed up. I believe that the main idea of ​​this film is a criticism of the growing "cutting committee" in horror these days, in which an editor named Edward is shown, who is slowly (well, not too slowly) going crazy seeing all the violence and bloodshed in the produced films from his company. The big boss is Sam Campbell ... Funny, isn't it? Personally, I also expected a character named Bruce Raimi, but for me there was no surprise. In any case, this guy got rich by shooting films called “Free Limbs.” They show (and I'm not joking!) Scenes in which a girl was raped by a Beaver (?), And then shoots in the head from a bazooka !!! Now, who said that horror is no longer original? <br /> <br /> With all the blood and “free limbs,” it’s hard to believe, but in fact it gets boring very quickly. After a decent first 25 minutes, Evil Ed turns into complete boredom and never recovers from it. The only thing left to do (except, of course, pressing the eject button) is to look for the obvious number of references to other, much better horror films. I saw scenes apparently stolen from Evil Dead, Silence of the Lambs, Brain Dead, and several others. And on the walls there are also a huge number of classic horror posters that you can admire. <br /> <br /> Evil Ed finds their source in Sweden. I am convinced that there are many talents there, far to the north (take the Danish "Nattevagten" as an example) ... but none of these talents joined the film crew of Evil Ed. Just to see if you are in the mood and if you want to use your brain at all.
