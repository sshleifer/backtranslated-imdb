Mickey Rourke now enjoys a renaissance ... and fair play with him. I always liked his image and his acting skills in such films as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you're going to get with Rourke - angry, naughty, dirty. But this film gives you so much more - and you don't want most of it. <br /> <br /> First of all - all this does not make sense. Rourke is a seasoned IRA assassin who runs from Ireland to London after killing a school bus. He is on the run from police and from his own comrades in the army. He also vowed never to kill again. It seems that a bus full of children finally made it for him. <br /> <br /> However, when he gets to London, he is haunted by a local gangster (Bates - his eyebrows and hair fell out right out of Burton Mannequin) to kill his main competitor in turn for £ 50,000 and a boat trip to the USA . Rourke reluctantly agrees to do this, but the priest (Hoskins) sees him and confesses this confession to keep the priest’s mouth shut. He believes it is better than killing him. <br /> <br /> Many things arise here that simply do not add up: 1. Why did Rourke drop out of the competition? This is illustrated by a scene in which an employee is pressed to the wall with a pair of weights with something like an awl - these London guys are hardy enough to commit their own murder. 2. Not only that, but the Gangster forces the guy to follow Rourke and watch the murder with his own eyes. Why this guy just did not kill a competitor and did not get rid of the hassle associated with Rourke? 3. Hoskins sees the murder happen, and the police let him go — without protection, I can add — to accept a confession? Never. 4. Rourke hangs around the church (near the murder site) immediately after committing the crime to make a confession. Why don't the cops check this place? 5. Rourke hangs around the church and, in particular, Hoskin's blind niece for a few days, and no one bothers him. What kind? Is he on the run and stays at the site of the murder itself? Stupid. 6. The police actually meet Rourke in the church, "repair" the body, and have no idea who he is. Don't they know that he is on the run for the school bus explosion? Do they even check it out? 7. Why would Rourke kill for you, and then tell him to wait a few days to get on the boat? You would think that you would want to get rid of him immediately. Or kill him. One or the other? 8. Why did Brother Bates suddenly decide to rape a blind niece in the midst of all the waiting? Could he not restrain himself for several days? At least until Rourke is safely sent to the States? Funny. 9. Does Rourke suddenly experience internal turmoil after all his years of murder and immediately defeat his blind niece - even after she knows that he is a murderer, does she still love him? Again - completely ridiculous. And besides - she falls in love with him in record time - in a few days !!!! 10. The whole bomb at the end is just stupid from the point of view of Bates. 11. In some parts of this film things happen that simply do not make sense or simply exist to help the storyline (and I say this as a joke). Bates Rourke's house in the boat until the boat is ready to sail, and Rourke suddenly shows moral exaltation to respect the slut in the house - but the blind girl will still sleep. 12. Rourke asks for the assistant on the boat, where Bates is, - and the assistant practically accelerates all the movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the guy told Rourke much more than he even asked. 13. Hoskin's priest is a former military man, and we see him beat three infantrymen behind a pub. Absolutely inappropriate and another scene worthy of mercy. <br /> <br /> I’ll dwell on an unlucky 13, without mentioning Rourke's hair (so falsely red that it is ridiculous), his accent (which, frankly, is not that bad, but sometimes worsens to a barely audible mutter) , his clothes, walks, looks to heaven, etc. I will not mention music and changeable editing style either. <br /> <br /> just mentioned them. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is a catastrophe with the addition of some obvious religious images (Rourke on the Cross, a sermon from the pulpit) that would embarrass a first-year student, not to mention the best star and director. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
