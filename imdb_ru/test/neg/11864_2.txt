This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I could hardly fall asleep. The game and the plot were terrible. I like B-movies, but there's nothing in this movie that would make me laugh or think. Well, there were two or three funny moments in the beginning, so I have to give this film 2 out of 10. If you really want to watch it, watch the first 10 minutes. After that, you'll be more and more disappointed while the movie is on.
