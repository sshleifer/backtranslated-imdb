Sam O'Shtin, the director of the film about the superb movie with the suspicion of Rosemary's Baby of 1968, runs a television sequel in which Rosemary Woodhouse (Patty Duke Astin, for Mia Farrow) turns off early - and inexplicably - probably to help flesh out the more disgusting aspects of this sluggish story about the son of satan on earth. The most interesting thing is Ruth Gordon’s return to her Oscar-winning role as Minnie Castevet (with Ray Milland as her husband Roman), but she’s not given much work — and she looks terribly uncomfortable due to participating in anyway, This the script is strictly low rent and must have disgraced the original author Ira Levin (who continued to write his own sequel). Pretty dim and pale, with a bad photo, without any expectations or panic.
