Would you be surprised if I told you that this film deals with a conspiracy? Not? How about if I tell you that the leader was a shadow puppet. What kind? You do not believe me? ... OK. Yes, I did it. This is very bad, this film could use a sense of humor. I understand that Charlie Sheen was doing this at the time — another film was worth more money — as for Donald Sutherland and Linda Hamilton ... why? Don't even get me to Stephen Lang. He was as fun as Party Crasher on The Hard Way, and now this stuff. <br /> <br /> Oh, it doesn't matter. All participants should feel ashamed. If you want to make a bad film and succeed - it is distorted - but I seriously doubt that this is what they wanted. The unpleasant story stinks, and we really need to take this yak seriously. Makes you wonder if this movie had at least some glimmer of hope. Seriously, I doubt it, and in the industry, which is so closely associated with wallets, as this light bulb lit up in the first place, I can not do it. Perhaps even worse is how this doggy heap got into theaters !? <br /> <br /> Oh ... Sam Waterson, how beautiful you are in law and order. Why are you here? Reducing myself to the role of President of the United States, which I might add, can be shot and killed by a gonzo-assassin remote controlled biplane. Again, this is a masterpiece by George P. Kosmatos, who “directs” titles, including “Rambo: First Blood, Part II” and other precious stones. Hmm .... in this case?
