When I entered Savage Intruder in the IMDb search engine, one of the options he suggested was Savage Garden: International Video Collection: History so far (1999), the only reason I mentioned this is because I am a big fan of Savage Garden. And you have to do yourself a favor and check out some of their music, such as “The Statement” or “To the Moon and Back”, and not to mess around with this ordinary cauldron, sorry, I just wanted to say it. In any case, Savage Intruder begins with a bizarre montage of what looks like MGM music and premiere shots, and a few rotating portraits that make no sense in the long run. In the late 60s in Hollywood, amid the glitz and glamor, the serial killer selects aging actresses, kills them and dismembers their bodies. A young man named Vic Valance (David Garfield as John David Garfield) jumps off the tourist bus looking for work when he stays at the already retired actress, Catherine Parker (Miriam Hopkins), who was one of the biggest movie stars but now lives in a large house with an elderly housekeeper named Mildred (Lake Florence), private secretary Leslie Blair (Gail Sondergaard) and a young maidservant named Geta (Virginia wing). Catherine recently broke her leg, needs a personal assistant and gives Vic a job. Slowly Vic fascinates him with Catherine's love and, more importantly, her big wallet. Vick begins to tune Catherine to other employees, but Vick is not what he seems. Vick is a drug addict who got pregnant with Greta while continuing to have sex with Catherine. Greta threatens to tell Catherine and spoil Vic's deceitful plans, but she is closely acquainted with the ax, no one in the house is safe, as Vic brings drugs, sex, rock-n-roll party and gardening to Parker’s mansion while his the plan begins to become more and more obvious ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Donald Wolfe. I thought that Savage Intruder was a bit of a mess, but at the same time a bit entertaining. The script is everywhere, and he can't really decide who he wants to be, Savage Intruder suffers from an identity crisis! The film begins with the discovery of a severed head and limbs, immediately after another woman (Dorothy Kingston) is killed by a mysterious unidentified figure, but then she completely tears up the elements of the slasher film that she just created, never returning to them. Savage Intruder becomes a kind of nice movie when Vic became friends with Catherine and shows her how to enjoy life again and have a sexual relationship with her. In fact, it is disgusting to think that she is old enough to become his grandmother. Catherine ceases to live the life of a hermit and gives up alcohol, as Vic seems to make her happy when they go to a party together and have banquets for Catherine's girlfriend, as she also used. This part of the Savage Intruder won't look out of place in a Disney movie! From time to time, fatigue from pleasant sensations is interrupted by the fact that Vic shoots, and he has stupid hallucinations about his Mother (Sibella Guardino) and chops off her hand with an ax, he also has sex with the Great at one point. Then, after Greta was killed, Savage Intruder becomes a strange horror movie, as Vic is revealed to the psycho he is. In my opinion, Savage Intruder does not work like a film, as it mixes different genres with little success. Similarly, the elements of the murder mystery do not work and, frankly, represent a small mystery. Why do everything you can to hide the identity of the killer during the murder scenes, but then make it clear who commits them throughout the film? Vic as a character did not work for me either, at one point he was a cool, calm, intelligent and cunning fraud, and then he was completely insane! Why kill all the other victims, but with Catherine try to deceive her? What makes it so special? If it's because she has money, why not go after her from the very beginning? So many questions and so few answers ... Some of the conversations of the 60s are pretty funny to listen to these days, for example, when Vic offers Greta painkiller, really hard drugs, and Greta says: “Why do I need painkiller?”, Vic is helpful replies "because your pain" wow, this guy knows how to charm the ladies! Or when Catherine suggests to Vika to do gardening and ask: “Do you have green fingers?” He answers “no, but I'm good in the grass!” Savage Intruder doesn’t have much blood, several severed limbs and a pair of decapitated heads. There is also a rather impressive shot when someone was cut off with an ax, so this is probably repeated three or four times. Stupid-looking scenes of narcotic hallucinations need to be seen to be believed. Technically, with Savage Intruder, everything is in order, the location of the filming in the grand mansion and the Hollywood hills probably gives him a better view than he deserves, the acting skills are average, just like the rest of the production. In general, I would say that Savage Intruder feels that he is trying to solve the mystery of the murder, which, unfortunately, gives the killer and as a result simply does not work. This is, at best, a slightly exciting pastime, and at worst - a complete mess of the movie.
