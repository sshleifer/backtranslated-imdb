As a native of New Orleans, I can say that almost everything in this film, from the disgusting dialect of N'Aulins to the extremely creative "manipulation" of the geography of the Crescent, is terrible. This is another one of those Big Hollywood films that decides to stereotype New Orleans as: 1. A city full of idiots sounding in French 2. A city full of people who sound like they just returned from Blanche DuBois 3. A city of drunks, where every day is Mardi Gras 4. A city of deep secrets, where almost everyone practices or is victims of voodoo (I admit that we may be a city of drunks; although every day is NOT MARDI GRAS) of the worst New Orleans movies. I would not recommend this to anyone.
