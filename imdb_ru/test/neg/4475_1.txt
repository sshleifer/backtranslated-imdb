It was one of the worst films I remember. I'm sure I have seen the worst, although if it softens me by slapping them. <br /> <br /> Humor is not funny, there are silly jokes of the stereotype, which, again, are not funny. I was a captive public on the plane and watched this movie. It was a waste of time. I enjoyed Martin in early films, but not this one. It was the same with Queen Latifa, she performed very well in Chicago, and she was also good in “Take it Down”, but this role was terrible. <br /> <br /> I mainly attribute the failure to a bad script. I feel that you cannot save a formulaic, unfunny script with worthy actors, this film is an example. However, all participants had to be wise enough not to participate in this film. I'm just amazed that something so bad can be lit, done, theatrically released and sold.
