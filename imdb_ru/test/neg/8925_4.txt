Ho Hum. Another click with Stephen Seagal, pretending to be some kind of spiritual being, but beating heads and killing, as if it was nothing. He, of course, justifies this in the end, by donating money to an orphanage. How cute. Destroy the world and we will ignore it if you take care of the little girl. Jeesh! This time he collaborates with Ice Cool (Anthony Creech Chris). I have to have someone to put all those shocking lines, man, and a lot of them. Dialogue is just crap. <br /> <br /> They follow the bad guys Nick Mancuso and Kevin Taiga, two people who were born to play scum. <br /> <br /> He squeezes Marie Morrow and impressive soap star Sara Buxton. How cute. <br /> <br /> I believe that if you have some kind of excitement in July, this may be enough. If nothing else, it will help you get a degree in Seagalology.
