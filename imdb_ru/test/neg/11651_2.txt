This film was meaningless. I can't even call it science fiction, because it takes more from the film than just happening in space. Max Q is not even set in space for the entire movie. The plot / plot is not original, the cast is not special, although it would be strange with the top actors in a mediocre film ... Moreover, it is not particularly exciting or well-narrated. At least, it is evenly balanced with low quality, nothing or no one stands out in it. All equally soft. I usually find some qualities in "space films", even if it is just 90 minutes of semi-weak entertainment, bordering on low-budget pathetic, but Max Q did not even give me that satisfaction. In general, a complete waste of time.
