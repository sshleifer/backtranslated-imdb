There was a time when Joel Schumacher was quite high on my list of favorite directors. Back in the late 80s and early 90s, when his name was attached to several great films, such as The Lost Boys, Flatliners and Falling Down, he really was one of the most talented directors in Hollywood. Then followed the stupid sequels of "Batman", unfortunately, and after that it seemed that every potentially sublime scenario turns into a giant mess in the hands of Schumacher. “8MM” and “Phone Booth” could be much better films, and even the incredibly stupid concept “The Number 23” should have been turned into a slightly more convincing and interesting film. Literally from start to finish, “Number 23” is desperately trying to become a mysterious and supernatural thriller and therefore uses all the terrible cliches from a big book of cinema history, including heavy-voiced narration, confused structure, characters with several personalities, numerous plot twists which are becoming increasingly absurd and sinister. Nothing helps, however, simply because of the sheer stupidity of the basic formula and the clearly uninspiring participation of the actors and the team. No matter how hard you try to communicate with the main character and be open-minded about crazy theories, it still remains a double-digit film, and double-digit numbers are not terrible. Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey in a rare non-comic role) is a bored animal hunter, whose wife Agatha presents him with a strange book on his birthday. The book talks about all sorts of diabolical theories and strange coincidences that are associated with the number 23. Walter almost immediately identifies himself with the main character of the book (a depraved detective investigating a grim suicide case) and begins to discover abundant examples of 23 riddles in his personal life. I did some research on Google and Wikipedia, and, apparently, all this numerology 23 does exist, and some people sincerely believe that most accidents and accidents are directly related to this evil number. Well, that's just ?? psycho! But I'm not here to judge people's beliefs and fears, no matter how crazy they are, and I can only share my humble opinion about the film based on a mysterious mystery. "Number 23" does not cause concern, despite the somewhat gloomy decorations and the unpleasant effects of makeup, and never manages to make you think about the role of numbers in your own life. All the actors perform below their usual possibilities, but nonetheless it was a joy to see the beautiful Mrs. Virginia Madsen again in a relatively large performance. Definitely not recommended if you are looking for a hard and creepy thriller fun evening, but hardy and not completely useless.
