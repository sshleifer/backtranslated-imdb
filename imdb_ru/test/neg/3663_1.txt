Not the best movie in the world ???? This was an understatement. I personally did not like this film at all. Not because of the storyline, not because of graphic violence and nakedness. Nudity didn’t really need it; it didn’t do anything for the story, except that the girls might have been in difficult times, and being naked probably also ruined them more. But one of the things in the movie that I hated ... it was so dark. You could not understand what was going on. I think that if it were not so dark, and you could see where they were, it might not be so bad. All you know is somewhere in the basement. You see neither home nor road, there is no killer in it, all you could see was half his face for about 5 seconds. I want to see something in the movie. It gets boring after 20 minutes of almost total darkness, and all you see sometimes is a flashlight or a wall. Then you will hear the sobbing of the girl. There was nothing special in the film that would be good in the film, perhaps waiting for the first 10 minutes of the film ... but not waiting for the film to end, but waiting ... for the will In this film I see everything except a few naked bodies and various flashing lights. But honestly, it was a meeting with Blair Whitch. Both are super films, and both with the right lighting to find out what's going on. Forget this movie if you can see ... if you are a blind person ... you can rent it to hear screams if you like such things. But then again, if you are blind, you probably don’t read it either ... anyway ... Bad movie !!!!
