Completely missing all the video game screenings, this is another terrible movie of Mr. Ball. The way they continue to hire him to make films is a constant surprise for me and, obviously, most of the movie community. <br /> <br /> In general, I will say that this attempt was somewhat better than many of his previous attempts. Some of the conversations were even half decent in Far Cry, although he still incorrectly uses some phrases, and in some cases he does not even use phrases correctly. <br /> <br /> Now, besides the fact that Jack Carver should be an American, not a German, Thiel was still in charge of this role. The only exception is the ridiculous lame lines he uses to go to bed with a girl. And we must assume that she is ready to have sex with him after such a minimal dialogue so casually? Emile? Just there for comic relief I'm sure and still lame. Jack's character looks old and tired, but is still capable of the extreme acrobatics necessary to avoid one of the modified super-soldiers in the lab. <br /> <br /> Don't look at the Far Cry adaptation. But you can just spend an hour and a half watching it if you have nothing to do.
