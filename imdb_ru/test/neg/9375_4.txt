First of all, I have to admit that I have never been a big fan of the Dutch movie genre. Unfortunately, the viewing of De Domini did not make me change my mind. He has some common flaws, such as the plot, which is too predictable and linear for my taste. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the actors have their own dialogues, as if they were theatrical actors in the play. Unfortunately, this is often found in many Dutch films and, at least for me, makes it impossible to feel any involvement in the main characters. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays Adri (sorry, I forgot his name at the moment) at least provides decent performance, and this is one of the reasons why I don’t rate this movie even worse. Another reason is that, at least, he seems to have had some kind of budget seems professional. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the fact that an action is often too clearly worded cannot be a big problem if you don’t speak Dutch, although I have already warned you that the plot is also not impressive, but at least it can make it an acceptable movie to watch.
