The topics presented are very interesting; suburban culture, suburban development, public transport, depletion of oil and gas reserves, energy dependence, alternative sources of energy, etc. The problem is that this is pure and unscrupulous propaganda material. One point of view is presented, then again and again falls on the viewer. You see the same handful of “experts” who have repeatedly expressed their arguments. The alleged “narrator” begins to sound like a reporter, but in the end he even preaches the dogma of the film. <br /> <br /> The dark side of the film is not so much the grim and doomed news of oil depletion, but the feeling that the people in the film really want a post-oil society and all that it entails. They paint this picture of a utopian society, where we all return to the autonomous model of the local village; go to work, shop on site, grow your own food and lead an idyllic lifestyle of the 19th century. For them, the post-oil society would seem like a great vision of a better world. This would definitely mean the end of globalization, and even better the end of Walmart. I commend them for using factual mathematics in identifying the weak points of several over-advertised alternative energy sources, including ethanol and hydrogen. <br /> <br /> I gave him 3 stars because I appreciated the old frames and the background,
