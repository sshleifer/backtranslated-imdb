As for the positive, I will say that this is enough so that you can look at it. Negative, it is tasteless enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen. Long, tearful and senseless. And I'm not saying what it means meanly, I really wanted this film to be liked, it seemed to have everything for it, there was a so-called “buzz”, and besides, it was difficult to track down. If a little more effort was put into the story, I think it would be awesome. And I expect that the team behind this, in the future will give a wonderful job, they clearly have the ability. But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.
