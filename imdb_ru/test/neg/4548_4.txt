The combination of Dan Haggerty (Elves) and Linda Blair (The Exorcist) is enough for any horror fan to be delighted with this film. And as soon as you see the cover for this frozen zombie film coming out of their cryogenic chamber, you will think that you are in the B-Movie horror movie. At least that's how I approached this film. But boy, I was shocked <br /> <br /> I love horror movies. I also love B-movies. Nothing makes my day a more fun little movie about zombies, monsters, killers and things like that. But to say that this film was not enough, it means to say nothing. This film was pure rubbish. You might think that zombies would look like the cover of a box, but instead you get actors with masks that are clearly sold on every Halloween display case. In addition, the script above is pathetic. Our main character, Joseph, suffers from the loss of his wife and son and seeks solace in the soulful Mary played by Blair. Never once do you see any signs of sadness or discomfort on the part of the character of Joseph. Instead, we see the head of the cryogenic laboratory, a man named Dr. Miller, seeking to get the dead bodies and experiment with their organs. There is no emotion or anything that would make you believe that you should give a damn about anyone in this film. <br /> <br /> Everything and everyone is very disappointing. All the elements to create a great horror movie were there. You had your zombies, your decent actors and your story. But the lack of good writing and the weak sense of direction spoiled it royally. Only 4 out of 10
