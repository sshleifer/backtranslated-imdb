"San Francisco, Oh, you miraculously devastated the city, Thank you, God, because you destroyed it and made the bricks fall on our collective heads, and for scoring tens of thousands of Your innocent, obedient sheep, oh God, who is so merciful in your heavenly ways ... "It should have been the words to the title song of this oh-so-inspiring and completely pointless film. <br /> <br /> The film starts well enough, Gable opens Cinderella with a very annoying but highly appreciated opera voice, and she soon shoots glory. One of many The problem with our Cinderella is that it is played by Jeanette MacDonald, who, if she “spends the time” to look through all this makeup and shiny facade of the 30s, realizes that she’s kind of ugly. In any case, it’s too ugly to play THIS the role. And yet Gable and everyone else are fawns here, as if she is some damn beautiful or something like that. Another problem with Cinderella is that her character is so humble, healthy, innocent, loving God, kind and generous - it's enough to make you sick of a whole hour. MacDonald plays his (admittedly one-dimensional) role with the types “aaaa”, “aa” and “oooh”, which serves more for irritation than for its sympathy. <br /> <br /> Tracy was better, and he had better roles than in the performance of this cliche, the golden heart, the God-loving, childless priest (who plays in “free time” - as if the priests have something to do - how cute). Even a reliable Gable does not meet its usual standards; he is too animated, and his character is too selfless for someone who is considered an ambitious western "villain" (although this is obviously the fault of the script). <br /> <br /> The plot is basically this: Gable and his rival Holt play ping pong with Cinderella - using it as a ball. How? Well, at first she works (sings) on Gable, then she works on square Holt, then she returns to Gable, but very soon returns to Holt. (And, of course, both want to have her as a girlfriend / wife.) And if an earthquake didn't interrupt this table tennis plot, it’s safe to argue that she would jump up and down another ten times, a small, exhausted princess, who she happens to be. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of, in fact, too many musical numbers. It’s almost as if they were trying to make the first “movie about the catastrophe” a musical. So silly. Everything she sings in Geybla's “join” is good, but when she starts singing those piercing, annoying cheekbones during the opera segments, then I felt that my ears were unprovoked and unfairly attacked by the sound of the fire of the enemy. Actually, there is an opera number that lasts 6 damn minutes. 6 may seem a bit, for those who have not had a first-hand Vietoperanam experience with such horrors of audio torture, but this is similar to the years of the dog; The year of the dog is equivalent to seven. A minute of opera is equivalent to 100 minutes of Chinese torture (or a dog urinating with acid on your leg). <br /> <br /> I thought it was a disaster movie, but it’s more like a movie close to a disaster. (I read that some of the dialogues in this film were written by the director of Silent Era. Jesus ...) The melodramatic, and only sometimes funny, proceedings are interrupted by the real star of this film (namely, an earthquake) only after an hour and a half. When Joe's earthquake finally shook the city and our cliché characters in it, I almost wanted to say: "Thank God, death and destruction are finally here!" Unfortunately, Joe comes to the film too late to save him from growing mediocrity; the devastation scenes are very good, but even a part of an earthquake movie collapses (pun) due to a very annoying, religious ending. You see, Gable, who declares himself an atheist all the time (without actually using the word itself), finally finds MacDonald alive - after several days of searching - and suddenly he turns into a believer because Cinderella is alive? !! So silly! All that tells me is that the character Gable is a moronic fool. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film ends with a very stupid note. Gable, saying “thank you” to God for the “salvation” of his girlfriend (and he makes him on his knees), “finds” God (sees the light), and the little old devil of the movie Gable turns himself into a believer. As a very God-fearing American end ... <br /> <br /> Of course, no one thought to ask this “God,” why the hell was an earthquake? The sad and unintended irony is that Gable eventually becomes a “sucker”; all this time he mocked the "suckers" who fall in love with the holiest scam of all - namely, religion - and in the end he himself becomes one. This is what I call the triumph of the human spirit! Another irony is that the ending should have improved Geybla as a person, but I see it very differently; on the contrary: it took only one big Joe to turn Gable into a God-fearing, meek, small, obedient believer who joins the sheep family in the world. And as if this intellectual wreckage of Geable was not pathetic enough and disappointing, this first ever “musical about an earthquake” ends with a truly amazing (accept this word as you wish), a noble and inspiring hope wonderful mass choir scene: tens (or hundreds) earthquake survivors and proud, proud citizens of Frisco spontaneously (or perhaps “God” arranged it?) sang the title song together in the hope of a better, brighter future without Joe. Hallelujah! If you're a fan of Hollywood sentimentality, don't miss this movie.
