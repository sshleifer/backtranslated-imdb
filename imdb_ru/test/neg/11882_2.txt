In terms of historical accuracy, this is the worst Roman film I have ever seen. The list of not only mistakes, but also plot ideas, which are absolutely impossible, will last longer than a three-hour film, but just to give you an idea ... <br /> <br /> Julius Caesar and Augustus are presented as liberal Democrats standing on the side of the "people" against the "nobles". This is clearly absurd. The Caesars were as noble as you could be. Their interest was to consolidate power and stabilize the country, destroyed by a 150-year civil war. There were reformers, especially Grakki brothers, who lived about 100 years ago and to some extent protected the rights of ordinary citizens. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that are completely ridiculous if you know something about the period. Cleopatra, along with Richard Burton, will give you a much better idea of ​​how events took place, no matter how bizarre they are. <br /> <br /> Historical accuracy is one thing. Acting and dialogue is something else, and here this film is dangerously close to being a bad production in high school. I laughed several times, especially when Julia, the daughter of Augustus, meets a lover. They passionately cling when she breathes: "My father ..." "Oh, your father, your father ... your father will not approve." Peter O'Toole is in his worst position, forced to nibble his way through some very pompous and stupid lines. The actor who plays Augusta as a young man is such a fool - and the character is written as such - it is impossible to imagine him as a cunning, cunning, Machiavellian politician who created the Roman Empire. Here he is just a whiner who needs to say what to do most of the time. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Rampling with dignity cope with the role that she signs as Libya, Augustus's wife. If she had been given a fuller role, she could have saved this production from absurdity. <br /> <br /> There are some good photos and battles videos about battles that are supported by many standard CGI releases. Oddly enough, this was done for British television (and it seems that this is a British-Italian co-production), but is marked with an "R" rating. <br /> <br /> The DVD image is excellent, and the Dolby Digital soundtrack is very nice, although you only notice it during a few episodes, because the film is mostly conversational. <br /> <br /> Almost any Roman film, even Cleopatra or The Fall of the Roman Empire, has more historicity - not to mention an irresistible drama - than this strange adaptation of the Classics, illustrated by the younger one. This gives a new meaning to the widely used phrase “Based on real history”. In this case, they could say: "Proposed by real events."
