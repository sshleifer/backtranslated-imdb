I do not see what this thing is about this movie. Patricia Kaas sings, yes, and this makes the film fascinating, but singing is not enough. I mean, if you want all the benefits of this, buy Patricia's CD and enjoy! The plot is simple (if you omit the "dream"); the main characters seem to instantly love each other, and also instantly forget their other acquaintances. Relationships seem almost “mandatory”, and the addition of a small “detective story” only aggravates the situation. What at first seemed like the perfect ending to the movie, at first screwed up, and then became just a dream. I rate films by how well I remember them, and for that I started to forget the details.
