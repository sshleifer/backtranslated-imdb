Theft is a crime, and these guys, Kenny Yackel and Corbin Bernsen, seem to get away with it. I have not even seen this film, but not only know that it sucks, but the fact that it steals the story of another film or two films for that matter is such crap (and if IMDb will allow profanity to be much more than bullshit), that i am filled with rage and feel as if i should just throw myself out of the window and just be done with it all. Yes, it's a bit, but stealing is even worse. <br /> <br /> Have you ever seen Pontypool? It was this amazing little zombie film made in 2008, this radio host starts his work, and then this zombie attack takes place. We only see what is happening inside the radio station, and the only assumption that we have about what is happening outside is the occasional calls from their eyes in the sky, Ken Loney (easily my most funny moment in the film) and the BBC. call for information about the situation. Of all the reviews I read, and the conversation I had with my friend (who saw this movie and Pontypool), this movie was exactly the same as in the story, with a few changes here and there. So throw originality and creativity out the window. As for the zombies or infected, no matter how you call them. This one and the same thing, just that they became infected, does not change the fact that they walk thoughtlessly and have an endless thirst for flesh. They are zombies. ZOMBIES !! <br /> <br /> ZOMBIES !!! Well, one to many, but back to this shitty movie. The zombies from what I heard are very similar to those that were filmed in the movie “28 Days Later,” another better movie, with their mad rage and even crazier craving for flesh. Here, the zombie movies define themselves, the story does not matter in the zombie movie (as long as you don’t take the idea of ​​another movie). Of course, the film about zombies can be improved by the plot, as is the case with Pontypool, but zombies must be original in some way. 28 days later, a crazy raging zombie began. Pontipool, I can't even begin to explain those guys without destroying the movie. Evil Dead, I think, all I have to do is just type the name again, because, come on, it's the Evil Dead. Romero is a master, and he went through all sorts of zombies, from painted zombies on faces in Dawn of the Dead to violent zombies in Diaries of the Dead, and each of them made his own unique style. <br /> <So, after talking about other great zombie movies, I think it's time to explain why I hate this movie without even seeing it. This film below steals the original plot of the story to Pontipul, which I think is called plagiarism, and in this country it is illegal, and many people are excluded from school for doing just that, but in Hollywood this is allowed and, obviously, approved. This is not the only film that takes the shape of another film, and he tries to talk about it differently. The 90s are the worst period for films, of course, there were once many gems in it, but not in a decade, and all films are the same. My favorite crime movie with such a turn that you never guess until the very end. They make you feed one suspect, make you seem impossible, that this is not someone else but him, then, Bam, all this time it was this guy, you just had to look at the scenes where he wasn’t, and then, when he mysteriously appears unexpectedly, they say: "Hey guys, what did I miss?" OH! I DIDN'T SEE THAT I AM! Well, I will leave the cliché as a final statement. This is the movie that you probably want to miss.
