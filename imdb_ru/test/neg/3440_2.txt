I like the way everyone treats this show as the next great American sitcom. I watched five episodes of this abomination, and the only person who was close to a real teacher was an old man, who seemed to love and hated his work. The rest were just nice people who tried to read lines written by people who never went to a real classroom. I liked that each episode consisted of two idiots (one who was laid, and the other not) who got into some unpleasant problem that indirectly involved their students. A British girl who thought she had found a pleasant quality in the main idiot, but in the end was somehow shocked that he was a donkey. A hot chick who was there for the special purpose of being hot, and the director and her lackey who somehow promoted an almost non-existent conspiracy. I liked that almost all the teachers in this show were very young, but I ask you to remember your school years and remember the teachers that you had. did they look like that? Or did you go to middle school where middle-aged people taught? This is a high school that everyone else went to. The show lacked any research on what was happening in schools. In public schools, directors do not have authority for higher and dismissing teachers, as the school board does, but in every episode I watched, the director threatened to fire his teachers. Remember your history lesson. ,,,, or remember some history lesson, have you ever seen how an incredibly hot British chick teaches a lesson in American history? Not. Have you ever seen a teacher's room that is so big that you could actually play basketball? <br /> <br /> Teachers could be a great idea if they were really based on some form of reality. What makes learning fun is the stories you get from communicating with students, and teachers find it fun because they communicate with students every day. Excessive attention to their life outside of training just made it another sitcom with four cameras, in which unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment spoke unrealistic lines, and sorry, I just did not buy it. The show could be modeled after other successful sitcoms and use the same camera format, and it should focus more on the teacherâ€™s relationship with his students, rather than with each other. <br /> <br /> He got a star for trying and a star for a hot chick (she was really hot). <br /> <br /> In the end, it was an unfortunate sitcom that would go down in history as an attempt by hacks to understand the profession. I only hope that if they make another comedy series based on the teachings, they learn from their mistakes so that such a monster never touches the TV screen.
