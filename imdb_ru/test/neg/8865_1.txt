Now first let me say that I like horrible movies. Especially horror movies mostly. I watched hundreds of movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000 without pain. But this is the worst movie on the planet !!! I had to turn it off so bad. It was not funny and just unsightly. Give me 3 views behind Manos "Hands of Fate" or Monster A-go-go. Avoid this movie like the plague! Now excuse me when I go out to wash my eyes, to clear them of the dirt that I had to watch in order to get a decent judgment for this film. Only one decent gag in the part I watched was that the assassins are now a pair of fighters for the Hitmen Destroyers. Even it was not too cool.
