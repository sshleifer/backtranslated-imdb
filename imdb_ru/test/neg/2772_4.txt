What I liked most about this film was the chance to see Joan Woodbury starring, which struck me as one of several beauties in Charles Boyer's classic film “Algeria”. She is doing well as Rita, an orphan who rises to become a kind woman, a criminal authority. Her climb to the top reminds me of the characters Joan Crawford, for example, Mildred Pierce, who realizes her ambitions thanks to her hard determination and willpower. If you are looking for a film noir classic, better look elsewhere. In some moments it is difficult to understand where this story is going. At first I got the impression that this would include Rita's plot to revenge her father and son, who deceived her, forcing her to take rap for the drunken death penalty perpetrated by the playboy's son. But the payback time turned out to be only a secondary moment and a springboard for the somewhat confusing second part of the film, where Rita is increasingly involved in corruption in the city. In any case, it is only 72 minutes, so the re-viewing should remove any danger. My copy of a set of platinum boxes called Gangster Movies. The picture quality is good, but the soundtrack sucks, constantly skipping fragments of the dialogue. In a box of $ 5.50, eight films, each of which costs 69 cents. Look for Anna Archer's father, John Archer, as Rita Bob's childhood friend. Alan Ladd does not get much screen time. This is definitely a painting by Joan Woodbury.
