Choosing a bloated, boring and racist "Cimarron" is considered the worst choice for the Best Picture in the history of Oscar. Bad acting (Richard Dix, especially rightly forgotten, whose performance as self-centered and irresponsible Yancy Kravat is considered one of the most narcissistic characteristics in the history of the screen) and truly dynamic, the film today is really shocked because of the racist bias of his one black character who is presented as sleeping in the chandelier. <br /> <br /> Other comments from reviewers IMDb rejected the attitude to this character as obsolete, but many films that appeared during this period did so. Do NOT portray blacks as shuffling, lazy mental defects in the manner in which this hippo receives immense pleasure; so this argument seems weak at least. But whether you consider this degrading characteristic a shockingly bad taste for anyone at any time or simply forgivable ignorance of a less educated era, it is very painful to look through the eyes of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> But even that may not matter if the film were not too long a bore. Awarded the best Oscar film at the Oscar 1930/31, when such persistent classics like City Lights, Public Enemy, Dracula, Dawn Patrol and Blue Angel were not nominated for Cimarron. ‚Äù certainly the worst choice to join the Oscar pantheon.
