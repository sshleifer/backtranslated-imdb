I am usually a fan of Bruce Willis, and, despite the fact that he plays a cold-blooded professional killer, I consider him the most attractive character here. However, his character makes such a mess in his professional activities, incredibly, that he was not caught before. The plot is thin to the point of being meaningless. The end was no less annoying and offensive because it could be predicted about 20 minutes after the film began. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers follow ** In Hollywood's morality, good guys always win, several victims along the way, and bad guys die, or at least by the end seek justice. An exciting insult to the film is the way that our terrorist IRA, who somehow became a pleasant, touchy character, goes into a new life. Like his former terrorist friend (who is now a loving wife and mother). <br /> <br /> Who is the biggest villain? A former (and, as far as we can judge, unrepentant) terrorist or assassin? I do not see much choice between them - in real life or in the film. <br /> <br /> This is the worst film I've ever seen this year.
