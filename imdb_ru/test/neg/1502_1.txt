NEVER ! I hated grandma. First of all, she is too tall — of course, this is Tom, whose brother plays her — and I hate what she does when she combs her fake silver hair, but there are funny moments in this movie. For example, the fact that every actor looks like VG. (very German), and also that they think that, even if left alone, they must pretend that this guy (Tom) is their real “grandmother” or something like that. I especially liked this moment when Charlotte leaves and goes to the nearest gas station to ask for help. She suddenly finds herself in the middle of some forest (where was it before? No one dares to explain) and turns, turns, turns like a ballerina, looks at the stars ... and ... ignores the fact that GRANNI IS HERE, READY !!! But, in any case, the music was not so bad, the haircuts were fine, and the final was terribly provocative ... Mmmmmm ... It’s a pity that I didn’t have a German version.
