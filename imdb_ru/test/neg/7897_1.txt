It is quite possible that it was the worst film ever made in a league with films such as Howard Duck, Plan 9 from Space and Ishtar. I do not understand why I decided to watch this film because it was a waste of my life. I also do not understand why this film was liked, regardless of their sense of humor. Acting is one of the worst I've ever seen, like writing. All the characters are stupid, and in the whole movie there is not a single funny scene. Tom Arnold is probably the worst actor in history - this film proves it. This film is nothing worthy. Do not give up, do not look, do not even say that it looks interesting. This is bad enough, I saw it.
