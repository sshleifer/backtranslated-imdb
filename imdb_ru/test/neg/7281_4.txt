I really do not understand how someone could enjoy this movie. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a movie half as boring as this indulgent piece of trash. It would probably be better if the director didn't spend most of the film showing off his own artwork, which is actually not so remarkable. Another thing I don’t really like is that when a character is hit on a face, a gallon of blood soon pours out of it. I don’t know how people bleed there in Japan, but I hope they have many blood donors.
