No matter how powerful the real story of Phulan is, this book on which this film is based came out before she herself was released from prison and had the opportunity to tell about it. <br /> <br /> This is supposedly based on her diaries, but she is illiterate. How it works? <br /> <br /> However, some parts of his film are accurate, and the game is not bad, with some sensitivity that manifests itself. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this story should be old on the show. Much more happens to squeeze in a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> Read her autobiography. Highly recommended. This is a fantastic story.
