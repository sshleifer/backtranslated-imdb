This film really tried to catch the naive idealism that many young teenage girls have for fun, friendship, escape, danger, sex, maturity, etc. The problem was that he could not establish these things at every level; that is why he failed to build a decent story around them. I could not understand any part of this story, nor any reason for which I would not care. <br /> <br /> This film is not a pedophilia study at all. This is mainly about a girl who is in love with her sister, and her sister who is in love with the idea of ​​"man." While the latter is experiencing her love for men, the first is trying to return her sister, "calming down." <br /> <br /> The plot is weak, the characters are weak, and the reality of all this was similar in the amateur porn director (without the sexual substance).
