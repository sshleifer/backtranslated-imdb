This film is from the 80s, but it looks like it was made in the Stone Age. The effects are too raw. On my copy is Sandra Bullock on the cover, which is why I bought the film. She was in the movie for about 5 minutes total time on screen. Most likely, she will deny all involvement. <br /> <br /> In short, thereâ€™s nothing interesting in this movie except to laugh at how bad it sucks. Rent it to see the worst movie ever made, without exception.
