This film was boring. Very similar to Underworld, only less interesting. This is not a big part of a werewolf movie and very close to a horror movie. The lead couple was boring. I didnâ€™t care at all about Vivian and Aiden. And the development of the characters was so small that I did not care about the characters in the film. The plot was thin on paper. Conversions were mostly zero. I liked the wolves themselves, I could make a documentary about the wolf, I would have liked it more. I would not recommend this movie. I did not find it funny or interesting. He just pulls, and everything in him is boring. This film may receive an award for not making a werewolf movie.
