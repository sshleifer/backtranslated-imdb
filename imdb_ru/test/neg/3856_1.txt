My friend, who has a mysterious ability to find and - horrors! - I like bad movies, I watch Pest. At that time, not knowing how really miserable his taste was in the movies, I decided to try. <br /> <br /> Bad mistake. <br /> <br /> The story, although it was clearly torn out any textbook of English for the sixth grade, if we talk about the topic “hunter for people”, would be funny under the right conditions - good actors, a writer, a director, a wardrobe, etc. etc. and so on almost to the end. Obviously, these factors are missing. <br /> <br /> “Pest” must be funny, I think. I say “think” because I allowed to crack no more than a faint smile throughout the entire movie. Not a cry, not a laugh, not a laugh, not even a smile. A smile, at best. And it happened so rarely when I watched this film, I even remember how often I smiled - at best, 3 or 4 times. <br /> <br /> So do yourself a huge favor. Never watch this movie. Avoid at all costs.
