The story is fragmented and poorly written. We are given the threads and possible hook in the first act, only to see how it disappears. If the writer had bothered to read his work carefully, it would become obvious that the initial problem of the character Madsden and the meeting with the “bad” girl suggest that there will be a problem union between them when they try to solve his problem. <br /> <The problem is not going anywhere. Relationships are not going anywhere. And there is no sexual tension in any of the relationships. Nobody digs anyone, and no one appeals. Writing and directing are ridiculous. You may feel someone struggling with disorder and shifting the emphasis in the story to trying to extract some kind of excitement. There's nothing here. The writer / director is just a newcomer whose confusions have somehow become a film. From simple mistakes, such as "... they took polaroids ..." - in Japan in 2007? for abusive mistakes such as nudity for eroticism, this film is an insult. You can't make them much worse. <br /> <br /> And by adding “Madsden” to the talent list, the producers thought they would have some success. He hardly acts. Asia, of course, is ... and the result was a kind of heroin chic. <br /> <br /> Skip this.
