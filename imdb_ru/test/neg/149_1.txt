I just watched this “movie”, and in fact I wanted to write my first comment on IMDb.com, even though I’m more than 9 years old. The reason I watched this is because I like splashing films, and sometimes I like to check my limits and see what really shocks me. Firstly, the blood in this film did not shock me, even the thought that someone had invented this and turned it into a film - I was really shocked that there seems to be a market for such crap, don’t get me wrong - I'm totally against censorship, but it seems to me that this film was created for some kind of fetish crowd that seems to be distracted by this type of shit. the same kind of disgust and guilt that I felt after watching films like the August Underground. watching this movie is terrible, but at least you get the feeling that the filmmakers want to show you how disgusting the violence is. in the case of “niku daruma”, it seems that this was done solely to awaken people. I prefer films that are shocking because they are well made and thought out, such as the films of Gaspar Noe, or Takashi Miike, or Fun Games, or The Man Bites the Dog - these films will stay with you for a while. I will forget this film by tomorrow, and the only thing that will remain with me is the thought that somewhere people are excited from watching this shit. if you are reading this, please check yourself in the next hospital or shoot yourself - this, of course, does not apply to blood hounds who just love to splash. you're cool! world
