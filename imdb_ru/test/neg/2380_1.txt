This film almost gave me a nervous breakdown. When I recovered from appendicitis a few years ago, I just started teaching in middle (high) school. The whole training business was starting to get a little nervous, but in order to mentally prepare for returning to class, I decided to watch some horrible films. “Flintstones” was one of the films I chose, and then I put up “King of the Streets” (the British title “Alien Warrior”). Shortly before it ended, I was almost in tears from the waste of it all ... of my life, the box office, the 2 pounds I paid for it a couple of weeks ago in the rental section of the Blockbuster ex, time It must print the cover, the efforts of the editors and musicians involved in the soundtrack (just as small as their efforts were) ... the list goes on. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. Let me make it perfectly clear - I love watching shit movies from blockbusters. My friend Dan and I sat and watched a lot of horrors and laughed at them. But it was a different type of shit movie. I don’t think something came close to that, even The Death Trap by Tobe Hooper (probably my second worst film in the world). The whole process of creating a car from an abandoned area almost killed me; repetition of music at any available opportunity, regardless of the events on the screen; whole .... aaaaaaaaaaaa !!!!! I can’t even continue this “critical” dissection, as I started a gag reflex. The futility of this film, even now, three years after I watched it for the first and last time, still makes me speechless (but I can still print). The whole section “Making a car from odd parts” made me think about terrible things. <br /> <br /> I beg you, if you are interested in watching this film, just look at the cover of the video and imagine the worst Possible version of the summary of the story on the back. I can almost guarantee that it will not be even half as bad as this film really is. Do not, under any circumstances, think about it for any reason. Not if you are a Christian and want to see the allegory of Christ; not if you are a lover of a bad movie and want to experience the true nadir of garbage even if you want your life to seem longer (and, believe me, every second that this film is being made looks at least a minute). Make no mistake about this, this film is unholy. This is the Antichrist in video form. As Bo Cattlett said in Get Shorty: "I saw the best movie in the teeth."
