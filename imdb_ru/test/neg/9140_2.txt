I'm a huge fan of both Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, but this film is simply not good. The reviewer below is absolutely right that the stunning images of the Detroit station are the first and last memorable scene in the film. I really really would like to leave after that, instead of continuing to hope throughout the film. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt disappointed. <br /> <br /> The score almost repeats the previous two - not necessarily bad if you are a fan, but there is only one part that makes me stand out as fresh. However, it was good enough that I might still watch the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> But keep this in mind if you see this film: if you ever realize that you don’t enjoy it, go ahead and share - you don’t miss anything because it won’t get any better. <br /> <br /> Here I will give a summary (warning! spoilers!): lots of shots of athletes who look almost good enough for Nike advertising, pictures of smiling people, inexplicably boring frontal pictures of wax mannequins of famous people (WTF they thought here? !?), some giggling children (cuuuuute), some "bitchin '" Photoshop effects, some images that should offer a comparison of the flow of water, information, money and people (I think) ... and then a bunch of quick unrelated scenes of mass violence. .. and then a bunch of footage. <br /> <br /> I could redo this movie in 10 seconds. Here is my ear: <br /> <br /> 2 seconds of happy father with shaved head and lycra bicycle shorts, playing with a kid playing with a kitten playing a string; 5 seconds of this scene in the “Network”, where the guy talks about how to communicate with the “elemental forces of nature” and how “the money flows, the money flows”; 1 second of Reginald Denny with a brick, and then 3 seconds of Alan Bean, bouncing on the moon. <br /> <br /> That's all - it's 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life, which I just saved. Of course, I would take a copy of After Effects and apply one or two filters so that it does not look as obvious as it is now. If Stephen Soderbergh reads this, hey, I don’t even need a lot of money for this project ... <br /> <br /> If you insist on watching a movie about “Life Like War”, I suggest “Bowling for Columbine.” Instead, perhaps, pseudo-intelligent plywood is not as fashionable among a crowd of black turtlenecks, but at least it's funny.
