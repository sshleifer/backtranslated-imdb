Who looks after the store here? How could any producer / executive director / director of the network let the team shove the most curly plastic palm trees in the history of cinema into the sands of a Canadian winter beach and try to fool us like the tropics? These trees were for real palm trees, like K-Mart's pink tinsel Christmas tree for a real fir. And who let Dermot Mulroney go in front of a camera with gray hair that wouldnâ€™t pass by in a school play? And haven't any of the geniuses who control the quality of this thing thought to fix the (excellent) Canadian actor when he said gas instead of gas? Everyone who was involved in this amazing piece of the film - the writer, the director, the actors - did not just a good, but a brilliant work in other places. Too fast movement between events and deadly slow in them, devoid of any emotions, except for the obvious, explanatory and contrived - perhaps it only seems to be one of the worst films in all his life because of all the hype about the "Red Carpet" with which he was introduced. And I say this as someone who loves all his life. What gives guys? <br /> <br /> It all says about the work of a certain actress at a certain critical turn of the film (and if you saw it, you will understand exactly what I am talking about) was so brilliant that the film would get 10 from me if it was the whole movie. Unfortunately, it was only about five seconds.
