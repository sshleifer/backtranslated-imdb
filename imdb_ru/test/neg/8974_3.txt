After a rest before going to work, I watched my collection of 50 Movie Pack Comedy Classics DVDs and chose the most incomprehensible title from this series: “Zis Boom Bach” in the lead role - the forgotten Grace Hayes. “Classic” is definitely a working word, as most of the names I have never heard of, and I suspect that they are all in the public domain. Anyway, this film also starred her son Peter Lind and his wife Mary Healy (I just learned that she is a native of New Orleans from the state I live in, Louisiana), and Benny Rubin is the owner of the malt shop and Hantz Hall, resting with East Side Kids, as Peter's friend. The plot is about a vaudeville mom trying to turn her rich carefree son into a responsible person, with whom he doesn’t know who she is, for birds and doesn’t have many funny scenes, although I liked the role of celebrity Peter and his dance with Hall in dragging. And the songs and dances are interesting in their own right. Rubin, however, is everywhere with his confusion about the American language of the time, and almost everything about him makes no sense at all (although I liked his funny dance). Since I’m sure that this is just 61 minutes, played in the bottom half of the bill for dual functions, I will be a charity and give it 3 for the few entertaining moments that I mentioned while enjoying.
