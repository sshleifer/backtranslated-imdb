The first 10 minutes of the movie are ridiculed by the sequels and pg-13 movies Here are two reasons why the film is so bad. They constantly refer to the film “Get Leo,” which is the “short film to movie” version. Every time they do this, you will be very angry. Travolta is not very cool, like Keitel. However, Rock and Vince Vaughn are funny. They are not so funny, which you expect to see in the film Elmore Leonard. If you haven't seen a shorty yet, you will probably like to be cool. If you like to become a short person, you will leave the theater, wanting to kill the director and screenwriter. Wait for the DVD.
