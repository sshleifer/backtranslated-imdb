Deep Sea 3D is a terrific view of the underwater world, only a few had the opportunity to see it first hand. <br /> <br /> From the initial episode, when the wave rushes to an audience that swallows us for a moment in the ocean, the filmmakers fully use the IMAX format. The field of jellyfish, it seems, fills the entire theater, the forces of the shark come to us, the predators run from behind the rocks and devour their prey. This is a beautifully captured underwater feast for the eyes. <br /> <br /> Our ears, on the other hand, do not receive the same treatment. The film is told by Hollywood stars Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. Both sound so funny that positively spoil the fun of visual effects. Depp sounds a bit boring, and Winslet sounds like he reads a bedtime story to a village idiot. I was shocked that the actress of her status could be so wrong to regard her performance. The script is pretty stupid and contains very little depth. The soundtrack is filled with weird, unrealistic sound effects that I suppose should be funny, but actually distract attention from the material that was supposed to speak for itself. <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman gave an excellent mark, which has many implications for the ups and downs of life under the sea, when you are allowed to play without the silly sounds of bubbles or the blows of crabs that are glove. <br /> <br /> The film is a technical miracle, but with its children's script, annoying narrative and inappropriate sound effects, it cannot be taken seriously.
