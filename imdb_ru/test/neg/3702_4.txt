The movies of the Science Fiction Channel (Sci-Fi Channel) have become boringly predictable. It would seem that there is not enough budget, originality and plot. <br /> <br /> In this creation, the government seeks to get a bunch of telekinetic and gaining a poor soul in insidious ways to help. On the topic of the evil government organization there are a lot of revised turns. Black coats, shadows, short meaningless lines make these one-dimensional cartoons. <br /> <br /> Daniel De Kim stands out as a good actor in a small role. He brings a bit of his angelic character to the role. It's hard to miss the link that his Crusade character was a telepath, and this is a film about telekinetics. Was this sci-fi casting to try to attract fans from another show? Who knows. Fortunately, he is a worthy actor and enjoys watching. <br /> <br /> The film is definitely low-budget. It reflects the current model of Canadian locations of Sci-Fi Channels, little known characters, few effects, and a terrible horror story and character development. One would think that they believe that fans of science fiction will see something marked as "fiction." <br /> <br /> If you want a good film about telekinesis, see “Rage” (1978).
