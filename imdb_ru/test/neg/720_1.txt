It was an interesting adaptation of the last famous solo play by William Shakespeare, but, in my humble opinion, terrible. Jarman is trying to change the personality of the characters to begin with. He makes Miranda seem insane after a long stay on the island. Prospero is no different - a mixture of insanity and self-pity on his part. I could not imagine that Shakespeare thinks his characters are similar to the way Jarman portrays them. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only thing he understood was the appearance of Caliban, but again I got the impression that Caliban was a weary, deformed monster, but it turns out to be a crazy vagabond, a northerner who constantly chuckles as I could imagine. Ferdinand looks short, almost naked and quiet. <br /> <br /> In fact, by the time I stopped watching this terrible adaptation, there were so many of them that were cut from the play. Anyway, I think that Jarman tried to rewrite Shakespeare and turn on his own scenes more often. So much of the text is cut out in the first part, which makes it not a Shakespeare play, but a load of melodramatic, ridiculous rubbish from the 70s. <br /> <br /> In the end, the attempt to interpret this play more realistically, but this game was never realistic, and there was nothing in it like a text.
