Franco's films can be divided into 4 categories: “the earliest” (often black-and-white and inventive), “naughty” (late 1960s - early 1970s, often with Soledad Miranda), using frontal female nudity, as a plot drive) and “everything else.” <br /> <br /> This is the “rest” part. This is not a film about cannibalism. This, of course, is not Gorefest. The few women in the picture do not even lose their loincloths, and there is almost nothing on them. The quality of the image on the German DVD, which I watched, leaves much to be desired. The film ends (as long as it lights up). As a fan of Franco, I would tell others not to worry. Do something else with your time ... read the book .... get a copy of "Women in prison block 9" ... something really ...
