The channel Lifetime went on the air in October, but I just watched it. Is this the old perpetual triangle again ?? Connecticut's little boy Dave Ford (Matt Long) quickly communicates with his best friend's friend Emmanuelle Chriqui on the eve of his departure for law school in New York, thinking about her for the next five years, until he fulfills contracts and briefings , confronts her again when he returns home after the death of his father on the eve of a large exam five years later, and again enters into a romantic relationship with her. But the director and co-writer Matthew Cole Weiss does his best to describe all this in the memoirs, as Dave confesses to the murder of Emily, her husband and another of her lovers in front of (here goes the spoiler) a lesbian policeman, who is also Emily's flame. Weiss bends the "Fold" effect, which Dave gets to see pieces of his previous flash life before his eyes even before he is actually dead, cutting those, even while Dave and Emily are having sex and thus destroying the soft core Porn snapshots, which give even some otherwise otherwise rather inconclusive films of longevity, at least a little attract the audience. I couldn't help but remember myself to James M. Kane, and how much better he wrote such women in his classic thrillers (all adapted to the hits), “The postman always calls twice,” “Double insurance” and “Mildred Pierce”. ” It also does not help that the film ends with the fact that the bad guys (in fact, bad girls) triumph, and the decent, albeit naive and stupid hero, apparently, goes to the lethal injection table ?? or that the actors playing the people Dave and Emily cheat on look better than they do. By the way, although this film went to the USA in a cable channel, there were several empty spots on the soundtrack, indicating where the cursed words were cursed, so I guess it got a theatrical release somewhere in the world.
