I watched this film with my boyfriend, an avid hip-hop fan, and he really wanted to catch the "soulful" atmosphere that the film was said to have. Boy, we were completely wrong. When I finished watching the movie, I felt two things: remorse and relief. Repentance, because I regretted having spent my time watching this terrible piece of manure, and relief, because I watched it for free on cable. <br /> <br /> This film really does give notoriety to dark-skinned people, putting so bad stereotypes that I believe all smart black people all over the world are trying to drive out. I am Asian, and I am very, very sorry and sick of those who made this film. What else to say? Bad writing, even worse acting skills and terrible plot. <br /> <br /> Even if you are bored to death and you have no other choice, do not watch this movie. Seriously. The film really has nothing to offer, except when you want to see such things as insignificant illegal drinking, killed animals, the degradation of women and in general: REALLY REALLY BAD, EXPECTING, EXACTLY EXACT FILM. Ugh.
