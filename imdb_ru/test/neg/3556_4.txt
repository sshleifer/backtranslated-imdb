Ealing comedies make up their own special subgenre in cinema history. They were crooked, funny reflections on British life in the late forties and early fifties. They are always funny, but I feel that misleading them is a comedy. They are fresh and good-natured, not ridiculous. Nevertheless, the best of them are permeated with understated satire and permeated with an occasional dark stripe (especially “Kind Hearts” and “Koronets” and “Ledikillers”). <br /> <br /> I have affection for all of them, except Lavender. Hill Mob is probably the one with which I have the most problems. Compared to the others, it looks somewhat superficial. For me, this is a sketch for the film, but he had to spend much more time developing before he was ready to work in front of the cameras. <br /> <br /> Everything about it is a little undercooked. For example, no one is given any real context or background. Henry is just a humble friend, whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions remain unrecognizable, while Albert is a disappointed artist, forced to indulge his talent, earning a living from a gift shop. This creates a motive for their crime, but nothing of what subsequently happens is the result of either their characters or their plan. <br /> <br /> Other characters are represented, but play no real role in the story. An elderly resident in the guest house, Henry could (because of her love for detective stories) become an unwitting thorn on his side, but was simply used as a background color. Similarly, the various police officers who come and go out of the game, just to keep the plot moving. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film is completely controlled by its contrived plot devices, which I find both frustrating and slightly annoying. A not-so-brilliant robbery takes place with minimal problems, despite the fact that Albert cannot fulfill his role in the plan (Clayton Sydney Taflera). The gold is then smuggled into France without incident. Everything would go smoothly if it were not for the minute hitch, clumsily based on the French pronunciation of the letter “R”, with the result that the six golden Eiffel towers were randomly sold to some English schoolgirls. <br /> This leads to a series of insane chases when Henry and Albert try to find them. These scenes are well executed, but at each moment the conspirators are disappointed in the pursuit of schoolgirls by a series of completely artificial accidents. As if God intentionally intervenes to give them a hard time. Such plots always make me grit my teeth. <br /> <br /> When they finally track the last Eiffel Tower at an exhibition at the Police Academy and pull it out from under the nose of Police Inspector John Gregson (why is he there, anyway?) All pieces of plot logic are abandoned. The final chase after the car simply fills the screen time until we return to the framing device that started the picture. <br /> <br /> The film does not even tell us about the fate of Albert (Stanley Holloway), Lackery (Sid James) and Shorty (Alfie Bass). <br /> <br /> This ingenious little captain is backed by the professionalism of the Ealing team, so this is not a bad film. I suspect that most viewers will find it much more enjoyable than I am (and why not?), But I can't help but think that there was a much better film that expects to be made if only more time and effort were spent on making a movie. and characters, and stories. <br /> <br /> According to standards established by Ealing, Lavender Hill Mob is a lost opportunity. <br /> <br /> PS: One curious footnote is that Audrey Hepburn gets a loan for her only line at an early stage, but Archie Duncan remains anonymous, despite his much more significant contribution. I think she just had the best agent.
