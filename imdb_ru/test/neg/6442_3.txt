I spent three months living in the East End of London in the second half of 1987, when the show was on the air for almost two years. There it was considered a ridiculous joke. <br /> <br /> Why? Because he had a completely white shade. Each cast and additional workers in the first couple of years were white. <br /> <br /> The street where I lived was long, with more than 800 houses, and as far as I know, I was one of three or four white faces living on this street. We were at the corner of the Indian and Turkish “quarters,” and even if you eliminate these two races, Asians and Afro-Caribians outnumbered twenty-one white people. Plus, of course, of the very few white people who * lived * in the area, the overwhelming majority were Scots, like me, - the Cockney accent was never heard. <br /> <br /> This was not a racist rant, just a simple statement of facts. The BBC either did not bother to cross London to conduct its research before writing this soap, or they had only white actors, and they decided to deceive him. <br /> <br /> In any case, as I say, in the East End of that time, we considered it a comedy show. :-)
