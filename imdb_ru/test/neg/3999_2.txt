The emotionally insecure Tom Rousseau (Asbestos Felt) reads the secret diary of his sexy wife Lisa (Courtney Lerkara) and discovers with horror that the love of his life has obviously slept with every boy she meets; this shocking revelation repels poor Tom from his rocker, and he begins a bloody revenge on the men who, in his opinion, offended his old lady. <br /> <br /> In my experience, really very bad films can often be as much fun as really good ones, and not a single film with a decoupling from a ceiling fan with a machete can be considered absolutely useless; but although Killing Spree rarely manages to entertain with his ingenuity and cheap and cheerful blood, I found that a terrible direction, terrible production values, an ugly cinema, a muffled sound, terrible lighting, a tediously boring and silly story wired from the very beginning, plus a meaningless zombie finale), a nasty synth score, meaningless dialogue and a completely amateur game - all this made the writer / director effort Tom Ritter is almost a joyless experience.
