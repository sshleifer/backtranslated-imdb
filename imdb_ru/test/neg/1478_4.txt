Again, I seem to be the only person on planet Earth who is able to criticize Japanese films shot before 1970. “Fires on the Plain” (1959) is another of the seemingly endless line of “classics”, which receives all kinds of praise for no apparent reason. No matter how much I love to overly generalize and psychoanalyze all these moviegoers who have such terrible taste in a film, it is still almost impossible to explain why anyone ever thought that such a poorly-made fluff should be declared a kind of “masterpiece”. What I find truly ironic is that fans of a derivative of “classics,” such as “Fires in the Plain,” devote so much attention to creating films “inside the box” (orthodox evaluation standards, such as script, acting, cinematography, and D.) It always seems that the most respected "classics" are the most imperfect in these very standards. For example, one of the most lazy companions for the director includes forced verbal exposure, where the characters basically explain everything to the viewer, even if the constructed script is completely artificial. The most amazing thing is that in the very first scene of “Fires in the Plain” this reckless tactic is used to the extreme. <br /> <br /> After a funny slap on the head, the next useless dialogue attacks the viewer: “Why can't you understand the situation? We landed west under heavy fire to reinforce the units in Tacloban. We lost two thirds of our people. Our artillery was sunk in transit. We tried to get to Burauen airfield, crossing the central mountains, but without artillery it was impossible. Counterattack of the enemy forced to disperse the valley. You know that. “So why does one character tell another already what he already knows? Oh yes, that's right, the creators of this film are too lazy to think about more natural ways of conveying this information. You see, a quality film actually shows what is happening or in the worst case, it involves a dialogue with the participation of one character who does not know about these events. Damn it, even an introductory summary in the form of a paragraph directed at the viewer would be better than what it turned out here. <br /> <br / > Such cases of low-quality film pro industries abound everywhere in Fire on the Plain, and this is exactly where this film feels like it was written by fools for fools. For example, the main character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in Japanese clothes. Instead of doing a natural thing, how ?? oh I don`t know ?? giving depressed mannerism, the character blurts out "Japanese soldiers." Thanks, buddy, but I could figure it out for myself. <br /> <br /> Worse, this film is overly dramatic tricks. The funniest scene includes a pair of shoes. Submit it. The soldier goes and finds a pair of worn boots. One would think that such a find is completely useless, but it turns out that the soldier’s boots are in an even worse condition, so he picks up his worn-out boots and leaves his SUPER worn-out boots behind. OK I understood. Soldiers in rude form ?? a fact that has already been clearly emphasized by their worn shoes for a start. The scene is ridiculous, but I was ready to let it go until the SECOND soldier arrives! You see, he finds a SUPER worn-out boots of the previous soldier and notices ?? get ready because it comes ?? that his boots are SUPER DUPER! Lucky, he picks up the SUPER worn out shoes and leaves his SUPER DUPER worn out shoes behind. But you see, that's not all ?? because then the THIRD soldier arrives! He finds former soldiers wearing SUPER DUPER boots and inspects them along with his own worn SUPER DUPER boots. As both couples suck, he throws them both aside and smiles, continuing barefoot. At that moment I was ready to throw the TV through the window of my living room. The severity, excessive drama and paramount absurdity of this sequence go beyond the bounds of poor filmmaking. This is SUPER-DUPER - bad filming. <br /> <br /> There are a number of similar, completely stupid moments. For example, the time when the main character asks someone: “Hey, are you dead?” As if the guy would say “Yes,” if he actually kicked the bucket. I will also be the first to condemn the poor-quality game of the main actor, who is the main author of the artificial reaction. I laughed heavily during this first slap, when his horned head returned to its place with such a stupid, stupid expression on his face. <br /> <br /> The fact that this trivial fluff gets an average score of IMDb is 8.4, and the verifiable Masterpiece like “The Tale of Two Sisters” (2003) gets only 7.5 - this is the height of mass stupidity. And to think that some people actually deceive themselves, thinking that “AToTS” does not make sense. Well, not every movie can have completely outrageous SUPER DUPER shoes.
