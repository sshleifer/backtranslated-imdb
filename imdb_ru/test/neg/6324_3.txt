Ok, where to start. I can not believe how many good reviews I read here. I watched it (2004), and I had to struggle not to press the stop button, I decided to continue only because of all the good reviews that I read. After watching, I felt obliged to tell the world about it. Firstly, it seems that the movie will never start, the storyline does not actually occur about 30 minutes before the end of the movie, and the viewer asks the question: “When will it start?” that revenge does not even begin until more than half of the film has passed. In addition, the film is trying to convince you that this is post-apocalyptic Australia. I regret if showing dusty rural roads to half the film and the crooked letter on the tablet did not convince me of this, even for 1979 it was not science fiction. Anyway, add it on top of a randomly placed homoerotic undercurrent, and you get yourself a shitty movie (I have nothing against gays, it just wasn’t necessary). The only good part was the first chase scene, good direction, considering that it was 1979, and the other good part is how he killed the last guy. So basically, I recommend that you watch the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes, and you will enjoy a lot more than if you were sitting in the middle of all this, which could lead to a knockout of your own eyes. Do not say that I did not warn you.
