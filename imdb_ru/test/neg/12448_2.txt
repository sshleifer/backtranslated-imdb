It was pretty bad - because of bad games, bad technical details, bad camera shots and bad sound (although I watched a DVD, sometimes I could not hear what they were saying, sometimes it blew into my speakers, even inside the same conversation ). The plot was predictable, and the characters consisted mainly of incredible neurotics, bipolar and caricatures. Character development was awful ... stupid little sister (why was she even written in the script?), Dull mother (again - for what purpose?) Weeping girlfriend (why didn't he leave her long ago?), A gang of "dark costumes "(As far as original - I can't think of a better name, I think), a hot girlfriend of a drug dealer (there must be a hot Latina, if you have gangs of Los Angeles, I think, but actually ...), etc. etc., etc. Can't believe I watched it all.
