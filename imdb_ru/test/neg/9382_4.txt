It all starts pretty well, but after a while you start to expect more from this movie than you actually get. Everything becomes unclear and remains unclear. Czech directors were good 20 or more years ago. But after they moved to a capitalist country, here is the Czech unofficial but well-known mentality ... COPY ... COPY ... COPY everything they think is good when they see it in other films, countries or where something else. I think this is a good example of creating “art”, “politics”, “horror”, “humor”, “film” and money. And it remains to me from / “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”, which cannot be compared with this film in terms of ART and ACTORS, HISTORY AND POLITICS. I think this movie is boring. This can be done better. At least they tried. Sorry guys. :-( I can not recommend
