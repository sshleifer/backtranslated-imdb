I was a fan of Jim Henson and his characters from the start. The most attractive thing about them was the manifested love, innocence and camaraderie. Kermit was a role model for deep thinking and problem solving. Spiritual character, but sweet and believable. All the other characters were a bit eccentric, but it demonstrated how different types of creatures can coexist in a caring manner, respecting the difference with each other. <br /> <br /> The following films have somewhat retained the same atmosphere. However, this “Very Merry Christmas Movie with Dolls” would have made Jim Henson spin in his grave. These characters were completely rewritten to be agitated, nasty, selfish, and stupid. <br /> <br /> In the cast, God is portrayed as an impartial corporate leader with malicious intent. Angels as a characterless, unspiritual corporate staff, and the film was so bad that I had to stop watching. I bought it for my great-nephew, but fortunately, I preview everything I give to the child. <br /> <br /> This film deserves a trash can and has no social or redemptive content. > Shame, shame to people who rewrote the characters and come out of the original socially-conscious version of Jim Henson. It does a terrible disservice to a great man who is no longer there to protect his creations.
