Good,. so I went to this loving RuPaul. I still love him / her, but I think a little less. This is one rough film that shows a lot of male genitalia. This is a fake black film about the operation of the 1970s and purposefully done poorly. The only fun part for me is that all the voices were fixated on the voices of transvestites, even the voices of real women. It's more than, nonstop, laugh at your ass, it's so stupid, a poorly made movie. I would never watch it again, but I appreciate what the filmmakers tried to do. There is no rating for this matter, but it will be R or even NC-17. RuPaul did a much better job.
