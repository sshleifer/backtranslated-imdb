Of course, HOTD 2 is better than the first crappy festival of Uwe Boll, but it's like saying that sinking is better than being chopped alive. OK, well, I'm a little harsh with this, just adapting video games to zombie movies always leaves an unpleasant taste in your mouth. The resident evil was in order, but its consequences were pure garbage. The first HOT was the most interesting shit more than anything else; Uwe Boll took care of this. And HOTD 2 was ... better? The value of the entertainment was there, there were hot chicks, there was blood, but ... is that so? The script, although not at all qualitative, was better than the first. But the script contains horribly written characters, stupid sequences of actions, cliches and an ending that draws and continues to reach the level of absurdity that would make Bolmeister very, very proud. But it could be worse, right? <br /> <br /> HOTD 2 stars Sig Haig (Yes, Sid Haig) as a mad doctor looking for a cure for death. As you can guess, everything goes to hell. The nearby college campus seems to be the center of a zombie epidemic (or Hypersapien?), And, as you might expect, a team of commandos and two zombie scientists are trying to save the world by going there and neutralizing the problem. Their main goal? No, this is not an explosion. Instead, they need to take a zombie blood sample to create a cure for the deadly virus. Between this and that which lies lies the unassuming interaction of the characters, an unbearable amount of cliches (but hey, at least the black guy is not the first to be killed) and decent looking zombies. <br /> <br /> The game is tolerable. Who would have thought that Sticky Fingaz was a passable actor? Not me. Emmanuel Voigier and Ed Quinn shine as presenters. And the cast was also bearable. It was all bearable. <br /> <br /> The effect of cosmetics on the Zombies was fine, it could be worse than the first HOT: just the guys ran in dusty mummy costumes. Blood was all right. In this film, there are virtually no cheap fears and even cheaper tensions, which is good. The action sequences were stupid like f * ck, but at least there were no zombies fighting the sword or that ridiculous effect of a slow bullet. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie will appeal only to zombie lovers, arcade game lovers and those who want to make a cheap horror movie for the weekend. Obviously, there will be a third, as the end has hinted, but I would not count on it. Unless Uwe decides to do it. A 4
