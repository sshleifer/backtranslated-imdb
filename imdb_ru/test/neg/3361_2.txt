Hello, I'm Derrick Cannon, and I welcome you to the first ever Cannonite review. My film this week was debatable, what route, what film, what excellent four-star epic I would choose, guess that I decided to take one eighty and go the other way, I decided to review the film so terrible that it completely killed what could be a very unique concept. The film, which I will consider today, - "Jack Frost 2", "Revenge of the mutant-snowman-killer." Stars in this film include Christopher Allport as Sam Tiller, Eileen Seeley as Anna Tiller, Marsha Clark as Marla David Allen Brooks as Agent Manners, Shaun Patrick Murphy as Captain Fahn, Ray Cooney as Colonel and Scott Macdonald as the very snowman killer jack frost. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to believe that this film was in the same series that gave us incredibly funny Jack Frost (he loved the carrot scene), but it’s even harder to believe that this is exactly the same cast. The film was destroyed for me as soon as they arrived on the island, and Captain Fan was introduced. What was the essence of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie? The only possible reason I could see was that they wanted to give us a character who was just a killer snowman. Sam Tyler looked more paranoid than the original, his chatter about antifreeze was one of the most pitiful demonstrations I had seen in the movie. However, his wife was one of the few bright spots. She played the role of the main woman to the hand. She was the voice of reason in the film of pure idiocy. The scene where she finds out how to kill snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the film. Ray MacDonald did a great job again, like Jack Frost, despite being given one. If not for such weak characters, he could have been immortalized as Chucky, Freddie and Jason. Laugh if you want, but when it comes to the fact that Jack Frost spanked, he had a sense of humor, and most importantly, he had an undoubted vicious trait. <br /> <br /> This film could have been a lot more, it could have been a continuation of a big franchise, instead, any plans to make Jack Frost three were canceled. <br /> <br /> This film gets two out of ten for me, and fortunately, it even gets one.
