In the history of cinema there were several films that deceived the viewer, such as Hitchcock’s “stage fright”, Alejandro Amenabar’s “abre los ojos”, David Fincher’s “game” and this “ausentes” (“absent”). for starters, I don't like movies of this type, I feel that someone is trying to stretch my leg. <br /> <br /> Moreover, after watching this movie, no one knows what happened, such a confusing film. “The Shining” Kubrick may be a film better or worse, but he is definitely more honest than this many pretentious and dubious situations. <br /> <br /> technically, this is a good photo, good performance, and so on, but the script is so bad that I wonder what the producers saw to continue and remove this nonsense. <br /> <br /> and this film notes that the 3 guys who wrote the script (calparsoro, loriga and quiroga) got lost in the movie Trying to make a masterpiece - or trying to do something to satisfy their desires, expecting more personal projects.
