George Seagal lives with his elderly and senile mother. There are a lot of jokes about her dementia, similar to Alzheimer's disease, and most of them are not funny, although there were some funny moments scattered here and there (such as nude, running around the park scene and the old people's home). At first, Seagal tries to kill his mother, because it is hard to live with her, and because he is a selfish guy. Making a film like “Wiley Coyote” against the road comedy “Roadrunner”, where he tries to kill this indestructible girl again and again, it would be a cry - too bad that it was NOT the general tone of the film. <br /> <br /> I applaud Karl Reiner's attempt to make a tasteless film that is meant to offend everyone. In my heart a special place is occupied by such films as “ED AND HIS DEAD”, “EATING HAPPINESS” and “KATAKURIS'S HAPPINESS” - all films about death that they dared to insult. The problem here, however, is where is popp? There are some funny moments, but he also has a lot of flat, and overall the product is surprisingly soft. Plus, topics like homosexual rape, incest, and the like are really hard to make funny. In the Guide to Cult Films, I read that this is a cult film, although I just don’t see anyone who would like to see it more than once.
