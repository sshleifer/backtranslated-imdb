<br /> <br /> I still can't believe that Louis Gossett Jr. agreed to star in this movie. Everything in this movement seems artificial, forced and contrived. Air sequences are flat. Enemy characters seem like puppets. This is just a bad excuse movie. At least Top Gun had airy strings that looked good (external shots anyway). Although Queen songs are great. Rent halfway instead.
