This is really bad, the characters were soft, the story was boring, and there is no sex scene. In addition, there is no drama in it, the conflict is minimal, which makes it extremely slow. Nothing happens in this movie, you expect a sex scene, but they just kiss. The plot revolves around three characters, a man, his wife and a stranger, whom they pick up from the road. The couple invites a stranger to stay with them because he is homeless. At this point, you expect a stranger to have sex with his wife, right? No, they just kiss and that's it. In addition, in this film there is no action, no comedy, no drama, or even expectations. Makes you think that maybe the studio did not even read this script !!!!
