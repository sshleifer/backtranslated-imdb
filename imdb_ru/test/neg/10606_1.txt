Being a fan of the show, I thought how bad a movie could be? Well, I got my answer. Some films should never be made. Why call it a remake of the series, if the only similarity is that there are three main characters. Pete's character on the show wasn’t a whiny little kid, as shown in the film. The only good thing about this movie, other than music and the fact that Claire Danes is good, was that it was short. What's up with this dance scene ??? The only reason I didn’t come out of this film was because it was so bad that it became ridiculous. Maybe it was a plan! It's really bad when a cheap TV show of the 60s is better than the 90-million movie of the 90s. El Mariachi was only $ 7,000, and the film is much better. Do not even spend your money when they go on tape, they are not even worth renting.
