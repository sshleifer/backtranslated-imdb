I can imagine how the authors of this story come up with this scenario: <br /> <br /> 1. Let us make a serial killer, for example, “Se7en”, “The movement of the knight”, “Copy” and “Silence of the Lambs”. People like a serial killer. It will sell ... 2. The killer must accept some kind of model. I know; he will copy it from a mystical novel about a serial killer. This has not yet been done, at least not quite. 3. Now we need some way to make this movie unique; Of course, a good guy can be bedridden, as in the rear window. 4. Finally, we need a finale that will give the film the success of “The Sixth Sense” and “Ordinary Suspects”. <br /> <br /> Okay, now that you know these things, you know the whole movie, so don't waste your money. One thing that I really hate in filmmakers is that they take a completely good concept for films and fully embed them in life. I wrote better stories than this when I was in high school. I just kept checking my watch every five minutes. When the turn was finally over, I was not shocked, I just said: “Oh, who cares?!” The two-dimensional characters. They have your typical personality in a movie. This film is merely proof that the theft of elements from other successful films does not justify a bad script. I give this film 1 out of 10. As a rule, he will earn at least 2 or 3, but I'm so tired of the lack of originality. When will they study? 1/10
