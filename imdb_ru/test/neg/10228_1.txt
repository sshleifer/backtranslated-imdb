HOW MANY FILMS DO I HAVE IN WHY AGAINST ALL THE PARTIES, THE RAGTAG TEAM GOES A LARGE GUIDE WITH ALL MONEY !!!!!!!! There is nothing new in Big Green. Anyway, you want them to lose. Steve Guttenberg had such a good resume (“Boys from Brazil”, “Police Academy”, “Cocoon”). Why, Oh, WHY, should he have made such films during the 1990s and beyond ?! So just avoid this movie. There are a lot of good films, so there is no reason to spend your time and money on this garbage. Obviously, money was "green" in their minds, because there is no creativity here. At least in recent years, Disney has released some clever Pixar movies.
