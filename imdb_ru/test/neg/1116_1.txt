Even with the low standards of a dedicated horror fan, I found this movie terrible. It was a huge disappointment since it was shown as one of eight horror films. I can only hope that the other seven were better. I was really embarrassed about the friends I was able to convince to see, and these are the very friends I made to watch a remake of The Wicker Man. It has all the clichés. In fact, he turned them on with all his might. Let's start with the characters. Instead of one young unhappy girl, we get three: a lonely, hot mother with two daughters ?? a blooming but brainless teenager and a sweet, but at the same time creepy little girl you just know will have special skills, including supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with the dead. The little girl is the same as in the Amityville Horror remake. She was a bit annoying, but not as annoying as Dakota Fanning. <br /> <br /> Overall, these characters seemed like fugitives from the LifeTime movie. I thought that, perhaps, horror films came out of the scenes where female characters go to bed in full makeup and run in the dark, announcing their presence to everyone who has ears, but not to this one. I also find it incredible that none of them bother to protect the front door from arbitrary opening day and night. To give you an idea of ​​how inconspicuous I was with these characters, I spent most of my time thinking about how cold it was on the set, because everyone was wearing coats even in their homes and how white their teeth were. /> <br /> Despite all the formal plot frauds, the film does not create any tension at all, except to be surprised when it ends. The atmosphere in the local giant is more in the midst of the most ordinary days after lunch. As for the dialogue, I could take quotes from ten other films and communicate better, more believably. The blood level, the sweetness for the horror fan, was minimal at best. Without their tiny weapons, the zombies were not at all threatening. You could throw a couple of them across the room. <br /> <br /> What really kills is her banality. Horror films, more than any other genre, cannot survive without inspiring mediocrity. Give me a horror movie that is out of place or outrageously filled with blood. I can even take new ones with their excruciating torture. From time to time I will appreciate the truly frightening, anything but this.
