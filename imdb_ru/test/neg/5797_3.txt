If there is an unimaginable, hackneyed story and soft characters in the film, he should make up for it, being very, very funny. You can get away with it if you find it funny. But although there are several funny moments in “Grandma's Kid”, they are so far away, and there is so little time between them that they cannot begin to compensate for the hacker work that the film demonstrates in such abundance. <br /> <br /> The film definitely does not aim to surprise anyone. When Alex hides marijuana in his grandmother's house in a tea jar, you know what will happen later, and it happens. It seems that the film was written by a committee that studied mediocre comedies and grabbed any gag that appeared in more than one of them. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing in the film is a somewhat unusual setting. The game takes place in a video game development company, which should be an interesting source for some tricky comedy. But don't be fooled, this is not a movie about video game developers. In fact, this is a film about the fraternity, in which all the boys were thrown into a large room to play video games. <br /> <br /> The way in which the film is completely unable to think about how to set it up and use it for the original game. Laughter can be seen in the character of JPJP, I think, more or less collusion by the creator of Doom, John Carmack. At least, inspired by the fact that he is a strange genius who makes games. <br /> <br /> In the film J.P. - a strange, disgusting idiot who is scorned and ridiculed by testers of the company. It makes no sense. If you are one of the most significant people in the history of video games (as JP believes), then even if you are cunning and nasty, people will still admire and respect you at some level. If Stephen Hawking is nasty, his partners are still not going to pursue him. <br /> <br /> In addition, game testers are as likely to be fans as JP, but in the film they are mostly fraternal boys. These are fun normal guys against a disgusting movie. And although this formula worked, very rarely, in the past, it is absurd in the game company. If you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie, you will not just squeeze all movie symbols from different settings into it. Unless you are a cracker. <br /> <br /> About two thirds of the film I gave up. Something happened that I knew would lead to a series of painfully predictable events. And I realized that in fact I hadn’t been laughing at anything for the last half hour. So I stopped (although I did fast forward, just to make sure that I was right, that they would follow the most predictable cliches, which they did). <br /> <br /> Usually, if the film is bad, I just say that it is bad, and then there are not enough words to say, but this film is so phenomenally cheesy that it deserves a long diatribe. <br /> <br /> Shame on the film for luring a good actress into it, such as Linda Cardellini, and then surrounded her incompetent people. I'll give the film 1 point for the fact that Shirley Jones got a chance to become Anti Shirley Partridge.
