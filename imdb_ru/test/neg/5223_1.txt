Recently, I had an idea to make a short film about a man who was hit by a car, and he woke up thinking that he was Chuck Norris himself. This meant that I needed to carry out Chuck's extensive research and find out as much as possible about this person. Later I find out that he is not really a man, but an angel sent from heaven. With such a face, who could doubt it? Over the past four months I have watched more Chuck Norris films than any other person. I can proudly say that Bells of Innocence is pretty close to the top worst ever. I spent most of the film wondering if I could return my copy to the local Wal-Mart without the receipt I bit to stop me from swallowing my own language. The main reason I decided to buy this film was that it was not only Chuck, but also his son Mike. I was eager to find out if Mike was a chip in the old block “you can’t act when leaving a wet paper bag” I came to the conclusion a long time ago; Chuck Norris is one of the worst actors in cinematic history for one simple reason. The only character he plays is Chuck Norris himself. No matter in which movie, in whatever situation it may be, it is always Chuck Norris. The only thing he holds over his son is that he is consistent. Mike doesn't seem to understand how human emotions work. In a scene where he talks to a little girl about his dead daughter, he seems very happy! Maybe this is because he actually pushed his daughter into the traffic jam, as shown in one of the strangest memories of all time. His actions confused me throughout the entire film, and it was very difficult for me to focus on that little conspiracy. The other two main actors were just as painful to look like the son of Norris. The guy who constantly wants to eat or tell a stupid joke with a peacock was just one of the most annoying characters that ever graced the Direct-to-Video screen. The only thing that I remember, he was in another film, except for the episode "Walker Texas Ranger", in which he plays an equally annoying character. Maybe Chuck owed something to this guy. The other guy, this is the only name I can remember, because it is so easy to forget, was your ordinary Christian fanatic. I have nothing against Christians, in fact I am alone, but this guy was too big for me. To complete the story, you have a lot of citizens who like to call people "friends", and a couple of villains who seem unable to decide who is responsible. Not to mention the creepy kids who remind me of the dollar store version of every other group of creepy kids in the movies. In general, the film is perhaps one of the biggest failures of all time, on more levels than Chuck Norris can kick ass people. Despite the fact that I'm one of the worst actors of all time, I still can't get enough of Chuck. Maybe he really was sent from heaven ...
