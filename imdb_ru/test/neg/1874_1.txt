You know, when you get older, for some reason you think that films that you didn’t like when you were younger could be caused by your youth and inexperience. For example, when I saw the Godfather at the age of 14, I thought it was boring. 20 years later, this is an incredible film for me. In other words, I grew up and began to appreciate great movies. <br /> <br /> I rented Dirty Dancing last night with my girlfriend at her request, because she loved it at 14, and I hated it at the same time age. But I was hoping, because I was young and stupid at 14 years old, maybe this will be a new experience for me. So I sat down to watch with her, hoping to be enlightened. <br /> <br /> At night after watching “Dirty Dancing,” I feel a disturbance. I feel that someone has penetrated into my soul and took 2 hours of my life from me from watching this cheese festival. <br /> <br /> At first, Patrick Swayze plays a 20-year-old, but he looks like he's 35 years old. the premise of the film - he seduces a minor teenager, caring for her with his dance moves. Really creepy. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is a cliche where a guy from the “wrong side of the tracks” and a “rich smart girl” accidentally fall in love with each other. Of course, their romance is fueled by the fact that the "rich girl" does not know how to dance to lick, so the "poor hero" teaches her to become an experienced dancer at the end of a holiday show or something like that in a week. <br /> <br /> But you guessed it: a disapproving father soon enters and forbids the two of them to see each other, and the film shifts to secret meetings of dance and love lessons. All this culminates in the final scene, where the entire resort is rallying around two young lovers, while the once antagonistic father takes a 35-year-old dancer as a freshman to his teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> In the end, even my friend whined from the film, as she admitted, it was not at all what she remembered. I did not press on her, but I grinned a little and put Part II of The Godfather into the DVD player.
