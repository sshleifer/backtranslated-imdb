There were some decent moments in this movie, and a couple of times it was pretty funny. However, this did not compensate for the fact that, overall, it was an extremely boring movie. In this film there was no chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock, and I could not understand why he decided to even leave his future wife for the sake of this chick, which he allegedly knocked out of rut. In Armageddon between him and Liv Tyler was the best chemistry. Hell, between Sly and Sandra in the movie "Destroyer" was the best chemistry. <br /> <br /> There were several moments in the film that were simply not supposed to be present and painfully slow. <br /> <br /> This was a bad remake of My Best Friends' Weddings. Wait until it is removed for one and a half years on video, and rent it in a 49-cent dump bin, if you have nothing more to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon and you canâ€™t come up with rental movies.
