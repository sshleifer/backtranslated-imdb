In such pretentious stories the same technique is always used: 1) Throw away the opaque unstructured threads to confuse the audience. 2) Treat only “big” topics such as life, death, and God. 3) Make it look deep with scenes of life, death, sky, etc. 4) Rely on an intellectually weak audience to give you the advantage of doubt. 5) And finally, laugh to criticism. <br /> <br /> This film is pretentious artificial intellectualism in all its courage. These filmmakers not only do not answer any questions, they are afraid to ask questions from the very beginning. The film is held together in bunches. Directions rise and fall awkwardly. Pop cultural references are shaking and arbitrary. It is so little to indicate that any critical hits will be missed. <br /> <br /> Critics who have found the intellectual foundation for this film are afraid to admit the truth: they have no idea what this film is about. Good news: directors, too. Satisfactory attempts to provide answers to deep questions about human existence require intelligence, intelligence, poetry, and genius. Unfortunately, this film does not demonstrate any of these features.
