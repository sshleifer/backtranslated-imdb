I won’t spoil your surprise by mentioning any disgusting plot lines, I’ll just say that this movie suffers from bad animation due to acting, obvious tags ?? Here are some of his good qualities. if you are deserted on an isolated island and the only connection with civilization you received is the film “throw it at fish”. I can't tell you how sorry I am that I saw this horrible horrible movie. Speaking of which, this film, presumably, a horror film cannot be classified as such, because the only horror in the film is the playability of some actors.
