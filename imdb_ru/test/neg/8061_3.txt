One of the most notorious of the forbidden Video Nasties of the 1980s is also one of the most overblown. “Make them die slowly” - this is what you expect from the inventor Umberto Lenzi, who works in the jungle, an inventive (but poorly drawn) torture technique, some ridiculous “social comments” (yes, even more stupid than "Holocaust cannibalism"). and a lot of courage chewed. However, violence against a film is often shown only briefly and never stops for too long, which reduces its effect (interpret it as you can). Dialogue is the usual stupidity of Lenzi, since our male heroes demonstrate their affection for women, calling them "tw @ t" and the like. The composition of familiar faces (including Lorain de Celle, Giovanni Lombardo Raditz, Zora Kerov and Robert Kerman) does everything possible in the face of increasing idiocy (including the completely ridiculous “preservation of castration”), but cannot save this overworked, lousy effort.
