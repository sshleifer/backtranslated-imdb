This entry does not contain a spoiler. It's not obligatory. The film is as predictable as the sunrise. The element in the first films about aliens was the expectation that something CAN happen. So it was in the first two films "Predator", although less common. Requiem completely removed the element of obscurity and replaced it with blood and blood. You know that people will die (well, this is an AvsP film), but you know who will die and when they will die, and where they will die before this happens. Directors must take a lesson from Hitchcock, who said: “Suspension is not a time bomb breaking under the table. A suspension is a bomb that DOES NOT explode under the table. ” What is the point of going to the cinema when you know exactly what will happen and when? If you really, really want to watch this movie, wait until it is released on video, and then RENT IT, but in no case will I buy it.
