EXTREMELY rapidly developing, exciting, interesting, rich in details book. A huge shame that the film did not have any of these qualities. Not only was the gentle upbringing of Tom Hanks or Robert Langdon ridiculous, but the name changes to key characters, huge deviations from the original storyline and a bad Irish-Italian accent from Karmalgango by Evan McGregor, the worst book for EVER. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of the A & D book, I had high hopes for a more generous, truthful book for the book, where it began and ended the same way as the book - leaving me waiting for more. <br /> <br /> Whatever the film actually did, it put me down for the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> What was impressive was how ... sorry! I could not even finish this sentence without laughing. In short, <br /> <br /> Vittoria was an iconic beauty, who lost to Audrey Tatu for a second, and there were some very cute Alfa Romeos. <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading the book to understand that if Ron Howard insists on creating an OTHER book for the film, I would be happy to save 6 pounds on KFC spices and a few chicken wings - much more fascinating and more enjoyable!
