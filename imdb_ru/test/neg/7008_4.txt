The female cast of this movie is awesome: you have Linda Blair (beautifully grown), Julie Strain (who doesn't have too many conversational lines is good), Rochelle Swanson (as convincing as a cute innocent girl or an angry-tempered girl, Tony Naples, and the most beautiful of them - IMO, simply amazing Christina Dukati (like a stupid man, Larry Poindexter, deserved sexual intercourse with any of these women, remains a mystery) However, besides the opportunity to see these beautiful and in some cases talented x women, the film has little to offer. The plot is scattered and doesn't really start until the last 15 minutes or so, and when Vinorsky finally manages to create some uncertainty, an absurd “turn” of the end comes and destroys everything.
