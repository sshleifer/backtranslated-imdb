I just shot this movie on TCM, and I can understand why George Murphy went to politics if it was the best MGM that could serve him. It is so slow that the attempt to turn it into a real film noir was not crowned with success. It featured two of my favorite players <br /> <br /> in the film Yves Arden (completely wasted) and Dean Stockwell (the best actor in the film), but what struck me was that the lead lady Francis Gifford went 90 years. minutes (it seemed longer!) without changing her expression â€” her faint was ridiculous. John Hodiak played his part well, but the script allowed him and the rest of the actors to fall very hard. I gave him 4 stars mainly because of the photo. That would be in the first half of the Program when opportunities doubled.
