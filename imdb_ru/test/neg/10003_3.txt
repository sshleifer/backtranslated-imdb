Copper paintings (films are not suitable for them) are really somewhat copper. Their attractive visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high-end television commercials. But, unfortunately, the pictures of Brass are feature films with a feigned desire to entertain the audience for more than two hours! In this they fail miserably, their undeniable, but rather soft and flabby, and not paired, erotic qualities do not stand up. <br /> <br /> Senso '45 is a remake of the film by Luchino Visconti with the same name, with Alida Valley and Farley Granger at the head. The original tells the story of meaningless love and lust in Venice and its environs during the Italian wars of independence. To be precise, Brass moved the action from the 19th to the 20th century of 1945, so here you can see the murals of Mussolini, people in black shirts, German uniform or tattered partisan clothes. But this is just a window dressing, the historical context is completely insignificant. <br /> <br /> Anna Galiena plays an attractive aristocratic woman who falls in love with an immoral SS guy who always puts on too much lipstick. She is an attractive, versatile, well-trained Italian actress and clearly superior material. Her wide range of facial expressions (signal boredom, disgust, delight, fear, hate ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to watch this picture and it is worth two stars. She tolerates this mostly trashy business with an astounding amount of dignity. I would like some really good roles to come to her. She really deserves it.
