This movie had some funny moments. Louis, the main character was well played along with some other worthy characters. The first frame of the film set the tone, but from there the direction and plot went down. Besides turning in the end (interesting and funny), I would like this film to have a better direction and a more developed history. Without giving away the plot, the whole idea is better than good! I wish everything was better in this short film. Potential was, but he did not deliver the goods.
