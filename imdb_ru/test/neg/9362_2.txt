This is a film from "Toilet Pictures". If the name of the production company indicates how smelly the film is, then it will be so. I think that I’m not really a fan of horror films, not what I’m chicken, but rather this year alone, I’m not genuinely frightened by what has been offered so far, whether from the West or from Asia. 9:56 is no different, a great premise, but poor execution, relying on clichéd methods (I think these are the only trading tools available?) To try to reveal some points of heartbeat. <br /> <br /> Se Jin (Ko So-jung) is a lonely career woman who once remarks that in some apartments in a block of flats in front of her, there is a simultaneous power outage at exactly 9:56 pm every day. No, she is not a voyeur, but a series of unexplained deaths in the vicinity, including the one she encounters on the subway, begins to plunge her deeper and deeper into the mystery surrounding these deaths. <br /> <br /> With horror In films there is always a pseudological explanation of how ghosts appear. This is almost the most interesting thing that happens in the film, disentangling the "Truth", although experienced movie lovers will not need to guess the plot halfway. Which, of course, makes watching the film extremely unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> There are many characters, such as a girl in a wheelchair, neighbors who take care of her in turn, as well as a schoolgirl and a detective story. , mentally retarded boy and creepy commuter train. But, following the genre formula, these people are usually used as feed for death, or, in this case, the senseless characters of red herring, whose sole purpose the filmmakers are to mislead the audience, ignoring their intricacy, or add a little to advance the plot. br /> <br /> And don't get me on the methods used here. Rapid cuts, sudden appearances, ghouls with long hair (ahhhhhhh, so fast!), Which can not move normally, copious amounts of blood, as if it drains from the mountain for free, and the list goes on. But we must pay tribute to the sound engineers for creating some piercing ears of crispy sounds that are used with every movement of ghosts, although it looks like one trick with a pony. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time on it, even if you're a horror fan. This is a waste of a promising premise, and, in the end, you feel that you are just a ride. Very long and painful to endure. The time has come for some innovations in this genre, otherwise one film will easily look like another, with ugly long-haired monsters moving funny, but with the ability to suddenly appear accompanied by loud sounds. Oh, and can anyone smear these doors while they are there too.
