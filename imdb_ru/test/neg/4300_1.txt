Wow. I was told that this is bad, but I had no idea. <br /> <br /> We started the tradition. We found one copy of this film and just pass it from person to person. The one who has the film watches it and then passes it on to someone else who is considered worthy to see this unique, creative, terrible film. Hopefully he will travel the world several times. <br /> <br /> It hurts. It really hurts. It's even so bad, it's funny. Well, okay, sometimes it's so bad, it's funny. But in most cases, it just makes you feel that something is sucking inside your brain. <br /> <br /> Wow. Look, then tell me.
