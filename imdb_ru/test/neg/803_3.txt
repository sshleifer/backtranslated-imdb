Without actually being the worst science fiction film or the worst I have seen, Time Under Fire is still far below average. The premises and the first 10-15 minutes are not so bad, it all starts with the "X-Files", which combine the secrets of the Bermuda Triangle and time travel. Pretty soon, elements of other genres (too much) are mixed together, but the story never goes beyond the level of interest of the television series. Soon, Time Under Fire quickly degenerates into a series of clich√©s, not only mixing too many genres, but also not being able to create something memorable in tension or special effects that will help viewers remember the movie until tomorrow. Acting badly and the lines of rhetoric in the script do not help at all.
