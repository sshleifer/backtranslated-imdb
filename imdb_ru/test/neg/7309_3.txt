The figure of Empress Elizabeth of Austria (1837-1898), in fact, is mainly associated with Romy Schneider and the Sissy Ernst Mariska trilogy (1950s), where beauty, gentleness, sweetness, and also history are always present. It was Sissy, perhaps a myth for some; However, powerful image. The spirit of greatness of the Habsburgs, as well as the spirit of Bavarian simplicity and directness, had a great influence on these films. They just had a soul. Nevertheless, Jean Daniel Verhege’s film, although filmed 50 years later, seems to be the wrong depiction of the empress and her life. It seems to be an attempt to show something else, to reveal some realism as a cure for sweetness; yet this does not happen to add much, but rather deprives the whole story of much. Let me analyze this in more detail. <br /> <br /> In September 1898, Sissi leaves for the port of Geneva. Accompanied by a maid, she goes to visit Dr. Mayer (Didier Bezas), to whom she will tell the whole story of her life in order to find herself in this tragic life. The action consists of memories of important moments in the life of Sissy, but these moments are presented chaotically, and therefore someone who is not well versed in the history of Austria may be completely confused or confused. Much attention is paid to the unsuccessful marriage of Sissi with Emperor Franz Joseph. The scene of her wedding night failed. Nobody treated the Empress like that (I mean strip and pay). The focus on misunderstanding Sissy is historically correct, however, the points of view that her views differ from other courtiers are not true. Where is her desire for peace? Where is her love for her nation? Where is her charity? Sissy looks pretty elegant, modern, liberal (from the point of view of the 21st century). She primarily cares about her appearance, which is historically incorrect. Sissy had an inner life that was not shown in the film. “One day women will wear pants,” she said as a sentence, which seems to be the image of Sissy presented in the film. Sissy hates the monarchy, which is a prominent criticism of the film against the Austrian Empire. Moreover, she partially accepts anarchist movements and, to my great surprise, accuses her husband, Emperor Franz Joseph, of the death of their son Rudolph. Where in the story is it mentioned that Sissy was present in Mayerling? Sissy's relationship with Sophie, her mother-in-law, is better illustrated, but the scene of Sophie's death seems hardly genuine, and the conversation is a little cliche. <br /> <br /> Sorry to criticize so much, but another important aspect The film, which I think is weak here, is the performances. Although Ariel Dombal has his moments in the role of Sissy, she is usually not suitable for this role. She looks more like a “female fairy tale” than a tragic empress. Her makeup is seriously inaccurate, like most of her gestures as an empress. Malik Zidi is slightly better than Rudolph and can be considered as one who adds value to the overall performance. However, Stefan Odran doesn’t do a special job like Sophie: you just don’t get the impression why she hates Sissy. She despised her for the young age of Sissy, being crowned, for the sake of her behavior, lifestyle and her beliefs. It appears in part in the film, but definitely not enough. But the biggest mistake, I think, is Julien Hans Capua as Andrassy. Andrussi was a count with pride, honor, patriotism ... here he looks like a libertine, thinking only of making love with his queen. And the image is so weak that this view is very, very pale. The exact choice of Tatiana Ivanova in the role of Katherine Schratt, she really fits the role with her appearance and her gestures. But, unfortunately, its role does not require much time on the screen. <br /> <br /> Some costumes and quite authentic locations are a good moment of this movie. The port of Geneva is well represented, and the moment of Sissy’s death was a good surprise from the film. It seems that it is not; however, this moment is good from a symbolic point of view ... the empress walks and knows nothing, that this is her last moment. That's how she was supposed to relate to this, that's how one mad man destroyed part of the greatness of the world. Another good point was visually when Sissy talks to his son Rudolph on Corfu. But such moments are rare. <br /> <br /> In general, this is not a very good movie. He distorts a very outstanding historical figure, a significant historical time, he is trying to cure the sweetness of the Sissy trilogy, but does not seem to offer anything creative. The charm is gone, the greatness is gone, and the story is ignored! Not really worth looking for! 3/10
