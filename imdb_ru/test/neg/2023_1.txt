Considering that they wanted to make a film about vampires in space, I thought: “Well, it will probably be rather silly, but at least interesting enough to see a different look at the whole genre.” Oops. I don't care which movies you like; even if you're the world's biggest fan of vampires, horror, thrillers or unknowns, or even negative, if you have never seen a horror movie before and expect your first movie to be impressive anyway ... you are wrong I do not think that the film "Made for television" has ever seen or after school is so bad. I have never seen a television pilot show it badly. I have never seen footage of sleeping or shit animals that are so terrible. This is by far the biggest waste of hours you could spend thinking about the importance of kitchen towels and their impact on your life. I would prefer to be trapped in the bathroom for a few weeks when I would have nothing to consume except my own urine and excrement than to watch at least one clip of this film again. Watching this made me wish the fates that the characters encountered, instead of knowing that I paid money to watch it. It was, however, like a train wreck: so bad that you just could not look, hoping that something good could happen. This is not true. Please, for the love of God, if you or your friends - even if you are using prohibited substances - even think about watching this film, instead choose a contest to find out who can shoot the snotty rocket further. It will bring you much more fun and entertainment.
