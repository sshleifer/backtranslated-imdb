Do people appreciate this film because it is a film about foreign war? <br /> <br /> For me, this is just a bad Hollywood film about the war in German. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad on so many levels. Even to mention this with a platoon or all-metal sheath is absurd. The sequences of battles are pathetic, the dialogues and actions are terrible. <br /> <br /> This so-called group of "assault detachments" is a permanent member of the Wehrmacht. Not the SS. There are so many bad things in this movie, it's sad. Bad editing, bad game. He has everything. <br /> <br /> The film goes on and on, as if the audience must suffer just like soldiers. <br /> <br /> I read in a review that this film had a budget of $ 20 million. <br /> <br /> Really? Where was it spent? In fake train cars? In miserable "special effects"? Ugh. <br /> <br /> As a lover of World War II history and a World War II movie fan, I found this film a major disappointment. <br /> <br /> For a great alternative war movie, watch The Beast. ‚Äù (Not a World War II film, but still outstanding) <br /> <br /> Don't worry about it.
