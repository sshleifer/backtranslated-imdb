On the whole, the story, albeit rather visual, is actually decent and interesting enough for readers. However, the film was absolutely terrible. The story was good, but the game was terrible. I cried all the time because I knew that I could never go back. I do not see this movie. If you do, bring a pistol with a bullet in it and a few bullets if you are going with friends. I feel sorry for everyone who had anything to do with this movie. I also feel sorry for everyone who should have watched the movie. Avoid this movie at all costs, and if your mother makes you watch her, kill her. Hahahahaha! See! I'm crazy now !!!! IKWTCBS turned me into a psycho !!!!
