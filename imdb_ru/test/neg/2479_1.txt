Indeed, REALLY ... What pleases the audience (American!) In this so-called show is completely outside of me. What we can learn from these series: <br /> <br /> 1. Each casino spends about 2-3 billion dollars a year on satellite rental and a huge number of high-tech high-resolution cameras for its security personnel. Let the FBI bite their dust. <br /> <br /> 2. Each security officer should have a voluptuous chest, of course, natural. Boobs must be shown constantly, otherwise they will lose their jobs. <br /> <br /> 3. If the employee is a man, he needs to implant his chest, then go to step 2. <br /> <br /> 4. Only in Hollywood can you openly rip off the ideas of other shows, and then them as your own and call all this crap "original" and "art." <br /> <br /> 5. Any security with tits greater than 39D is considered immortal and cannot die. <br /> <br /> I would really like to be able to vote with negative values. 10/10 for that!
