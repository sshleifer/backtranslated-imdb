Our story: Two US Navy deep-sea divers are looking for silver coins hidden under the ocean off the Philippine coast. Our proof: extremely boring entertainment at its best, without a plot in sight. Jim Brown is completely wasted, providing his assistance in the production of this military turkey 70s. Richard Jakel in his usual form. Don Cornelius and Richard Pryor are among those who expressed special thanks for their contributions! BOMBS RELAX !!!
