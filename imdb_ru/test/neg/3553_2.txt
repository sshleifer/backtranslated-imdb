I had high hopes for this after reading previous reviews, but it was so slow and the plot was so simple that I wondered if I read the wrong reviews. <br /> <br /> Please, the boy meets the girl next door at 11 and both seek to love and be basketball legends. Grow apart, but watch each other's progress. Guess what! Both receive scholarships at the same university and become lovers again, until his father plays with a young woman. Our young hero, unable to cope with the situation, loses concentration in court, but somehow decides to go to the tests and quit his studies, and guess that he caught Lakers. Rejects the heroine, because she was not next to him in this emotional period. For the past 5 years they have been going their own way. She returns from Spain, losing interest in the game, and our hero gets married in two weeks. Mom tells her that she must fight for her love, so she confesses her constant love and challenges him in a basketball shootout. He wins, he marries, she wins, he loves her. Well, he won, but decides to throw another girl for our girl. The End has her basketball game, and he has children's responsibilities. Sorry 2 is my high score. My partner, she scored 0 for a soapy story for those who read Mills and Boon
