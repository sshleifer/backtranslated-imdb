Yes, it may not be historically accurate (in fact, only 6 soldiers of the 9th company were killed there), and yes, there are some errors and exaggerations in it (a bent machine gun? If someone wins, an educated Russian officer will know the history much better than this, for example, the British campaign in Afghanistan). And yes, he does not have multi-million dollar special effects in Hollywood style, but this is the strongest point to show the life of soldiers, their attitudes and feelings when the best friends are killed before their eyes. In my opinion, the 9th company really shows all these things well. <br /> <br /> Again, the film has its weaknesses, but, in my opinion, this is one of the most powerful Russian films in the past few years. years old. <br /> <br /> 8/10
