I accidentally watched this film (film?) and never stop watching, because it's so funny that any dog ​​can play this act and be better than the actors (actors?) of this poor remake of Fatal Attraction: a copy of the film by Adrian Line, if you have doubts about suicide, watch this and you can choose ... for "yes" <br /> <br /> I cannot imagine people who went to the movies to see this garbage; maybe someone who had an empty day and chose the first cinema near the house to stay for 2 hours with others to forget about the problems, but it is difficult to return home relaxed
