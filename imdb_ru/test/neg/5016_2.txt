I'm not so old that I can't remember how I laughed at Bobcat Goldthwait a couple of times. But in some places, where for all the years of drug addiction, he lost his sense of humor, as well as brain cells. <br /> <br /> Since the opening of the film you can have neither sympathy nor sympathy for a woman. Also, you will not find anything funny when you hear the introductory line. Goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade in order to feel better - even if these are his own imaginary characters that he humiliates. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen Shakes the Clown, you know how funny Bobcat was 15 years ago ... this movie is worse. It was not even funny by accident, it is sad, pathetic and a waste of time. Let Goldwith's hands be paralyzed so that he cannot write another script. Hit him with his tongue so that he could not dictate another unfunny scene. He is sad and pitiful and must make room for a new talent, dying to get into Hollywood
