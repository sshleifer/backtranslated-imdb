I'm not a big fan of musicals, although technically it can not be considered a musical. But I thought I would give him a chance, because I love movies about war. At best, it was mediocre. <br /> <br /> In this role, Hudson seems completely out of his mind. It just didn't work for me. Julie Andrews probably played her part as best she could, but I just find it difficult to buy her as a cunning, deceptive spy. Sorry, I know that this is a classic stereotype on my part. But I have to say that I think this is Julie in her most beautiful and feminine appearance. I always thought of her as more arrogance, but of course this is the result of her roles in “The Sound of Music” and Mary Poppins. No doubt they were desperate to get her out of this print shop in this role. She looked quite attractive, but I still did not buy her as a spy. <br /> <br /> I couldn’t concentrate throughout the whole film and found that I’m getting ready to go out - and I’m talking to those in my room (which I usually never do - I always keep silence on everyone). So this shows how little it held my attention. Do not waste your time!
