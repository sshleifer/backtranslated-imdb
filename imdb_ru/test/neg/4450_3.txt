I just watched this movie and was very disappointed. I did not expect much from the beginning, since the premise of the film still does not speak of greatness. Unfortunately, he does not even manage to deliver equally silly entertainment. The main problem is probably in action. While I’ve seen much worse actors in much worse films, the story would have required some people to act like violent maniacs, others like people who were in a really tense situation, and they couldn’t do it. Although I watched the German release, I watched with the original sound, so this is definitely not just a bad voiceover or something like that. In addition to this, the German release of the DVD seems to be cut off, all the killings are largely omitted, which means that with the exception of a few half-death scenes near the end, the German release will not be presented as a film for hounds. "Or. Of course I can not comment on this for other releases. There are some stupid moments in the storyline added back and forth, and the beginning is just ridiculous (have you ever heard of a demon visiting a psychiatrist?) It's a pity that the film takes itself too seriously if it was shot like a horror comedy and few o changed here and there, respectively, it could work better. The ending is just a huge disappointment. If you don’t have anything better and you just can't stand the boredom, you can (and this is really weak “Strength”) to consider this film. If there is something else that you can watch or do: choose this alternative.
