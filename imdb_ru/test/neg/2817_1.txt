“Kill the Queen of Screams” may sound like a good slasher, but this is terribly boring and very stupid. <br /> <br /> “Kill the Queen of Screams” tells about a crazy director who listens to girls who are shot in his film. He rapes and torments them. This is garbage that is not fun, stressful, or entertaining. The killer has no motive, okay, maybe he's just sick ... and very boring. Perhaps they could give the victim their own story. Everything can be an improvement. It was necessary much more. <br /> <br /> They could add a little more. I love horror movies / slasher, but this is ridiculously bad.
