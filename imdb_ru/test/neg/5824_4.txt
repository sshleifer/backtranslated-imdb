I think Purvis is starting to make a fun "Gone with the Wind." If so, sorry Tag, this did not happen. It also didn’t happen as a fun sex movie. I think I'm confused; what are we trying to do here? As much as I would like, I just can’t get to where I’m not enough for these characters. This film is effective in capturing the taste of decadence that lives in the South; it does nothing to explain, enlighten or promote my understanding of homosexual relationships or conflict, which the main character seems to be struggling with.
