The Mexican "classic" was the third entry in a series of Aztec mummies. As you will soon realize, this film is not just a classic, but rather a film that intentionally tries to tire you. <br /> <br /> A scholar wants to steal Aztec treasures from a tomb, but this tomb is guarded - this is a walking advertisement for toilet paper: Aztec mummy. Knowing that he can not defeat Mummy, he builds a robot, and very bad at it. We will see Mr. Robot only on the last drum, when he clings and fights with the Aztec mummy. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of lousy sci-fi movies, damn it, most of the Fi-Fi scientists that I see are lousy, but this one, because of its 64-minute length, is the worst movie I saw, with FUBAR, who goes in the next second .... <br /> <br /> In conclusion: Do not waste your time.
