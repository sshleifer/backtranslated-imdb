Pretty bad cheap PRC, which I rarely try to watch again, and no wonder - it is slow, squeaky and dull, like a butter knife. Crazy Dr. George Zucco is in this again, turning a haggard country man in overalls (Glenn Strange) into a wolf man. Unfortunately, the makeup is almost non-existent, consisting mostly of beards and dimestor fangs. If it were not for the presence of Zucco and Strange together with the sweet Ann Nagel, this would have been absolutely impossible. It is strange who continues to play the monster of Frankenstein in Unuiversal two years later, it seems that Lenny has the impression of “Mice and Men”. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
