This film could be a good little school thriller. Instead, we had a boring party about a whining, spoiled nanny. The problem was that there were too many unnecessary things. A fight with a guy, random friends come to be killed. It was obvious that they were just killing time. The main character was soft and uninteresting. Camilla Bell experienced no emotion during this film. She was just there. Another problem was that the killer was not a threat. Children survive, so it is obvious that they will allow Jill to survive. The only reason he got the four was because the last ten minutes (when the killer finally got off) were really exciting. <br /> <br /> 4/10
