“EXPERT” with Jeff Spikman in the lead role is the definition of “Dumb.” <br /> <br /> “Boring, characters, boring situations, boring tutorials, boring actors, boring cinematography, boring music.” <br /> <br /> I don’t really understand this movie. Should it be an action movie? It’s as if Speakman wanted to play in a serious film, but the level of acting and writing in “Expert” is lower than the average in a television drama. Both here and there are some typical scenes of "Speakman beats up bad guys", but the main aspect of the film is based on some believable drama that is completely unsuitable for Speakman or is so poorly directed that it simply does not work with an action the film looks and feels very slurred and boring. The worst aspect of loudspeaker is music. The composer is an imitator of Jerry Goldsmith with his pompous and melodramatic score, which is simply not in this (boring) film. It was as if the producers knew that they had a very boring product in their hands, and they asked the composer to make the film more convincing and dramatic with his score, which makes the whole film even more confusing, stupid and boring. <Br /> <br /> Don't waste your time watching, even if you're a fan of Jeff Speakman.
