My expectations were high after watching the trailer. They were even higher when I saw that the film had the same director as on Independence Day, and Godzilla. The special effects on Independence Day were much better than in this film. The whole movie I was waiting for the appearance of spiders. The rest of the story was really boring. And when the spiders appeared, they looked very amateurish, like special effects from a film shot in the 60s. I have not watched the entire movie. When it was playing for about an hour, I turned off my DVD player. I watch 3 films almost every night, and I never left the film, even if it was so boring. The only thing that is good about this movie was the pretty sheriff :) That's why I voted 2 instead of 1 :) So don't go watch this, instead you should rent the Star Troopers, it looks like the same thing, only 10.000 times better
