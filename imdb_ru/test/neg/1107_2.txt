One of the few reasons why these meaningless films can be made is to allow some actors to play a good role if they play well. The only good thing about this movie is the acting, the three main roles of the woman are better than most horror films like this one. There are 2 scenes that can cause an unexpected jump. <br /> <br /> Small young children crawl through holes and lay dynamite to explode mines. When someone collapses, as a result, all the children in the cave die, turning into zombies. Adults in the mine remain dead, there are no reasons why children become meat-eaters. While still alive, they looked frightened in front of the cave, innocent, so they should be angry with any adult who exploited them in the mines (the only reason that comes to mind). <br /> <br /> Mother and her 2 daughters move to a house near a mine together with a landowner who wants to build a resort, and another of those creepy people who seem to know exactly what is happening, but no one believes . <br /> <br /> Nothing new here You are the usual clich√©s, predictable, a lot of negatives for this film, very few positives.
