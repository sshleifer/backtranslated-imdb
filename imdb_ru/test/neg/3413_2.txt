I just saw this film in a beautiful air-conditioned movie theater here in Bangkok. And since the temperature outside fluctuates somewhere around 37C with very high humidity, my 100Bt was not wasted. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I have not seen such a piece of very well-made rubbish for a long time. This is a film that checks taste. Anyone who claims to love or love this, immediately goes to the same list of tasteless fakes that still go around talking about the superiority of British television. At least the old wide bump in the wheelchair was good for a few chuckles. <br /> <br /> Pseudo-likeness and thick lips, although typical of many French cinematographs, do not really make a good film. I would rather watch Independence Day 10 times in a row than sit through this bitch again.
