Ho hmmm - - - Nothing more. If you are a longtime fan of Rush, you know what this video contains: disgusting songs from the past, hits of “BIG 3” from the 80s and their “last attempts” to stay modern. They manage to make fun of themselves, beating critics, posing as "dinosaurs". Unfortunately, they are not able to protect themselves from embarrassment. Close-ups of their faces only reinforce the fact that these guys WAS. <br /> <br /> If you follow (as much as you can) the group for several decades, starting in the 70s, then you know that there is no new material here. Same old, same OLD: 1) Neil avoids the press, 2) no real backstage events (Heddy loses his FOOTWEAR?! Give me a break! Even HE thinks it's absurd!) 3) there are no new ideas. > <br /> Would a better video show a CREW setting within 3 or 4 hours ?? just let the camera do the work. And stop changing the camera angle every 2 seconds! I understand that the director wants to try to do something fancy. But then offer the full live version of 2 or 3 pictures that the OWNER can choose. Do we know what the band looks like? Let's see what WE REALLY want to see. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a BIG service: RENT this movie first.
