If you want to watch a horror movie that is terrible and has very bad taste, this movie is definitely worth seeing. This film begins with the fact that two young teenagers get wild ideas about going to chat and go on a blind date, and it is quite possible that they, like a little lamb, will end up in a slaughterhouse. Lots of blood, blood, nudity, handcuffs and all sorts of hooks to drain the blood and all that you never dreamed that a man could commit on men and women. If you like piercing, this type of piercing deals with heavy heavy hooks and lots of tattoos; in addition, a lot of needles and threads to seal things on the human body. I really hope that this film will not give some sick people in this world the idea of ​​playing out these horrors in real LIFE.
