What's the point? Hasn't it been done before, better? And again? Why does Werner Herzog spend his good talents and time on such things? Shouldn't he shoot a movie somewhere - I mean a real movie? <br /> <br /> From the beginning, everything seemed fake. Werner Herzog would never have tried to make a film about the myth of Loch Ness - at least on such a small scale, surrounded by losers - so the plot was not believable from the very beginning. The actors who must act as if they are not acting obviously act. The story was not interesting, the details of “ordinary people” in each mock-up were invisible, the personalities were not fresh, the jokes were not funny, the effects were inconclusive, and the final was nowhere to be seen. <br /> <br /> I just do not see the point. This is a fake movie about a fake movie. Ha, ha. Perhaps, if those who came up with such a film wanted to create a film that ridiculed people who really wanted to find the real Nessie, now this could have some potential. But the Duke is not a believer and never claimed it. In a mockery of a crowd of cryptozoologists, there would be much more fuel. <br /> <br /> It was miss.
