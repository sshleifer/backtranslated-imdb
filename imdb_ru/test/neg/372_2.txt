I did it in about 8 minutes in Steel Border before I turned it off. Then, thirst for punishment, that I, I watched the next day. Today I had to stroke a pile of clothes, so I decided to finish the film, and that was his own punishment. Here's what I don't understand: Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carrut spent $ 7,000 on their debut films and made two great films. However, here we have two directors with as much money as possible, and they produce a huge, steaming pile of crap. Let me see if I can understand the logic: “This is“ Road Warrior, ”but this is like a future western. We will have the cheapest “actors” we can find, ”we will ask my cousin with mental problems to write a script and we will spend the budget on a bunch of explosions. We can not lose! "<br /> <br /> Seriously. I don’t think that even the guys from MST3K could improve this. But if you insist on watching, I recommend getting drunk first.
