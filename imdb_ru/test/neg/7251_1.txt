Although my familiarity with world cultures is limited, I try. It was a movie that I tried and hated. Worst of all, having heard how many people condemn the superficiality of a typical Hollywood fare and its stereotyped caricatures, I saw characters too outrageous for Truth to be shown realistic. <br /> <br /> Clint wants to quit addiction and for this he aspires to be a waiter. The goal is always, I always say. Brad Dorif, or his photo by fax, or perhaps a curly wig on a stick, it was hard to say, offers to hire Clint if he gets a pair of shoes. <br /> <br /> Clint and Huge entourage, apparently, wanders throughout England, trying to get him shoes. In the end, they end up in a suburban house. Whose is not clear. Mom helps the girl to shoot. Oh, now there is realism for you! Mrs. Brady might have been a ridiculous stereotype of American housewives, but she never helped Marsha contact and find a vein. Oh god Dad comes home and sings Elvis tunes, and then drives the kids away. <br /> <br /> Why did Clint not borrow money and did not buy shoes in a second-hand store? Why did he not go to church and ask a kind nun for help? Why didn't he hang out in front of a shoe store and pen? I just do not know! None of this seemed under it. Friendly groups, such as Benevolence and the Salvation Army, have stores to help people. I know the people who work there! If someone without money appeared and needed shoes, the staff would give him shoes. Maybe not Prada or Gucci, but some form of foot cover. Not many of these groups give out cell phones to the poor, but there’s usually no problem with shoes. What a stupid concept. The world, or at least its western part, is simply not that cruel. In England, it may be from the Queen’s Charity, not from goodwill, but people who need shoes get it. <br /> <br /> Besides the search for shoes, there was no noticeable conspiracy to get in the way. actions. Not that the film is faster or more tolerant, notice. Despite the fact that I checked the tape recorder several times, I did not watch the extended 20-hour version, it just seemed. <br /> <br /> Clint got his shoes? Cardboard cutout Brad Dourif hired him at a restaurant? Did I watch anything else abroad? <br /> <br /> [spoiler] Yes, yes and yes. <br /> <br /> Regarding the fate of this film, I decided to end it. everything. I took out my S & W .45 and punched a half-inch hole in the cassette. Blammo! (I definitely rewound it first.) I put it back in the ribbon sleeve, returned it to the rental shop, and it's amazing that no one ever asked for it !!! This meant, of course, that no one else had rented it, at least for the remaining three years when I lived in this city. Others knew what I did not know. Live and learn. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you rent something that you have never seen, and someone really punched a bullet, take it as a sign. And if you're working in the Kroger video department, I'm just kidding. <br /> <br /> Footnote: this classic has not yet seen the light on DVD, for which we should be forever grateful to digital gods,
