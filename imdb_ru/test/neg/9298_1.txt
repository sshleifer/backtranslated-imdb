I love Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni. However, this is easily the worst film I have seen in the last 10 years, and I see my share of films. Stinker This is a bad idea for a film that is poorly executed. There is nothing funny, believable or interesting. I was looking for wit, irony and real humor. Instead, it looked as if most of the actors went to the set to do Teu Leoni a favor. It is a pity that such an acting talent was spent on such a void. Don't worry. I wonder what the creators of this film think about their audience in order to explain to them the idea that Polish gangsters in Buffalo, New York, send an assassin to San Francisco to become an assistant to the mortuary during a visit to an AA meeting. Bill Pullman must start reading scripts before he agrees to act in films. Sad.
