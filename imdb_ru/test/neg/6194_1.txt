The director / lead actor Dutcher enjoys this “look at me” film, in which he tries to gain worldly recognition for casting a shadow on the generally very optimistic world of Mormon missionaries. Some of the actors are fair. But some roles are unrealistic, such as the sinister (rather than paternal) mission president, etc. The film gives an honest idea of ​​how some missionaries can fight their faith, but the actual missionary program that he claims is far from his concept about it, in terms of optimism, cohesion and inspiration. The only inspiration I see in this film is Dutcher's inspiration. The film is slow and boring, and the shooting and the script are like a student project.
