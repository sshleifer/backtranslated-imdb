SO WHAT IS IT, where the head of the Colombian Department of Short Subjects received his directorial start, eh? Yes, it is none other than Mr. Jules White, who is credited (or, rather, “exposed”) as the director of this recording in the MGM DOGVILLE series. This co-loan as co-director is Zion Myers; whose name is still unknown to us. Mr. Meyers, without a doubt, was the guy who controlled the four-legged Traspians and was responsible for learning and acting. In short, he must have been a trainer on the set. <br /> <br /> The NAME of this short comedy is without a doubt the MGM game of the same year, THE BIG HOUSE; which starred Chester Morris, Wallace Beery, Robert Montgomery and the star cast in support. We must recognize ignorance regarding this name; not seeing this until this point. (Sorry, Schulz!) But there are a lot of dog jokes that are related to what we read about the movie *; not to mention some specific characteristic jokes. For example, we observed a dog convict who stuttered and correctly concluded that the actor-fan imitated the character of comedian Roscoe Ates. Later we checked out the cast of THE BIG HOUSE and presto, his name is there! (A brilliant conclusion, suitable for Holmes and Watson!) <br /> <br /> The practice of covering popular functions was already tried and true practice in the field of a short comedy film. It was the one that seemed to raise no objections from the producers and copyright owners of the main films; but rather contradictory received a bunch of mysterious approval. After all, imitation is considered the most sincere form of flattery; besides, any producer would welcome even some seemingly disrespectful parodies. ** As for the film itself, we found it interesting in a perverted manner. To see so many "best friends of man", artificially animated into a single, long and boring kind of anthropomorphic gag, seemed to us very tedious, making up the audience. I mean, how many eggs were made to bark without the need to achieve the illusion of "talking"? <br /> <br /> When it comes to pets or "animal companions", as the politically correct crowd prefers, we are pretty eclectic; in favor of not only dogs; but also cats, hamsters and parrots. We do not like to see how any animal is exploited in such a non-funny, expanded game format. <br /> <br /> HOW incredible, as it may seem, is the step that Mr. Jules White took from MGM shorts to lead Colombia. 2 It would seem that Reeler production has not only become more expensive in finance; but all in artificial content. We never thought that we would be a producer for such luminaries as “3 Stooges”, Andy Clyde and Hugh Herbert, as well as for those who probably saw better times like Charlie Chase, Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon; will be cinematic step. <br /> <br /> In case we have not yet made our point of view; we are officially preparing it. So look at your own risk. We warned you! <br /> <br /> NOTE * We read excellent reports of both BIG HOUSE and Laurel and Hardy packages, forgive us (Hal Roach / MGM, 1931) in both MR. LAUREL & MR. HARD John McCabe (1962) and LAUREL'S MOVIES AND TOUGH William C. Everson (1967). Both books have received our hottest approval. <br /> <br /> NOTE ** Prison photography has become a genre of its own; all indebted to the BIG HOME. In PARDON US, Laurel and Hardy, Hal Roach and his director made a first-class parody, the first of many; for prison, comedy has become a must-have theme for so many funny screen people.
