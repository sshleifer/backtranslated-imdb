I rented it, thinking that it would be pretty good just the cover of the film. The judge and Yuri began with a pretty good killer who stalked a man who killed his wife on a bicycle with a cool gun, but this film became increasingly stupid. David Keith is a terrific actor, especially when he plays a role like this, too bad, the film was shit, he really spent his talent. The judge and Yuri were completely stupid, I gave him 3, I had to give him 2, I gave him an extra star just because David Keith was cool.
