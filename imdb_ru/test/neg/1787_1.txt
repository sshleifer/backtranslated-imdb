This film is so terribly bad that there is NOTHING in it. NO effects, no waiting, and poor dialogue poorly delivered. Oh, and neither CAMP nor any fear contain. Do yourself a favor and go see the original Friday of the 13th or (preferably) Sleep Camp, but whatever you do, do NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Even the appearance of Michele Bauer at the very beginning cannot save him. Usually in such films you expect violence, waiting, a little blood and some T & A. At least one of these things, done right, would at least make it watchable. <br /> <br /> Speaking of at least one pleasant word, Buck Flower is great, he seems to be the only one who understands what they are doing chok, and rightly flushes. If everyone else matched this tone, it would be funny without a pun.
