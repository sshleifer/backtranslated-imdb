Now I watched it when I was on a hangover on one Sunday, and my aunt and uncle once came to us with two cousins ​​(one was 11 and the other 9). We were stuck on TV, and "Passport to Paris" just started. My cousins ​​both said that they sometimes watch “Two of a Kind,” and I said that they can watch a movie if they want. Since I could not get out of bed, I just stayed with them in the living room and eventually watched the movie! I have to say that as a person who is not interested in such TV shows or movies, I actually enjoyed it ... it must have been alcohol, but I admit that it is likely that girls between the ages of 6 and 13 will like it more but it was a film to pass the time. There is always a movie or show that you don’t like, but you liked it to laugh.
