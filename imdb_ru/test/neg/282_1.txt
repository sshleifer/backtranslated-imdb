Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) catches up with Danny Ocean and his team and demands that they return the money they stole from him (in Ocean 11), plus interest. However, he refrains from violent acts, as he is under the guidance of the greatest thief in the world, the Night Fox. Then the team must conduct a series of robberies to pay Benedict, testing their abilities against Night Fox, who wants to maintain his position as the greatest thief in history. Simply put, this movie is a complete mess. Massa may argue that this is “cool” and that Clooney and Pitt played great, but these are the same people who subscribed to the “Hello” magazine and believe that David Beckham has the potential to become a great actor. The story is confusing, it is not complicated and not clever, and there are no intellectual turns in it, it’s just a complete mess spreading in many directions, in the hope that the public will think that it’s cool and intelligent (Hello readers). Any respectable viewer of the film, however, will see the film for the farce it is. While Oceans 11 was not a great movie, it had a decent pace, was stylish and had decent turns. This film very quickly loses its popularity, and then gives up. It’s as if the director and the cast said to themselves: hey, it really doesn’t work, let's just laugh! Indeed, the actors look as if they are enjoying themselves, but I was not. I will not delve into the plot, since its intricate evolution does not require any study. The addition of Catherine Zeta-Jones is pretty annoying. The scenes in which Julia Roberts impersonates herself (with Bruce Willis playing the role of a cameo), while the slightly funny look is a desperate step to interest the public. The film is so full of holes in the plot that Arnie devastated "Uzi 9mm" in the film studio. We can pay tribute to only some scenes where Night Fox uses Caopeira to take theft against some funky music against the back, but this is hardly an excuse for watching a movie. The final scene shows the team in a meaningless drunken stupor; it sums up the movie for sure. Stick with the original.
