Any fan of Russian cinema with great difficulty can believe that the performances are not true, voiced by Mashkov and Bodrov Jr., and perhaps he will be completely bewildered by the beaten and confused script of Bodrov Sr., combined with an uncharacteristically weak guide, Most of the characters roam the film as if they had no idea who they were or what they were doing. It is also sad to see that Jennifer Jason Lee’s acting skills have not progressed a bit since “FAST TIME ON A HIGH RIDGE”, and fortunately her exposure on the screen is limited. This is a terrible mafia film; so much so that it makes GODFATHER III look like a winner in the genre. To see the key Russians in the best possible way, look at the work of Bodrov Sr. on the “Prisoner of the Mountains” (which also includes the younger one), the turn of Mashkov in the VOR (“Thief”) and the new criminal Bodrov Jr. in BROTHER.
