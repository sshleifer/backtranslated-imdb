How can you make a joke about the mafia? This is not a topic to laugh at! Close cinema can't make me laugh, because I compare it with Mafia Jane Austen! Mafia! It was not a good movie, but Goodes is really worse! In Mafia !, there were a few good jokes, but there are maybe two or three in it ... that make you smile Not too bad actors, but a very bad script !! We are sure that we prefer something serious, like the Godfather. I give it * of *****.
