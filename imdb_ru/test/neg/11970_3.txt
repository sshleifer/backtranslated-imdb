Jerk Heyzer Mike (David Zelina plays this college guy as one of the main bastards you want to see dying at once) and his college friends leave hypoglycemic Sam (Caleb Roerig) hanging on a wooden cross with this scarecrow, which is a legendary story about ghosts, They get PO'd to Sam, who, in fact, falls into shock and aims at Mike, who instead falls on his girlfriend Patty (Christina Sheldon), so leaving the poor guy hanged is his punishment. Somehow, Sam’s soul “emerges” with an inanimate stuffed animal that comes from the cross to destroy all who left the poor there to rot. Mike and the gang send the uninitiated assholes back to bring down Sam, but they are the first to get the swinging blade through the throat. Mike and his party go to the beach to take a sip, play volleyball and quarrel until they get scared to finish their little party. Replacing Sam's brother Jack (Matthew Lynhardt) should look after him, but instead decides to sleep with Beth (Samantha Isling), a new love interest. So when he received a message from Mike on a mobile phone about how they left Sam hanging on the cross while they were on the beach, taking the sun and sand, Jack was furious with fear. Beth’s estranged father is a doctor, and he agrees to monitor Sam’s condition after they kill an almost dead young man and take him to the emergency room. Returning to the beach to confront Mike because of his negligence (... not to mention Jack’s promise to coach Ramsey, played by UFC fighter Ken Shamrock, regarding the absence of hazing), Jack and Beth face the same killer stuffed with straw that comes across others. Coach Ramsey, who was involved in a hazing relationship in the past incident, which led to mistakes in the scarecrow killing, must confront some demons when he informs the survivors in the group about what they are facing. <br /> <br /> Kids, boobs and blood ... this click follows the basic principles of slasher. Nevertheless, this click also carries the typical features of a sleazeur of banal characters, actions, dialogue and general conspiracy. The film shows signs of its low budget, especially in the case of violence, since most of the real action takes place behind the scenes, and does not show that this is happening, close and personally. What appears on the screen is mainly the consequences of the killer’s revenge: one guy holding his guts, the other with a stake (holding a volleyball net of the group) stabbed him in the chest, a splash of blood after the woman was hit on the head, allegedly , big rock, one chick is dead after a scarecrow struck her with an SUV, etc. There are also some problems with duplication, when it is clear that the sounds of their voices often do not coincide with the movements of their lips .. a particularly unintended fun sequence in which Ed (Travis Parker) rock The star of imitators, sings to his friends a terrible song, with which they all seem very impressed.
