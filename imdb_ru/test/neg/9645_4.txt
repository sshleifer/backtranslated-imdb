Threesomes with Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong and James Gleason are playing Coney Island guys who are fighting for a hand with Ginger Rogers, a working girl who sells salt-water toffee. Since the beginning of World War I, the three of them are recruiting and stalking Ginger from afar. The first half of this production of the RKO Pathe is difficult, with three male leaders chewing the scene with overdone odnostrochnikami and "lively" dialogue, which quickly becomes tedious. The second half focuses on action sequences, as the US Navy is pursuing both a German merchant cruiser and a submarine. These episodes are lively and well filmed, but overall this is a long and unsatisfactory flat comedy drama. Only for fans of stars.
