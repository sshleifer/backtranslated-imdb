Evil behind you, was created for a specific purpose, to push the authors / directors to personal views on who can walk on water or dance with the devil. Unfortunately, it may seem that the creators were so focused on expressing their point of view that they completely abandoned her power, forcibly passing their point of view to the viewer. The way her message is presented almost reminds me of the stories I heard about the Spanish Inquisition. ! From one real Christian to another, avoid it like the plague, the fear tactics never work when you try to send this kind of message !! <br /> <br /> The actions were terrible, the choice of Muslim terrorists was racist and unfair (they are terrorists, so they must be Muslims). The initial premise was good, the story served as an excellent channel for its message, but it was not possible to realize these ideas, which made it difficult even to separate the message from the messenger. <br /> <br /> You'd better erase your old "Ghost" DVD from Mr. Swayze to get this message. at least, this film did not try to shove itself in the throat. Or, if you like good Christian films with a powerful message, try “The End of a Spear”
