There was so much chemistry between Kristen Scott-Thomas and Harrison Ford, but every time the story about their relationship started to gain momentum, the script turned off and dealt with some inappropriate story that did nothing to promote the story. Indeed, the plots had nothing to do with the story at all. These were commercials in which you watched the trailer for another movie. <br /> <br /> Authors (or someone who controlled the authors) obviously didnâ€™t trust themselves to write convincingly about the relationships and inner life of their characters. It seemed to them that they feel uncomfortable if they do not arrange shootouts and shootouts in bars. Or perhaps they did not trust viewers to pay attention to the story of a man and a woman trying to understand their relationship in difficult circumstances. In the end, we all know how boring Casablanca was. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the relationship between Kay and the Dutchman were more developed and allowed to end, the authors would know how to finish the story. This film was disappointing that he did not do more with his wonderful actors, who gave good performances, but could do more with the best script.
