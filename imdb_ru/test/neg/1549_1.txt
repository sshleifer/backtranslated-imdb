For a while it seemed that this show was 24/7. Then, apparently, there was a second season or some other continuation of this terrible show about the two most stupid and vain people who were ever filmed. All other comments fully reflect the essence of these two selfish, aggressive, dizzying movements. Not much less can be said about them, except what everyone else said. <br /> <br /> I doubt that these two ladies have souls, and itâ€™s more than likely that they made some Faustian deal to make their lizard dig a TV series. May fate protect the human race from further exposure to the Ghastly Girls!
