Well, we got JP from Grandma Boy and Chuck, well, Chuck. I thought that this film would be pretty good based on the reviews, and it really started quite high on my scale of the film, but about halfway through, it just took so long that I continued to lose interest. I actually got so bored, probably because you immediately see what will happen in the end; the story is actually rather uneven, I missed more than 15 minutes and did not miss anything! This film was supposed to be a short work, perhaps from 45 minutes to an hour maximum. It starts well and ends well, too bad that the filling is soft, boring, boring, and lacks everything but time. Some people say they like music; I do not care about jazz, and I do not go to the cinema at their expense, I follow the story, and when it drags on ... well, the ratings fall in my book. <br /> <br /> The result is a good open, great close, boring filler. The story was cool, but if you don’t know what will happen a quarter of the way, you haven’t seen too many thrillers.
