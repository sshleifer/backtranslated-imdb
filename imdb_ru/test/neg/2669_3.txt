Usually I would not comment on the continuation of the horror film, because it is usually assumed that they are BAD, and if you watch them with a healthy lack of respect, they can be very funny and enjoyable for ridicule / laughter. However, this chapter of the ongoing Halloween saga was close to absorbing everything that was in the original. In the very first film, Dr. Loomis said (very precisely, I might add) that Michael Myers was evil, and this is trying to explain why (I may add that I did a bad job). In my opinion, he was much worse when he was just a bloodthirsty freak. This whole gothic / iconic thing was an unnecessary and desperate attempt to add a new curve to the Halloween equation. The result was a boring, predictable film that was not scary and not bad enough to be funny.
