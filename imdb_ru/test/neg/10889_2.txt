This movie is not a horror movie. Nothing wrong with that, it's more than torture. And it does not make sense to me, there are several scenes with disappearing bodies. For example, he is a woman at the beginning of the film. What he pulled away returns to the stage in the closet with Nicole, and she and she completely disappear. Then she kills a policeman to save him from suffering, and he disappears. PLUS had to shoot him twice in the head to kill him. I don't think so, especially when you see how his head half exploded and didn't kill him? In the end, she sets fire to the killer truck. This, but he is not in it. He stands behind her. Then he stops before the full stop has been completely refitted, and some people are in the recreation area, and a new girl arrives, and Nicole asks for help as the first girl. There is no point in this movie. Save some money and skip this movie.
