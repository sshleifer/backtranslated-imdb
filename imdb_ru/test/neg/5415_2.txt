This film is trying to rip the Predator, but this film is much better. This film has really terrible special effects and a meaningless plot. The team that enters the forest to find the cause of the disappearance of the military and scientists is a combination of rude and rugged delta commando men and beautiful but tough female rangers. None of them is too bright. All the characters seem to be more than ready to run away into the woods alone and go headlong into a spear or sword and their death. Some of the pyrotechnics are very large and should cost a beam. But close-ups of the creature are ridiculous, as are most death scenes. All the cliches the authors could think of were used. If you are looking for a meaningless holiday slaughter, it can fill the bill. The night I was watching was very slow, so I sat through it all. I have to admit that it's been a long time since I saw something so bad. There is very little to redeem this film. I am amazed that such junk is produced.
