Tarzan, a leader in environmental awareness, runs into four catchers, who, in the most unorthodox ways, kidnap animals to bring them to zoos. Tarzan has a modest but rather sexy wife with a flawless hairstyle and a child. No one should accuse Tarzan of being saddened by the evil actions of the hunters. <br /> <br /> This Gordon Scott Tarzan film is one of the most stupid, completely and unnecessarily stupid; for one reason or another, the team did not find anything charming to sustain the film, and therefore it is just stupid trash. Tarzan and his family are threatened by a group of evil catchers, because Tarzan’s environmental consciousness has led him into open conflict with the villains. The child and the chimpanzee, both belonging to Tarzan, are kidnapped by evil catchers; therefore Tarzan causes the released forces of animals in the jungle to free the child and the chimpanzees, and Tarzan leads the attack. Tarzan and traps are stupid, unattractive, completely uninteresting. Maybe in childhood I would like it? Now you have to be too mean - as angry as those pitiful catchers who were punished by Tarzan - to ask for a click of Tarzan not to be stupid; I admit it. But everyone really has the right to ask these films of Tarzan, albeit stupid, to have and show a little pleasure - even a little pleasure - even a little pleasure. Some bump, some excitement, some fun. Now the failure of Gordon Scott Tarzan is too stupid in the sense that she has no pleasure, does not experience any excitement. (Yes, I liked the sequence of the beast in the jungle eating a snake. What kind of beast? Watch the movie, kids, now here I just gave you one reason to do it.) For one reason or another, the villains look somewhat pathetic and sharp. mercy, not virtuous wrath. <br /> <br /> From the books it seems that Tarzan seemed quite bright in his own way; and if finding a decent bodybuilder or other athlete who would look wise enough to cope with this role may be too difficult, almost impossible task, Gordon Scott was still too far from achieving this ideal. <br /> <br /> Wife blames Tarzan for disliking books. <br /> <br /> The script assumes that Tarzan was uneducated, almost illiterate and negative about his studies; but the book says otherwise, and we know that Tarzan himself studied a lot using the books of his missing family, even before meeting with white people. <br /> <br /> And I didn’t like this cry. <br /> <br /> (Expected, dear Kido, to be a real wild shriek, not a missed yodler.)
