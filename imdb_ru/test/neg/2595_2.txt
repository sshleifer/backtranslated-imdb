Have you ever seen one of those shows that became so popular that in the end you could get away with some nasty stuff and repetitive indecisive tricks with which its creators can come together? If not, then you have never seen The Family Guy. <br /> <br /> Fans of the series consider it witty, sharp and sharp. It is nothing else, however, it is boring, repetitive, offensive and boring. <br /> <br /> The humor of the series comes from two sources. <br /> <br /> 1) Irrelevant idiocy Shows often have memories of things that have nothing to do with the plot and are basically just absurd and meaningless. And also there are random links to films in which the characters of the show reproduce the scene from a popular film without parodying it. , or parody it at all (which is NOT FUNNY !!!!!). <br /> <br /> 2) the same crap that is in every episode of the show. One guy is a sexy deviant with STDs, AHA HA! Isn't that funny ?! Hey, do you know what's even funnier? To make the same joke about him anywhere from one to fifteen times in one episode. And do not say it many times in one episode, make sure that you pull it out so that the whole scene is devoted only to one joke. Now imagine that this same procedure is used again and again for almost every character in the entire series. <br /> <br /> The unusual humor of “un-PC” is not the same “un-PC” as you believe, basically they just say what idiots think about the latest newspaper headlines, politicians and occasional celebrities. <br /> <br /> There were moments in the series, but now I think it's time to just take the show off the air and get it over with. <br /> <br /> Do you know what's funny? I still like it more than Nausicaa from the valley of the wind.
