Maybe I was young when I saw this. I may not have grown up with films about Lubrication and Elvis. <br /> <br /> I could not get it. I get a black comedy (Black Adder, etc.). I get the irony and parodies. But I do not understand this. <br /> <br /> I did a quest to find out the name of this film (to enlist the support of people from usenet and the most excellent IMDb message boards) so that it is my first 1-pointer. Awful
