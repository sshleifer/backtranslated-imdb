This movie was crap. The script is so full of holes; I do not understand how the producers agreed to finance it. <br /> <br /> We are never given an explanation for ANYTHING. The game is terrible. The plot sucks. This film was clearly written for those who are less than 8 years old. <br /> <br /> I have to say the following: why do the lessons in high school take only 2 minutes? The teacher enters, finds a frog on the table or draws on the board, and after 30 seconds the bell rings, the lesson is over. Children have not even opened their books. Can we have a little continuity? <br /> <br /> Oh, the dialogue. Milo Jeter - the embodied, interrupted fruit, zombies. Do we need a line? "This is Dr. Jeter's office. Dr. Jeter, Milo's father." Thanks for the tip; I could never have collected it myself. It never gets better. <br /> <br /> Why does Milo speak like he does, even at the beginning? Was Milo "real"? Or was he never real, just always what he is now? And if it was always like this, why did Milo experience an inexplicable "accident"? <br /> <br /> Aside from “What is Milo?”, What are all unresolved items for? We see all these tricks in his father’s medical office, and we are never given an explanation of what they are intended for or what they should do with the story. What are injections for? What about the tricks in the aquarium? They are clearly not needed. (Watch the movie, it will make sense). And what does this drug do to anyone? Apparently, nothing, since it does not affect the main actress. <br /> <br /> This film is very, very bad breaks all other slasher films. This is really terrible Friday 13th / Halloween, told by a 10-year-old writer. We must laugh for a reason, just incredibly boring.
