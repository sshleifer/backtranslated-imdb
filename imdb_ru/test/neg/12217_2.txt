Asmali Konak may have become one of the best TV shows coming out of Turkey. With its unique cinematic and visual approach to filming, the series received a broad follow-up base with rating records constantly beaten. Personally, I do not agree with the fact that singers become actors (hence, Ozcan Deniz is the leading actor), but I think that the numbers speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> Regarding the film, it was disgusting to see how much someone could destroy such a plot line. For years, this film has been able to watch every story of origin that existed within the series. Not only were cultural mistakes unacceptable, with an idiotic scene in which family members danced (Greek style) and broke plates, which is not found anywhere else in Turkish culture. <br /> <br /> Some argue that the film should be taken as a separate film, and not as a continuation of the television series, but this theory has one serious fall, the way the film was sold was that he would understand where he left off the series, and will complete the series once and for all, Therefore, given this note, I and everyone I know would ask for compensation and would agree to stand near the theater to warn other victims.
