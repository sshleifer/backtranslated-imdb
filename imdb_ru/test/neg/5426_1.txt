Oh my god, this is so idiotic. Totally pointless, insulting and disgusting. Why the authors have such a problem with the actual union of Zoe and Chase, we all want them too! in ordinary shows, there is actually a plot conflict MORE THAN ONE, wow, what a concept. In addition, you cannot even distinguish the episodes of Zoe 101 from each other, because the same thing happens every time. Quinn exploits Dustin for something strange, Nicole giggles and is stupid, Zoe is just curious, Chase is always hanging around for her, but she doesn’t notice remarkably, and Logan is a jerk. reiteration. Quinn exploits Dustin for something strange, Nicole giggles and is stupid, Zoe is just curious, Chase is always hanging around for her, but she doesn’t notice remarkably, and Logan is a jerk. reiteration. it's like a bottle of shampoo. and the end of the film, oh my goodness. so pointless nothing happens. It seems that they specifically designed it so that the film could fit in between any two episodes of the show, and after the plot of the film the show completely changed.
