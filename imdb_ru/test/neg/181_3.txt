An interesting period of picec, showing us what was amazing in 1938. Damn it, Ma, a fake accident ring that requires $ 25,000 !!! I guess it is projected that in the 21st century it will be a lot of money. Acting will be a clean ham of the 21st century. Nice to see the president as a hardworking newcomer.
