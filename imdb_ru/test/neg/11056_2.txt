The stinky bottom is so bad that it's just ridiculous. "The plot" of the American mercenary, played by reb Brown (in the film they call him "military adviser", but it is not entirely clear whether he is in the US army or not), helping the army in the Latin American struggle for the country, the guerrillas who end up joining to the partisans when the government turns him on, imprisons him and tortures him. Shannon Tweed is a “saleswoman of sports equipment,” whom he raises in a bar that enjoys all this intrigue. This description actually makes the film sound better than it actually is, because it’s really smelly almost biblical in scope. How bad is it? Well, Shannon Tweed turns into the most professional acting work in the film. If this is not an indication that this turkey is 12 percent rubbish, then nothing from inappropriate sound effects to a musical score that sounds like it's from a 1940s horror movie "Z" (and may well be) the same material (i.e., armored personnel carriers following the same jungle trail), constantly reused in some of the most inept production scenes in recent memory, this slug with a minute laugh should be regarded as distrust, Tweed looks bored brown looks like styvshim and by the time this thing is over - if you can hold out for so long; I could not - you will know how they feel. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that there are many explosions and shootings, this cannot be considered an “action”, oddly enough. This is boring (there is a scene in the back of a truck, where everyone just stares at each other for three or four minutes), repetitive (the same “insurgents” and “soldiers” are killed again and again) is illogical (when a group of insurgents are caught in the open field by the government military helicopter, instead of breaking into the shelter, they just stand there staring at him), inept (soldiers and insurgents fall "dead" when they don't hear gunfire, gunfire inside the house, soldiers standing at the walls, shot with machine guns, but miraculously the walls are not f shunned) predictable (when the “governor” says to offer a reward for seizing Brown, because “someone” can surrender him, you know exactly who this “someone” will be, and it turns out that this is exactly who you are thought) and just stupid (almost everything else in the picture). Inappropriate, brainless and stupid to the limit. Do not waste your time.
