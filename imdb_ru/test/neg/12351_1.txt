I saw it in the preview and I must say that this documentary is the biggest burden I've ever seen. <br /> << laugh in the whole movie <br /> <br /> Many people left halfway through - Maybe I'm not guilty ... I thought the movie would catch, but I never did, and I would like to leave. <br /> <br /> Humor really sucked, and I'm surprised that it ever appeared on the big screen. I'm not the one who is offended at all by the content of this film for adults - it's just not funny. The people who made this film don't really deserve your money, so please do not pay to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not even funny to show on TV, not to mention the movie. .. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give 0 out of 10, but the system will not allow this ...
