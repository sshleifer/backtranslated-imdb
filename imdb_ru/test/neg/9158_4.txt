This “middle block” is below the average from the cliché of everyone in the living room routine. Charlie Chan is a secret service agent doing government work, and he must find out who killed a bomb scientist to defeat German U-boats in World War II. Not much can be recommended with this film, since neither the bomb, nor the scientist, nor the war have anything to do with the plot. Fans of Charlie Chan are likely to find this film disappointing. Who blows? What's the difference?
