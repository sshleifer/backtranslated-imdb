A film about an interesting and sensitive period of the story, shot in a beautiful setting, managed to present a terribly trivial and clich√© production, an extremely awkward script, poor continuity, obtrusive slushy music, sweet casting and a pale acting game. <br /> <br /> Between the script and the actor's plot there was something more than what was worse. The scenario probably won - the historical background, the background and descriptions of the characters were set out in detail in the dialogue. ... in fact, words cannot describe how bad this film is. <br /> <br /> During the preliminary screening of the film in thirty minutes there was a massive exodus. After about an hour, many of the others were laughing out loud. I have to add that I am frankofil, I am fascinated by Canada and I love historical films. It really was once.
