Fully agree with another review. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for about 5 minutes. I looked at one review on another site and found that it was not a real sequel. This was after I slowly retreated from the TV with the remote in my hand, my jaw dropping lower and lower. <br /> <br /> The quality of filming is beyond the means. It doesn't even look like a damn movie. If I watched the “home video” footage from the documentary, I would expect it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: avoid, avoid avoid. Boooo Lion's Gate! <br /> <br /> I am very ashamed of seeing 5 minutes, and I hope that I saved others from renting or owning them.
