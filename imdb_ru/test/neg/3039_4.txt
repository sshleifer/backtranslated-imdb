When “Alien Calls” belong to a group of remakes of this year with films such as Poseidon, beyond the horizon. Directed by Simon West (Con Air) directs this updated version with many relatively unknown ghosts that signal either a high mortality rate (this is not the case) or that the established stars are escaping from a potential turkey. <br /> <br /> For a relatively short 87 minutes, it mainly consists of two actions. The first, which takes a full hour, is setting. Our heroine, Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle), recorded 800 minutes of conversation (math) on her mobile phone, and as a lesson of responsibility her parents confiscated her mobile phone and grounded her. To pay off her debt, she works part-time as a nanny, and looks after the children of rich Mandrakis, this is her first stay. <br /> <br /> Mandrakis's huge mansion goes through a full tour, since this is where all the action takes place. Lots of rooms (for good shelter), an indoor pool the size of an aquarium pond (to get wet, to handle a wet T-shirt), and check it out - motion detector lights, which, as you know, will contribute to intimidation with manipulations with lights and shadows. Naturally, pranks, red herrings are abundant, which prevents the execution of this act, but most of them fail in the waiting section. <br /> <br /> A small tendency arises, the actors are invisible, providing and acting through their voice instead. Recent attempts include Edward Norton in the Kingdom of Heaven and Hugo Weaving's Vendetta. Here, Lance Henriksen does honors for an anonymous, nameless psychotic killer, but it just didn't work. What for? The script does not give him much dialogue. Most phone calls were silent (mental-masturbating), which I felt was a waste — instead they could also throw the unknown, and the work would still be done. <br /> <br /> The second action, in which the main action takes place, is already too late. And frightening, well, purely frightening. Those who expect blood and blood will be disappointed, because basically this is a one-woman show that will hold your attention in the first hour (eye candy will always succeed), and this act will make her solve everything twice as fast, ala Rachel McAdams in Red Eye. Do not expect any form of character development, nor the plots that will be involved. <br /> <br /> The end was trying to be too smart for his own good and looked like a cheap way to finish the movie. There is nothing good in this film that could be identified - no panic, no thrill, no mysterious villain, not a lot of security flaws, especially with this door alarm - the only thing good for is to provide a number for 4D.
