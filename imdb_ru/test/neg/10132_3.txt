Natalie Wood portrays Courtney Patterson, a polio-disabled songwriter who is trying to avoid victimization as a result of her first love affair, and her partner is lawyer Marcus Simon, who is played by Wood’s real husband, Robert Wagner. The film is heavily cut, but most of the remaining scenes show a very weak hand from the director, which allows Wagner to constantly sommulate, emptying Wood’s solid and nuanced performance, which also offers excellent soprano. The scenario is somewhat banal, but the constant nature of Wagner's dramatic flaw unfortunately holds everywhere, as he is given a free hand to impose his disgusting look on Wood, who must be discouraged by the actress. The sequence of their relationships is unpredictably represented, and this, combined with intermittent editing, leads the viewer to the fact that he is not sure what is happening, the motivation is almost completely ignored in the letter. Despite the fact that cinematography is largely imperceptible, during one short scene it shines when Wood is placed on the inner courtyard, and, following the sound of a closing door, remains in the center, while the camera’s eye constantly moves away, showing its helplessness weakness. A more controlled direction would allow performers, even a sluggish Wagner, to scale their actions in accordance with interesting relationships; since it was released, there is, for the most part, a huge lack of commitment.
