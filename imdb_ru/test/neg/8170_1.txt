This film really shows the farce and hypocrisy of Indian society. What he is trying to show you is only ONE side of the story. The other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of Indian children, which is not shown in this film. <br /> <br /> “Indian parents” are guilty of the following: a. Destroy the individuality of children, making them completely dependent on their parents at a very early age. Such children grow up as adults only in appearance, but remain children in the mind. Since everything was provided to them by their great Indian parents, they, children, do not automatically feel the need to work hard on something or learn the basics of human communication with other people besides their parents. <br /> <br /> B. I can show you so many Indian parents who are trying to stop their children from making friends, going out or preventing them from doing anything that starts to turn them into adults. <br /> <br /> The reason they do this is the same. selfishness Indian parents “expect” their children to take care of them when they get old. They do not make savings for themselves, and as soon as they reach the age of 50 ... They shout Loud ... We have already grown old, so we have been dependent on you children since we have MUCHED the service of bringing you to this world, caring for you and making you intellectually weak. <br /> <br /> Most Indian parents aged 50 have decayed bodies and health, and they are financially completely insecure. Most believe that they absolutely do not need to take care of themselves, because they “expect” their children to take care of them. <br /> <br /> In the west, the opposite happens. At the age of 20, people begin to plan retirement, and after retirement they become financially secure. <br /> <br /> Indian parents do NOTHING because, as I said, they brought the children to the world and what is better to invest in it? <br /> <br /> I’m a victim of my Indian parents (I’m sure there are many other Indian children like me) who grew up physically, but still struggling with their lives on OWN OWN and they still pestered to 50-year-olds who all the time shout loudly about HELP. <br /> <br /> This film shows only one of the sides of the story ...
