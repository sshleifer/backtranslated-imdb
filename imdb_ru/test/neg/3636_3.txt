The only time I really laugh while watching this show is when I make fun of him. Jamie Lynn Spears got an acting job just because of her older sister, and I don't think anyone can argue with me about that. There will never be any expression on her face (even when she smiles) - just watch the show and you will understand what I mean. Now let's talk about the show. Zoey 101 is one of the most unreal shows I've ever seen! As many people have already said, Zoe Brooks is absolutely perfect: everyone loves her, she is an excellent student, and all the boys think that she is "hot." PCA is a boarding school full of rich children, which provides all its students with flat-screen TVs and laptops, offering children sushi from a sushi bar. In one of the newest episodes, Zoe is completely ignorant and thinks that Chase does not love her, and acts as if she does not even want Chase to love her. Then, when she bursts into Chase's room to prove that her friends are wrong, she discovers that Chase is kissing this girl named Rebecca. Zoe, of course, is worried, probably because she likes Chase's attention. In any case, watch this show only if you have nothing else to do, and on television - only Zoe 101. You can at least have fun, laughing at how unreal it is!
