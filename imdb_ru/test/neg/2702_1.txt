As a fan of the old series, I have to say that at best, this is a parody of your favorite series. First, the old series, at least, would try to follow some kind of military structure. I know in this PS the world is not the right thing to do, but hey, don't turn it into caring bears. In the old series, Bitchhead was a cruel soldier, now he is a teenage turtle. Another thing is a flying tank, well, it takes off from the base of the cobra and bounces off the helicopter, and they are both fine ???? Let's face it, if the next one is no better, this may mean the end of G.I.joe.
