I don't often put two stars on a horror movie, because horror is my favorite genre. The film can be BAD in the sense that it is not a masterpiece, but it can be enjoyable due to unintentional humor, strange characters, etc. As an example, many horror / science fiction films from the 1940s to the 1980s yo They give pleasure to fans of the genre and fans of guilt, because their "anger" is entertaining. However, in this film there is neither humor, nor spectacular bloody scenes of the original Piranha (1978). <br /> <br /> I believe that in 1995 it was the heyday of political correctness, so the amount of blood on television was minimal. Currently in the mid-2000s with C.S.I. show, television - a real bloody holiday! (Good for us horror fans!) <br /> <br /> William Katt and Alexandra Paul are not Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies (original stars of 1978.) This is not Catta and Paulâ€™s fault, but the scriptwriters and director who created this warm turkey. How the main characters interact - the main drawback of this film. I will not say how, because this is part of the plot. <br /> <br /> This television film probably had a larger budget than the original, but it looked as terrible as the voices of the users here show. Stick to the original 1978 if you're in the mood for a killer fish movie!
