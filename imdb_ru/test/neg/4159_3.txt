I thought this film was a bad effort by the British Cinema Council - it failed, come on, Tim Robbins is an old man, and now this beautiful young woman who falls in love with him too. As lost in translation, it is very difficult to suspend disbelief in this context. This is a good looking film, but there is no punch in it. When Tim Robbins pretends to be psychic, he seems to have a small migraine. He looks uncomfortable and life is less. The part where he checks suspected employees in the sphinx is ridiculous. If the investigator came to my factory, the last thing I would do is tell him about my freckle fetish. This is clearly overly intellectual. Clumsy. The city itself is a convenient background. Obviously, they chose the most futuristic city of all that they could (Shanghai) as the background, but the city never really appears and affects characters, like the runner with blades, where the characters of the city often cross history . slowly like a wet week. No chemistry, real dramatic moments, so the plot.
