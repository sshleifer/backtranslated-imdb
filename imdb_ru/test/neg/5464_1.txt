Well, that, of course, stunned me - I can't believe that someone shot another Australian film, which is even more boring than Somerso. The story is implausible, the characters, with the exception of the characters Friel and Mailman, are unlikely and wooden, Tom Long has many VAST facial expressions: happy and not happy, and “sex scenes” that could be very confronting and excitingly erotic would be at home in low budget porn movie with. <br /> <br /> This is the first film that I saw in 30 years of film-ONE, which had me on the edge of my place .... ready to stand up and leave. <br /> <br /> The best in this film is a poster.
