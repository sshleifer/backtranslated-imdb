This is what happens when a franchise becomes lazy, and no one can come up with a new twist to add. Remember what happened to the series "Children's Game"? The first three were played as horror films, with genuine fears (albeit predictable) that corresponded to the theme of the film. Then they ran out of people so that the doll could track them down, and decided to play it for fun, and the next two are black comedies ... <br /> <br /> Well, that's what happened here, but I think that this should not be so. It seems to say: “I wanted to make pancakes for dessert! I did it on purpose! ”When your souffle accidentally eats. But the milk was spilled, and it had some value in theaters like stupidity. <br /> <br /> When the floor came out from under the passenger’s seats, I expected the passengers to stretch their legs through the hole, launch Flintstones-Style to land safely in the Alps. I did. It would fit into the stupid obscene topic of the rest of the show. <br /> <br /> Instead of pointing out the obvious physical impossibilities of the movie, what about social improbances? Like George Kennedy's character is calmly responding to the news that his date was a whore? Even in 1979, it was not easy for a person to accept the idea that he had just poured out his heart on a paid companion. He allegedly felt that he had established a connection with a kindred spirit, who later turned out to be a hired sex worker who entered into battle. Who will not feel cheated by the experience? And yet he giggles and hugs his boyfriend's waist when they cheerfully leave. What a cheap end to the dirty scene. Oh. <br /> <br /> I had an appetite for soufflé, and tasteless pancakes were served to me. And no, you didn't do it on purpose!
