Amanda Bynes is an extremely talented actress, and I really enjoyed all her roles in the past, especially in the fantastic “She's a Man.” For this reason alone, Sydney White was a great disappointment to me. The real reason for my dislike of this film is the poor use of characters. In a good fun junior comedy, it is perfectly normal to play all quite realistic young characters. In Sydney White, this idea is thrown out the window. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes makes an excellent Sydney, but she really lacks what usually causes her to play a brilliant actress. I blame the script that makes her character too soft and discreet, and the hairstyle / makeup department, which gives her a disgusting, plastic look and an annoying hairstyle. Seven "assholes" with whom Sydney eventually is friends, much worse. They are so stupid that they cannot be loved or even respected as characters. In fact, it is a disgusting gag. As in the plot "The charming prince", which is absolutely incredible as a character and as frivolous as possible. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest future star of the film (with the possible exception of Amanda Bynes) is Sarah Paxton, who is actually very good as the sly Rachel Witchburn. The only pity is that the writers did not make it any more gray than black. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically similar to Snow White. What kills is that it is too stupid and obvious rethinking. The links with Snow White are thrown at us so much throughout the entire movie that they ultimately annoy and exaggerate. The beautiful Prince is unbelievably charming, the witch is too contemptible, the witch, the seven "assholes" are too stupid, and Syd is too sincere. This does not mean that everything in the film is bad. Although the script made Bynes go, she still has her moments. Like Sarah Paxton, who brings a physical comedy to the maximum in her scenes. Sydney's roommate named "Dinky" is also a very funny character. This is a pretty funny movie in detail, which is ultimately too stupid and cliché to recommend.
