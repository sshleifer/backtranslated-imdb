Bad, bad, bad .... <br /> <br /> This is another stupid movie. still don't know what language this movie is in? is it english or french or german !? !! You must speak all 3 languages ​​(at a minimum); chose Italian too, to understand it. poor-quality translation with a very hard-to-read font. showing a very stupid way to end this movie !! in the middle of a movie, you lose interest in this movie and start thinking, why am I watching this ?! Brad Pitt argues that his acting talent is declining. <br /> <br /> This may be the movie number 1,000,000, which refers to the Nazis. Are there other items that Hollywood can produce ?! I think this film is another American propaganda featuring America's super heroes. I expect the next Hollywood film - the American hero will save Jesus !!!
