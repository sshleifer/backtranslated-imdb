Rich ranchers in Buenos Aires have a long-standing policy to ban Crawfordâ€™s Manhattan trade, but what happens when a mustache Latin son falls in love with a certain Crawford with bright eyes, blond hair and some funny moves on the dance floor? The 20th Century-Fox musical has a glossy veneer, but at the edges it seems a bit nondescript. It is very hard on a fierce, gymnastics-like dance, extremely thin on history. Betty Grable (replacing the eleventh hour for Alice Fay) gives her a push, even if she is paired with lead Don Amechem (with tan makeup and smooth hair). Also good: Charlotte Greenwood as the content aunt Betty, a limousine driver who is constantly sleeping at work, and Carmen Miranda, who plays herself (who else?). Argentina's stock shots are far superior to the action shot in the background of Fox, and some of the appearances in support are pretty awful. By the time the big jump finals, most viewers will have enough. * 1/2 of ****
