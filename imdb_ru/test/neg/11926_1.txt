Straight up (or down) there with the Toys and the Jurassic Park 2 and the Phantom Menace. <br /> <br /> The premise sounded great, some commercials looked half-promising, but, alas, the entire film took about 30 seconds of an elegant cast, and this was shown on a 30-second small screen slot. <br /> <br /> If you want amateur writing, second-rate effects, funny costumes and all-round snoozefest, by all means look this. The plot is reworked sci-fi feed. Too bad, because when I came, I thought it would be bad, but I gave up hope. It may be the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - do not watch it. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, you liked any of the above 3 films.
