Flashdance is one of those horrible, stupid films that you really like, just because they are so crap. I just watched it on TV and my friend and I was amazed at how stupid it was. It’s true that Don Simpson and other producers came up with the idea of ​​a rather cheap, low-key movie with lots of sweaty bodies to help sell the soundtrack to (delightfully memorable) pop, so Flashdance is a strange kind of pioneer: the first MTV movie. Adrian Line began in advertising, and this can be seen, because Flashdance is almost an advertisement for himself. You have already decided to watch it, but in the film there is a strange, panicky current, as if it is scared that you can change your mind at any moment. He sells himself to you again and again, all over, using sleek commercial style editing and glossy close-ups of swaying breasts. The story is very thin (I, frankly, I can not remember another film that I saw with less plot), and it never makes much sense, but it is a very contrived, calculating film, so it seems consistent. People say it is outdated, but Flashdance has always been rubbish. The audience in the early 80s knew that this was just a stupid T & A, but it works in its own way stupid. In a crowd of parties, an unsightly romance reigns, and heaps of fat, wriggling female bodies for their dates - all in the rhythm of disco. How can this fail? It helps that dialogue is meaningless, so you can take popcorn without missing anything serious, and if this kind of thing is not your cup of tea, you can always laugh at the “interpretive dance” on the display. The scene in which Jennifer Beals was replaced in convulsions / "dances" on stage in front of the TV with a fan and a face full of white clown makeup made us fling. Genuine guilt.
