This film was terrible. If this had never been done, the world would have been a better place. Come on, flying van? What were they thinking about? It was a poor quality film with a terrible trap, and I would like to receive a written apology from the studio that produced it, along with some cookies, to help me pay back for the time spent on this crappy festival, which I can never return. If you paid to watch this movie, I'm very sorry, because I watched it on TV on Sunday afternoon, when I had nothing to do, and it pretty much ruined my whole week. Flying van?!?! And that should make up for the horrible mother who cares more about her own problems than her children? It is not surprising that they do not have enough sense to tell someone that he beats them, their mother does not teach them anything, except that what she wants surpasses everything else. Absolutely awful
