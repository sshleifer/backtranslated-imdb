I know it sounds crazy, but yes, I'm a big fan of House Party 1 and 2 (and proud of it !!). I hated the third part, and then the fourth part. I was like you are making fun of me? Kid 'n Play is nowhere to be found in this film, and it would be nice if they hadnâ€™t called House Party 4 by stupidity, as if it was in any way, in form, in form or in fashion related to it. predecessors, Every time this film appears in the USA late at night, I rent my TV with a rifle. Frankly, it really is so awful. * tossing * <br /> <br /> As the only remaining Kid 'n Play fan who really admits to being a fan (hee hee), I was shocked. Remember that stupid little boyish group of Immature? They snuck into House Party 3. Good, good, but how can part 4 only be about them and nothing more, and it seems that they are not even the same children from part 3. * are confused !!!! * House Party Fans: Do yourself a favor and stick to House Party 1 and 2 and Class Act. In addition, everything else is funny.
