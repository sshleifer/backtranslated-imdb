This should be considered one of the funniest television shows in a long time. <br /> <br /> Jose Ferrer played the title character, Nemo. He did part of justice and, of course, looked from the outside. But now it amazes me that Nemo, whom he invented, was something more than a fleeting resemblance to the “Captain of a bird's eye” from a television advertisement. Or maybe the opposite is true. <br /> <br /> His sworn enemy, Professor Cunningham, brilliantly outplayed Burgess Meredith. It seemed he had never finished his days "Penguins" from Batman. Although he does not make his penguin "quack" here, he has no parallels as a maniacal professor. Only John Colicos, known from Battlestar Galactica, better chewed the scenery like a manic despot. <br /> <br /> I can never remember that there was a grudge between Nemo and Cunningham, but it must have been serious, since the professor had never missed an opportunity to try and kill Nemo, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> The effects were not special, although Professor Cunningham’s submarine looked better than Nemo. He also had a team of strange, fish-like amphibians that served Cunningham and carried out all his orders. <br /> <br /> However, the most memorable aspect of the whole show was Professor Cunningham’s secret weapon. Delta Ray! He always said: “The fiery ray of the delta!”, After which the fish crew member would have terribly distracted attention from firing from a weapon, completely shrugging his shoulders. Truly priceless! They no longer make them so, and perhaps the same. But, as in other series of this era, for those who remember it, there will always be a tender place in our hearts covered with cheddar.
