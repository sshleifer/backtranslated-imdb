This movie is a laugh and a half. From the first scene where we see Mel Torm as a big, bad leader of a gang of muffins with a herd of Jaguar (and this is a ridiculous holiday in itself), to the final image of Mami Van Doren, now rehabilitated angelic teenager. ruled by nuns with iron fists), you can't stop shaking your head. The cast of this film is a lousy list from Mel and Mamie to the inept Paul Anka (all I wanted for most of this film was for him to just stop singing!) And the King of forty-year-olds, Dick Contino. Gloria Talbot, who plays a young girl without humor with more than a few chops (judo, not acting), which I last saw in the terrible woman-hater of the 50s Leech Woman, with such a bad hairstyle that looked like a dead groundhog, which Maw crushed truck. <br /> <br /> Mami is a bad, bad girl â€” she smokes, curses, grumbles, hits teachers and runs around with gang leaders. She throws her idiot Jaguar behind the wheel of Chip's boyfriend (whom we see in the first scene, trying to rape the blonde before he falls off the good guy), and instead begins to fight with Dick Contino. Whether this is a step for her, no one knows. Mel appears at a party in which she participates with her new boyfriend, and accuses her of pushing the nasty chip off a rock. Although I am sure that she would like it, she was not there. The stupid fight scene between Contino and his gang, Mel and his jazz monsters, is accompanied by merry unsuccessful actions on both sides. <br /> <br /> As a result, Mami is sent to the city of girls, the school of reform .. wrong. .. I love home for lost girls .. run by sister Iron Pants and her correction sisters. She annoys the nuns (and us), scattering them, discarding sullen one-liners and simply showing how bad she is. She quickly encounters Gloria Talbot, who plays one of the bad girls, who gives her a sharp sock so that she knows her place. She meets the limp noodles of a girl who is obsessed with the character of Paul Anka (why?). This little droplet becomes her "minion". <br /> <br /> There is a long film in which nothing special happens, except that St. Paul Anka constantly appears and proves how holy he is. He sings too much during this period of time, until you want to hit him in his huge pipe, just to silence him! And Mami's younger sister, played by the Best Glory of the Princess of the Father, calls her to tell her that she is in trouble. It turns out that it was the sister who went out with Chipster, and now Mel is blackmailing her because he found out. All the girls burst out to save her, with a hysterical scene of fighting between the girls, Mel and his boys. this is after the race between Mel and Dick, which is so stupid that it strikes the mind. Crazy teenagers in this banal film have a great time walking through what is essentially a stupid, poorly written and morally preaching film that does not achieve any goal, unless its purpose was to make you laugh out loud.
