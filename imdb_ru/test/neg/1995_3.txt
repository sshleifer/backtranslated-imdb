After an almost killed big dog, a stray cat thinks to herself: “Why can't I be a skunk? Then everyone will leave me alone. ” She looks around the landfill and finds an idea: white paint, black paint and some Limburg cheese and some garlic ... mmm. The next thing you know, we have a harbinger of "Pepe Le Pugh", although in this cartoon she is still a cat, she is just a disguised skunk. <br /> <br /> The cat also enjoys and fully utilizes her new stinky skunk status. Now he is a happy, contented guy ..... until a real skunk appears (with an imitation of Charles Boyer’s voice)! <br /> <br /> I really appreciate the cat wearing Bugs Bunny clothes. However, in general, I never cared about these French characters taking off, considering the stereotypical dialogue to be excessive and not very funny, so I rate it only as “honest.” I do this, however, for morality at the end of the story.
