I'm Mike Sedlak. I was the co-author of the bill for this movie. And proud of it. <br /> <br /> And I like all the comments. Some have not gone far enough. <br /> <br /> The film premiered in San Francisco in the summer of 1973. The theater was full of friends and family. We all clapped. <br /> <br /> Five days later, he was removed from all screens in the bay area. <br /> <br /> If someone is interested in hearing some of the details of the scene, it can make the movie even more enjoyable, please let me know. <br /> <br /> We could start with the frame where Gideon Blake throws a toilet plunger to distract one of the evil minions guarding the radio transmitter on the Bad's deck house. <br /> <br /> Or how Gideon spread the bomb in the original version. <br /> <br /> It did not help. It was still being bombed. <br /> <br /> Bring it.
