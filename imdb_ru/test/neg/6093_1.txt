If you are shooting an unknown movie, it is important that the “villain” is not more sympathetic than the “victim”. And it fails miserably. Watching this was so awful and unpleasant that I really had to register and comment. So, the husband is rich and insolent. There are worse vices, and the hog guy has many wives. A husband is a jerk because he ... does not approve of the physical attack of the boar boy on this woman - a witch who has absolutely nothing to do with the conspiracy. The boar boy threatens his husband and repeatedly tries to seduce his wife. Then he imposes himself on her - that the woman finds so hot that she stops thinking about rape and starts thinking that she wants it. Yeah. The misogynistic, complex inferiority thoughts that the director demonstrates are simply disgusting. It's one thing when a good movie like American Psycho is purposely trying to make us sympathize with the villain, but on the Island of Survival I felt I was watching a movie about Ted Bundy, but the director didn't make it incredible and instead made us hate his victims. What was he thinking about ???
