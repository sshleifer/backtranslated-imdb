If you can overcome a slow start and a bad game, itâ€™s worth a look. The storyline was pretty decent. My father had an evil temper because he was unemployed and he barely managed to see his child, except in the summer, because his ex-wife had custody of him. My father was very angry and disappointed most of the time. The monster in history was not too scary. The film violates the sequence of an incredibly strong monster. The only scene in which the directors do this is one of the times when the child falls into the basement and the monster attacks him. When a monster attacks a child, his hand falls into a steel trap attached to a chain. The monster is about a foot from the face of the child. Every time during the movie, the monster is strong enough to break through or break anything. However, the steel trap and chain keep him from getting the baby! Most likely, the filmmakers did it because of the shock, because no one wants one of the main characters to die. The filmmakers just wanted to scare us, thinking that this might be the possibility that the child might die. Instead of disrupting the sequence, the filmmakers had to replace the child with someone they could get rid of!
