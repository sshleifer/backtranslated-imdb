Blimey! I sincerely regret that I looked at this picture ... It's funny, I agreed to see her only for my wife, who suffered torture, seeing her about half an hour before retirement, while I remained in front of the TV, but only to feed the masochist in me and in me, because I wanted to know if this film was so bad in its entirety or whether there were some redemptive aspects that could have made me feel that I was stupid when I watched this film called “Two girls and boyfriend ... <br /> <br /> Everything in this picture is wrong , absolutely wrong ... because the initial, absurd premise of two women stupid enough to stay with their common boyfriend, to a terrible but merciful, end, not forgetting the terrible play of three actors ... Do not believe the rumors, the addict's play is bad, and I don’t see how Graham made herself a famous name in the film industry ... <br /> <br /> I wonder why, after the producers saved a few bucks with just three actors and the only place, they didn’t hire a person to write script instead of putting a monkey to with Doing it with his *** ... <br /> <br /> At least, I felt a little good when I destroyed the DVD and threw it in the trash can ... Anyway, I somehow ( and quite a bit) I liked the brunette actress, Natasha, but it was not enough to surpass the incredibly stupid and crazy premise of Face-off (face change), so Two Girls and Guy are at the very end .... <br /> <br /> Stay away from this ****!
