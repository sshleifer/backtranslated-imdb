Despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century, Erwin Rommel, as a rule, is highly respected by historians and fans of the Second World War as a gentleman, soldier and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare. The argument asserts that if Hitler had given him the troops and material resources that he desired in Africa, everything would have gone very differently. And this is probably true. Rommel was, in fact, a military genius, and, by all accounts, an honest and honest man. <br /> <br /> But this film does everything possible to make it almost holy. He does his job trying to win the war for Hitler, but the Fuhrer constantly intervenes and gives him ridiculous orders that Rommel (James Mason) expresses amazement, but rarely in fact questions and never, never disobey. Only when it becomes obvious that Hitler is leading Germany to collapse, does Rommel think of treason against him; This dilemma plays a major role in the film: a good man in bad circumstances tries to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> Mason is fine with Rommel, but this is hardly a memorable performance, say, George S. Scott as Patton. Of course, Rommel was not as colorful as Patton, but this film is so keen to make him look like a decent person that he forgets to make it interesting. He sometimes falls into some kind of warmth when with his wife Lucy (young Jessica Tandy, well savvy), but usually Mason is called on to give a tough British game ?? as if the British were trying to claim Rommel for themselves (although, frankly, all the Nazis have English accents, except Hitler). <br /> <br /> Made cheap, with any battle scenes that look like livestock, and beaches from Southern California, which doubles Tunisia, there is nothing to specifically recommend this film. The remake could be interesting (I would choose Ed Harris only because of a slight physical resemblance and, well, Harris could act) if he had a little bit of a touch, but this film basically showed me how much more demanding we became viewers in the last fifty years; a biography that this politeness would never cut.
