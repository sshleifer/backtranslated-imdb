I just caught Farewell to the King by telegram, and maybe it's just because I'm a girl, but I thought it was disgusting. The screenplay and the staging are pretentious (as soon as I learned that John Milius was in charge, everything became clear). Supporting actors were quite good - James Fox was outstanding. The biggest disappointment was Nick Nolte, which I usually like. As soon as he switches to his native language, he begins to speak very hard, unnatural English, and half the time he seems a bit confused, as if he had just smoked some of the bounty of the rainforest of Borneo. And then the end - what the ??? It turns out that Lleid is on the same boat as the Botanist (by the way, did the botanist leave the girl or what?) ??? The boat just casually stranded near the island, a ripe capture of a crazy former army deserter, a bounty hunter ??
