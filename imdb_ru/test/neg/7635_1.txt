This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This is a thriller with a rather ridiculous ending. I watched this movie in the hope of the best and instead found something really bad. The film was shot by two actors who I really like, Rebecca De Mornay and Antonio Banderas. Of course, they had good chemistry together, but for what? The idea of ​​the film was bad from the very beginning, and the performance only made it worse. <br /> <br /> Miss Demorne is played by Sarah Taylor, a psychologist trying to analyze a convicted serial killer, whose protection depends on multiple personality disorders. This will pretty much give you a hint about where the film is going and the identity of the killer. At the beginning of the film, she receives an unexpected visit from her father. This was done in the 1990s, when bad dad was in Hollywood, another key to the final conclusion. <br /> <br /> Mr. Banderas plays a mysterious man named Tony Ramirez, who enters Sarah’s life. The entire first meeting and the first meeting between Tony and Sarah are so poorly made and so unconvincing that they make you wonder how they were shot in general. And there is a sequence in which the two of them should know each other, which is so stupid that it seems that this is not the place. One thing I would admit was that there was a sex scene that is very hot. In any case, after his arrival, terrible things begin to happen, strange packages appear, things fall from the wall that can kill Sarah, an incident that says things are no longer normal. <br /> <br /> In general, the film was poorly thought out, editing sometimes seemed fussy, and the conclusion was ridiculous. Another thing that bothered me about this film was all the orchestral music playing in the background. A more subtle musical score would be better. I have to say this, no matter how bad the ending was, Miss Demorne was very good at this sequence. It is sad that she never received first-class materials in her career. This is the rare combination of talent and beauty.
