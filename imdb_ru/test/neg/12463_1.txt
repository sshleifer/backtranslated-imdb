I just wish I had the common sense to turn off this movie in the beginning, when I knew it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Instead, I doubted the doubt and waited for an improvement. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake as me. <br /> <br /> The title has nothing to do with the film. The film has nothing to do with the real world. The plot has nothing to do with the plot. The action consists of a guy who wants to be John Cusack, but can't handle it. The host is the girl who is trying to be Claire Danes. Unfortunately, she can not do it. They are in love, although God only knows why. And by the end I hoped that they would all kill each other, so that I could believe that none of these children would ever ruin the world.
