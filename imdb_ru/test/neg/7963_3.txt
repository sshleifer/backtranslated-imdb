Spoiler warning !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably my most hated film by Cary Grant. I spent most of my time thinking: to ignore him, leave him, etc. He is trying to kill her? Should we assume that after the end, when he convinces her to return home with him, he will still kill her? From checking several books I can see that this is a reading that some viewers / critics have accepted. After all, early completion is a more sensible way to remove a book than to change the ending — and this is a more unjustified change to the ending than, for example, in Altman's “Farewell”. Unlike Hitchcock's earlier example that the killer was not the killer, because the star was thrown (when Gosford Park refers to the Resident, Ivor Novello’s murderous habits are not mentioned) the end of the book is definitely not excluded. <br /> <br /> In Hitchcock’s “Revised Films” of Robin Wood, he writes: “As the person mentally“ moves ”from end to end, the meaning of each scene changes, the apparent hardness of the narrative disappears, the illusion of“ reality ”disappears fiction, the film becomes a “modernist” text in which the narrative process is predetermined. ” I love to play intelligent interpretive games just like everyone else, but if the film is not read directly, it fails. This one fails. Even after reviewing the fatal glasses of milk, which are repeated in several Hitchcock films. <br /> <br /> Annoying nagging. 1941 Nothing in the film says that it happens in the past. Biki (Nigel Bruce) keeps his money in a Parisian bank and goes there to engage in financial business? Doesn't he know that war is going on? Were there really flights from Croydon Airport? Is he on good terms with the Nazis? Why is it never said that the Germans shot him like a spy or something like that? <br /> <br /> Curiosity. When Johnny and Lina have lunch with Isobel, the author of riddles, and her brother, a pathologist, there is a fifth person who is never explained or introduced - a woman in a tuxedo. The authors say that it is Nonda Metcalfe playing Phyllis Swinghurst. Is this not an example of how lesbians were coded in movies from the 40s? Should we consider her Isobel's mistress? Books discussing explicit and hidden gays / lesbians in Hitchcock (for example, Robin Wood again) do not include Phyllis Swinghurst.
