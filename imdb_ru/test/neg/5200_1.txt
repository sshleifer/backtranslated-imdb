Since I am required to write at least 10 lines, and this garbage deserves not only one, I will start with the following: 1. I voted for HORRIBLE for this terrible so-called “movie”. <br /> <br /> 2. Let me explain why these turkeys that Mr. David Varod produces are shot mostly in my beautiful homeland, in Bulgaria (by the way, BTW, for illiterate people around - this country in EUROPE, is located north of Greece and has absolutely nothing to do with Mexico and Uruguay) Several years ago, NU Image invaded our country and began making trashy, mostly video releases. Why here? Because here they pay incredibly low fees to the Bulgarian team and Bulgarian actors (most of them are outstanding), who are in many ways better than most of their American counterparts. Personally, I am ashamed of this fact. The reason, of course, is the greed of the Americans involved and their desire to get more, if not all, profit. In fact, it would not be so bad if the production were not so dirty and pale. There has not been a good picture taken here for many years. Currently, the image of NU is being sued for the very dubious purchase of our national film production center called Boyana Films. There is no doubt that there was corruption, there was deception, there was a lie in this recent purchase. Bulgarian cinema is dead. Long live the Bulgarian cinema!
