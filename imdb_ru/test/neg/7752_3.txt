Albert Pyun presents his vision of the lost city of Atlantis - and this vision is so cluttered with claustrophobic settings, strange costumes and noisy, "fancy" secondary characters that one thing is for sure: you want to get out of here as soon as possible (unfortunately it will take you have about 80 minutes). The story, similar to Alice in Wonderland, is winding and uninteresting, and probably there were no actresses in the world who could turn it into a good film, although Katie Ireland makes an attractive (annoying voice and everything) attempt.
