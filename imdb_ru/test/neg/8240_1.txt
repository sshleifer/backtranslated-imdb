This season there was not enough real noise, but, if we recall the stories to bring us back the mood, season 6 does not have highlights and spontaneity. <br /> <br /> This season lacked the usual soprano style, and if you cut out Of all the rubbish that was filled in each episode of this season, you probably would have 6 episodes of real stories. <br /> <br /> Side stories, such as mom Paulie, is she or not? it was boring and had no purpose other than further study of his character. I would like Bobby to express his anger at Pauli in this episode of the carnival, but to no avail. <br /> <br /> And that's it! These side stories had no real purpose and did not end. If they are going to finish these stories in the next 6 episodes, I would prefer not to watch them, because in fact they should not be seen. <br /> <br /> Disappointment is a good word to say about this season. and its finale.
