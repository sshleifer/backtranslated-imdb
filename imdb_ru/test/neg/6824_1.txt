Rourke plays his usual role - an ominous, evil, Neanderthal, fierce, vicious jerk, in the same form as in Picture Claire, Out in Fifty, Get Carter, Double Team and the rest of the trash, which he turned out to be. <br /> <br /> He has very few lines. <br /> <br /> Of course, all this is just rubbish, underestimating Rourke, demeaning him, and does not matter for his characteristics as an actor. However, after watching "Prayer ...", "Johnny Handsome", "Barfly", "9 1/2 weeks", "Year of the Dragon", etc., etc., for many years I considered Rourke an outstanding, intelligent, intelligent man. I think he has changed since then. <br /> <br /> He looks callous, burned. <br /> <br /> "He walked with gloomy looks; / Despair inhabited his chest / And made the man the perfect pest." (Belloc, "Example"). <br /> <br /> I had absolutely no other reason to watch this boring film, except that it was Rourke.
