I do not know that the creators of this film tried to either perform or say, but they did not succeed. Unless, of course, the goal was to completely confuse the viewer. I watched this film simply because Drew Barrymore was in it, and it turned out that there was a little cameo in it. The very idea that this child should go on some wild car trip to win a big cash prize from playing at a gas station and meet with all sorts of assholes is simply ridiculous.
