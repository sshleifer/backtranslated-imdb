There are a lot of "bad" movies out there. Tune in channel 5 every night of the week, and you can simply get daily, shocking efforts from one director or another. There may be films that caused me more pain - it was harder to watch - than that, but in terms of writing, acting, directing, cinematography and the bare foundations of cinema, Inbetweeners is a really, really terrifying effort and should be avoided at all costs . The only laugh he gave me was in a behind-the-scenes DVD documentary film in which the disgusting film director Darren Fisher explains exactly how his script drew the “talent” to the project! Never underestimate the power of self-deception. <br /> <br /> Darren Fisher - British response to Edward D. Voodoo Jr.!
