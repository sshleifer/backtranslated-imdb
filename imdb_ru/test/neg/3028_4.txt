I watched this movie over and over since it first came out. I was fifteen, and even then I knew it was stupid. He had so much potential, and I was constantly rewriting the script in my head. Capoeira destroyed what could be a good drama. I liked the fact that he was shot on the spot. It is a pity that the characters were underdeveloped. As if they wrote the first draft of the script, and then immediately made the film. At fifteen, I could write a better script! Some scenes and dialogues came out of nowhere, and you have a lot of unanswered questions. And it was just me, or did Lobo seem sexually attracted to his cousin? "Elena grew up in some woman!" And the way he always touched her. There will be an interesting plot twist; Elena works for her cousin, who works on drugs, who is also a pervert. It is a pity that they did not hit the target.
