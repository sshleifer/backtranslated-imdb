First of all, no one with any experience of law enforcement (not ER or EMT, but real law enforcement) takes this show seriously. Walker will be knocked out of any police forces in the United States for his illegal and completely unprofessional tactics. In addition, he is a comic character - no acting skills, incredibly banal lines, no character development. The fact that Alex Cahill loves him shows how stupid he really is. And Trivett is a real clown with a black face. Come on --- if you think Walker is a soul show without bias, then explain why J.T. they consider it a fool, always the subject of Walker's jokes, never allow to solve a crime and never save Walker. which must be dead 50 times for the stupidity that he does. Although it may be true that many criminals are even dumber than detectives who chase them (and believe me, most cops are dumber than dirt), clever opponents faced by Walker never realize that after Walker is caught, jerk must be delivered from his suffering. But again, Norris produced the show just as he did in it, as he could voluntarily get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics were. It's like six guys will be waiting to take it one at a time. What a horrible series! It's more humiliating than any hooligan western, such as Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, Cisco Kid and Wild Bill Hicock, although I think most of you are too young to remember these shows. But, like these shows, just like these shows, the Walker TR is just as offensive and just plain stupid.
