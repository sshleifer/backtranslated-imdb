Happy Days was one of my favorite shows when it was broadcast in 1974. But critics quickly showed their ignorance, coupled with a complete lack of a sense of humor, slamming this show, because they thought it was a cheap attempt to capitalize on the success of the American GRAFFITTI. <br /> <br /> There were several similarities between the American GRAFFITTI and HAPPY DAYS. <br /> <br /> Both were opened by Bill Haley's Rock Around the Clock and Comet. Both occurred in a bygone era, and both featured Ron Howard as one of the lead roles. But there were some significant differences. While American GRAFFITTI was held in 1962 in California and focused around a group of high school students who are ready to make such a big step into adulthood, HAPPY DAYS were held in Milwalka, Wis., And were centered around a group of teenagers in high school the joys and tribulations of adolescence. <br /> <br /> HAPPY DAYS originally opened with a music box in which the original version of Bill Haley and "STONE COMETS AROUND HOURS" were played. But when the old people became hot, thanks to the success of the American GRAFFITTI and the original version of ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK in 1954, entered the Billboard Hot 100 and became a hit again in 1974, royalty payments went up. Thus, the “remake” of the song (the correct term is now “new stereo recording”) was quickly replaced. <br /> <br /> The current song for HAPPY DAYS was introduced for the second season, if my memory serves me correctly. <br /> <br /> Fans and enemies agree that this show is an escapist. Freedom was taken, and the details were omitted, which made this show less than genuine. <br /> <br /> This is completely normal. Happy days should be a comedy, not a history lesson. But sometimes authors sometimes stuck their necks out, striking controversial topics. One episode was centered around the Cunningham building in the shelter. Another episode was about a divorced woman moving next door with a dream to start a new life. The topic of prejudice was touched upon when Howard was invited to the wedding of an old army friend who turned out to be black (in an era when prejudice and discrimination, unfortunately, were an acceptable part of the American way of life). The draft problem even surfaced in a later episode! <br /> <br /> The show, originally set in 1955. One of the problems that was solved wisely was the cast. Most of them were teenagers, and every year it was obvious that they were getting older, so the series ages along with the actors, moving the series from the safe waters of Eisenhower's era to the era of Camelot, up to JFK and then to the turbulent half of the 1960s. This, together with the authors who run out of ideas, and later, actors like Ron Howard, leaving the series, wisely leaving while they were in front, made me want them to do everything right, pulling the plug on this show and going out they were ahead. This, along with worshiping idol worshipers in the studio, who simply could not control themselves every time Great Fonzi took the stage, began to wear out very quickly. <br /> <br /> This show originally portrayed the Fabulous Fifties, when we Like to remember that era. You know, time heals wounds. Everything has its place, and although I would prefer to hear “original hit versions” rather than “new stereo recordings”, these “new stereo recordings” worked very well in HAPPY DAYS. And here I am sorry that I bought a DVD! Unlike the full DVD of the first season, the original music of the second season was replaced by another one. Although it is great that the original episodes were digitally restored to digital perfection, the removal of the original music ruined what made the show so interesting to watch!
