I am going to talk about this film from two different points of view here. First, from the point of view of whether someone sees the movie and never reads (and, perhaps, never reads) a book. The second is from someone who has. <br /> <br /> (Film without a book) From a movie point of view, it was a good movie. Nowhere is it as good as in any of the Underworld, but much better than UltraViolet. And I'm not just talking about the storyline. The visual effects were dubious in many parts, although the transformation of the wolf was very pleasant. The characters have very little development, and Vivian does not even seem to care that her "love" was killing what was left of her appearance. Some other characters could have more air time, for example, the "Five". To my taste, the plot was similar to the Underworld. <br /> <br /> (film with a book) According to many, apart from the name, the names of the characters and several minor parts, the film and the book are nothing. So. In the film, Gabriel was much older and was the father of Rafe (so Astrid was once his assistant). In the book, Gabu was about 24 years old, he never mated with anyone, as wolves mate for life (Astrid tries to win his love), and Astrid was the mother of Ulf, not Rafe. Another important thing is the location. The book took place in Riverview, Maryland. Also, why they moved from West Virginia is another. There is Vivian’s fault in the film, and because of this, her entire family was killed. In the book, the original leader of The Five, named Axel, killed a girl from their school. The hunters tracked down the wolves and killed many of them (including Father Viv), forcing them to move. In addition, Viv's mom, Esme, was the main character. <br /> <br /> One thing from the book that would make the film better is “bitch dance”. For those who do not know, this is an ordeal when all the females (females of the pack) fight to see who will be the partner of the new leader (as there used to be a fight for males). Vivian won this by trying to save her mother from Astrid (who is the terrible evil woman in the book) and, thus, had to mate with Gab. Prophecies were not! In any case, if you read the book and you like the book, I highly recommend NOT watching this movie.
