A mad, terrible farce is mainly about a young man who refuses to obey or makes better use of the discrepancy to achieve his goals - deceives his parents, thinking that he is in college. The truth is that this jerk was rejected by every school he turned to. Having studied this garbage, you will understand why. <br /> <br /> What a ridiculous name is the South Hampton Institute of Technology. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out the initials of this nonsense. The problem with this type of film is that in the end, the nonconformist becomes an accepted regime. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the world of reality and call this film what it really is - excessive manipulative garbage!
