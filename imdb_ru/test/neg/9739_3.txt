Most of you really didn’t like this movie ... you were right. A small minority of you really loved the movie ... I can't say that you are wrong. For me, this film was too stupid. I've seen a lot of silly comedies, but this one surpasses each one. While I was watching, I couldn’t stop rubbing my eyes, not believing what I had seen, and trying to decide whether to laugh or cry, because “REAL DEAF” things happened on the screen and people left the theater. <br /> <br /> According to the leading characters, the journey through time is complete, just go into any museum and you will really go back in time. Plus, if you are looking for experience after death, just go to the nearest planetarium, there you will meet the Lord - excuse me, Loyd and get important commands ... All of the above does not make sense, right? Well, go on, watch the movie (I almost never regret the films I watch), you probably won't like it, but you will be intrigued by the writer's ability to create a script, ultimately STUPID ... <br /> <I give it 3 out of 10, not good, far from worse ...
