I usually like films about animals or reptiles that rebel against mean old people who threaten their environment, but I must say that Snake Island was a serious disappointment. <br /> <br /> The premise is an interesting group of people, including the writer, voiced by William Katt, goes to an island called “Snake Island” and asks how this island justifies its name. This is one thing that I will give this film: there are snakes, lots and lots of snakes of all sizes and types. Thus, this part of the film, to be honest, corresponds to its title, but the script, acting and direction is SOOOOOOOO, limping from which it is almost painful to watch. <br /> <br /> The characters are so incredible that I asked for snakes to finish off these terrible people in order to save us from suffering. There are a couple of scenes that are so surreal and ridiculous that they can be seen as believed in them - snakes whirl around to really awful disco music, while the two women dance together, and the scene with a snake holding meaningless dialogue with one of the actors. Ridiculous. I think the writer was trying to be funny, but it just turned out to be a strange trip with LSD ... <br /> <br /> I remember William Katt many years ago when he starred in Carrie, what a goat he was. ... not that he was ever the main star, but I am inclined to this garbage, I feel for him. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague if you really dislike movies in which there are lots and lots of snakes and really horrible people.
