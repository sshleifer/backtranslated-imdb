Dear SciFi Channel: How are you? How was your summer? I was fine, but I feel that our relationship is no longer the same, and we are growing apart. I do not understand why you no longer love me. I just finished watching your original SciFi channel "Skeleton Man", and, once again, you showed a clear disrespect for my feelings, killing every hot girl in this movie !!! I mean, I understand that you are just in this for instant gratification. All you care about is the creation of a film in which people are cut and cut off by the Indian spirit / creature / legend / whatever. Thus, you really do not have time to think and make efforts for something else, for example, to find a costume for “Skeletman”, which does not make him look like a gay, loving “Skeletor” from “He-Man”. Seriously, his clothes look like a sheet of satin blanket, and his skull is sleek, like a child’s back, it looks almost like a killer Halloween costume for a 6-year-old child as he passes through the desert in a frenzy of fury. Thus, we throw bones to you, because we are not looking for Oscar-winning performances, intriguing scenes, or realistic characters' reactions to arising situations. Because we understand that, although Michael Rooker, Caspar van Dim and all the girls must be Special Ops agents, they all mysteriously turn into copies of Keystone, who cannot shoot or see directly whenever the Skeleton appears. And we also fully expect that nothing — bullets, explosions, electric shocks, nothing — can kill the Skeleton Man until one minute remains in the film and we don’t have to find a way to neatly tie things together. We expect to see blood and guts. But you have the ability to take the least attractive actress from the entire composition and make her the only surviving woman. And frankly, I think that you do this only to confront me. Because this film, no matter how stupid it is, can potentially become a classic “so bad, it's good,” and simply destroying all the beauties destroys everything — and makes me downgrade it. All I ask is that once, once, you take into account my feelings and let the sexiest girls survive the film. You are welcome.
