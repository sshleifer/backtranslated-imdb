There are so many logical mistakes in this show that are hardly worth talking about. 1) Mystic Gohan does not exist 2) Uub is as strong as MAJIN BUU, but it plays absolutely no part in the show, anyway, it’s easy to beat every bad guy on the super 17 (which is the worst idea for a database villain) 4) Super Sayan 4 Goku is not suitable for Super 17, but not transformed Goku, using the move he learned in the film, which should not happen, kills his lightness 5) Vegeta is completely useless 6) No character except Goku has no effect on the outcome of the battles 7) The series ends with a bomb with the spirit ... come on 8) Goku is not eat? absorbs dragonflies? limping 9) Gotenks? ... even better is Goten ??? The trunks ??? they both suck 10) Super Sayan 4 includes magical transformation into an adult 11) Goku - a child 12) Goku - a child 13) No super-level 2 level (characterized by electricity) 14) No imagination with Goguet animation 15) Gogeta completely useless ) Kamehameha Big Bang is the biggest disappointment in anime history (not entirely logical, but I’m following a tangent) 17) The shortest fights for a character ever <br /> <br /> I could go on longer if I don’t suppressed most of the memories associated with this show. When I earn enough money, I will finance the reworking of this series.
