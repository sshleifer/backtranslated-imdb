Of all the films I could choose, this was supposed to be so. When I was last in New York, I went to Times Square store, and from the hundreds of DVDs they had, I chose Joel M. Reed's “Bloodsucking Freaks” (1976) and this, on a two-track DVD, which also included Seeds of Sin (1968) I regretted it? Read on to find out. The film opens on the island (near the Staten Island Milligan House), where two lovers are walking with a massive umbrella, apparently made of paper, and at some point he gave her the tip of the weeds as a gift. Out of nowhere, Colin (Hal Borske) appears a backward hunchback and kills them both for no reason. After the opening credits, joined by some of the worst headache music I've ever heard, at least it led me to this, since it is constantly used throughout the film, we are introduced to three pairs. All wives are the sisters Vicki (Ann Linden) and Ricard (Fib LaBlaque), Veronica (Eileen Hayes) and Bill (Don Williams), and also Elizabeth (Carol Vogel) and Donald (Richard Ramos). Each of them receives a letter from attorney H. Dobbs (Neil Flanagan) requesting a meeting so that he can read the testament of their late father. Dobbs informs them that they have to spend three days in the house of their childhood House Crenshaw and fill it with “sexual harmony and conjugal love”, which he never knew because of the tense relationship between their father and mother. He informs the couple that the will is extremely irregular, but legal. In three days the inheritance will be settled. Param also talks about servants Martha (Veronica Redburn), Hattie (Maggie Rogers) and backward Colin, who greets the couples, killing and biting the rabbit pieces in front of them. Later that night, what was left of the dead rabbit was found in one of the couples' beds with a note saying: "Blessed are the meek, for they inherit." It begins a series of events that end in a terrible murder and reveal gloomy family secrets. <br /> <br /> Co-authorship, photography and director of the worthless Andy Milligan. This is an absolutely horrible movie in every possible way. Let's look at only some of its shortcomings. Music is terrible and causes headaches. The sound, you can barely hear what the characters say, and in certain scenes there are no sound effects, plus at certain moments you can hear Milligan shouting orders to her actors, oh, and hissing sounds constantly on the soundtrack. The game is probably one of the worst I've ever seen. Very unusual effects, Colin looks out for someone in the sequence of discoveries, this is the size of a tennis ball, the part where someone is tied and the stomach is opened with a saw, looks really awful, just like the various hands and feet are chopped off. Photographing: Milligan absolutely does not know how to set or shoot a scene, he regularly cuts off the top, bottom or sides of people's heads and faces from the screen, and his camera jerks and shakes, as if it were used by someone who constantly stumbles. There is also at least one scene, so poorly thought out and filmed, that they saw a crew member. The film is often so dark that you can not see what is happening. Editing, again, some of the worst I've ever experienced, he seems to cut out the scenes before they finish, cutting while the characters are in the middle of a sentence. The script, if it was, was credited to both Milligan and Hal Sherwood (to write this! It took two people!) Everywhere and incredibly stupid. There is one incredibly bad sequence: the killer follows the victim to the basement, the killer goes right behind him, at some point the potential victim turns around. What does the killer do to not be noticed? They are hiding right from him, the killers are close enough to give the guy oral sex, but he does not notice them, right in front of him. You need to see this sequence to believe it, I still can not believe what I saw. Bizarre stories just happen and then disappear completely, check out the scene when Richard has to borrow money from his brother Walter (producer and coauthor Hal Sherwood), who turns out to be a gay priest who had an incestuous relationship with his brother before he was married ! A strange scene that is there for no reason. Martha, the housewife, responds to the first murder; she is more worried about the fact that she abandoned her lunch schedule! There are also a lot of crazy dialogues, Patti and Martha discuss Colin, says Patty, “if I hadn’t beat him so much,” Martha responds sympathetically, “You owe Patty, you owe!” Pronounced quite straightforwardly. And do not start me talking about how awful wallpaper looks all over the house! The only good thing I can say about is that the costumes look reasonable, for a period of time during which they should be installed. I could probably talk all day about how unprofessional it was, but I think you get the idea. One to avoid if your serious masochist! However, I did not regret neither the purchase nor the viewing!
