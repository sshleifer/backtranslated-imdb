Mining has an interesting story, if you donâ€™t remember its advertisement in newspapers in June 1984, you may have caught it on the Kino channel in the summer of 85, but there is little to remember. The plot is again your main killer in the forest. But ironically, it was filmed until Friday the 13th. In fact, the victim was shot somewhere in 1978, according to one of the actors in an interview a few years later. But released during the week on some entries (yes, Jim, entry Namanov showed it in June 84 years). But it looks obsolete. Maybe they released it later in order to make money on all the other terror films with which the market was flooded by 1984. Now there is some kind of prehistory in this story: a forest fire in the 1940s burned down many gypsies to death. But one of their children survived (our monster), so let's fast forward to modernity, which will come in 1978, we have an older middle-aged couple who go camping only for monsters. The tag line for this picture states that it is NOT a PERSON, AND ITS GOT THE AX, but the Ax has been used only in these first two murders. Now we have a group of teenagers who look like they are about 20 years old. We all know that they are prey, and the monster knocks them out one by one. For an 80-minute film, this seems longer. We also have lots of wildlife videos to fill the voids for 80 minutes. In general, while filming the horror film of the 80s, he looks much bigger than ever. Hey, mining could potentially be a good horror killer in a forest movie, but a bit underpowered ... However, in the end it shows a rather scary, cool looking monster, and we need to wait until the last 2 minutes to see it. Note: The monster starred in films about the Addams family in the 1990s.
