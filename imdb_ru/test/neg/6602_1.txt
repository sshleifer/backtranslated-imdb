Usually, when a television biopic is released to a celebrity, it is at least countless people (i.e. Cybill Shepard as Martha Stewart, Lauren Bacall as Doris Duke), this is the most horrible, cheap and television film BORING ever created by If the VH-1 is going to make a television movie, they MUST spend a little more money on it. Flex Alexander — although talented in Michael’s voice — is not a great dancer, nothing like Michael and not even devoid of manners. VH-1 could do more if he hired a real imitator, so when Michael begins to do plastic surgery, he doesn't really look exactly the same. Why should we be puzzled by Michael's nose reduction, when its size is exactly the same as at the beginning of the movie? The woman who plays Elizabeth Taylor cannot act and is not like her, and does not even turn me on to a woman like Janet Jackson. A terrible script and a serious case of mis-broadcasting should prevent VH-1 from releasing more films. Fleks Alexander would make much better ZHERMENA Jackson, and not Michael. Suits? Trash robberies. Neverland Collected together frames from news documents. Do not worry about it .... it is not even remotely worth it. One good cast is an actor portraying Joseph Jackson, and CAN BE an actress in the role of Lisa Marie Presley, although she should have been a more pretty girl than a girl.
