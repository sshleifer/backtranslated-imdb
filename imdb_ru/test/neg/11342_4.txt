Thunder Alley discovers that Fabian banned NASCAR tracks after the death of another driver. Stanley Adams may want to put him on his team of riders, but other drivers don't want him around. <br /> <br /> Fabian, desperate for employment, contacts the owner of the auto-trick Jan Murray, who pays him peanuts and tries to capitalize on Fabian’s bad reputation. stay. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is Fabian’s attempt to return to the NASCAR track, at the same time juggling both Annette and his current girlfriend, Diana McBain. Personally, I would take McBain, she has Annette. <br /> <br /> Thunder Lane helps by shooting the terrain on the southern NASCAR tracks and shooting a good movie about NASCAR races. It does not help a rather stupid story, which delves into the real cause of Fabian’s problems and his rather unrealistic recovery after him. <br /> <br /> However, NASCAR fans can go for it.
