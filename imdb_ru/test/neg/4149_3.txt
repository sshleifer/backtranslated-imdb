As a child of the 80s, like many other reviewers, I hated the original V and V: the final battle. I own both on VHS and never connect a VCR to watch them. I remember that I didn’t really like this short-lived series, but I couldn’t remember why, so I rented the first CD. By the third episode, my memory was updated. It's horrible. The letter is terrible. It is not even fun. They had a lot of material to work here, but it seemed that they simply didn’t know what to do, so they turned it into “Days of our lives with alien lizards”. How cool and full of potential is the concept of Elizabeth Starchild? All they could think of was to turn her into a whiny, boring teenager to romantically compete with her mother? Mark Singer looked less embarrassed when he was at Beastmaster II than when he fell into the trap of this madness ... The bottom line is whether you are one of the young people who just discovered V, or one of us old fans of science fiction who are looking to rediscover the old fun, take care of yourself and miss it!
