I really tried to love Saw. The story was good, and I admire the frantic pace of filming. However, there were too many cliches and elements that, although they looked “cool”, actually did not make sense. <br /> <br /> First, in the film I liked the general tone of the story, and I thought the premise was fantastic. The character of The Jigsaw Killer was intriguing and reminded me of vintage Dario Argento. Danny Glover was superb as an obsessive detective, and Monica Potter was good at the ungrateful role of the doctor's abducted wife. Shawney Smith’s scene was incredible, and Van and Wannell should be commended for using this scene as a demonstration to get support for the film. The idea that the zigzag killer finds a way to kill himself with his victims is an excellent concept, but as soon as the film was released, the logic began to disappear. <br /> <br /> As soon as they showed that Zap was the only one holding hostage the wife and daughter of Dr. Gordon, it was obvious that he was not the killer of the puzzle, but part of it. The scene where he puts the stethoscope on the frightened Diana's heart, and Allison screams at him through the gag, was one of the freest scenes I've ever seen. It was supposed to be intimidating, but install nothing. In addition, since the puzzle killer finds a way to kill himself, he easily cuts the throat of a policeman. I think this is a way to show that he does not want to be caught and will go to any means necessary to prevent this from happening, but for me this is simply not logical, especially when he doesn’t show remorse about the death of another detective (which I I liked it, it would be better if it was given to someone who really deserves it). <br /> <br /> I felt like Lee Wannell is fine, like Adam. It was not a spectacular role, and he has great potential as a character. However, I was not too fond of the direction of James Van. The story may have been original, but the direction was definitely not there. I think I'm tired of speed, the MTV style goes in favor of the old approach to directing, but many scenes involving the Jigsaw killer reminded me too much of "Se7en", too much. As the film progressed, for me it became a series of demos, such as "Hey, see what I can do." Instead of being intriguing, it became very distracting. But hey, it worked. He is now in charge of "Final Destination 3", so he is on his way to a successful career, and I think he will be directing super horror in the coming years. <br /> <br /> What I really did for me was the ending. As I said, I knew that Jigsaw is not Zap, and I liked how Adam opened the mini tape recorder after he was killed. It would have a terrific end, with the exception of one fatal flaw: I felt that they had to leave it where you did not know who the killer was. The way it was done was done for one reason only: boy, are we smart? No, it just didn't make sense to me. <br /> <br /> Some of the best horror films are made for a reason where there is a cause of violence that we see in the story. Although Saw started out very well, it began to collapse due to the insatiable need of directors to be “cool” and distract from the history of victories they had. Perhaps, if they weren't too persistent in creating the films themselves and relied on a more experienced horror director to direct them, I think it would be a horror classic that she had unfairly received in the last four months. If this is "Cabin Fever" - the future of horror, I am very scared.
