This film was a huge disappointment. The anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and a hasty presentation of a rather lame villain, but I expected Shambala to tie up all the empty ends. Unfortunately, this is not the case. He added more holes in the plot than he decided, and confused more than he found out. The animation and voice were great, but with an idiotic plot, a boring setting (most of the film does not even happen on the boring Earth of World War II, but not in the world of alchemy) and a disappointing ending (Ed is useless for the rest of his days in a world without alchemy, ditched Winry?), it was on the whole rather dim. Do yourself a favor - do not pay attention to the last half of the anime, as well as this film, and read the manga.
