How truly sad that it came from the same opinion as Donnie Darko, perhaps one of the best films in this genre. Where can I start? I think that one of the most ardent aspects of the film is that we must criticize humanity, and yet we do not see humanity in it. No more than 5 minutes of the film is spent on torment about the possible death of another person. These are terrible one-dimensional cardboard cutouts of people. Unfortunately, this is how they play with what can only be called a terrible game. Is this really how Kelly sees humanity? Judging by the reaction of the audience, this is a terrible capsule of humanity. Why don't movie characters ask questions that all viewers have? This is not an accusation of humanity. This is an indictment of straw men who are set by Kelly, who have little resemblance to real people in this situation. <br /> <br /> To those who say that it was a wonderful film that makes you wonder what you are comparing it with? Armageddon? I even saw someone compare this with the works of Kurosawa. How sincerely should you think that this will contribute to a good existential discussion? For the love of all the good in the movie! Even the Indecent Proposal ten times more blames humanity for this. There we see people who are truly painful because of greed and the condition of a person. Yes, even the “Indecent Proposal” puts this film to shame for philosophical discussions, and yet it gets 5.3 versus 6.0 for this meaningless deception. <br /> <br /> Rarely did I see a more pretentious, pontificational and self-deprecating film falling so directly on his face. It has a high school film project depth, and a poor one at that. Truly, this is about the level of discussion promoted by this film. If you want to watch a GOOD psychological film, do yourself a favor and watch Das Experiment. If the "Stash" even corresponded to this single goal, I would be ready to forgive some terrible actions, gaping holes in the plot and a completely meaningless storyline. Unfortunately, he can't even do that. <br /> <br /> The true accusation of humanity is that there are people who think that this film deeply deepens the introspective look at the human condition. This is not Sartre! This is not even the version of Cliff Notes Sartre! This is a hastily thought-out and cracked 9th grade coursework about Sartre, based on some conversations on a bulletin board on the Internet. If Sartre were still alive, he would have sued Kelly for libel.
