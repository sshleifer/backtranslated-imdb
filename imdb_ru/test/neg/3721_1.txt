Although I do not recommend this film, I also do not recommend reading this review without previewing the film. Although I did not give up the ending or most of the plot twists, this film is best viewed without prior information. It is difficult to determine the main problem with the film "Donnie Darko", as there are many people with whom we have to deal. Richard Kelly, in his first feature film, seems to have collected enough scenes of teenage anger, nighttime masonry rioters, self-righteous excuses and a harmless, banal philosophy to inspire twenty teenage playwrights; then mix them into a single two-hour package with a sci-fi twist. The result is deeply upsetting - for all the wrong reasons. The film tries to lead the audience along intricate paths without any sense of symbolism or meaning, make them sympathize with one-dimensional characters and, above all, hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped story full of irreconcilable empty ends, hiding it under the guise of CGI-effects and non-surrealism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man dedicated to treatment, misunderstood by his friends and upset and dissatisfied with his suburban life. We must feel that he is smarter than his classmates, although sometimes it is difficult to do. For example, when one of his friends puts forward an absurd theory about the Smurfs, and Donnie objects to his own theory, his friend complains that Donnie is behaving “cleverly”. Donnie's speech, however, is not smarter than his friend's speech - just meaner. The only clear evidence of his intelligence is that its director described the standardized test results as “frightening”; but, given the director's tendency to simply categorize human elements (as shown in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), this is a bad substitute for character development. Donnie takes prescribed medications to deal with mental problems that are not dealt with directly in this film. In fact, the whole problem with drugs is understated, and one of the first chances that the director should buy the film is lost. The ambiguity of Donny’s strange fate, the likelihood that all this may be a product of his imagination, has been relegated to the background, making the film 100 percent science fiction. This would not be bad in itself, except that the “science” behind the “fiction” is very shaky. Explanations of time travel are weak, at best, seem detached, ignorant chatter. We understand that the author of the film once read a book about time travel or several chapters, and cannot remember how it works, but I was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to include it in the film. As a result, the scientific part is more dependent on expensive computer animations than on the actual development of relevant theories (at some point a teacher discussing time travel claims that if he continues to speak on this topic, he will be fired. Further explanations are not required). Donny’s relationship with a visitor from the future encourages him to commit several vicious acts. Justifying these actions is difficult. He damages his school, but this is normal because his school does not treat him as a person. His punishment for the eerie advocate of self-esteem (something like the character of Tom Cruise in Magnolia) leads to the public humiliation of a person. But should the audience believe that Donnie is a kind of angel-avenger, striking against ignorance and debauchery? He himself seems to be ignorant of the consequences of these actions to the end. In addition to these shortcomings, the film is permeated with flat, uninteresting generalizations of humanity. The plot unfolds in 1988, shortly before the Bush / Dukakis election, and the director touches on this issue during the film. However, the emphasis extends to this: Donny's rude father, blue-collar, votes for Bush, while his freedom-loving, naughty daughter plans to vote for Dukakis. There is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement; just a statement of the obvious. The former are not necessary for making a good film, but the latter should be excluded. Similarly, Donny's heartfelt speech about the inability to mix all human emotions with unconditional categories of “fear and“ love ”; This does not require large leaps of understanding from the audience. Everyone knows that there are more than two people. emotions, and special emphasis on this fact is useless. Mr. Kelly in his film pays tribute to several symbols of the pop culture of the 80s: ET, Stephen King, The Smurfs, Back to the Future. In fact, this film looks like a director's tribute to himself, a collection of his own experiences, interests, personal heroes and opponents, affirmations and disappointments, roughly sewn with unprepared hands. Entire songs are played in a music video format for the actions of the characters, apparently because the director loves songs. Characters who have little or no relation to the plot (including the archetypical hooligan, the fat girl and the right idiot teacher) get an unnecessary focus, because the director really wanted to put them together in some way. Donnie Darko’s embarrassing mess makes us wonder if Mr. Kelly has enough ideas to create another film or has he spent all his work in one meaningless, erratic, tortuous effort. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/10.
