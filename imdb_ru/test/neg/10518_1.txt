There are some great Canadian films. There are some shit. Last night I watched one of the shitty ones. It was not a typical Canadian film, in which he tried to be so different, being artistic. This film tried to be a kind of Hollywood gangster film. It was terrible. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning I had a feeling that it would be a bad movie. He had the most fun dialogue, which can only be in the movie. There was this voice for one scene, and then he never returned. It always bothers me when directors just use voice overs when they can't come up with another creative way to tell a story. <br /> <br /> I know that in the Canadian film industry I have to support my fellow human beings, but this film is rubbish. The package is something like a soprano episode, just not realistic. The daddy of the banker’s mafia boss is on his deathbed and orders his son to make the business legal. Not so original. And the workers complain about it, but they just accept the fact that they will soon leave work as nothing. To make it legal, they use extortion. The irony. But not a good view. Then some monstrous show-girl, who had a terrible wig and Elvis's mole, covering half of her face, robs the main character and as if rape him. In any case, for some reason this guy now loves to dress like girls. Then this banker connects with a prostitute when he has a beautiful future wife at home. But he falls in love with a prostitute because a prostitute dresses like a man and puts on make-up on him. She blackmails him with photos of him wearing a bra and panties. However, he still loves her. He also has no reason to leave his fiancé, but he does this in order to be with a prostitute. <br /> <br /> For the film about the organization of crime and sexual fetish there was no action, no sex. It was like late night cinemax porn without good stuff. Future sex scenes were not hot or sexy. It was too amateur. The film was nothing but a silly plot. <br /> <br /> I don’t think it was an actor’s mistake. I think they had a terrible script for work. Most of all stood out ridiculous characters. The bad guy's name was Uncle Bunny or something. But the name was not important. They were all cliches. The dialogue was ridiculous throughout the film, and other viewers laughed out loud at some of the “serious” moments of the film. Then the worst of it all. It was supposed to be the cheapest final. If you ever remember playing, shoot in childhood with imaginary or toy pistols. It was basically the end of the film. But I was more than happy that it was over, and I had to warn my compatriots so that they would not waste time and money on watching this film.
