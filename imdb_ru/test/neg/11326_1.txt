A few years ago, I deliberately watched bad movies. Somehow I missed this. No gesture sounds believable. No facial expression matches either the scene or the action. I have never heard such inappropriate music for a movie. On the final stage, I was rooting for a car that would have moved this ridiculous child - one of the worst child actors in history. <br /> <br /> I had only one name - Wilford Brimley. He must have been very hungry to take part. <br /> <br /> NOT FITS ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, LOOK THIS FILM !!! YOU were warned !!!
