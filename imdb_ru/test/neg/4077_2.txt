I want to say that I went to this film with too high expectations. I thought it would be funny, because it was a continuation of Bruce Almighty, which was really funny, and it was filmed by Steve Carell, a great comedian, but man, that sucks. <br /> <br /> The film is advertised as a sequel, but it really has nothing to do with the original, since the only people who replay their roles are Morgan Freeman and Steve Carell, but Steve’s character is completely different, he’s not the same dumb as he was in the first, he is a good guy, The story is different, the actors are different, and it is not funny. <br /> <br /> All the actors involved (Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Wanda Sykes, John Goodman, Ed Helms and even John Stewart in a very crappy cameo) have talent, but none of them seem to use it, and it seems that in the film it's just for the money. <br /> <br /> Now the plot is clearly shaped according to the story of Noah, but there are so many wrong things in it. I do not know where to start. I think the big problem is that everyone around Evan thinks that he is crazy, despite everything that happens to him, in two days he grows a huge white beard, he is helped by animals from all over the world, he builds a giant arc in a few weeks, in real life, people will not scoff at this guy after this, they will say that he is the new Noah. <br /> <br /> Also, the special effects are good, but what the hell is the biggest movie ever made in Evan Almighty? Did they really have to waste such good special effects as filler for this shitty movie? <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey seems to be a smart guy, as he avoided the three worst sequels ever made, Son Mask, Dumb and Stupid, and now Evan Almighty. <br /> <br /> This was a huge disappointment, and Tom Shyadak should be ashamed of himself.
