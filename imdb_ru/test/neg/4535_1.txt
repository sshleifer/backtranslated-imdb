It is sad that they are allowed into film festivals these days. I had to sit for more than twenty minutes of this dismal short show, which is not funny at all, to get a good spot for a feature film that I wanted to watch at a local film festival. The festival organizers have connected this terrible shorts with a great feature. I'm just glad that this function was good, otherwise I would not be a very happy tourist! <br /> <br /> There was no laughter for the comedy short film. The name speaks for itself.
