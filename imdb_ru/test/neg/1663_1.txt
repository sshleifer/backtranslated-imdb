Several stupid children unwittingly uncover the evil that has been inactive for the past twenty years, and are forced to reap the misfortune that comes with it. The film “Brothers Campbell” before “Midnight Skater” was funny and their picture after “Red Skulls” was all right. So why is "demon summer" so shockingly bad? I really don’t know, it’s better than their “Splatter Rampage Wrestling”, but not as much as the basement level of acting, and when the horror film is as talkative as this one is not very good. thing. The story has been filmed to death in many other top movies, so why waste your time on this one? <br /> <br /> My rating: D-
