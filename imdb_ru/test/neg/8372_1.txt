This is really the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life (I'm about 47)! The description on the back cover was like scrolling the text at the beginning of the movie. A further conspiracy was zero, and even a handful of corpses would show more life in their "game." I looked through its entire length and was very happy when the death of the last character was the end of my sufferings! The place was either some kind of storage or a dirty beach. I assume that the home video equipment served as a camera and the lighting was not standard. The dialogues were boring and devoid of meaning. How were the faces of the actors. Which brings me to the topic of "makeup": apparently, they perceived it as tricks in the magazines of some teenagers "My first own make-up" or the like. What made me buy a DVD is the name "Lovecraft" printed on the cover. The only connection with the works of this brilliant mind was the use of the name "Necronomicon", which was mistakenly translated as "The Book of Light". The 4.70 euro I paid for this DVD was a complete loss, because the DVD went into the box for processing without further ado.
