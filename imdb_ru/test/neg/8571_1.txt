Review: Encouragement films. They have been around since time immemorial. Some of them come to mind, this is the Mexican film of devil worship "Alucard", "Night of Demons 2", "Monastery" and, of course, "Desecration of Dante Tomazellis." I can't blame anyone for trying to use a religious / holy image and distort it to make it scary. If done correctly, it works. Here is the most recent addition to the sub-genre of non-exploitation called "The Nun." <br /> <br /> A story about this group of girls who live in a Catholic school. In this school there is a nun who is especially cruel to one of the girls. Girls who act in self-defense against an abusive nun accidentally kill her, then decide to bury her and not to tell anyone. Fast forward 18 years later, and the nun returns to take revenge on those who killed her. <br /> <br /> This film was shot at the fantastic factory of Brian Yuznas. You know, the company that makes horror movies in Spain. Need a reminder of what films this company is releasing? Well, here is a small reminder: arachnid, darkness, romasant: werewolf hunting, Rottweiler. You get the picture. The only really good film made by this company (in my opinion) was Stuart Gordons Dagon. This is it. Oh no, wait, I think they also fired Christian Bale's superb “Machinist” machine. But it is so. So when I deliberately rented this film, I knew that I was not going to watch something that would be incredibly good. However, with all this psychological preparation, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> One of the good things about this movie is its sleek look. The film has good cinematography. It doesn't look like a cheap horror movie. The special effects of the films were fine, because the Nun could travel on water. Well, it was an image that was taken for granted during some cool moments that sometimes scratched the damp ground, but were sometimes steep enough to look. I dug that scene with a nun hurling myself in people like a bucket of water. This is not a particularly deadly move, but it made for a cool visual. There is some blood here, but not so much. One particular scene related to the death of the elevator was cool, but unfortunately, the film reached its summit with this scene. And it was only halfway through. After that, nothing really cool happens, and the film turns into an incredible boring holiday. <br /> <br /> From time to time the film just turns into a nun, who occasionally breaks out to scare us, she kills someone, and then CUT! We return to the characters talking shit, go through the rooms, open the doors, you get an exercise. And I just hate it when a horror movie turns into this. People open the door and go into the rooms. Boring! And when the characters talk, this is a terrible dialogue. In one particularly stupid scene, the character immediately out of the blue decides that the nun turns into flesh and blood whenever she is in water, so that they can go and try to kill her. And everyone just says OK! And they all develop this plan to kill the nun in the water tank. Now, who gave this guy that information, and why did others just take it for granted? Who the hell knows, but such scenes make the film look stupid. <br /> <br /> Another thing that prevented me from enjoying this film was that they used Spanish actors who had a very thick accent. When they try to speak English, it is very difficult to understand what the hell they are trying to say. I would prefer to be voiced, and then try to find out what they are saying and be disappointed. The fact that there are no English subtitles on this DVD did not help either. <br /> <br /> So in conclusion, this film has nice visual effects, nice sound effects, but a terrible horrible script. I think it just shows that you can have the biggest budget or the best special effects, but if your movie has a bad script with horrible characters and situations that your audience cannot communicate with, then you still have a bad movie. This was the case with the Nun. <br /> <br /> If you want to really have some fun with evil nuns, rent any of the movies I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Now, as for the creators of this film, they have to say, say, ten degrees and light fifty candles to their chosen saint in order to find out if they will be forgiven for having shot this sinfully horrible film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5
