I am a German student, so sorry for any mistakes (Iâ€™m working on it;)) <br /> <br /> The style is very interesting, transformed and with effective sound effects, underlined by the dramatic effect of a dramatic deviation, not terrible bad actors (insincere and unnatural movements and expressions of feelings) and make a relatively strange and meaningless story less good. Just a typical slasher genre with in this case a very strange action. Many plays partially destroy the main story and allow viewers to plunge into the darkness to the end, create oddities and suggest a sense of action and the meaning is simply dull. Surely this is a hit for fans of slasher, but not for me. But although an interesting style of cinematography and skillful use of light turned out to be successful. <br /> <br /> So not the best ...
