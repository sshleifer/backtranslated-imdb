So, I’m wondering while watching this movie, did the producers of this film manage to save money on Sandra Bullock’s wardrobe by pulling her “up” clothes from Miss Congeniality? Did Miss Bullock also get sleepwalking through the role, directing “before” Gracie Hart? As noted by many reviewers, the film is very formal. Add to this that the deja vu viewer experiences with Cassie Mayweather as the somewhat darker Gracie Hart with a more long history, and she quickly became a stupid festival. <br /> <br /> Two bad guy serial killers were made earlier (and better) in other films. As before, the character "a good guy tries to protect his partner, despite the evidence." In fact, none of the characters in the film never goes beyond two dimensions and does not try to be anything other than banal stereotypes. <br /> <br /> One final note - the use of the term "serial killer" is a false advertisement. Killing one person - even if it is an intentional murder - does not make you a serial killer. You may have the potential to become a serial killer, but you are not a serial killer or even a killer.
