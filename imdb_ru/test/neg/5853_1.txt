Michael Allred's stories about comics, especially his work on Madman, are usually a lot of fun. Astroesque, Allred's low-budget indie film, is the opposite of fun. <br /> <br /> The worst action ever combined with a truly awful dialogue creates a cruel cinematic experience. Almost certainly Allred understands that WTF is happening, but he is the only one. It is not enough to look at you, to see the whole mess ... to challenge, to see this whole mess, is more than a goal. <br /> <br /> Astroesque is a kind of film in Alred's movie Red Rocket. The 7 "comic book, which, ironically, is mostly unreadable. Therefore, if your Astro experience is not so terrible, definitely keep track of large-sized comics and continue the fun. <br /> <br /> Sorry for Alred, who absolutely unable to try a movie. I also felt sorry for myself, what an incredible waste of my time and money. Please buy my copy of VHS, which is available right now on eBay.
