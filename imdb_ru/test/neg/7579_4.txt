I have to explain that since this trend is breaking Asian horror films, this Shutter is head and shoulders above The Grudge and Dark Water, although it still does not reach the same level of atmospheric creep that The Ring sets. <br /> However, films, like life, do not exist in a vacuum and, therefore, can be compared with other films in the genre of obscurity / thriller / horror. Honestly, I don’t write a long synopsis here and say that this film is trying to rely on the “frightening” panic caused by the music, and not on the atmosphere, but the “ghost” itself is really not so remarkable. The plot is quite simple and predictable, and there is nothing special about it. While there are several exciting scenes that border on creatively scary, most of the film is pretty vanilla. If you like The Grudge and it looks like, then you might like it. <br /> <br /> Rating: C-
