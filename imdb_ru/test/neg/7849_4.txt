Perhaps the director was trying to find another PIRATE (musical “Good Garland and Kelly”), but this lame musical era did not work. The voices of Sinatra and Catherine Graysons do not mix very well - and their chemistry lacks a spark. Sinatra's background as a nice guy who tries to impersonate his deceased father "bandito" is fine, but he seems awkward in this role. What is surprising and wonderful here is how Sinatra can take a rather tasteless song and make it sound special - his phrases and eloquence as a singer make you want to hear it again. When Grayson sings the same songs, it's hard to believe that she doesn't sing something completely different and not so interesting. She has a great moment with “Love where you find her,” which is perfect for her and demonstrates her abilities. Photography is profitable, and both stars look attractive, as are the costumes and scenery. Co-stars Mildred Natwick and J. Carroll Nash have put a lot of energy into creating impossible work. Besides singing Sinatra, there is a strange dance under the direction of Manlbahn, Sid Charisse and Ann Miller. It is fascinating and strange. Montalban and Charisse were a wonderful dance team, and this number is a real oddity.
