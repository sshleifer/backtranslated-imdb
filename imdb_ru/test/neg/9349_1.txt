I like the Star Wars series. I also like a good, cheap science fiction film. Gosh, I even like the New York jobs that Roger Corman produces. <br /> <br /> Although I don't like Ice Pirates. <br /> <br /> First of all, it looks too cheap, understand? For the film, which should take place in space, it seems cramped and closed, as if it was being shot in the front seat of someone's Mazda. And the special effects, although they look ugly, look more like foam rubber, painted in metallic gray. <br /> <br /> I usually don't let such things bother me, especially if the story and characters are worth it. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. <br /> <br /> The whole storyline about these unhealthy space pirates who decided to find a planet filled with ice that they could melt and sell like water (I think this is a hot commodity in the future) is about as original as jokes that are not a compliment. <br /> <br /> Humor manifests itself at about the level of the perineum (for example, you will see the castration of the machine early) and everyone seems to have a capricious attitude. And who told John Matuzak that he was funny? Whoever did, shame them. Good old Robert Urich is trying, but he is a reliable actor aboard a poorly sinking ship (or starship, in this case). <br /> <br /> I watched this movie three times, and every time I felt the same - shanghaied. <br /> <br /> Without stars. Despite the presence of Houston (one year before the Honor of the Prizzi) and Carradine (at the end of the once high career), these "Pirates" must walk on the board.
