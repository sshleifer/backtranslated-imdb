There are some ideas about a decent but routine history of the Federation Council. This is hampered by several factors. First, the actor is just awful. Even competent actors are terrible. The dialogue is wooden and stilted. The plot walks predictably. Itâ€™s like a finished film, not like actors passing through a film. Extremely disappointing.
