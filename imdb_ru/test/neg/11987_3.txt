Uwe Boll returns to his filmmaking skills to tell a fantastic, scary story about mercenaries and reporters fighting super-soldiers on a remote island. A good cast, led by the excellent Udo Keir, is set free by Ball, who does the worst-case scenario that should have worked. The mad scientist that the reporter is investigating was executed to death, but this scenario is funny enough for the plot to work, besides, the effects and design of the super-soldier with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of eeriness, but Ball somehow manages to shoot everything purpose. As if he couldn't be bothered to actually figure out what worked, and instead ran out of the backup cameras and left. In addition, the scene collection has no spark, no life, I suppose that Ball took only one or two takes and simply used what he had. It really stinks. Obviously, Ball in one of his periodic retrograde films, where everything he ever learned about the film broke out. The last film he did was so bad was The Serial Killer, which is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's not that bad, but it's close just because it was supposed to be better. On the other hand, Udo Keir is so good that he makes watching his scenes worth the effort and makes this film almost so bad. I would take a pass, if not late at night, and you catch it by telegram.
