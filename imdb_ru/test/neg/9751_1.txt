Seriously, I don’t understand why people all love: “Oh God, Step Up - The Best Movie Ever !!!” This is a bunch of rubbish! The action, first of all, is ridiculous, and let's not even talk about dialogue, because it was awful ... The films should be interesting, and this, let me say first of all, was * not * entertainment, I really laughed because that I was so embarrassed to look at it. Music and dancing also did nothing for me. And what about the Channing Tatum "zharkost", which they say all the girls? No difference. The film was pathetic. Do not waste your time or money. If you are not a fan of dance films, but such films are not films ... they are jokes.
