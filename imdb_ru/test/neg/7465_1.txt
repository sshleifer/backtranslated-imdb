What can you say about a grainy, poorly made 16-mm boyish film, where the German Shepherd Dog is the best and most attractive performer? Nothing that would be positive. Avoid this parody at all costs. In any case, it will be difficult to find, since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal topic in the United States. I highly recommend IMDb to revisit their weighing formula for rating, as the estimate of 8.8 for this part of feces is absurd! I am by no means a bigot and spent many hours enjoying classic porn movies of the 70s and 80s; but it is the worst product even by the weaker standards of the (then illegal) deer cycle.
