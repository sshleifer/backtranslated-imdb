Dee Snyder is the villain in this film, and his bad play and reappraisal spoiled him for me. The whole film seemed to be taken too seriously. He is trying to reach the dark atmosphere of the "Seven" without a good game. The film tells about the "subculture" of urban industrial rock / tattoo / body art and expects to be amazed (scared?) The size of the guy's nose ring. I am not an expert on films, but the script and actions in this film are just awful. Dee Snyder looks like a villain, but his behavior is absolutely terrible. I recommend not to waste time on this if nothing else is available.
