Enter the Ninja (1981) was the first of several Ninja films shot by Cannon in the lead role or with the participation of Japanese sensation Sho Kosugi. But the star of the first Ninja film was the legendary tough guy Franco Nero. Unfortunately, even Mr. Nero or Sho Kosugi could not make this movie watchable. When there are two bad guys in an action movie, and it's not watchable and not fun, something is wrong. But I digress. Skip this chapter and watch the following films in the series. They are more interesting and more fun. <br /> <br /> Next is the Ninja Revenge. Instead of playing in the "evil East" (I use this term "tongue in the cheek"). He is a star! Strange for a western movie. Take a look at this. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, with the exception of Sho Kosugi fans or film lovers.
