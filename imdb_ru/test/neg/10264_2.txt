This movie sucks !! Looks like they just decided to place the scenes by accident. Good blood, but little plot. Sally whines and complains about everything until she becomes a demon. I realized that she had PMS. It seemed so. Dubbing in this movie is terrible. One scene that the woman was talking about, and a few seconds before we heard any sound. At that moment I knew that my suspicions were true, that it was not from the USA. I tried to follow, but I lost half the way and it was very hard for me to believe, even for a horror movie. Some good characters, but not many. Do not waste time.
