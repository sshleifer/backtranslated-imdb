To this day, I have never seen Elizabeth Shu in anything else because of the stench of this film. Poor, ill-prepared and racially Neanderthal, this was the case in Chicago, where every black person apparently lived in a blues club. , SPOILER FORWARD. ..., SPOILER: her blues solo was even more painful than her stupid game, and her introduction to “Nobody leaves without blues singing” was just as silly as a post. The children she played with were unbearable, and long before the end of the film I wanted something terrible to happen to all of them. <br /> <br /> I have to say that there is one peculiarity in this film; The film needs a lot to insult me, but this smoldering piece did what Chopper, Phantom Menace and Catwoman could not - I was nauseous.
