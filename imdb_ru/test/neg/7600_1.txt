Beethovan Lives Upstairs is a very bad movie. In my world history lesson, our teacher asked us to watch this film and Amadeus so that we could compare two composers or something like that. At first we watched Amadeus, and it was a very good film, but when she made us watch this film right after that, I could not believe what I had seen. The game was terrible, the costumes were terrible (the little boy was especially ugly and girly), and the cinema was z-rank. A friend of mine compared it to a home movie without displaying the date in the lower right corner. I understand that it was a television film from Canada, and it probably cost 10 dollars, but please, they could be better. At one time I saw some good films about T., but it was not one of them. The biggest thing I don’t understand is why my World History class couldn’t just watch the Immortal Beloved or something like that. How can composers be compared by giving them the film “Amadeus” for Mozart and “Beethoven Lives Above” for Beethovan? It is impossible to do when it is the choice of a film for Beethoven. I give Amadeus A- (9 out of 10) if someone wants to know, but Beethovan Life Upwards gets F (1 out of 10).
