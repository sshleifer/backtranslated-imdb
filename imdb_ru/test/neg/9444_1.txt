Ed Wood, perhaps the worst director of all time, left us jewels that are SO bad, they delight, being unintentionally funny, and therefore charming and innocent. <br /> <br /> James Lei and his financial backers (mom and dad) Judging by the captions, in “The Land of Dreams” created a film as poorly made as any Ed Wood film, but devoid of charm or innocence. The country of dreams simply stinks, and the only thing that is good about this 90-minute waste of time is the definite knowledge that James Lei and his buddies will never make another picture. <br /> <br /> I have to mention some dramatic Some crew members tried to avoid this horrible picture. I am sure that the production controller, once having seen the finished film, demanded to change his or her name in the credits to Donna Snartlebutt and in accounting for Brutus. One can imagine Brutus with its $ 5 bills paid to the team at the end of the shooting day. <br /> <br /> I will not mention many technical problems with this pathetic video cassette, but I have to mention a few comments that compare this slag with the work of David Lynch. You know that you have become a real stinker when your mom enters IMDb and publishes such an amazing BS - no one, except violent mentally ill people, can be mistaken in a “dreamland” with anything produced by Lynch. What a terrible weakness against Mr. Lynch and his work. <br /> <br /> Come back to film school, Mr. Ley.
