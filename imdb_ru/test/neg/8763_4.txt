One of the horror shlockmeister low-budget actors, the more lively roles of John Carradine as a Nazi scientist who turns people into zombies to serve the Reich. Senseless fight in the brain of the dead, able to obey only the simplest orders .... a bit like the staff at McDonalds. <br /> <br /> Hitler is not mentioned by name, since America was not at the time at war, they were dropped, but it’s obvious who the bad guys work for! <br /> <br /> The film seems to have two types of zombies, the traditional type of voodoo, popular in old black and white films of the 1930s. and 40s. Empty-eyed and just following the instructions of someone else when they stumble. And then there is the type that we know from later films such as Night of the Living Dead and Evil Dead. Still wandering, but only with the intention to kill and eat the flesh and brains of their victims. Both have their moments in various films over the years. <br /> <br /> “Revenge” is a former type of zombie, although they look particularly stupid and look like home on old, ugly geeky shows that bite their heads off to chickens. One black zombie named Lazarus with his wild hair looks like a young don-king. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, the evil doctor decides to make his wife a zombie with the others, and it is here that he makes his mistake. Despite the fact that he allows her to keep his sandals as a pleasant feminine touch, when he turns her into one of the living dead, she is not happy about it. <br /> <br /> Everything goes terribly wrong and ends with tears, and the moral of this tale should never turn your wife into a zombie, she just begs for trouble .... <br /> <br /> The film is quite interesting, and it is fast approaching its end, but never rises above the level of poverty. Not a patch on any real zombie classic, but still fun.
