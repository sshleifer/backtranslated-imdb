I know that it’s impossible to save all the details of a book in a movie. But this film has changed almost everything for no reason. In addition, many changes have made history illogical. A few examples: 1) in the film “Paul Reno,” really meets Porio before his death (in the book, Poirot receives only a letter), telling him that he is afraid of being killed. This is completely stupid, because if Renault’s plan was successful, Poirot would know that the corpse would not have been Reno (Poirot was at the morgue when Mrs Renault recognized the victim). 2) The film "united" two people into one! Cinderella was filmed. The girl Hastings falls in love, and the ex-girlfriend Jack Reno is one man in the film! For God's sake? 3) Hastings finds victims because he is such a bad golfer. Totally funny and stupid. 4) The film tells secrets too early (for example, at the very beginning). So you know things you should not know. 5) The murderer was shot at the end by a person who is not in the book. Perhaps because the person (Cinderella) who stops the killer does not exist in the film. 6) The book is very complicated. The film takes only about 90 minutes. Of course, it is difficult to include all the necessary details, but this is impossible if you include stupid things that were not in the book and that have no meaning (for example, cycling).
