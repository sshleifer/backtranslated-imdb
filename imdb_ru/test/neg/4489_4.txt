After reading this story a while ago, I was very excited to see a movie. I read the book again. This is one of my favorite books by Nicholas Sparks. What I think makes history a relationship. It was a bad moment for me in the film, because I think the relationship was poorly expressed in the film. I have no idea what is the point of changing the roles of the main characters (characters of Tim and Alan). The film does not reflect the relationship of John and Savannah at all. Perhaps, if you have not read the book, you may like this film, but I thought it was so boring compared to the book. I thought Channing was a great choice for John, but I had a feeling that he was going to invite all the young people to see him, so I think he was more focused on them. The ending excludes the whole point of the book, so I was also unhappy with it. I was hoping that the film was more like a notebook or a walk to remember, and how they captured the books. I feel I wasted Friday night and 10 bucks on a juicy love story, not the story I was expecting to see.
