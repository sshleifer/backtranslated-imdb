With this title, you will be forgiven for thinking that this film is about the great artist Goya. Then in half an hour you decide that this is more about the Roman Catholic inquisition. With even greater breadth, perhaps this is just a snapshot of the period. With a grim characteristic, too many axes to grind and a scant attitude to the fact, Milos Foreman accumulates a colorful, but chambolic, incoherent jumble that fails on all three accounts. <br /> <br /> Milos Forman (who lost his Jewish father in Nazi concentration camps), a great director who drew the artist Mozart as a jester and died with him. Won the awards for this, in fact. His life in Czechoslovakia gave him a taste of diverse, repulsive regimes, especially communism. He also made an equally stunning, but rather impressive film, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. So at the age of 74, how can he offer us this mess? In Goya Ghosts, Goya is one step away from the jester. The main character is Brother Lorenzo, passionately played by Javier Bardem. Natalie Portman is as energetic as the model Goya Ines (and later in the film, her own daughter). The unclear connection with Goya is that he draws them both. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo is tortured (and then raped) by Ines, whom he suspects of being Jewish. Her father torments Lorenzo. Napoleon rushes to the liberation of Spain (briefly). Ines comes out of the dungeon in which the Church has left her, and is looking for her child. Goya still draws, but deaf. His main concern seems to be helping Ines. And so on. <br /> <br /> Historically, Goya was also a historian. Since Foreman, unfortunately, rejected the idea of ​​a biopic about the artist Goya, could this fact be used to unify the entire film ?? a big piece of the story seen by Goya. But the artist is too tangential to gain any weight. Similarly, the document on the horrors of the Inquisition must be made ?? in comparison with other despotic orders at all times, the Holy See was forgiven only with confession. Although someone may ask if Foreman is competent enough to be trusted based on actual data. <br /> <br /> “I thought it might be the heart of a wonderful story,” he says in his notes. "There were a lot of parallels between the communist society in which we lived and the Spanish Inquisition." But the story is too unreliable to hold our attention. Contrary to our expectations and against the backdrop of something significant (the life of a great artist, the horrors of the Inquisition, and even the French Revolution), we are instead asked to feel involved in the invented (if it is good) hobby of Goya. As a result, we feel cheated. <br /> <br /> Background details are terribly handled. Goya became deaf in 1792 (when the film begins), and not after 15 years. Napoleon is as believable as a cutout from a bag of cereal. We see the Church passing the death sentence (when the usual procedure was for the Church to insist on the social hand to do this dirty work). Battles look overly choreographic and stage. The interweaving of unwarranted bare sinuses hardly compensates for this. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, production figures are mostly good. The colors are bright, the rhythm is excellent (at least until we give up in search of some decent storyline). Bardem is superb, and Portman is happy, until she goes to high speed like a crazy woman. Although it does not speak about Goya too much, what he says is pleasant, though superficial and rather inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Once I was talking to a drunk late evening where my friends and I asked each other if you could choose a director to depict your life, who would it be? In his notes, unfortunately, Foreman was supposed to be at the bottom of my list.
