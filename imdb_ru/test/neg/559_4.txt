I thought this movie would be a disgrace to the show. In the end, part 3 did not match part 2, and there is no Daniel Soone in this one. Miyagi’s humor wasn’t as witty as in the third installment, but it was funny enough to make the film worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The girl played pretty well. She is a lost teenager who needs direction. I find it hard to believe in the plot. That the aunt would simply agree to leave her house and niece under the supervision of Mr. Miyagi, the man she had just met. Of course, he was a friend of her brother. <br /> <br /> I really liked the monastery. From some of my other reviews, you might think that I don’t like the dancing monks, but I thought it was funny. This showed that they know how to have fun. Now, if it were monks in ancient China dancing to pop music, that would be another matter. <br /> <br /> Probably the smartest part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldn't kill the mistake. Miyagi told her that street gangs that kill each other are stupid, nations trying to destroy each other are stupid, but respecting all life is not stupid. Miyagi has expressed such wisdom in other films. <br /> <br /> I give this film 4 points out of 10. Of course, I liked some things. It was not as funny as in the third part, and not a single character could match Sato in the second part. This film has no value for re-viewing. I can't imagine seeing this again, but it’s worth seeing once.
