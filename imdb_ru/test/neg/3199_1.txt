It is quite possible one of the greatest celluloid waste in the last 100 years. Not only does he suffer from a painfully (and extremely predictably) fragmented scenario, but this is clearly an exact copy of Alien II. Within five minutes, I correctly predicted who would die and who would not (and in what order). The special effects are ridiculous; There is a scene where one crew member is beaten (unconvincingly) by two Creta who look like a pair of teddy bears, and rare humor is inappropriate and terrible. There are other things that are better done using the VCR remote than using it to watch this movie.
