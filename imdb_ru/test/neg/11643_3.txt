The best thing about this movie is that they used a lot of things left after the attack on Pearl Harbor in Thor Thor Thor. My favorite was a P-40 shot that hit a row of parked P-40s, but shot from the top of a hangar or crane. Unfortunately, this only gets worse. <br /> <br /> American prisoners of war, two black and two white, as well as several Filipino prisoners of war and Japanese guards. The rank of American soldier is a white naval lieutenant, who, of course, is an O-3 in the navy. In any case, he needs a haircut, strongly, distracting, strongly. Hockey hair does not belong to the film of the Second World War. Oh and he is racist. He does not want to share apartments with "blacks". Of course, in real life he would not want to share apartments with a white guy. I think that in the Geneva Convention there is a clause on the officer corps and enrollment, but this is not the point. Oh, well, I think the plot is secondary to the other issues in this film. He is put in place and largely spends the rest of the film on the inspection and starts the air pump for divers. <br /> <br /> But as soon as you start, this is a good storyline. Japs wants divers to raise silver thrown away by Americans before the fall of Corrigador. The resistance of the Filipinos wants them to be in no hurry. And prisoners of war do everything they can to help. Potentially good story and not so badly done, I think. It is a little unbelievable when prisoners of war use respites in a camp to swim between a prisoner of war camp and a Philippine village every night. Maybe I'm not so picky when I find out that this is not a blockbuster. I suppose that's why it comes with a collection of war movies on DVD for 20 pieces for five dollars. <br /> <br /> The music of the 70s did not belong to this film or to any other film of the Second World War. It is rather distracting, to say the least. The game was not so bad. Probably better than I could. <br /> <br /> Without being a football fan, I at least found out that Jim Brown is a real person, not the one Richard Pryor invented. That alone was worth the 25 that I paid for this film. <br /> <br /> Worth a look at TCM or pay a quarter for. <br /> <br /> One star for a film about war, another for participating in World War II, and another for making me feel generous.
