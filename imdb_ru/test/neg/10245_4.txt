I have seen the worst movies. This is bad, but at least not trying to be good, so it deserves a short applause. He firmly kept in the areas of low-cost science fiction genre of B-films. <br /> <br /> This is a trash film, but in a good way, and it is definitely worth buying if it is in the shopping cart at your local supermarket. Terribly charming, and not just awful. <br /> <br /> The main thing for me is that Galaksina's lover is sent to save her. Appearing, she exclaims: “Rabbit-pooh!” That attracts laughter from his co-pilot. <br /> <br /> Sit down, get drunk, enjoy!
