I did my best to watch this two-hour fiasco. He combined the terrible special effects and plot of the original “Blob” with an improved gain (outstanding in the original) script “Runaway Train”. The only explanation for this film is that someone had to take a huge tax deduction and thought that he would combine it with an attempt to arrange a couch. What an incredible git! Lou Diamond Phillips wants to show us why he will take part, no matter how bad he is. Barry Corbin continues his career as a creeping typographer, a US senator from Texas and plays well. Then he must play a major role in the story of Trent Lotte or Jesse Helms. All the women in this film seem to have received their roles as consolation prizes in the Fay Wray Memorial screaming competition. The special effects are incredibly bad. H.S. kids in a movie class in north dakota might have done a better job. The authors must have pulled the bank robbery into cliches to accumulate it a lot. I could not look anymore, without being forced to sit in a chair "A Clockwork Orange." I have no idea how this ended, except, obviously, 119 minutes later. Ugh! Let the buyer be vigilant.
