Detective Sergeant Vince De Carlo (James Louise) and the company in the case of a violent serial killer / rapist. Can psychologist Carol (Susan Sullivan) help, or will she be the next victim of the killer? And what kind of funny White Afro Dude killer? <br /> <br /> Inspired by serial killer Ted Bundy, Killer's Delight, also known as The Dark Ride, is a rather boring story about a 1978 serial killer that does little. In any case, this is more a police procedural film than a horror film, since most of the violence takes place off-screen. Of course, we get mutilated bodies, but we don’t get much in the exploitation department, especially if we consider that they were received after, and not during the crime. Those who hope for such “Killing with tools” or “Maniac” will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there is an impressive scene with a woman trying to escape from the killer, who understands how to tune, it is quite difficult to download. In addition, John Karlen is very effective as a killer, although his cheerful hairstyle (white guys with Afros always deserve laughter) is more than distracting. <br /> <br /> “Dark Journey” is too ordinary and mediocre to really guarantee a recommendation, because it lacks the proper elements of exploitation, and it is outdated even by the standards of time. Those who are looking for a better example should probably turn to “Do not enter the house” and several others instead, as this simply will not work.
