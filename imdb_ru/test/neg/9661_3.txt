Wow, this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> This film was an embarrassment for the original film. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie was horrible. <br /> <br /> The scene was terrifying. Each part, except for the part of the “Mexican” manager of the sandy areas, was terrible. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry, although only a few parts were just awful. It was the worst part. Even the kid's actor playing him in his childhood was the one you wanted to hit, even in the end he was laughing. <br /> <br /> This film reminded me of those children's films that make an extra mile, making the role of a fool far beyond the ridiculous stage. Humor was for 6 year olds. <br /> <br /> If you are over 12 years old and want to watch something, skip this movie and watch a comedy series instead.
