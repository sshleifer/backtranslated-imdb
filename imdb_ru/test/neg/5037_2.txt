From the epicenter of the cultural world, four teenagers from the working class tried to change the world with the help of music and fashion. This was the last attempt to do this in the past century, and they failed. Before the dust cleared, the group manager and SEX store owner Malcolm McLaren spent the money that the Sex Pistols earned to “defile” their role in their success. The film was called “Great Rock and Roll Fraud” (take a hint) and consists of a very small number of The Sex Pistols videos, actually performing music, and a fairly large amount of footage of how McLaren actually calls viewers idiots. <br /> <br /> Nonsense-surreal nonsense, in which guitarist Steve Jones is a detective on McLaren's tail, is soon dissolved, so he and drummer Paul Cook can escape to Rio and spend time with “great train robber” Ronnie Biggs. Get ready for the spectacle of three very unattractive men dancing naked under the disgusting, without irony version of “Belsen was a Gas” (a song about the murder of Jews for gold in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp) and another song performed in deaf tone of Ronnie. whines, which includes the lyrics “God Save God Myra Hindley God Save God Ian Brady” (lyrics that Johnny Rotten would have considered unpleasant). The scenes of Sid Vicious are few and idiotic. Jumping out of bed in a thong with a swastika over the testicles to sing a biker song of a bad boy of the 50s. Playing on the theme of the movie "Punk - joke," in an attempt to turn Sid into James Dean. I’m surprised that McLaren also doesn’t take responsibility for Siddy’s death. The scenes of redemption are the scenes of Cid in Paris and the infamous production of My Way. Zeitgeist punk rock right here. To mock the adoring public, before shooting them all. No need for a full movie, just watch this video on YouTube. <br /> <br /> From the much superior (and more enjoyable) 2001 documentary Filth and Fury, we were given a more balanced / honest film. The kind of fact that it turned out in 78 year. But there were also a few scenes that I would like to see in “Fraud” (since Fury was basically a reprint of the same material). One of them was an animated Sid with Sid's voice acting; “Damn it, be careful, okay, or I'll cut you” - a still image that appeared on the cover of a 7-inch Something Else - a fragment was shown in Fury, but I don’t know in what context it appeared. Was it in the original prints, but deleted after Sid's death? Was there more? Fury also shed light on the film “Who Killed Bambi,” which would be the mocking film “Hard Day's Night,” which McLaren originally intended to shoot. He played Sting (!) As part of the gay group "New Romance" and looked so damn spectacular than a scam. <br /> <br /> Sod Swindle is a scam. If needed, rent The Filth and The Fury and enjoy the failure of music as a controversy changing the world.
