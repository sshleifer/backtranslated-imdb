I love low budget movies. Including those that are deliberate or unintentionally ridiculous, excessive false blood, violence, etc. This, however, is beyond stupidity. As soon as you see the final, you will say that, damn it, it was the meaning of all the murder scenes, when there was no one around (except a couple) to witness them. And how the ending really happened (I wonâ€™t have a whole story for those who are stupid enough to actually watch it) Grandma as a psychic Jason. At first she is outside the window with the body, and after 15 seconds she is knitting in the living room. It's all about setting up for a newbie. They shoot graphic scenes of murder, knitting needles in the eyes that only Chris Angel Mind Freak could shoot. And again, the very end was pre-poster. 56 minutes is a waste of time. I saw one of the directors of other films, and it was almost as bad. Give me 20 pieces and I can do better. It really deserves a big fat 0.
