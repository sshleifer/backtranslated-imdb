What a waste of talent - although it seems that in real life Krudup looks more like a pusty, self-absorbed person without a character, whom he portrays in this disappointing film. <br /> <br /> In art, sometimes empty spaces show more than drawn or created content. This film reveals unconsciousness and contradictory / contradictory, unresolved impulses / consciousness of the film’s director / scriptwriter. This inadvertently shows a LACK of recognition that a truly developed, deeply conscious character must suffer and suffer in order to earn sympathy or audience sympathy OR whose absence is used as a warning story for the audience. But this film failed on any level in this regard. <br /> <br /> The fact that Cal, the protagonist (largely antagonist, not the protagonist in the true sense of the word), has no sympathy for anyone, especially those who deserve it (not including it) , and that he has such a bloated, pitiful feeling of self-pity, a whine only to himself, combined with a lack of remorse and a lack of guilt or awareness of his influence. about others - everyone converges in this film to make it the embodiment of the self-styled, arrested in the process of development, the narcissistic sociopath - somehow this is now the gold standard for men in the movies and in the world at this moment and time. <br /> <br /> One of his counterpoints (James LeGros) states with a true laser flash: “I can bet that you didn’t do anything good in life - and I bet you don’t.” It reflects the absolute essence of Cal. Something that the other characters he shoots in the film seem to realize pretty quickly, despite the fact that the director has put together a deck to manipulate sympathy for Cal. This is a testament to the talent and skills of the support staff. <br /> <br /> Cal's possible “return” has nothing to do with character development, transformation, or consciousness development. This is only due to the final capitulation, that until something better happens, he can just as well return to his comfortable and cozy status quo with the right to benefits, where life is easy and no one will demand so that he grows up - something from which he is deliberately not capable and not interested in it. <br /> <br /> The film could have been pointed and deliberately told about traps and tragedies — the devastating effects of such a lack of conscience / consciousness, but it justifies and glorifies it instead — in fact, it falls into self-pity along with arrogant, selfish, emotionally undersized protagonist. <br /> <br /> (and this undoubtedly caused chills in my spine when he reflects on recent revelations about convicted murderer Scott Peterson). <br /> <br /> If you want to see Krudup in his very nuance and full of exciting potential, which, in my opinion, has never been truly realized, look at the undervalued “Invention of Abbots”. ...
