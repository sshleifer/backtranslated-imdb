Scheduled as light entertainment, this film is really successful as such during its first half, but then succumbs to the quickly falling out scenario that lowers it. Harry (Judd Nelson), the “reformed” robber, and Daphne (Gina Gershon), the beginning actress, are used as living dummies at a shop window in a department store where they are late and locked inside one night, after which they become witnesses from their observation point For less than a protective glass, an obvious kill happens on the street. The alleged killer, Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local sculptor, returns the next day to watch the mannequins, as he realizes that they are the only possible witnesses to the violent event of the previous night, and when one of the posing couple "flinches" the fun begins . Daphne and Harry report their observations at the local police station, but when a detective reporting a crime recalls Harry’s criminal past, he becomes cynical. There are so many ways a film can get beaten up, and it manages to use most of them, including the obligatory scene in slow motion in the bedroom. The low budget case shot in Vancouver, even police procedural aspects are displayed by heart. The always capable Gershon is trying to do something out of his role, but Mancuso is incredibly historic, whimsically so, as he attacks his lines with an obvious free reason. Although the film fails in nonsense, cinematographer Glen MacPherson prefers not to follow his example, as he adjusts to the camera and highlights some beautifully realized compositions that the viewer can focus on, ignoring the holes in the plot and meaningless dialogue. Hal Beckett provided a well thought out score, based on action accordingly. The dialogue mentioned was initially somewhat fresh and was teasingly joked by Nelson and Gershon, but in the subsequent context of incorrect continuity and logic, predictability takes over. The direction reflects the lack of original ideas or points of view, and the shortcomings of post-production shift the work further than one would expect from the main thriller.
