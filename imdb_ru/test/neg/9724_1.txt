Anyone who rates this movie above 3 has a very distorted view of the movie, anyone who rated this piece of sh! T 7 or higher, I absolutely do not respect their taste in films, and I doubt that they have ever seen a good one. I am always ready to give any film a chance, and I did with this film, I tried to pay attention, I tried not to let my money be wasted, but for 15 minutes my friends laughed at me because I listened to 2 of my iPod 25 minutes later I even I could not watch the replay that took place in the film, so I got up and left, I never left the movie until this rubbish, The one who said they liked it, is a liar, or they should be banned from this site. I am so angry when I see that a person evaluates this 8, when the total rating of the Godfathers is 9.1, it's like saying that this film was close, and this is not so.
