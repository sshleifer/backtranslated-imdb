Well acted, yes. Very well, I must say, although I do not speak Chezke. Good cinematography. But the script is lame, really lame. Predictable soap opera, in which you know exactly what should happen. Well, maybe the end is not so predictable, but is it good? This is one of those films that you feel have already seen, and forget about the day after tomorrow. <br /> <br /> I just received a message from IMDb saying that my comment was not long enough. It's really sad, because I have no idea what else to say about this film, which actually says a lot about it, isn't it? The fact is ... He has no soul and no originality. Compare this film with Barrio, or Riff Raff, shot more than ten years ago (or unusually recently filmed “The Child”). It's sad to see that this is a much worse movie.
