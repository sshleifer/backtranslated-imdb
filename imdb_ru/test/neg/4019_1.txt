Fox's 20th Century ROAD HOUSE (1948) is not only a silly noir, but also an incredible boring movie. Full of inconclusive cardboard characters, he was softly written by Eduard Khodorov, who also produced, and surprisingly the director Jean Negulesko, from whom much more could be expected. Miscast - starring Ida Lupino! Lupino, a lady who can exude as much sex appeal as a bloody orange, is under the illusion that she is Rita Hayworth, who plays the role of a sexy torch singer in a bar. Beauty Corneille Wilde, like her lover, is as wooden as usual, and completely in vain - this is the talented Celeste Hill, whose role is slightly more than a part. Then we have Richard Widmark, who has the funniest role in the film! When we first see him, he is a good OK the guy who runs the prosperous road house. Then suddenly - and for reasons that are not well understood - he becomes insanely jealous of his manager (Wilde) when he tells him that he is going to marry Lupino. You see, Widmark wanted to marry her himself, but - 1) he never offered her - 2) they never had a relationship (they don't even have anything like a love scene together) and - 3) did not talk to anyone ( including Lupino)) he received a license to marry. Blimey! So, how the Widmark had to achieve something like marital happiness with Lupino after such “courtship” is someone's task. BUT? Well, when Widmark falls apart in the whole case, as well as the film, I'm sorry to say. From this point on, the Widmark character becomes unintentionally comical! His loss of marble so early in the process is completely unbelievable and inconclusive. In the end, he goes over the edge, becomes completely insane, and with a few Tommy Udo giggles, he ridiculously shoots poor Corneille Wilde before biting the dust himself. <br /> <br /> And if this is not enough film for you - the picture is also clouded by the constant use of studio scenery and interiors. There is not a single shot in the whole movie! To this should be added - 95% of the film takes place at night. <br /> <br /> In addition to an interactive book for the press and photo galleries, the add-ons also feature the Widmark & ​​Lupino At Fox feature. Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me! As far as I know, they have never been together in a film on Fox or anywhere else! Nevertheless, this collection is organized by such strong know-alls as Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudi Belmer and some others who amazingly praise this tiresome and challenging shocking business. All I can say is probably me. But “Road House” was still forgotten and buried by Noir, and as far as I know, it should have remained that way. <br /> <br /> Fox would be more successful if they released a DVD with an excellent and yet elusive Widmark film like Down to Sea on Ships (1949) and the colorful Montana Red Skies (1952).
