The film by Michael Bassett “Solomon Kane” (based on the eponymous character created by Robert E. Howard) is a disappointing film “Fantasy Action Adventure”, which, despite several brilliant scenes, collapses because of an awkward pace, poor performance and overall dullness. Solomon Kane (James Purefoy) - a mercenary of the army of Queen Elizabeth fighting in Africa, where he comes face to face with the Devil's Reaper ?? a demon who collects the debts of the devil, that is, the soul ?? while he refuses to go to hell, he evades the Reaper and begins a new life in an English monastery. With this new life, Solomon left behind his culture of violence and bloodshed and instead now accepts the values ​​of peace and non-values. But as soon as he was expelled from the monastery because of the fear of the return of the Devil's Reaper, he must return to his home in Devon and make friends with the traveling family of Puritans on their way to the New World. During their journey through the British counties, the family is attacked, and their daughter Meredith (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is abducted by the army of the evil sorcerer Malachi, who is led by a mysterious rider in a mask. Now a man of peace, Solomon must return to his former life as a man of unrepentant violence and destruction in order to save Meredith. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that he has excellent source material for the work and that he can create a potentially exciting and long-lasting medieval action movie adventure, the film falls through in three key areas. The pitch of this film is terrible, which may be due to its incredibly short display time of just one hour and forty minutes (and this is most likely due to the fact that they want to turn this film into a trilogy), the constant transition from drama and self-knowledge to action and dirty bloodshed kills some excitement sequences of actions. Instead of keeping the audience on the edge of their seats, foaming with the anticipation of an eagle-eyed, the film instead feels incredibly depressed and, it follows the next part of the criticism, dull. Despite the fact that Solomon Kane is advertised as a "thriller" or in some circles a "thriller" is almost certainly not. The action is mundane and boring, and usually ends before you can enjoy the beauty of beheading. Finally, apart from Solomon himself, there are very few characteristics in this film. For example, we know little, and therefore we care little about the young woman that Soloman goes on a journey to save. And I suppose that the filmmaker would again attribute this criticism to the fact that, most likely, there will be a second film, which we hope will touch on those aspects that this film probably missed. <br /> <br /> This is not, however, a terrible movie. James Purefoy plays fantastically, like Solomon, a mercenary who has to decide whether to retreat to his conscience or his blade, and how his decisions will affect not only himself, but also those around him. Although respect, admiration and recognition should also go to Bassett and his team, to create bright places that perfectly reflect the period in which they are shot. At times it is difficult not to get carried away with the admiration for the beauty of the locations, the composition of the pictures and the stage setting at the exhibition. That, of course, indicates that a lot of time and effort was invested in this film, but unfortunately this does not mean the same thing for the story and the characters. “Solomon Kane”, of course, could become something more than just an “epic fighter”, however, it seems that once again the absence of any depth in the history and characters led to the fact that Michael Bassett created nothing but three-dimensional view of the game of swords in the Middle Ages.
