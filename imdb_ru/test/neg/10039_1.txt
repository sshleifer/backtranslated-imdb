I don't understand why people praise this film. I did not like it at all. I watch it with a few people. None of them cared about it. First of all. It's just clear that another low-budget studio is trying to capitalize on fame. Shooting looks like a television interview. Makeup bad. When you watch a movie along with additional DVDs. You will find that there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who participated in it. There is no talent. There are facts that appear in the book. The facts are distorted by the invention of comedy and the parodies added to it. I read a few books and watched a few shows on this story. From all this material I have always learned that this is a serious horror story. I really would like someone to make a good movie for this one. It has always fascinated me. Bad game really ruined the story. The situation with the little boys made the situation even more complicated. When you watch this movie. The little boy and his problem is what you and your friends will remember and laugh about. There was no point why his brothers laughed at what had happened to him. As if the witch should have been so threatening, but she could have thrown her younger brother. This is a huge story with him and his little problem. I still can not cope with a little girl who says: “Mom said that tobacco will destroy your teeth” Frank Fox's statement and facial expression are so bad. The scene in the courtyard, where he gets food, is pretty stupid. The sound of his parts, it seems, from the movie "Psycho." In addition, the girl hovering over the bed, and her little "problem with the control of the bladder" from the "exorcist." This film lacks creative talent. We set the film for a couple of minutes and immediately realized that it was a bummer. I also noticed their flaws in film quality. In part, it looked like a person could take a home video camera. I noticed that many people in loans had a lot of jobs. This is probably how this movie was made. Someone said I like this story. I will gather all my friends and make a film with a video camera and computer. It does not matter if we do not know how to act. While we are shooting this and saying it is good. We gathered a family and cooked food. Then he sat down and watched this unsuccessful attempt to make a film.
