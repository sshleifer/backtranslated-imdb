I finally rented this video after long months of searching. Initially, I wanted to see it only because I am a fan of Neil Pearson (Patrick, Izobel boy, presenter). Nevertheless, the film does very well without Neil (although he does it very well in this film, it is overshadowed by three main female characters). This is an eerie, intense film, similar to what the British are doing so well - definitely, “chick-flick” at home, and this is an isolated setting, giving the film almost the “aura of Wuthering Heights. The film is full of tension and finale, shocking, but still somehow inevitable. I'm glad I looked, it was worth the wait.
