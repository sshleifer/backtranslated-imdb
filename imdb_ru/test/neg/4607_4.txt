A great cast, doing everything possible with a terrible script, inept leadership and some of the worst results I've ever heard. More television film of the week than serious drama. What is sad when you consider that the source material is very serious and very real. The filmmakers decided that instead of creating drama and character, it is better to simply show the most graphic and cruel pieces and hope that the public will be shocked by sympathy and care. In my opinion, one of the most egregious forms of cutting and sticking film.
