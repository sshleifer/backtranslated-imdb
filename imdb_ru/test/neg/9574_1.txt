An old bat turns into a young, good-looking girl after drinking a potion. This movie was terrible. Acting brutal. The filming work made me dizzy. And it shows the longest, most painfully boring striptease ever placed in a movie. Piero Vivarelli should be ashamed of guiding this. Eduardo Manzanos Brochero should have been blacklisted just because he wrote something awful. Do not shoot this film, the only exception I can do is perhaps if you die and you have less than 90 minutes left, watch this movie look like an eternity, and you will ask the Clutch Reaper to come a little earlier. <br /> <br /> My rating: F
