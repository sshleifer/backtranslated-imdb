Half of the film - flashing lights and a wobbly camera. Everything else consists of predictable characters (for example, science versus government, know-how and authority, etc.). <br /> <br /> What is the worst aspect of this movie? Are these cars scattered in the first 5 minutes, is it a terrible "Russian" accent of the "cosmonaut", are these boring characters, poorly integrated top 40 hits or the couplet "The USA will save the world"? Not. It is the fact that regardless of the “sad” ending - there is very little expectation in this film - we basically know what will happen. <br /> <br /> One good part of this film: “American components, Russian components: everything is done in Taiwan! "
