Tycus is one of the worst films shot directly in videos I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I am not surprised that this product does not appear in the cinema. I donâ€™t understand why the great Dennis Hopper is featured in this movie) and the Bad Screen without meaning. My alternative: Armageddon or Twister. SENTENCE FOR TYCUS: Do not watch this movie.
