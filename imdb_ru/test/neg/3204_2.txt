(LITTLE SPOILERS) I just bought a DVD of this film yesterday. I saw it with my friends, and I could not believe what had happened. <br /> <br /> In the first three films, the creature, at least, had a sense of humor (especially in the third film), but not only the creature barely appeared, they were not funny! They never made me laugh. I must admit that the story began well. An hour later, I remembered that Nibble films were always very short. So I thought to myself: “Where is $ ^% # $ - these creatures?!?!” They were barely in this movie! If it didn't make me angry enough, a boy named Ethan was sitting on his bed after Charlie "killed the ship," and he knew that the creatures were still on board! In the first film, the Brown family was scared to death. But here Ethan did not care! It was as if the creatures were not even a threat! <br /> <br /> Now what I'm going to say next can spoil the final, but I will say it anyway. In the first film, at the end, they had to face a giant creature for the final battle. In the second there was a big ball of the creature. In the third film, the creatures with his burned pet were made spindash (from Sonic the Hedgehog) and were about to attack a small child. But at the end of the fourth (which made me the most evil), a bald creature rushes at Ethan, and Ethan kills him as if it were nothing. <br /> <br /> Now what I really don't understand is what happened to Ug. He was one of my favorite characters in the first two. Then after 50 years he is angry. It was very disappointing. Not only that, but wasn't he a faceless bounty hunter? Why is he still "Johnny Steele"? Plus he seemed to have a different personality. He seemed much smarter and not as monotonous as in the first two. <br /> <br /> Being a man who really enjoyed the movies of the first two creatures and loved the third one, I give Critters 4 2/10
