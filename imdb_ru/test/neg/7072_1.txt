Ok, fans, it's on DVD. But the only reason to watch it is: 1) say you did it (because of its notoriety), or 2) if you're a hardcore fan of Bill Paxton. I am not a hardcore BP fan, but it was interesting to watch, and that was the only thing that kept me from disconnecting from pure boredom. This is a shame, because it could be a good film with some kind of screenplay work and if it were shot by someone with some intelligence (and with actors led by someone other than the completely mistaken and talentless Judd Nelson) Of course, this is gross, but this is bad, and not in a good way. If after reading all the comments about how weirdly disgusting and horribly dirty this film is that you are still interested, do yourself a favor and look instead GOOD weird strange weird disgusting filth. I remember the films of John Waters, David Lynch, “The Brain Dead” by Peter Jackson, “The Basket” by Henenlotter, etc. There is much better.
