Mario Van Peebles is trying to follow the route of Jean-Claude Van Damme and play a renegade robot soldier who sets off AWOL to save himself, but the government is not going to accept this lie, so among the simplified plot Van Peebles defends the villagers Rebel defeats and defeats an improved version of myself in this disappointing film. This frank robber of the Universal Soldier (who is much more fun than this) is simply not going anywhere. The main problem is that the film is incredibly inert. Van Peebles just waits and not enough ass to justify watching. On the other hand, the film is really something like a competent version of R.O.T.O.R, although, despite the fact that this terrible bad film was ridiculous, it only sometimes gives laughter in its ridiculously unconvincing sequences of actions. As well as R.O.T.O.R, there is no point in his narration, and basically the film is terribly boring. Plus, the villains are disappointingly weak, and basically the film needs a real action scenario, because the material is too boring. In all respects, Solo is a very weak film. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4- (bad)
