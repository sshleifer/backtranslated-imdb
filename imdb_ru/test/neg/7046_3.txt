It is unfortunate that there were so many contradictions around this picture (in other words, the infamous novel by Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini), as it attracted a lot of attention to a very forgotten film. The story is incredibly slow, cheap and uninteresting. And finally, the film is filled to the brim with amateur actors who barely speak English. I would really prefer subtitles - this would make the experience less tedious. Let's go back to the rotten game. At the time this film was shot, there was a big neorealist movement in Italy. Many of these films are absolute masterpieces (for example, “Umberto D.” from “De Sica”, “Children Watch Us” and “The Miracle in Milan”), because they have received so much from non-professional actors. They behaved like normal people, but in Stromboli they behave like normal people, ATTEMPTING to be actors and very poorly come out - like children in a school play. <br /> <br /> By the way ... if you hope the film has a good ending (this way you take the time to make the film worth the time), do not worry. The plot was just completely unattractive and stupid - so much so that I actually found that I could care less about the characters. Like the island on which they all live, the film is deserted and devoid of color or life.
