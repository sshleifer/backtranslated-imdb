Originally filmed as a sequel to the “Slumber Party” series, this film looks brand new with a new title. First of all, if you are going to include the word “slaughter” in the title of your movie, you had better put it. This one, of course, no. There is no blood, no killing on the screen, no chainsaw, as the decoration will make you believe. Instead, we get a thin, overly ordinary storyline about a group of fans who find themselves in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football match, but they are overtaken by turns. Again, this film could be fine if the blood coefficient were slightly elevated. Why are directors, especially those who make live video clips, afraid to show ANY bloody effect, I can not do. Now, I'm not a big fan of excessive bleeding, but come on ... why would anyone shoot a movie called "Cheerleaders Massacre ??" In addition to this problem, the film suffers from the cheapness of shooting on a home video camera. It looks cheap, it sounds cheap, and the actors are not so good. He is trying to lead us astray from who the killer may be, but even that fails. The ending ends in a ridiculous mess. People, if you stumble upon this film, go away and find the original “Night Slaughter Party”. 2 out of 10.
