There is nothing bad in erotic, but this rather clinical is a lot of nudity, but everything is fake (of course, it is always fake - this is a film, but you know what I mean). There is no sexuality or eroticism here, these are all random nude bodies and a bad game of "lust" and sex with each other. <br /> <br /> This is partly, of course, your personal preference. These women obviously have body problems: body piercing, tattoos and silicone - not to mention the fact that they look too plastic and leathery, so if this is your thing - fine, you can see it all here. I don’t think that someone’s expectations are very high if you look at a movie title such as this one, but for many it would look like a look at cyborg fembots ... they almost seem real, but in reality they are more horrendous.
