Sometimes the unforgettable dialogue of screenwriter Frederick Fox and the study of old professionals can’t save this warm western about white whites in the desert by a group of bloodthirsty Cheyenne Indians. In addition to his sometimes catchy dialogue, you will not find surprises in Fox’s script about this fight between whites and Indians. The characters "Dakota Incident" cause only minor interest, of course, not enough to highlight them, as some of Fox’s dialogue choices. Unfortunately, good dialogue is Fox's only contribution, because this ordinary little wormwood fades with a lackluster ending, which contradicts his previous 80 minutes. The final is also invented as it comes, and it lacks trust. Most of the characters are sympathetic, but some simply lack common sense. <br /> <br /> Dale Robertson, respectively, is cruel and clumsy, like the criminal John Banner, one of three bank robbers who has to shoot him down with his own, without regard to partners. Veteran western character actor John Doucette (Rick Largo) poses the best of villains, while Skip Homeyer, lost in the minor role of Banner's brother Frank Banner, later dies from the Indian arrow. Doucette tries to shoot Banner from the very beginning of the action, but our left-handed hero fakes his death, later tracks down Largo and slaps him on the skin in a city called Christian Flats. Naturally, Largo this time bites the dust, but Banner makes an interesting discovery. One of the passengers on the stage, from Christian Flats to Laramie, turns out to be none other than the cashier of the bank from which he stole money. John Carter (John Lund) is not only trying to find a Banner, but also wants to find out his good name in the bank, which released the wanted posters for his arrest. Obviously, the authorities were wrong and increased the role of Carter in the robbery. Carter is ready to take Banner to Laramie and pass it on to the law, but Banner has other ideas about Laramie. Banner's ideas change when he intersects with Amy Clark (former beauty of the “Twentieth Century Fox” Linda Darnell), who wears a bright red dress and still holds a pretty chest in herself. Like everyone else who mentioned here in their reviews, Republic Studio's TrueColor demonstrates RED in everything: from the attractive Darnell outfit to the blood spilled on the ground. The problem that director Lewis Foster coped with this mediocre stemming is that everything stalled after the stagecoach lost the wheel, and our heroes were in a dry wash to protect themselves from Cheyennes. Good guys and Cheyennes run out of ammo over time, but in the Dakota Incident, clichés never end. Ward Bond has some interesting points as a politically correct politician who defends the path of red skin. By the time this 88-minute dust collector is completed, you will feel trapped and threatened by the looting of Cheyenne.
