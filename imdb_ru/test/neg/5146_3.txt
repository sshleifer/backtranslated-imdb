During production, this LWT series was called “Rocket To The Moon,” a name everyone on the set at that time considered stupid enough. Then came the news that it was renamed "Reach the Moon", as if this addition of this new word would have caused heavy metaphorical meanings, including the characters' attitudes and aspirations. This same gross lack of subtlety and understanding is clear throughout the entire series, and the same weary and boring storyline of the love triangle actually stretches over 7 episodes! Any television program that decides to use the plot of the “love triangle” even for one episode pushes it, but it is unforgivable to spread it on seven episodes. However, there are reasons to observe: the landscape of the Isle of Wight undoubtedly provides a beautiful setting, and a seemingly easy performance by Linda Bellingham, striking all the right comedic qualities. This, however, is not enough. A number of performances are noticeable, especially if you look at the static and insensible wasteland that Jonathan Kerrigan calls his face. I already mentioned Linda Bellingham in the role of “fussy mother” (yes, this concerns character development and history), but I was impressed by actor Maurice Roves (who is by far the most experienced actor in the cast who has appeared in everything from classic films such as “Oh, what a beautiful war” by Richard Attenborough and “The Eagle Has Landed,” and on television, including “Baywatch”, “Holby City”, “Bill”, “Eastders”, “Greetings”, “Doctor Who is 80 , Star Trek and even a trip to Hollywood with Sylvester Stallone in 1995 by Judge Dredd, The performance of which very much reminded me of the real teachers with whom I met are often incapable people whose lives are painted in a very sad lane.It is nice to see that Rove still gets a job, also starring in the 1998 British film Acid House and even recently along with the wonderful Maria Bello and Sean Bean in “The Dark.” The outstanding reason to watch this show, although its appearance is very small. Another actor who is struggling to improve the program is Ben Miles as the insane brother of “typical men "(again, what an original character!). As in the case of Roves, the summary says it all. After this, Miles starred in the Hollywood film “V for Vendetta” and in the 2001 film “The Case of the Necklace”, along with Brian Cox, Adrian Brody, Christopher Walken and Jonathan Price. Unfortunately, the rather capable actors that I mentioned have come to terms with relatively small roles compared to the dramatic snags that Kerrigan and Saira Todd are, both of which seem to have been in “Victims” for too long and have not yet learned to act. Even the tolerant Francis Gray suffers in the presence of such theatrical-fetal mannequins, and unfortunately for her, I still have memories of her from the set, that AD asks once again to make a relatively complex picture, because during the take, she subconsciously "pulled the panties out of her slit!". Familiar faces appear in each episode - child actors from CBBC programs, and such dramas as “2 Point 4 Children”, and other regular customers from commercials, such as Mr. Ben (“they will remember me for it”), Linda - Lady Oxo "Bellingham and others I don't even want to remember." Each episode hesitantly tries to "cope with such problems" as teenage pregnancy, disruptive students and rocket science (!) ... things that Grange Hill did better when my parents were young! Overall, this series was a disappointment and a lost opportunity to create a really interesting and well-designed drama series. Unfortunately, they chose the easy way for them, both in writing and (mostly) in the casting. I would recommend both Waterloo Road and Street to lovers of good drama, in particular the latter, who managed to achieve this. If you like the Isle of Wight, do not “reach out to the moon,” instead take the advertising brochure - it probably contains more character development!
