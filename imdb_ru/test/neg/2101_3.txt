When renting it, I did not expect to blow me away. In fact, I knew it would be terrible. He just saw how awful it was. This is what comes with a low budget horror. <br /> <br /> “Snakes on the train,” not to be confused with the serpentine summer blockbuster “Snakes on an airplane” with Samuel L. Jackson, about a woman who put under the Maya curse that makes the snake hatch inside her and devour her from the inside . Her only hope of survival lies in the shaman who lives across the border, so she and her companion went on a train bound for Los Angeles. Add a few passengers and the fun will come. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, the story is not half bad. And this is not half good. <br /> <br /> In this film, the action competes with the fantastic, if not worse. Believe me, it's terrible. Snakes were another problem. I think they should have been rattling, but most of what you get instead is mostly harmless garden snakes that do not attack anything, and there is this rattling sound effect that is really annoying. <br /> <br /> The effects of blood on the other hand, although not at the level of Tom Savini, were in fact quite good. <br /> <br /> And yet, only the final compensates for the rest of the film. I will not talk about it here, so you have to rent it and see for yourself.
