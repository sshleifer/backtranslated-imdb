How do you make a completely unattractive film from the history of one of America’s most famous authors? Watch this movie and find out. Perhaps I overestimate the author Carson McCuller, but “The Heart is a Lonely Hunter” impressed me, and I also hoped for something memorable. Forget it. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave looks like a man with a short haircut and clothes. Anyway, I never found her delighted in almost any movie. Rod Steiger as a preacher? How insulting is that? Unpleasant characters, one after another. Well, maybe this is also a book, and I'm unfair to this film. I am not familiar with a story different from what I saw on the screen, and it was such an unattractive film that I never recommended it to anyone. <br /> <br /> In a backward city, it’s just one backward person after another. In addition to good cinematography, there is nothing to recommend here and there. It's amazing how you could sit 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> I did not even think how bad it was. There is good news: it was the only film directed by Simon Cowell.
