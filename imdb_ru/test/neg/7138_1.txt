What a horrible movie. This film was so out of order, and it was difficult to follow. He was so hard to follow, and he was just confusing. All the while I watched it, I wanted it to end !! I felt like I wasted 2 hours of my life, that I would never return. Save your money and don't rent this movie. Now I understand why Sarah Michelle Gellar was hardly in the film. The first movie was great, but it just sucked. I never recommend this movie to anyone. Save your money and watch the trailer, because this is the only thing worth seeing in this movie. This film also did not have a true story. I still wonder what I was watching.
