The quintet marks the sole initiative of Paul Neumann and director Robert Altman in the field of science fiction. It was said about Newman that he could not play a comedy, but he tried, until he finally achieved real success in this genre with Slap Shot. But the failure of this film confused him, and he never tried it again. <br /> <br /> This is one of the biggest depressive films I've ever seen. This is a futuristic ice age caused by one who knows what, but probably this is a nuclear winter. Even during the Ice Age thousands of years ago, the equatorial parts of the Earth still supported the life of animals and people, but obviously not here. The seals survived, and Paul Newman the sealer outside. <br /> <br /> Hunters really need a little work, and Newman goes to a futuristic city, where everything is so boring that the locals play some kind of game for six people and this is a kind of Russian roulette. To win, you need to kill five more participants in your game. <br /> <br /> This is a sad turn to see where the person came to. Which is one of the reasons why I simply could not get into this story. The atmosphere is gloomy, the story is gloomy, the people are gloomy, everything is so gloomy. Not surprisingly, this thing did not work at the box office. <br /> <br /> This is a film that, in the opinion of almost everyone, will never make it to the top ten Paul Neumann films, including me. <br /> <br /> This is a male future, what a bummer.
