does not mean that this film is good. I was really disappointed with this on many levels. This is a kind of Bukowski hat tip. Hey, I read this guy in college - see what Matt Dillon does to him. and I like Matt Dillon. I thought he looked like Hank, but mostly just ruddy cheeks. I have to take care of the character, and there is simply nothing to take care of. I think that time can be cruel to Bukowski, and this worries me a lot because the letter was solid in its time after the counterculture. hard to sit, scenes that have not gone away, and the soundtrack, because of which I wanted to vomit. I ask for very little, got less.
