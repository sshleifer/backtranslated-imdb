The Heart of Darkness film, based on the book of Joseph Conrad of 1899, is a film with almost no details, and it has an almost schizophrenic storyline. If you read the book, you know that in the film there was practically no one important scene of “creating a story”. There is so much in the book that is left to the discretion of the imagination, and I feel that this is one of those parts that make the book what it is. An example is the fact that Marlowe spent endless hours and days, even months waiting for rivets, and the whole scene was excluded from the film. Again, if you read the book, you would know that this scene in the book almost completely describes the main theme of uselessness. Finally, I feel that the film was too harsh and dry. Although it was not enough to insert into the original text and how it made history the way it is today. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t read The Heart of Darkness book (preferably Norton Critical Edition), then don’t waste your time renting or buying a movie. However, if you read the book, then I think you will appreciate it much more if you decide to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> Eric 2007
