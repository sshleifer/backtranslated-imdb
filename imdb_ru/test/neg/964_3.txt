“The Snow Queen” is based on the famous and very beautiful fairy tale of Hans Christian Andersen about the girl Gerde, who sets off on a dangerous journey to save his friend Kai from the cliffs of the Snow Queen. This adaptation tries to grasp the meaning of this story in adventures and vivid intricate images with the help of generous scenery and production design, but does not produce results for several reasons. <br /> <br /> As in many productions of Hallmark, the potential of the story is completely undercut by harsh scripts and guidance. Two actors playing Gerd and Kai are softly pleasing, but forgotten; Bridget Fonda as the Snow Queen looks like a role, but otherwise she cannot be mistaken for a role. This winding three-hour mini-series clearly lacks dramatic tension. At least some of the tempo problems can be associated with the addition of filler scenes, which add very little to the original story, especially at the opening hour, where the main characters are represented. <br /> <br /> However, “The Queen's Snow” would be an ideal option for teens with a love of fantasy and a little patience. This is amazing, but not scary, and the acting is presented at the level of pantomime, which sets out the storyline is very, very bold text. Just make sure you read the story of Andersen to them too.
