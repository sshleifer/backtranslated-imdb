I agree with some of you that this film was rather boring and boring. I did not like the main character and the following actors / actresses who appeared on the stages. The work of the camera was not the most pleasant. Random shots and shaky movie scenes really annoyed me, and I turned off the movie. I will spend my time watching the adaptation of 1999, and I hope that it is suitable for a pleasant viewing along with Sense and Sensibility; Emma; Become Jane; and pride and prejudice. I have only a few others to watch besides these films, but I believe that they were made with taste. The music was a bit out of place with the film, reminding me of another show I saw this year. He was called Hex and the show from the BBC. I came across this one night on the net. I rather liked the first season, but the second season was dry and pulled things out of thin air that should have stayed with the clouds. I found the male protagonist, who was Henry in this film inappropriate. Maybe I just don't like his way of speaking or his height. Well, I would not recommend this film to anyone, unless they disconnect it and want to look at the fashion of the era or how they lived at home at the time. Iâ€™ll look at the 1999 version again, and I hope that she will get better and will make Jane Austen some justice in her writing.
