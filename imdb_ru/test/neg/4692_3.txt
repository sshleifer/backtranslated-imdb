Esther Williams plays the romance of the unattached water ski secretary, who wants to stop “walking on the water” and become the wife of a man; Van Johnson and Tony Martin are her potential choice for a husband. Despite the wonderful water scenes shot in Florida's Cypress Gardens, this romantic comedy is terribly outdated. As director Charles Walters says, everything here is done deliberately innocuous, which does not give the picture a special endurance. Even the great moments of Esther in the water are not quite up to the hypnotizing jumps from her other swimming means, although they are preferable to men, both of which are colorless. Carroll Baker, in her film debut as the disgruntled ex-girlfriend of Martin, is the busiest of the whole group. Shaky things, really. * 1/2 of ****
