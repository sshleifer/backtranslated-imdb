Sorry, but this film is just for me. In it, Perez dances a taxi with a guy Keitel, who is trying to become an actress. First of all, what the hell is a taxi dancer? Even after looking through it, I still do not know. Oh yes, Perez also inspires DeLorenzo to follow her like a puppy in love. Love has no reason, it just happens. There are times when characters and events are really trying to get your sincere feelings, but this rarely works. The only character you really have feelings for is Keitel’s character, and that’s just because he does a great job with it. Any other actor and character would be the same as everyone else. <br /> <br /> The script, in fact, is not inspired by the repetition of how difficult it is to make it an actor / actress. This was done and said earlier; language and dialogue sound as if they were written by a street pimp. The end ... well, I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say he feels unsatisfactory. I would be more upset if the story were good to begin with. The direction is average, nothing truly miraculous, but nothing that really hurts to look at. To repeat the action, the only one who does anything worth seeing is Keitel. Although I could live without seeing him in a tiger-print bikini. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, Eddie Bunker appeared. No matter how accidental this mention is, how it is accidental in the film. And Tarantino provides a service to his director, showing about 20 seconds.
