I can overcome a political parody; even if it was a PROPOSAL to be the movie "Masters of Horror." <br /> <br /> But I can’t overcome this apparent use of our war heroes (and their victims) as pawns in some of the political horror maker’s eroded political statement. <br /> <br /> It was just insulting to desecrate Arlington and our heroes. I have a family in Arlington. The idea that this guy (Dante) even portrays outraged Arlington graves just makes me vomit. <br /> <br /> I finished with Dante and finished with the MOH.
