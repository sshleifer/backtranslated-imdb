Since I'm not a big fan of Steven Seagal, I thought it was a pretty good movie. Obviously, his fans are very unhappy with this drama, which lacks the abundance of martial arts and brute force. <br /> <br /> Gaylard Sartain plays the self-proclaimed patriot militia leader in confrontation with ATO weapon violations. He gives up with the intention of releasing a deadly virus. Seagal is a former CIA agent who became a country doctor who forces himself to find an antidote to a deadly mistake that disabled a small city. Herbal medicine of his grandfather from Native Americans turns into salvation. <br /> <br /> Notable appearance L.K. Jones, Camilla Belle and Silas Weir Mitchell. My personal favorite in this film is the Whitney Yellow Robe. She's awesome, and she seems to have everything she needs to play a more complex role. <br /> <br /> Despite the contrived final, it was a worthy film in which much more action could be used.
