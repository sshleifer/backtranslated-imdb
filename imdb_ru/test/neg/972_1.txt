In the career of every famous actor, a moment comes when they become careless and accept projects that they would not touch with a 1000-foot pole on their golden days. Remember the "Taxi Driver"? It was a good movie. I can hardly believe that De Niro from Showtime is the same actor. <br /> <br /> I would prefer to watch Time Racers twice than watch this movie again. If someone offers to take you to Showtime or give you free passes or something else, run as fast and as far as you can.
