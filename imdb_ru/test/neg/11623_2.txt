worst continuation i have ever seen. really awful songs that grieve, considering how fantastic the first movies and stories are! except for the fact that it destroys the film for me, the fact that there is no John Cleese, so Jean Bob might not even be in it, and the new villains are terrible. It is really annoying that this old woman cannot put together a simple sentence without repeating her words over and over again. but, honestly, do not shut up, put away, a little ridiculous. but the fact that it was her 50th birthday: why do they paint her like an 80-year-old? I was going to give it 1, but now I think ... I could give it 2, but still the storyline is far from as good as the first movie. it looks like no humor from certain characters. In general, I didnâ€™t like this film because of disappointing music, a serious lack of vocal talent: changing the voice of Prince Derek and Jean Bob, new villains, a disappointing plot, annoying habits of some characters and very simple animation.
