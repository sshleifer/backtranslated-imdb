If you are reading a summary of the Mad Max plot, you have just spoiled the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the movie. You also learned that Mad Max is happening in post-apocalyptic Australia, which will be useful, because otherwise you will have no idea what is happening. The film, shot in 1979, is trying very hard to become “A Clockwork Orange” by Stanley Kubrick (1971), only that film, in all its weirdness, really makes sense and leaves the effect. This film does not do any, and ends up becoming a stunt filled with stunts in a car / bicycle that falls, like all cars in a film. <br /> <br /> The first thing wrong with the “Mad Max” is that he tries to sell himself as a story of revenge, when no vigilant takes revenge until the last 20 minutes. If the first hour was reduced to 20-30 minutes, and then the last 20 were added, and then another hour was added, then Mad Max would be a tough fighter with a great rebel hero. Instead, Mel Gibson must wait and act like a grandmother for 2/3 of the film, and then suddenly see his revenge. I have yet to look at the continuation of the "Road Warrior", and I must admit that I am glad of this just because I want to know what it is doing next. This first film was basically a waste of time. <br /> <br /> George Miller does some great action films here, but his excessive symbolism is absurd and the unbearable crazy reaction sequence each time a character discovers something terrible, such as a burned hand or something that completely destroys these moments. This is a terribly cliche technique of the B-film. <br /> <br /> In this film there is absolutely no thematic value or subtle criticism of society. It doesn't matter what you think. An excellent sci-fi movie at least makes a difference, but gratuitous, randomly committed violence, strange bikers say nothing of value. Even the villain Toecutter feels that the modeled Alex from “Clockwork” is only ugly and totally unassuming. PG violence simply does not allow the violence of this gang to settle down and get a reaction from the viewer, it just lubricates it, if anything. <br /> <br /> I will give credit for the amount of material that the film crew exploded and crashed into things, and Miller does a great job making you feel the intensity of the collisions. Everything else is mediocre at best, and after an hour of mediocrity you get something good, and the film ends after 20 minutes. I just cross my fingers "Road Warrior" will meet the expectations of where this film ends, otherwise it is more time spent. ~ Stephen See <br /> <br /> Visit my website at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
