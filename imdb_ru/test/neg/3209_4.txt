As a child, I watched the first three movies of Critters and enjoyed them. They were fun and exciting horror comedies, perfect for the adventurous children of horror kids. I have never seen Zubastik 4, so I finally decided to watch it. My verdict: a forgetful and rather bad movie with a startlingly low number of bodies. The screenplay of Joseph Lyle and David J. Shaw is both predictable, and clich√©, the plot is ripped off by Alien and Star Wars, and the scenery looks dull and dull. The tone of the film seems deadly serious, making it slow and boring. "Critters 4" were, apparently, so budget that the filmmakers could not afford any optical effects, and those taken from "Android", look seriously outdated. out of 10. One to avoid.
