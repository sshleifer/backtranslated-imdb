“The End of Days” is one of the worst high-budget action films I've ever seen. Blending direction, a tortuous script loaded with unsuccessful dialogues and gaping holes in the plot, fast editing in MTV style and bad behavior to the end. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that End of Days will not be observed. The film got me interested because I found the last action of Ah-Nuld, ridiculously stupid because of his ineptitude and stupidity when it comes to logic. Without logic, the film dies faster, so "The End of Days" deserved a huge reduction in box office in the second week after opening in the USA. <br /> <br /> I will not go into the details of the explanation why End of Days violates the law of the film’s logic, but there are several problems with this movie: <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) <br /> <br /> After the Devil goes, the restaurant explodes without any trace of how he did it. No snapping finger, no forged energy gas to light a fire, nothing. How could this happen? <br /> <br /> Arnold and his annoying assistant Kevin Pollak somehow magically come up with the name “Christina York” after studying the phrase “Christ in New York”, carved on the body of the victim, launches the database. on the computer and alto Christina York, the only person with the exact name in all of New York! Outside of my suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> How did the characters who came into contact with the character of Arnold turn against him later in the film? I laughed out loud when I learned that a good stepmother who had become an evil stepmother is the same actress who played the nurse in the novel by William Shakespeare Romeo + Juliet. Her ironic transition from this movie to this one was absolutely funny if you can imagine. <br /> <br /> All insanely huge explosions and shots. What did you expect from Arnold Schwarzenegger's car? <br /> <br /> The devil took the human body, consisting of flesh and blood, but he is invisible to bullets and explosions, healing through this body. It is logical that this is impossible. <br /> <br /> As the devil demonstrates an illusion in an apartment, Arnold's character faces a solid Christmas tree, which is supposedly an illusion and * falls on it * physically. <br /> The devil is capable of knocking out a person’s brains and turning the victim’s head 180 degrees, but he cannot kill Arnold’s character, as he always intends. <br /> <br /> How did the object of the parents of the devil's desire die? and why evil New Yorkers run after Arnold, and the object of desire is never explained at all. <br /> <br /> In a sequence that is Speed ​​robbery, Arnold and the Devil’s desire object manage to escape from the subway. train wreck short distance inside unscathed. This is beyond my comprehension, since there will be enough power to violently drop Arnold and the object of desire and die from fatal wounds seconds after the impact. <br /> <br /> Arnold suffers a brutal beating from a mob sanctioned by the Devil and put him on a cross to hang on the wall, but the devil forgot to waste time and the ability to kill him for convenience. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, after the devil took over the body of a man, suddenly Arnold is his bodyguard ??? Is this a coincidence or just an example of bad editing? <br /> <br /> Arnold talks about irritating dialogues in such ridiculous scenes as “YOU ARE GOOD COMPARED WITH ME!” are the perfect food for MST3K, as Eraser did with the classic line “You are Luggage!” <br /> <br /> The whole theory about 666/1999 is absolutely ridiculous. Just like the pseudo-religious chatter about Christian theology concerning the end of the world at midnight, and fanatical murderers who know the location of the object of the devil's desire. <br /> <br /> (END OF SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> It is quite ironic that End of Days uses scattered profanity that insults a deity while it wanders through Christian theories. The level of violence in the film is excessive and terrible, and therefore there is no need to maintain the plot. Director indulgence excess is a factor here. He, of course, does not know how to make a consistent fighter from the screenwriter Air Force One, who was obliged to write the script only for a large amount of money. <br /> <br /> Therefore, End of Days is a useless film that has no redemptive value except politeness - Arnold is the worst since the time of Hercules in New York. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
