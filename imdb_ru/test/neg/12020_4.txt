and nothing else. <br /> <br /> One of my friends bought the package “Hysterical Problem Child” (contains the first two “Problem Children” on one disc), and we decided to see the sequel, because it was “more funny”. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of funny moments in the movie (vomit scene, that's all I need to say). Nippy dog ​​after eating CHOW DOWN and many others. The film is nothing but toilet humor, but it's funny. However, besides the fun moments, this film has little to offer. <br /> <br /> John Ritter annoys me because he seems to be reading a book. A person cannot play this, sorry. <br /> <br /> Although I can’t say, I would find the film funny now ... (we were amazed when we watched it), this is a great film for a rainy day ... but no more. Don't wait for the Oscar stuff about it, guys.
