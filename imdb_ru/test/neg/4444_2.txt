The Altman Quintet should not only be seen as a flaw: as many other reviewers noted, the ideas underlying the film, even some of the options for portraying these ideas, should work — and at the same time very little in this complex film. I noticed to my wife that this must be the most distracting director vanity I have ever seen - never let me “enter” into the world of the film. <br /> <br /> In general, there are serious problems with the stage setting. It is clear that a lot of attention was paid to such factors as costume and production design, but none of them are very effective in creating a believable world. Perhaps this is a matter of scale; The film is so scenic that I laughed out loud when it was mentioned that “five million” people live in the city. (Yes, I understand the limitations of the film’s budget. Matte pictures here and there could help.) In all of the most disappointing Altman films I've ever seen. Great ideas and great metaphors do not always appear in art - this is just part of the game.
