Poor action movies - cemeteries for aging martial arts stars. In such films, they struggle to preserve the dangerous behavior that made their early work successful, but they all end in failure. Seagal is too old for such a role, but he will not let go ... no matter how silly he looks. Some hope that his current job will somehow bring back magic, but there is no magic left. The end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s belonged to Steven Seagal, and his work made me a fan. I could see that he fit perfectly into the slot on the Sopranos, where his overweight, cheerful features and sullen attitude could find a home. I wonder what the impact of his run straight to the videos ?! Since it produces them, I assume that $$$ is more than satisfactory. If this is a deal, we will be exposed to poorly filmed Seagal fighters in the late 60s and 70s .....
