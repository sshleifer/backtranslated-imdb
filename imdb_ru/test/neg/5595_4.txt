1st viewed 9/9/2008, 4 out of 10 (Dir-J.S. Cardone): a sexy political thriller that doesn't really succeed in any of these areas, except for the early period, when there are some interesting episodic scenes. The film begins with a show of a couple exploring their sexual fantasies in their work environment or wherever and whenever they like. The couple goes on a tour of the retreat and bath, where they encounter a woman who wants to become part of the troika and fulfill some of their fantasies. At the moment we only know that this couple is safe, but we do not know until they return, that the groom is part of a wealthy political family. A man hopes to be on the verge of a possible place in Congress after the wedding. Then they receive a package from an anonymous source in the mail with detailed photos of their meeting in the bath, and their qwest begins a story about how and why they were taken, who sent the package, what they want and how to clear their names before any of them. this will come out. This qwest becomes an obsession that leads them deeper into darker worlds and takes a lot of time from them, to the extent that their friends and family wonder what they do all day and why they look exhausted all the time. This film is sometimes interesting, but becomes ridiculous, because they are personally looking for a problem, and do not involve the police at an early stage because of their pride. This mistake, of course, supports the movie. The performances are in order, despite the nameless cast, but the madness of the situation redefines, and the film begins to become Humyak about ½ way. And, of course, they add a turn at the end that challenges and challenges everything that happened before (as is customary in our day, when they don’t know what else needs to be done to revive the film). It does not help this film.
