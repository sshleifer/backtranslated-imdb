It is difficult to decide who or what is the target audience for this film. Jean-Pierre Limousin allegedly had the opportunity to investigate the problems of amnesia on a serious level and decided instead to use it as an excuse to make a soft porn movie. Seeing, loving, beloved and respected, Se Souvenir des belles chooses who investigates memory loss - albeit as a result of Alzheimer's disease - in a deep and heartbreaking way, not least in the bright performance of Isabel Carre, I discovered that Novo is an insult to Sa Souvenirs . I have no problem with soft pornography on its own - and even if I had, I would actually have to refuse to go to the cinema, so prevailing today - but I have problems with writers / directors who try to respectablise his disguise as here, under the guise of medical research. The sad thing is that such great actresses as Julie Gayett — such great ones in “Klara and Moy” - and Anna Muglalis - who seem to have got into a double play after last week, Le Deluge, and now this one - spend their time on the dross, like this.
