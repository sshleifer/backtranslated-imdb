Seriously, I could not find anything that would constitute a reasonable human thought in this film. For some reason, the writer decided that in random places a bunch of actors would grunt, humiliate and scream like two-legged Cro-Magnon men. I understand that it was about gymnastics, but seriously, with all the roar and bleating of a person? I also saw at least five actors with hyperactive terrette syndrome and grade 10 syphilis. <br /> <br /> Although there is real human acrobatics in this film, I must say that it is amazing that you can make such a film without having anything intelligible. form of human speech patterns. This is a really important stage in the history of filmmaking, because there was no conscious decision to force the characters to express something more than timely Urrrrr! or rfff! sound. <br /> <br /> Incredible.
