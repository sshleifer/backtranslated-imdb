Wave after wave of aimless nausea - this film wants and at first promises to be bizarre and original, but in fact it is obvious, solipsichny and immersed in a cliche-driven dialogue, which by the end turns into a scandal of horror and cheese. Throughout the film, we see, apparently, with the walls of characters who are really very boring, and just don’t quite work, and who cling to a horrific scenario, like people in armor, drive jeeps to their homes and tear up the unsightly existential evidence in accompanied by nagging coldplay. There are episodic funny episodes in the film, often no more ridiculous than a dog playing with genitals, which happened twice (pointer of farce, elementary humor of the film as a whole), but as a result, the film falls into the “endless abyss” of the director’s detritus, which made me want to knock me out. Watch this movie at your own risk.
