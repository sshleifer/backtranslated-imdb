This is the stupidest film ever made. The story is funny. His wife and child think he is insane. Then they do not. Then it turns out that he is, and I think they knew it all the time. There is a dog named Ned who causes some problems, and I think it's all his fault ... just like Jim Carey. God only knows why Virginia Madsen took on this role ... this is a careerist. I think that the target audience for this is 11 and 12 years. And this is a total of up to 23. Or maybe this is for 8 and 10 years, and also up to 23. Or maybe for a really stupid 23 years. Or maybe a really stupid 32-year-old, because itâ€™s 23 years old. Or maybe 46-year-olds will like it, because half of them is 23. I think searching the Internet for things about number 23 will be more interesting than this film, unless you want to watch a comedy.
