This last effort of Frida plays like a modern day (that is, the 70s) in the gothic thriller, but it lacks the thrill. Of course, this is not a terribly bad film, he just has the feeling that many of Fridaâ€™s later films have about someone who gave up when he saw the first daily film. It starts quite well, almost as sweet as in tone, then turns into Gothic territories with a decent (albeit awfully cliche) tuned. Suddenly, Frida seems to have lost interest in the film, and all we get is long shots of Camilla Keaton and burning candles. Then, about an hour after the beginning of the film, we get some violent climax with special effects from poor to poor. This is followed by a slow outro pace with a very obvious end of the turn (if it is even intended to be a turn?). And throw some very indecisive explanatory scenes along the way, and you will receive the Tragic Ceremony. Thus, in parts he has his qualities. But then suddenly stumbles and falls in front of you. It's a pity. <br /> <br /> By the way, stay away from the SHAROMA DVD, a useless dark pan and scan that kills what can be a good visual experience.
