Tony Curtis and Skip Homier both wear black and white canvas edged shoes on the scenes just before and after the swimming pond and the tank being blown up. It must have been too hard on the feet of the young stars. If real marines were on a mission, they would be in boots. In the first scenes, they took off their leggings just before going on a short journey to find the Farmer. When they went to the area where the foxhole had been dug, Tony and Skip were wearing combat boots, then when Lovejoy and Curtis were confronted with Fremer, and his daughter Tony was in Tennis Shoes, but they were black. The film is about a true story, but did they really need love interest?
