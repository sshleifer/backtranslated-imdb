This film tried something, but failed miserably. All attempts at suspension were cheap, and there were so many weary tricks and holes in the plot that I ended up laughing and making fun of all this time. At least I was entertained. <br /> <br /> Ghosts try to warn the family, so why do they attack a girl whose name I still remember. And what about black and white at the beginning? I know what they were trying to do, but they failed. And where the hell did this guy come from (John Corbett's character)? He just waltzes from nowhere on a huge field. And why did he suddenly lose him again when the ravens came? And if the crows were a manifestation of the spirits of his family, then why did they attack him if it made him try to kill the family? It makes no sense. So many things in this film simply do not make sense, and the role of the main character is not very good. It's not terrible, just like the days of her children's movies. <br /> <br /> So in general, this film was not brilliant, but I had a good time, and sometimes that's all I need to do in a horror movie. Rental for entertainment is not high quality.
