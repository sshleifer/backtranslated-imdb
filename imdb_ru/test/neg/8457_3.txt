“Terror in the aisles” may look like a real treat for horror fans, but in reality it has very little to offer. Of course, it represents a decent and versatile (too universal?) Choice of horror / thriller fragments that are considered classic, but ... what's the point? This documentary is primarily intended for the public who loves horror, so we have already seen almost all of these clips, haven't we? The only thing that really deserves praise in this project is editing. If you like queen screams, chasing nasty killers and the like, there are several neat collections of the most famous episodes in Horror in the Aisles. All of these different plots are connected by an inconclusive story with Donald Pleasant and Nancy Allen in the lead role in the cinema. Between the two sequences, contact the viewer and “explain” why we love horror so much. These speeches, naturally, are hypnotic and fairly obvious (in our nature, fear ... blah blah blah), and I do not understand why many people like this concept. It's worth a look at if you are a devoted fan of horror, but this is definitely not a must-see. On the contrary: in case you still need to see the name of the classic genre, be careful that its pieces do not spoil your future viewing. The main reason why I didn’t like it at all was that he shamelessly ignored many lesser-known but fundamental (foreign) titles that endlessly focused on Halloween. However, this leads to a cool joke, when Donald Pleasant shouts to the screen his own character.
