Wow, this movie is bad. Think "flashdance" with ninjas. Worst of all, when the sword must fly in the air, but you can see the strings. Or perhaps the worst part is a giant eye patch (which looks like a stand) that a good ninja wears. In fact, there are so many bad places, I can not decide what is the worst. I can not believe that someone is actually investing money in this thing. The only redemptive value is that it is pleasant to laugh at.
