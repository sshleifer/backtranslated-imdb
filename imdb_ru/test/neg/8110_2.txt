I found this film to be a waste of 96 minutes. Jones was a strange kid and seriously confused! According to my recollections, what could be wrong, is he only 16 or 17 years old? ** Spoiler ** Why did he leave college and rent an apartment with two crazy girls who had been at enmity with the boys in the past? and the cowboy who lives under Jones also scared me, from where he knew that what was happening in the apartments had not flown past me for a minute. I do not understand his thoughts about a girl who took pictures for fun and stayed in her room when Mandy Moore always finished, and it was quite obvious that she wanted to be more than just friends with him. I really do not find this film funny, fanciful, dramatic or something else, I found it to be stupid and a complete waste of time (D- F +)
