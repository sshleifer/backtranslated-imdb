Yes, Lifetime has the habit of making the male look look silly. And this soap opera is not joking when they make Perry King, a supposedly famous doctor, unable to see the evil around him. Trust doctors, eh? How can someone not see what is happening? Is he so stupid? And an evil wife, with a face that looks like a horse, begins to kill her entire family without a trace. How does she get all the drugs? This is not explained. How does she manage to be a secretary in a hospital without any authority? I think that director Don FauntLeRoy asks us to just believe it. I'm not. I kept shouting at the screen at Kingâ€™s stupidity, right in front of his face. If the wife were so attractive, maybe, just maybe, I would accept it. But she is not even like that. Shannon Sturges is the perfect wife, and I tell you that she has a horse face. I would not cross the street for her sake, but our ideal husband does it quickly. After everyone in the cast was confused, I was not satisfied with the fabrication given to our evil. She deserved more than she received. William Moses plays the brother of the doctor, who, unfortunately, you know his result from day one. It's nice to see at least one pretty face in this clinker. This is Lesley Ann Down. She gives the film 2 points just to see someone in this mess. Perry King deserves his fate. What a moron.
