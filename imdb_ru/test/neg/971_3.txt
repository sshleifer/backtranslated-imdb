Spoilers with a small plot ahead !!! <br /> <br /> How did such talented actors get involved in such a reckless re-creation <br /> <br />? Robert DeNiro plays a stupid Hollywood version of the brutal policeman who is violently abusive (that is, he beats the bad guys and rolls his eyes at the police who prefer to stick to the book), and Eddie Murphy plays <br /> /> not such a tough cop who would prefer to be an actor (that is, he screams <br /> <br /> “Stop, the police!” and has his “hard look” stroked). Naturally, they are <br /> <br /> having a partnership when, due to Bobby’s weak tactics, he finds himself in hot water <br /> <br /> with the media, and is essentially being blackmailed in a leading role in < br /> <br /> "Cops" - as a reality show. Take a breath, because it's so funny how it turns out <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> No energy was put into the script - it looks like a pale repetition <br /> <br /> each copy of a friend’s film thrown into the blender with “15 minutes” in the lead role, <br / > <br /> yes, DeNiro himself, is pretty much the character he plays here. <br /> <br /> The jokes were unsuccessful, the action seems sluggish, and no one seems to be having fun <br /> <br />. He is dead on the screen. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time. Even if you have a strong attachment to one of the actors, avoid it and do them a favor. Because if this <br /> <br /> makes money, these scenarios will be considered quite acceptable <br /> <br /> for actors of their own quality. <br /> <br /> And for Mr. De Niro, you used to make serious films. I remember them - <br /> <br /> they were good. You were nominated for awards - remember how fun it was <br /> <br />? Now after “Analyze it” (which was good), “Meet the parents <br /> <br />” (which was also good) and “Rocky Adventures and <br /> <br /> Bullwinkle” (it was NOT good ), I think we need to see you parody yourself, <br /> <br />, and BE more. "Casino" is felt very long ago <br /> <br /> back. And no, I don't consider “15 minutes” to be serious Bobby. Anyone who <br /> <br /> was serious about this media satire should receive weekly world news.
