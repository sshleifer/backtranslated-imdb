Mr. "Uwe Fail" delivers a new blow, turning the classic game into a cheap piece of shit. Bad game; Bad direction; Terrible adaptation; I mean, the Far-Cry game was awesome, it looks like a real FPS game, cool weapons and a lot of shoot and shoot. In the film, we had nothing compared to the game ... Well, we had some point and shoot things, but ... I don't know how to explain, but if you have ever watched another movie "Uwe Fail "you will understand. If you do not believe me, go to the Petition Online website and check what is called the Stop Uwe Bowl. <br /> <br /> This movie made me bleed, someone had to stop it this time. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time.
