(May contain spoilers) This film is the epitome of weirdness. I shot it in the hope of such a bad film that it would be funny. However, I still honestly cannot decide whether this movie was scary or humorous. It combines emotions in a rather disturbing way. Obviously, this is trying to be smart, but in reality it is not. For example, when a knife comes out and tries to kill a teacher, he starts playing funny music. When we go to Toxico, we have a quasi-mister. Roger's Neighborhood Music. However, when a small child dreams of falling into the "blood" and when he finds a leg, they are clearly intended for tension. So watch this movie and decide for yourself. It is too strange to describe in words, and for that I say, glory. <br /> <br /> "Spout ... WOW!"
