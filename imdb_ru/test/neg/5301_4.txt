I really liked Get Shorty, but this film was completely disappointing as a sequel. First of all, Travolta is in no way similar to the chili palmer from “Get Shorty”. He just half appreciated this view, as in all of his later films. He is completely uneven and has no gangster presence, which makes him kind of cheering for him throughout the film. It seems that Travolta got out of bed and decided that he was good for filming this film. The plot was simply not exciting or clever, in fact there were no highlights, the only thing that looked like entertainment was watching Christina Millian's performances, and The Rock was funny. But in any case, in short, this film was rubbish, and I had to force myself to just go through it.
