I got it on my birthday in a box called Broke Skull. Well, after watching one of them on DVD and, being pleasantly surprised, I turned on this sucker. It was worse than I expected, and I did not expect much. This film is basically a tangled story about a guy who dies and returns to life with a mob and other bullshit. There were some interesting ideas that were never implemented. Now everyone says that there was a lot of blood, could anyone tell me, were there? I saw a bad effect from the fact that the head was crushed, brain tissue (or something like that ...) and blood flowed from the penis twice. I must say that the fact that the guy had bitten off the hood made me flinch, it was the only good thing in this film. And this gay sex scene was just thrown there for no reason. The acting in this was Brutal, really, it blew up. This Asian chick annoyed, and then the annoying Mexican guy who came to be killed. I say that if you get it in a box, that's fine, but don't spend money on it at all.
