Yes, I understand that half a dozen other reviewers called this film “Copying Amadeus,” but this is not enough. The scenes seemed to have been taken directly from the script of Miloš Forman with minor changes. You can expect to see: <br /> <br /> - Maestro’s arrogant scene (“I am the voice of God. Everything else is meaningless!”) <br /> <br /> - Maestro makes fun of The work of a mediocre composer meteorism, like Amadeus) <br /> <br /> - Mediocre composer’s dialogue with God (“Why do you instill music in me, but deprive me of the ability to compose?”) deathbed ("The usual time. Start with the violins ... cough") - and the list goes on ... <br /> The problem is even worse. Not only were these scenes shamelessly copied, they were not even done very well. Jeepers, if you are going to rip the original, at least you should try to improve it in your own way creatively. <br /> <br /> No, wait, there is something worse than that. It is the fact that the director tried to turn the story of Mozart into the story of Beethoven. People, Beethoven was not the rude, vulgar slut that this film portrays him. In addition, Beethoven was not a talkative idiot who takes pointers from his copyist, a 23-year-old student of music. Unfortunately, such films are responsible for killing stories. <br /> <br /> And one more thing, Beethoven (in real life) never called her Sonata of the Moonlight, as he does in the film. This name was given by an embarrassed critic a few years after the death of Beethoven, and unfortunately it was stuck. But Beethoven’s original name was Quasi Una Fantasia. <br /> <br /> AND OTHER, when Beethoven (in the film) shouts “B-flat! B-flat! B-flat! ”And hits the note on the piano, he presses the white key! <br /> <br /> AND ANOTHER VIEW !!! Beethoven (in real life) was completely deaf a few years before composing his 9th symphony. This film shows that it has only a minor disability (saying “what?” In each line is enough to annoy). <br /> <br /> AAAND !! ANNNOTHER !!! THINGGGG ... !! American accents ...! Oh, never mind. Just ... never mind. I have already spent enough time on this. Go see "Amadeus" again. Then if you want to see an interesting film about the life of Beethoven, see “The Immortal Lover”, which takes poetic freedoms, but at least these are interesting ideas. Finally, if you want to see something brighter, watch the Impromptu film about Chopin. But besides these three I have never seen a good respect for the classical composer.
