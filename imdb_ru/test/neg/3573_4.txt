This is what I constantly asked myself about during many fights, screaming matches, expletives and general chaos that permeate 84 minutes. Comparisons also justify themselves when you think of one-dimensional characters that have such a shallow depth that it is almost impossible to care about what happens to them. They are simply poorly written ciphers for the director, on which you can hang your multicultural beliefs - a theme that was much better realized in other dramas, both on television and in movies. <br /> <br /> I must admit, I’m not really alone in order to notice the bad actions during the film, but I must say that Nicholas Burley (as the heroine’s best friend) and Vasim Zakir (as a dirty, mocking brother) were absolutely horrible. I don’t know what kind of acting school they graduated from, but if I were them, I would apply for a full return after a rush. Only Samina Avan, in the leading role, managed to impress the cast of so-called British talents, whom we probably will never hear again. At least that is hope. Next time hire another scout. <br /> <br /> Another intriguing thought is the awfully fashionable soundtrack featuring Snow Patrol, Ian Brown and Keane. Now I’m a bit of a music fan, and I’m familiar with the release of most of these artists, but I didn’t recognize a single track during this film (except for the omnipresent "Run"). B-sides, anyone? We get many, many musical montages that show how we feel. They are accompanied by strikingly original images, such as couples kissing in a bloated lake and stumbling in the doorway. This is a problem, because none of the songs effectively conveys the mood, and we understand that the director lacks the ability to carry an emotional journey to the audience only through storytelling and dialogue. <br /> <br /> It is assumed that the ending is meant to be just desserts, as each receives his retribution, and the store has at least one big shock .. But I remained firmly set because the script did not give me anyone cheering for. It is not enough to solve the problem with the "hot button", you need to give us a story that has not yet been made to death, and people who are more than window dressing. In its current form, this film is a noble failure, in which there is only a promising lead actress and several slightly distracting strokes to save him from the bin. 4/10. We must try ..
