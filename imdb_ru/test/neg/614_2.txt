hey .... i really don't know why this film was rated so high, i may have missed the point. As I see, many international filmmakers have made brilliant films that dealt with "schizophrenia" and have informed, excited, shocked, evoking emotions and forcing viewers to move away from their own reality and think ......... is true that The ambition of Senar was ambitious in the light of all the other films, this one is not up to ..... unhappily ...... it was too slow, there was no detail about anything, and the ending .... was completely ... meaningless ...... it was not with an open end or something .... just a demon mentally ..... so look, if you want to see a good concept completely wasted .......
