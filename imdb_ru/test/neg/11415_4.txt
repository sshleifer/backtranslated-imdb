The key scene in Rodrigo Garcia's Nine Lives occurs when Sissy Spacek, hidden in a hotel room where she has an affair with Aiden Quinn, finds a documentary about nature on TV, and at this moment Quinn notes the trick of such things. - Individual frames are edited in one scene, predators and prey come together to capture the moment - all to bring about communication where there really aren't any. The characters in the nine shorts that make up this film occasionally flow into each other’s stories, but none of them seem to connect. A woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father later works in a hospital ward, where another woman is preparing for a mastectomy. A man who encounters an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life should have been later masters, with his current wife, at a party for an unhappy couple. Garcia puts some of his characters in front of each other, but none of the subsequent stories is ever based on what was before. <br /> <br /> Garcia’s first film, wonderful, overlooked “Things you can say just by looking" She "also had a short story and intersecting characters, but there were fewer of them and they had much more places to breathe and grow. The nine lives' stunt premise, in which each of her nine stories is told in a single uninterrupted form in real time, never allows the film to create real dramatic tension or momentum. This is also a rather visually ugly movie. Internal shots are often muddy and difficult to watch, while other scenes - especially the one where the girl walks back and forth between rooms to talk with her uncommunicative parents - annoy the camera work. Considering that this is Garcia’s third film and that he has a respectable history of directing for television, the direction in this film is rather surprisingly amateurish. Like his filmmaker colleague, the child of the great writer Rebecca Miller, García (son of Gabriel Garcia Marquez) focuses on the scripts and characteristic features of his films, often to the detriment of the director. <br /> <br /> Separate scenes are touching and even affect. I liked Jason Issac, who kissed Robin Pente's pregnant belly. And Joe Mantegna whispers softly to his wife when she slips into preoperative sedation. And Sissy Spacek stole some happy moments from her life with Aiden Quinn, and then returned to her with a phone call from her daughter. But the film (unlike “Things you can say just by looking at it”) is more like an exercise than a real drama. We just watch the actions of people.
