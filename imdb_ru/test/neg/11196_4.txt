The summary was promising, but watching the movie was a huge disappointment. Nothing happens in this movie. The plot is linear and without surprise. Normal characters remain normal until the end of the film, strange characters remain strange until the end of the film. There is not even a single opinion that could make the viewer think that the bad guy is someone else, and not the most obvious candidate. On the other hand, the actors play well, and there is a bit of atmosphere in the film, but too little to be significant. <br /> <br /> People who voted for 10 for this film also donâ€™t Watch, or you are a member of the crew! 4 is well paid.
