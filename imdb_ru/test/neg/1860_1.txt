Blimey! This film is almost too bad for words. Obviously, the writers wanted to somehow connect this with the Ghoulies franchise, so they received from Pete Leapis the first one who repeated his role of Jonathan ... only now he is a cop and he has no similar character traits like the first, Guli in not the ghouls of the latter. Cheap-looking puppets have been replaced by even cheaper costumed men. Instead of being the main antagonist or evil, they are more like comic relief characters who appeared from nowhere for no reason. <br /> <br /> When I first watched this movie, I felt I had seen it before. Why was this? Because everything in it was stolen from another movie. All the wacky police lines and battle scenes were from "Deadly Weapons". The hunters looked a lot like Bugs Bunny and Duffy Duck, except that they weren't funny at all. Even scenes from the original Ghouls film were scattered throughout this film. <br /> <br /> I think that the target audience should have been adults, but the mix of black magic, cartoon, police drama and bad acting would not work for everyone. I hope they don’t do Ghoulies V, because I don’t want the film studio to lose their money. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 78 minutes P for violence.
