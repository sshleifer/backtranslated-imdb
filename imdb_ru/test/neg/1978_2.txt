Cute visual effects and lots of fights make the movie not so good. And this is exactly what happened here. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me admit, I still have to play FFVII (I intend to do so soon). However, I did research to get to know the characters and the story. However, not everyone can afford the luxury of time to explore such things, and Advent Children requires that knowledge of FFVII is required. <br /> <br /> Despite the incredible visual effects, I can not say that they are too many. new. We saw it in Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, and aside from some better movement, I can't say that they did a lot of super bold things with that. <br /> <br /> Wrestling scenes - well, it's a little fun. However, as we could doubt as a result of any of them. This was a boring classic - there were three fights with bad guys, following the standard procedure (the hero, Cloud, was defeated, then he almost achieved and was defeated, and then, finally, he won). The reason why I say that it was boring classic was that it was used very often, but in this case it is poorly executed. I will touch on this later. <br /> <br /> English dub seemed to me good, although I did not watch it in Japanese, so I will not judge the Japanese dub, but only in English. I will say this - I have heard many better ones, even in my limited repertoire. <br /> <br /> And now, the plot. Hmmm ... what's the plot? Let me be frank, this film is nothing more than a fan service, a chance to see the FFVII characters on the big screen with cute eye candies. As I said earlier, battles seem to be happening for no reason at all. The opening battle is never explained, Kadazh seems to have no ambition to destroy the world himself, or any real motivation to do something unpleasant. Cloud loafs throughout the entire movie, and almost everyone else gets a must-have cameo. <br /> <br /> Indeed, FFVII was part of the ensemble. Advent Kids is not at all like that. If they could give everyone a meaningful role in the story (Star Trek: First Contact proved it was possible, I could add), then it could be much better. Naturally, this would also change the plot, which, frankly, would almost certainly be better than the one we got. <br /> <br /> Characters, as a rule, are either not used or are almost forgotten. Avalanche members (this is the group that Cloud worked with at FFVII, for those who don't know) get 2 scenes (3 in the case of Vincent Valentine, and some even less). Damn, the bad guys get more lines than these guys, and that's pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Music ... well, I donâ€™t care if Nobuo Uematsu is God himself, he ruined this film a great time. Advent One Winged Angel was the only worthy piece. Otherwise, he could not decide whether he would be epic (and orchestral) or funny (with an electric guitar). When he switched from one to another, you felt as if he had taken a sledgehammer in his head. <br /> <br /> And the last moment, whether this film was epic or funny ... it tried to be both, and failed miserably. Honestly, you can't please everyone and do everything. The film also tried to be deep (you can become epic and deep, or merry and deep, but all three are too many), but it also failed. The last scene, resembling a baptismal ceremony, was added there for the sake of something similar. You don't have to be a Christian to just shake your head and cry there. This scene was simply not in the film (as well as the frequent appearance of Aerit - she is dead, Jim!). <br /> <br /> Given how fantastic I was in Final Fantasy VII, this film is nothing. except for the gigantic disappointment. Because of the beautiful visual effects, I give him 2 out of 10.
