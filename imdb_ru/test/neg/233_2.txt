What was Bruce Willis thinking about when he signed up for this ?? it didn't make sense to me .. I was so embarrassed by it, it wasn’t funny at all .. I don’t even know why Disney did it .. Bruce - Great actor that I have loved for a long time .. I was very disappointed. Pass it on the video shelf ....
