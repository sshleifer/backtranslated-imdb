Where to start, where to start ... hmmm ... well, what about the toughest, unnatural, incredible performances you can imagine? How about stereotypical "characters", situations and locations? Or how about a manipulative, closed, completely wretched scenario? I can not remember a single element in this film, which would be original, worthy of viewing or interesting. <br /> <br /> Note to all of you, Josh Hartnett / Chris Klein / LeeLee Sobieski - enjoy their team for fifteen minutes, guys, because they are not going to be famous for much longer ...
