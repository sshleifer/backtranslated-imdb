After reading the other reviews on this site, we were not sure if we could criticize this film because it does not sound bad enough. However, after 2 minutes of the film, we knew that another failure awaited us. No summer is complete without ice cream, but in this film they serve melted, sour, with a broken bottom ice cream cone (you know, one that makes you sticky and dirty and looking for a wet dream). The biggest problem with this movie was the plot. What was it? Looks like it was a psychotic driving around. That's all. Nothing more happens. First of all, what is the qualification to become an ice cream in this crappy city? 1. Spend a few years in the most ridiculous psychiatric hospital known to man. This hospital was plagued by clowns, graffiti, fake plastic sunflowers and oversized syringes to the head. 2. Have extremely poor hygiene and a mutant face to scare off children. 3. Make sure that your truck is equipped with detached body parts, roaches and do not forget about the snow-white eyes! <br /> <br /> Actors of this film are real B-Movie calibers. Mixed with a bunch of unknowns, there is someone except .... the trailer version of Macaulay Calkin !! Even his courageous charm could not save this punch in his pants. It seemed that in this film there was no rhyme or reason for murder. The whole concept of the film smelled! Who would kill ice cream in car shooting? Bandits? Fiends? Bath White? Who! We are still struggling with this issue. <br /> <br /> Anyone who was in charge of the wardrobe for this movie should be immediately blacklisted from Hollywood. Did they sincerely think that under the pillow under the children's shirt the audience would believe that he was really fat? Did they forget about arms, face, legs and all other parts of the body? Secondly, this film was shot in 1995, but the wardrobe seems to have been selected from the film of the 80s, as evidenced by white, crotch-fitting white pants with high water. <br /> <br /> While we were watching this scandalous production, we both developed severe cases of ADD. We left the room to walk aimlessly. In many aspects of this film, we found that looking at the blank wall behind the television set was more interesting than the film itself. We were stunned that this film did not make it to Bottom 100. After that, we took the cassette out of the VCR and left it on the black top so that it melted like a sub-standard ice cream cone.
