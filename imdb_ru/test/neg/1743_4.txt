Some contemporary Janapese horror films are very good. Strong plot, scary moments, good acting, while others just ... unfortunately, Uzumaki belongs to the last camp. <br /> <br /> I will evaluate the film based on 3 elements: the plot, the scary factor and Acting. <br /> <br /> 1) The plot - in accordance with the name of the film, the plot moves in a circle and never explains itself. Well, the city is fascinated by the spiral curse, but why? And why do people act so stupid? There is a fleeting attempt to explain what is happening to the reporter ... unfortunately ... <br /> <br /> 2) A terrible factor - if it was a horror film, it failed miserably. I can't remember one good scary scene with a lot of preparation for it. <br /> <br /> 3) Acting is very monotonous. People walk, they say senseless phases. I do not feel much sympathy for our tragic heroes. <br /> <br /> In general, there are much better contemporary Japanese horror films with a consistent plot and strong characterization. Do not waste time on this imitator.
