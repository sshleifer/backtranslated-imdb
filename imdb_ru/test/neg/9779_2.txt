I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just because I am a polite person. This film made me lose 90 minutes of my life in which I could do something useful for the human race or only for myself. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is bad, the actors never look scared! Even if it should be a horror movie. For example, the scene in which Kurt collects the bones of his former colleague. He should be scared, but he looks fine. Chicken movie is such a cliche. The only thing I liked about her was the dress she wore in the final scene. And by the way, the end was extremely predictable with a cocoon flashing pink in the box. In fact, I was thinking more about the ant who walked in the back seat of the car. But it still did not surprise me.
