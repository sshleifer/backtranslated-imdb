Obviously, Raw Feed Video is smarter than all of us who have wasted our money renting this movie! They will earn millions on video rentals, and their low-cost investments will pay off, which will be financed by Rest Stop II (unfortunately). I believe they spent a maximum of several hundred thousand dollars to hire actors, rent a place to stop, burn a truck and drag a motorcycle behind a truck, and pay for technical things. That's all. We all have to be as smart as these guys, I will not confuse them for having a genius who can make stinky profits. The premise of the film was good, and it could be a truly adequate horror film, but it failed due to the lack of a clear storyline. I am always looking for a gem from novice film companies, but I have not found it here, and you will not find it either. I only wish I spent $ 3.99 plus tax to find out.
