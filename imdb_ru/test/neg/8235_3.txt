Luther Geek (1990) is a boring horror film, and it is really bad, even by the standards of Tromy! We are talking about an eccentric who bites chickens' heads and kills people, biting their neck, and he actually thinks he is a chicken !!!!! Luther is released from prison after 25 years, because he seems to have been a “model” prisoner and deserves another chance in life (it is VERY hard to believe when you see how he acts and treats people throughout the film ). <br /> <br /> After the murder of an elderly lady in the parking lot of a supermarket, he manages to slip into the woman’s car and start torturing her, her daughter and her daughter’s boyfriend at their family home in the village. <br /> <br /> Then we get to a long, boring and boring movie with terrible actions, until a useless cop appears to kill Luther once and for all !! Oh, and the film also has a funny and funny ending !!! I like low-budget horror films, and I think The Toxic Avenger is a classic of all times, but I'm afraid Luther the geek is just boring, illogical and boring, not so scary, just a little bit of a blood bite and that's about it! 3/10
