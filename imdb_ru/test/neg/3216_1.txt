Some time ago, I stumbled upon this DVD, browsing Netflix, and with such an impressive lineup I decided to try. <br /> <br /> Never before have I seen a film trying to become a new version of an existing great film (Scarface) and such a spectacular failure. <br /> <br /> The main problem seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what the story should be. In Scarface, Tony Montana was the self-proclaimed “bad guy.” His spectacular rise and possible fall were not sad, it was a great (and only logical end) for someone who lived such a life. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa, as a director, writer and lead actor, sees Kilo as a kind of hero or, at least, as a complex guy. However, he does not want to perform the main work of creating a realistic, responsive character. He was raised by a white mother, except for the six months of his childhood, where his father, himself a gangster, showed him his life. For reasons that are never fully explained or even mentioned, he decides that he wants to become a drug dealer, and in fact travels to a bad part of the city, goes to two dealers and says, "Hey, I would like to buy drugs." He refuses on behalf of his father, and, apparently, more than once they are not only rich, two guys who supply him, obey him for reasons, again, never explaining. <br /> <br /> Chapa wants you to feel bad when his character is sentenced to imprisonment, when a police informant lies about him. However, since he used to take a large amount of drugs, why do you need to feel sympathy for the fact that this time he went to prison? The most obvious case where Chapa wants to be a good guy is the execution of a white supremasist / rapist by Gary Busey. In Scarface, Tony Montana kills someone in prison because he pretty much needs to get up, everything is ready, he goes on. But in this case they are forced to make Busey not only a rapist / pedophile, but also a supporter of the superiority of whites. A little overkill, don't you think? I will not go into details in this regard, but their desperate message “PLEASE HOW ME! I AM A DIFFERENT GANGSTER! ”Fails at every level. No matter how hard I tried, I didn’t feel bad, I was in conflict or sympathized when his friends were killed (after the shootout), his wife was also killed (soon after she called him for being a lousy father when he decided that it would be normal to drive right next to a car filled with armed people while his wife was in the car) and his possible demise. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that his actions can be rightly summed up lousy, his only achievement bringing the term “wooden” to the stellar new heights. Bucy should pay tribute to the fact that he really made an effort to his ridiculous role. Tiny Lister succeeded. Stacy Keach plays her warden from the role of Prison Break. Robert Wagner is looking for a salary. Faye Dunaway, although dramatic, turns into a performance better than this film deserved. Brad Dourif is shot in a movie for about two minutes and does his best. And to pay tribute to the film, he makes a single-layer Scarface in one way - Jennifer Tilly now bears the title of “The Most Ridiculous Attempt of Hispanic Accent”. (Sorry, Robert Loggia.) In short, this film had an interesting premise, but a bad storyline, unsympathetic characters and the performances of “hit or miss”. I would advise Mr. Chape next time to soften the forced sympathy - indeed, we do not need your character, we just need to be interested. Lucky next time.
