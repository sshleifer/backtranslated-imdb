I was in a blockbuster and saw a film called Dark Harvest. The cover looked great, the plot wasn't so bad, and the slogan (“You reap what you sow”) made the film look very good. But I was stupid that day, because I did what I should never have done. I rented an “Independent horror movie right on video. Stepping out with my much better rental, I went home, pulled Dark Harvest into a DVD player, and it started. I thought I'd watch the trailer after the movie was shot (BAD IDEA), but I still watched it. NOW to review. * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * First, the game of "children" - sucks, and the scene when talking 2 (the main characters), the lighting - sucks, and the buildings even look fake! Now they go to this house, where relatives of Sean Connel lived there (I think he is the main character, I don’t care). Suddenly, one by one, they start to kill them all ... (sighs) HORROR KILLER !!!! Ahhh !!!!! The scarecrow is obviously the definition of a small budget, and the scenes where the scarecrow is computerized look so fake that it's fun. It makes dinosaur noise and everything! And then at the end ... they shoot a stuffed pistol (it's for God's sake red and it looks like it was bought for a local family dollar), and it pauses for a while and then ..... (sigh) It explodes !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Save time, I say this film sucks. if you need to spend an hour and a half, look at the wall, because looking at the wall is fun + compared to this disaster. This is pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: F If there was something lower ** F - ** than I would say.
