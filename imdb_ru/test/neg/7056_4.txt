'Enough. An undercover police officer from the state capital goes to a small county where moonshine flourishes. As a result, he fled the road from the local hooks, who do not even suspect that he is a police officer under cover (so they just leave as blissfully as before). Soon the woman and her three daughters, who all wear short tops and short shorts, should take care of him (should be until the 70s). He falls in love with one of the girls, but at the same time he has yet to find out who makes the moonshine and delivers him to all the local bars and restaurants. He also has to deal with a fat sheriff and his incompetent deputy, who believe that he is a moonshiner because he is new to the city. <br /> <br /> Life in a small town of America, the style of the 70s. YES HAAAAAAAAAAA.
