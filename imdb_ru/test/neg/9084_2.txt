Again, director J. Lee Thompson teams up with actor Charles Bronson for a cruel and uncompromising action movie. In fact, this is probably the most brutal film of Bronson (a real feat for a man who appeared in the movie “Death Wish”, “Ten to Midnight” and “Land of Kato”) However, cruelty is not in itself a good movie, and The Evil That Men Do is disappointing in the end. If you removed his cruelty, the film would have a slightly different interest. <br /> <br /> The story of a retired assassin (Bronson) who lives a comfortable life on a Caribbean island. He is being urged to retire to track down and eliminate the sadistic doctor who tried his vile trade around various South American holes in hell. Throughout the film, especially at the beginning, we are introduced to some graphic scenes of torture, to show us how disgusting it is. <br /> <br /> These topics are actually quite serious. Torture continues in the overwhelming Latin American dictatorships, and ordinary people are forced to suffer disgustingly painful experiences simply because of the unpopular point of view. But the Evil that men do - despite his decent posturing - doesn't really bother the plight of these poor people. He is worried that he gives Charles Bronson a reason to brush on the unpleasant sacks. This is just an exploitative fighter who hangs up his coat of real questions. The sequence of torture makes you, the viewer, feel like a dirty, sick voyeur in your head, more like a person who enjoys watching "snuff" films. The script is full of terrible dialogue, including some excessive descriptions of acts of torture. The evil that men do is not able to explore his disturbing ideas ... it serves them as entertainment and asks us to enjoy them. Sorry, but this is just wrong.
