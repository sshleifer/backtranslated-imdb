I am a regular reader of Katie Reichs Temperance Brennan novels. Therefore, I am very surprised that she even consulted with this show. <br /> <br /> This is terrible compared to books. The character "Temperance Brennan" is in the books a ghostly, recovering alcoholic and a divorced mother of a college daughter. In Bones, she is arrogant (rhymes with the rich), who, as a rule, is not the mother. The emphasis on her assistant staff, full of grim details about who had many sexual exploits, contrasts completely with books. <br /> <br /> In full respect for the PC movement, she portrays the enemies of the United States as lovers of peace (!). Some information is not even correct, for example, the character from Afghanistan is an active member of the Arab-American friendship group. Since when is the Afghan Arab? I’m sure that if negative references were made to “disadvantaged minorities”, or women, or LGBT, the producers / writers / directors of the show would have to apologize. However, in a typical far-left manner, all racial insults go to the minority group with the highest achievement - Asians, because agent Booth Booth from David Boreanaz constantly calls Angel Montenegro "squint". and so forget about this show. After the episode "The Man in the SUV," I thought that I would try the second episode to see if he would get better. It only got worse! I don't even care if the teenager in question was killed or killed himself, and I will never watch the show again.
