What can I say about such a bad movie? The people who made this film did not even try to make the monster realistic in it. You never see more than his head, and the head is just a giant puppet with little movement, except when it opens its mouth to roar. And the sound they used to roar is the best part. In many moments of the movie, it sounds just like a TIE fighter! I could not believe that when I first heard it, and I had to rewind several times to plunge it into it. In addition to the terrible looking monster and the noise that he makes, this film will have nothing more than a few banal scene attacks and a crazy Scot attacking children trying to spend an intimate moment in his castle. However, it is watchable if you like this type of garbage. I know that....
