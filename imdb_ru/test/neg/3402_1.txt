In fact, it was conceived as a promotional material for a film made by the same terrible director, which is even worse than this documentary and absolutely the worst film I have ever seen, so avoid it at all costs. > <br /> With regard to this documentary, it is interesting; entertaining and clearly misleading! Most of the “historical” video footage is most likely historical footage from completely unrelated events that were sadly cut out and inserted into this documentary to make it more dramatic than ever. There is no doubt that Waverly is a rather interesting place with a rich history, but the production of a documentary film about promotion in the country and related products, due to the lack of better words, is terribly useless. Yes, I lived in Kentucky all my life, and I visited this place many times. Waverly Hills deserves respect; and there's nothing respectful about this settling documentary.
