Think of the most unworthy movie topic that you can, and this is 10 times worse. A woman should make as many crosswords per day as possible. We can't even see the questions and think about the words ourselves, we just watch her struggle. It seems that a woman is so excited and hurries to solve crossword puzzles, but for some reason she is distracted by walking around the city when she can concentrate at home. Acting is terrible, the actress puffs irritably trying to think of words, and we remain completely in the dark. New York landscapes are good, but the film relies too much on them, and it quickly gets old. The film plays as a rejected NYU student film. This film does not have redemptive qualities, and I do not recommend it to anyone.
