You know, I really have a problem with movie listings. Some time ago I was reading Maxim magazine, and they had a list of 50 of the greatest B-films of all time, and, knowing me, I, of course, have to look through them all and write reviews on all of them. That's why on my list you see reviews of films such as Gator Bait, Barb Wire and Coffy. So, I noticed H.O.T.S. in the video store the other day and got to know him from Maxim’s list of the 50 best B-films, and I decided to rent it and check it out. My only consolation is that I rented it, because I learned from the list of bi-films, so I already knew that it would be bad. <br /> <br /> Given the type of film, I cannot say that H.O.T.S. this is a complete failure, as it is just a T & A film from the late 70s, and it never pretends to anything else. The only place where he widely deviates from his goal is a torn section with the participation of a pair of former prisoners who hid a lot of the stolen money in the house, which the impostor H.O.T.S. go to, because this site has absolutely no place in the film. Despite the fact that the rest of the film is also, this story is completely superfluous and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> This story is based on a pair of competing women's clubs in your favorite FU, which exists as one of those universities, which contains the total amount of one women's community, until the deviations form their own to return to the snobs in the other . This new women’s club “Help the Seals” is a women’s club, supposedly based on stamp assistance the whole movie). <br /> <br /> It will sound strange, but in fact there was one scene that impressed me a lot in this movie. I must say, one shot that impressed me. Around the middle of the film, one of the girls from Pi, a rival in the women's case, pours alcohol into the punch, and she pours herself a glass and drinks it. Oddly enough, what she does while drinking this alcohol reminds me of what Charlie Chaplin would have done, which really brightened the film. Obviously, nothing in this film can compare with something Chaplin ever did, but this one shot raised my rating for the film from 2 to 4. <br /> <br /> In general, however, the film Exactly as one would expect, many people run around looking for excuses to take off their clothes (I liked how in the end, in the finals of a football match, “one piece of clothing for each account” was removed). one of the ideas of GIRL. Riiiiiiiiight ??), and not many thoughts are invested in something else. For example, at the beginning of the film there is a scene in which a couple of Pi girls are poured hot sauce into snacks at H.O.T.S. a party that accidentally got into an incriminating photo (the girl taking the picture did not realize that she took the picture at the time), although this photo never appears for any reason later in the film. <br /> <br /> I have seen such films before, like Gator Bait, but without violence, cattle and Coffey are not far off. Even Barb Wire is almost the same, only with a large budget and plenty of silicon. Fortunately, Maxim's list of 50 B-films contains only a few comedies, because these funny T & A teen films are occasionally amused like bad films with a random half-naked scene after watching H.O.T.S. I think I decided that I like bad horror movies better than bad comedies. I would prefer to see how many horrible actors pretend to be frightened than to pretend to be funny.
