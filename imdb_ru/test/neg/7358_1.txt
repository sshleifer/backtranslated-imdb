If you saw a grudge, another mediocre ghostly film, then you need to know what to expect, only worse, much worse. This time, instead of being in Japan with all English-speaking people, we are in Spain with all English-speaking people. Interestingly, not a single shot of this film really looks like Spain and could have been completely shot in the studio. Yes, and a place with swings, because there are good 5-minute shots with swings, on which there is no one, oooooh, how creepy. <br /> <br /> This horror is terrible in all respects. The actions of mom and dad-laminator do not help at all. Anna Paquin is the only person who has played well in the film, but I hate Anna Paquin so you can present my own hell of this movie. <br /> <br /> However, there is one good moment in the film, when a villain tries to explain the intricate plot to Anna Paquin’s character, and she doesn’t understand any of this, asks a bunch of silly questions, and he throws: got it! ”lol. Well, I understand that this film is a piece of garbage. 0 stars
