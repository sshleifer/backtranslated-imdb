I took the opportunity to see if my good First World War film really escaped my attention - this is not true. John Phillip Lowe and Don Stroud are both tough in their actions and wrong in their roles. The dialogue is stupid or does not exist; flight sequences are fine, but fairly repetitive. Compared to the terrific Blue Max, this film should never have been made. Watch George Peppard, James Mason, and Usul Andress at BM, and you will understand why this film is one of the best war films ever made, but it’s not. Recently released on DVD, Richtofen and Brown are presented as excellent “lost classics” of the 70s, I resold my own the next day after I bought it. Do not waste your time or $.
