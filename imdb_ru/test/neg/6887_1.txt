I think when people say it is beautifully shot, they talk about close-ups of frogs and cooking. This, of course, does not apply to the set, which seems to consist of 3 rooms without any external shooting. In addition, all this shot too close. <br /> <br /> I got sick of a little boy who constantly whips in Miu or sprays hot wax with ants ... do the Vietnamese spend all their time squatting? It looks somewhat rude, at least in the way that this film shows - one close-up of it would be a lot, not a dozen or more. <br /> <br /> And finally, the second part ... a film for Vietnamese girls with a perfect handsome rich man who plays the piano all day (he is cultural). A beautiful maid steals him like a forbidden green mango fruit. Deep. <br /> <br /> With the exception of a few good close-ups, this film is stupid. This is a kind of soap opera without dialogue. It is closed. How is it beautiful ?? The kit looks completely fake. <br /> <br /> No, do not make the mistake I made, and rent it, because someone recommended it. I was expecting beautiful pictures of the coastal mountains of Vietnam or something like that, when I heard that this is a visual gem. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. I love foreign films, I even prefer them. But this film is dull and boring. It annoys you that something like that will win a lot of prizes.
