I saw comments from Turkish people (who I don’t), saying that this film is fantastic and accurately portrays Turkish life. All I have to say is ... Turkey should be one of the most boring and depressive places in the world, because, in my opinion, this is exactly what this film was for me. If I were Turkish, I think it would have a greater impact. But if you are not from Turkey, I would advise you not to spend two hours of your life on it. <br /> <br /> It seems that “Distant” is eternal. Many scenes are painstakingly long, with almost no purpose. I do not understand the director’s purpose even in terms of many scenes. It is stated that the director used his car, apartment and friends when making the film ... Well, guess what? It shows. It looks like a low budget. The game is bad. If this is a cultural thing, then so be it. I just do not understand the purpose of the film on this story. This is incredibly boring.
