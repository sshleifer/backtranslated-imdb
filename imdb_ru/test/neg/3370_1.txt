In general, it took me three attempts to get through this movie. Although it is not complete nonsense, I found several things that would be more useful for my time, for example, removing nails from sandpaper. <br /> <br /> Actors participating in this should feel the same thing as people who are filmed for advertising herpes medicine; people will not pay to see that the fame you earn will not be the best for you personally, but at least the commercials will receive airtime. <br /> <br /> The first one was bad, but it gave the word “bad” a completely new definition, but it has one good feature: if your children do not give you the opportunity to let them watch movies with an R rating, before you will want it, tie them and insert this little gem. tears begin. ;)
