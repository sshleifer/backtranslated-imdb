This is the worst thing I've ever seen in a movie. My uncle's home movies have more talent than this shit. <br /> <br /> The main point of the story is that these double kickboxers play some kind of sick survival game with a man and his private army on an island. This man has a very cheap paper that looks like a manual typewriter. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the game is terrible. There are scene changes in a drop of a hat. For example, for at least 30 seconds, we see a guy singing a song for himself that doesn't add ANYTHING to the film. This is the worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life, I do not think that this film can become even worse than it is now. I would describe it as a desire to be Chuck Norris. And I hate Chuck Norris.
