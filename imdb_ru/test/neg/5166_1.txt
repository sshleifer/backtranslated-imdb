Absolutely pathetic attempt to film about the victims of Australian soldiers during the campaign in New Guinea. A complete waste of money, even if you see them only on DVD. Fortunately, the video store provided a free weekly DVD rental, otherwise it would be a waste of money. Probably made skillful types and full of symbolism, which modern socialists Chardonnay seem so in. Honestly, this film is an insult to the memory of brave guys who never returned. Someone, please provide funding to create a decent film, at least equal to "Saving Private Ryan." We hope that the RSL will establish the greatest possible distance between itself and this film. This story needs to be told from all sides - Australians, locals and Japanese - although it is highly unlikely to force the latter to tell the truth about everything that happened during the Second World War. In fact, it is rubbish, I do not see it, do not buy it. Go away
