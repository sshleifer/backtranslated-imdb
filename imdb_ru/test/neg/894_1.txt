(Spoilers ahead!) The same exact plot from this movie was made before. It was made on Ferris Bueller's day off! Marquis "Bat Man" Houston plays sick. His gullible parents believe him. His sister knows that he is pretending, but she still has to go to school! She is frantic. He has a party with friends while his parents are gone. By the time his parents returned home, he fell ill again, and his parents never found out about the party. I like immature better when they were in House Party 3 and still immature!
