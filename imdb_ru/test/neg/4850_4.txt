Well ... I like Patricia Kaas. She is a beautiful lady and an extremely gifted and versatile singer. Her play in this film is more than competent and, from my point of view, about the only saving future of this film. She very gently catches the essence of a lonely singer with a very serious health problem. However, what I really dislike about the film is the shameless placement of the product in the famous French hotel chain. Another thing is that the story seems to be wandering for a long time, not deciding what the film is about and what it wants to be. On a positive note, you can argue that the film is not predictable, but you can also say that it is clearly boring due to the lack of cohesion. There are some good shots in the film that you can't help but think that all parts simply add nothing. Too bad, because Kaas really shines in this film.
