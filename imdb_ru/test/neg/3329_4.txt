Some movies just ?? unhappy. These are films that clearly flourished thanks to goodwill and a handful of potentially great ideas, but simply did not have at their disposal budget funds and / or professional actors and film crew members to make this happen. “Strangeness” definitely falls into this category. You really want to enjoy it, but even the most tolerant and undemanding horror fanatics of the 80s will have to admit that the film barely reaches the level of mediocrity due to its cheap atmosphere, the awkward effects of motion stoppage and impenetrable dark cinematography. “The Strangeness” has a rather original plot and setting (ok, this is similar to “The Boogens”, but I sincerely doubt that director David Michael Hillman deliberately tore himself off the insignificant 80s B-film), although the players show enthusiasm, although Wrong. A gathering of amateur cavers goes on an expedition to explore the infamous Golden Spike mine. Many years ago, several miners died there mysteriously, and since then this place has left, but there must be too much gold to remain closed forever. Shortly after they descend into the mine, the members of the group one by one collide with the slimy ruler of the Golden Spike mine; Lovekraftovsky monster with tentacles and an incredibly brash way of moving forward. For most of its time, “Weirdness” is a boring and incompetent mess that is difficult to follow due to the total lack of lighting. The characters are uninteresting, and the mine remains a mystery, because the only light effects are from speleologists' helmets. There is very little action or horror in the first hour, but director Hillman deftly attracts the attention of viewers, regularly showing pieces and pieces of monster. As soon as you catch a glimpse of the tentacle of the monster, you are doomed to continue to observe until the very end. The creature is implemented with stop motion effects, which I usually adore and worship, but here in this case they look extremely weak and pathetic. The man responsible for the special effects should have paid more attention to the work of Ray Harryhausen. The death sequences mostly occur behind the scenes, and there is very little expectation throughout the entire film. A horror film with such a setting should benefit from a claustrophobic atmosphere and unrecognizable sound effects, but “Weirdness” lacks all of this. The biggest trump card of the film is, of course, the beautiful appearance of a blond actress Terry Burland. She looks like a caver just as I look like Mother Teresa, but she certainly looks good in her tight white top and beige trousers.
