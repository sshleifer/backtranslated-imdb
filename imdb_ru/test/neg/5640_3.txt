No wonder it was free with “Mail on Sunday”, slow motion, bad play and shooting (camera flash, almost the beginning of the film, not even artistic) = Directly to the video, but not in this case, why not pay back some of your (film production cost), releasing it for free with the British Sunday newspaper, at least in this way, you get a captive audience and reimburse some expenses. <br /> <br /> I didn’t give this film 1 out of 10 because of the effort to get some old actors out of their shell, it was nice to see some old faces (Vanessa Redgrave, this is not a blast), but Vinnie Jones as the leader, and I think he was better off in 60 seconds when he did not speak. <br /> <br /> This film falls in ratings every day, I think it will find its true rating of 3-4 out of 10 in the very near future
