This film was not so bad as the story was going, but working with the camera is what prevents you from watching. I just don’t like the so-called “realistic” camera work that is currently underway; You know how to jump from the center, pan, etc. What is especially annoying for me in this film is the new thing that they added to the mix by shooting a few frames in black and white in each scene. I think the film would be much better if the camera were shot in a much more usual way, because I couldn’t focus on it and instead found myself analyzing the camera’s performance. Perhaps, if more people express dissatisfaction with camera work, like this, filmmakers will finally get the hint.
