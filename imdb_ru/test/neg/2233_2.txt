At least with this episode. Here we have a time traveler, a professor from Gilligan Island, no less, returning in time in 1865. What to do - why try to save Lincoln, of course! There are no really interesting variations on this old topic. As another reviewer stated, this episode is particularly boring and not stylish, and there is little to say that the “professor” actually returned in the 1860s. Budget constraints are readily apparent, and the direction is solid. John Wilkes Booth adds a spark, but it remains a very flat production. We too often feel onstage, waiting for something clever. At the end there is a slight twist, but I emphasize a minor one.
