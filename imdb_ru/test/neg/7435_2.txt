LTL is a typical, hopeless comedy that appeals to sheep who stop and listen when they encounter a band playing in a mall. <br /> <br /> I remember how Murray advertised LTL on the lousy Larry King Shaw of CNN, where he said something like "if this film doesn’t become a hit, I’ll stop making films (or comedies)." He was not as merry as one might think; he must have felt that LTL was an unmistakable blow and that his failure would mean that his star status had fallen markedly - hence a kind of ultimatum live to his fans to spend his hard-earned money on the blunt elephant comedy. (Comedy is stupid, not an elephant ...) Or, maybe, he just realized during the shooting (or when he saw the final episode) what kind of turkey it was, so he desperately tried to convince everyone how optimistic LTL is about quality. "Go see, this is really good!" Actors are prostitutes associated with car dealers. <br /> <br /> LTL is a kind of lousy project created in the school of the comedy Friends; their motto: “If you ever run out of ideas - or if you don’t have them at all - then drive the animal into the plot, and this at least adds an element of attraction.” Wit = sad replacement for the lack of funny jokes. Another motto “Friends” sounded like this: “always include senseless, boring sentimentality”, than this film ends so predictably when Murray says rather pathetically: “What they forgot to tell you is that you will never forget the elephant ". Maybe not an elephant, but I, of course, managed to easily forget this turkey, which I saw many years ago. I was suddenly reminded of this when I saw a scene from this story on TV today (hence this equally meaningless review). <br /> <br /> Murray spends his talent on this turkey (disguised as an elephant), but he’s not nearly as uninteresting / bad as McConaughey (or, nevertheless, the name of this person is written); one might think that MM it would have been easy to play himself, that is to say dick, but he is so painfully unfriendly and unconvincing that I could barely stand and watch how he makes himself such a donkey. It was terrible. To complete this nonsense, we have this generation X jester, Garofalo, in a rather useless role. On the other hand, everything about LTL is useless ... <br /> <br /> After LTL, which, as far as I know, bombed, Murray became a more "serious actor." What is it with these comedians and their inferiority complex? It's all about receiving awards, that is, "recognition from their peers" (read: voices from their moronic colleagues)? This piece of shit put an end to a number of good and wonderful films made by Murray in the early and mid-90s, such as "Groundhog Day", "Quick Shift", "Mad Dog and Glory", "Hairpin", "What about Bob ? and "Ed Wood". We recently had immeasurable pleasure in seeing him in the trash / mediocrity, such as Hamlet, Lost Translation (you just can't get away from these “ultra-talented Coppol”) and Broken Flowers. Compare these two batches. <br /> <br /> One guy called LTL "funny, damn it." Now this is the audience that this film was hoping for ... Shopping centers and trailer parks ...
