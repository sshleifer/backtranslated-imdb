I was looking forward to the appearance of two bright young actors in Dear John, but that was very slow; and I felt that both the script and the direction hampered the flexibility of the main actors. I usually like the screen versions of these novels. Ironically, I really thought that the film did an excellent job of portraying realistic military action. <br /> <br /> Cinema was very well versed in love letters, paying enough attention to the keyword or phrase in each letter. I felt that Channing Tatum was stuck in what had become very “tenacious” expressions in response to the loss.
