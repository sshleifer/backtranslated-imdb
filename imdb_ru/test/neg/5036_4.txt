The brief existence of The Sex Pistols and the making of this film after the controversial, groundbreaking breakup of the English punk band happened before I was born. However, I started listening to their only album "Never Mind the B * &% @ # & s, here are the sex guns", in 2003, when I was a teenager, and quickly became a big fan. I did not see the “Great Rock and Roll Scam” until 2006, but I saw it a couple of times this year and thought it was pretty good (certainly not great, but pretty good), even if I could only remember the bits about it, and did not see how all this is connected. Seeing this for the third time, almost three years after the second, I didn’t care. I'm not even sure that I found so much good in the first place (I don't remember now). <br /> <br /> This film is an image in which the manager of the Sex Pistols, Malcolm McLaren, tells his side of the story of the band and its members; guitarist Steve Jones, who is called here "The Crook"; drummer Paul Cook, known as "The Teapot"; bassist Sid Vixius, called "The Gimmick"; and John Lydon (known as Johnny Rotten) is credited as "Employee." McLaren claims he created the band (and even the punk rock genre) as a scam to make money. He tells most of the story of Helen Wellington-Lloyd (a.k.a. Helen of Troy), in different places where they come together. This is basically a jumble of McLaren talk, Pistols songs, live band performances, fictional scenes (often stupid, weird), several animated episodes, etc., assembled in one movie to tell the Pistols side of the story in a strange way! <br /> <br /> It is well proven that McLaren is a liar, I know that many have already pointed this out, including the band members themselves. He was NOT the band’s driving force, he didn’t create them (nor did he invent punk rock, and The Sex Pistols were not even the first punk band, although they were unique). The members of the group were the ones who made the group what it was. “Dirt and Rage”, a much more believable film about the group of Julien Temple who made this film, is told from the point of view of the group members who contradict the statements of McLaren. However, the "Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle" dishonesty is not the biggest problem with this. If it was really interesting (which I used to think that it was to a certain extent), I could lose sight of this, as I obviously used to do. During my third viewing, besides the Sex Pistols songs, some live performances and at least one slightly amusing animated series, it was pretty boring! At first, the song "Who Killed Bambi" seemed a little funny to me, but she was very tired. <br /> <br /> Is it worth watching this video for Sex Pistols fans? It seems that many fans will say that not to learn the true story of the short, but revolutionary punk band of the 70s, but for entertainment. Once upon a time it was my opinion about the "Great Rock and Roll-style fraud." After seeing it for the first time, I couldn’t remember what McLaren said, and by the time I saw it the second time, I realized that the Pistol’s manager was using this film, but I could hardly remember that I heard him say! Obviously, other aspects of the film were what I found impressive. Now, after the third viewing, I can definitely remember some things that McLaren says, but it was still not 100% clear. Like most of the film, I think his words are not so memorable, probably because of how they are presented. If you're a Pistols fan, I think it would be a good idea to try Fraud, but for me, for the most part, it's just an incoherent, boring mess that tries to be funny, but fails.
