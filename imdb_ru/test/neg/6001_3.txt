I usually love Jackie Chan movies, but this one was terrible. There are only 2 or 3 battle scenes, each of which meets the normal standard more or less. The bad thing about this movie is that it pays a lot of attention to racing / racing cars. The pursuit of a car is not so bad (although not as exciting as a fight), but the races in cars at the end are extremely boring. In fact, he takes everything that makes a Jackie Chan movie with a Jackie Chan movie, and leaves everything except Jackie Chan. Even traditional outlets in the end do not have their usual humor. <br /> <br /> I believe that to some extent this was aggravated by the fact that I saw one of these terrible duplicate versions. I usually try to see the version with subtitles ... I wish I could understand Chinese. <br /> <br /> I only saw one Jackie movie, worse than that, and it was one of his early Hollywood film forays that didnâ€™t work so well. <br /> <br /> Avoid if you are really curious or a lover of motorsport.
