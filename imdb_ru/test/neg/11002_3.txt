Fanglys is located in a small Texan town called Leighton on the eve of Halloween, as citizens treat it like the second coming of Christ or something, I mean that Halloween is not so important, is it? One way or another, Sheriff Pete (Burton Gilliam) was called in for another murder, since local boy Ned (co-author producer John William Galt) found the body in local forests. Could it be Lady Fang (Justin Hamilton)? The main character involved in the local legend of a witch who kills teens, who knows? Being a funny guy, he Mark (permanent director and producer Robert Harvey) convinces his Mrs. Kelly (Laurie Reeves) to go to the cemetery, which his partner Stephen (Josh Gobin) found the night before at the Halloween party. The idea of ​​spending the night in a cemetery in the middle of the forest obviously likes Kelly, and she agrees, along with Stephen and his girlfriend Camilla (Natalie Woods) and their boring friend Jerry (Tim Boswell), whom they arrange. overnight fun, as well as as much fun as you can expect in an isolated graveyard. However, they soon discover that the legend of Lady Fang is far from what many people say before going to bed ... <br /> <br /> Edited, executive producer, author and director Christopher Abram. Fanglys is a rather stupid horror movie attempt. The scenario is very predictable, boring and does not deliver any entertainment value, in the right hands and with a decent budget. Fanglys might be an effective horror movie, but be that as it may. It moves at a fair pace, but the “action” on the screen is so poor that it doesn’t matter, I don’t know what else to say, except that “Fanglys” is a really bad movie, and I don’t see anyone who gets what any pleasure from it. The dialogue is basic, characters are cliché and lifeless, while on the whole the film seems much longer than 90 minutes. There are several unsuccessful attempts at humor that are not very well combined with elements of horror and what did this retard keep in this cage? I guess the budget did not allow the filmmakers to show it. Oh, if you want to know what is happening with Jerry at the end, then you also have to watch the end credits until the lame truth opens, if, of course, you can do it so far (believe me, this requires some). <br /> <br /> Directed by Abram does nothing special. Abram thinks swimming in neon light is stylish, I can tell him that it is not when your film should be set up in the forest. There is no atmosphere, panic, tension, excitement or any elements that make a good horror movie good. Forget about decent blood, there is little when someone eats some skin from the hand, and the forks stick out through someone's throat. <br /> <br /> Apparently, The Fanglys had a budget for shooting in the amount of $ 2,837, which makes it one of the most budget films ever to have a commercial release, and, frankly, it shows. How about a backward guy and his false jokes that look ridiculous? The terrible special effects, the cinematography of the camcorder and the terrible actions of all the participants that make it even more painful to sit. <br /> <br /> Fanglys is shit, straight to the video, it has no ransom functions. Whatever it is, and this is a low IMDb user rating, this is justifiably, this is one of those films that I spent half an hour looked at his watch and wanted it to end.
