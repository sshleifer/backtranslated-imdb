I do not agree with the fact that this film is a stoner because there is weed. I can not imagine that it even comes close to the “stoner classics.” It would be like to call Singles a “grunge film”. The film definitely stretches along with the dark plot. At times, I wondered if the script was either dropped, or mixed, or they lost it entirely and just tried to use it. Watching this movie reminded me of how children play an acting game and make up a story as they go along. <br /> <br /> Wooden characters, dialogue taxed, and the whole story seems completely disconnected. Who was killed? When? What kind? And how do you act when your friend overdoses? Total absence of emotions and complete disconnection from reality. <br /> <br /> As for the guitar soundtrack for the guitar that accompanies each scene: that's enough! It was like watching the opening menu screen, where the same track endlessly loops in the background, moving neither forward nor backward. <br /> <br /> I continued to observe and hoped that the plot would somehow fall, the order of the dialogue would improve, or something that would somehow focus this confusion in a sequential film. After 112 minutes this did not happen.
