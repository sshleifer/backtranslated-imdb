Although the embryo could be a potentially thought-provoking study of bioethics, it degenerates into a stereotypical parable about Frankenstein, skipping the already monotonous lesson that there are some areas that people should not have entered or studied. <br /> <br /> Scientist Rock Hudson is experimenting with ways to prevent the death of extinct children. After success with the dog, he immediately goes to people who violate medical ethics and any sense of believability, with the same unrealistic help from the hospital administrator. His experiment works too well, with some obviously unpleasant side effects. <br /> <br /> Although Barbara Carrera is good enough in her role, and some animal training is impressive, the film suffers from being too fantastic. Despite the fact that the message in the prologue convinces viewers that this is a modern technology, the depicted scientific work seems far from appropriate even in the twenty-first century, not to mention the mid-1970s. In addition, the scene where Carrera can find a cure for the side effects of bioengineering by simply typing a question into a computer is ridiculous.
