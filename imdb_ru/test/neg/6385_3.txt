Well ... the horror is not true, but ....... !!! ??? Awful low-budget subcompact film of the worst kind, a kind of AND ... so pretty charming and fun to watch ... at least on my TV !!! A cross between Pete Walker, Gershella Gordon Lewis and ... let's say ... hell, I give up ... I just can't think of any "prettier" similarities for this crappy movie. It's all so wrong that I just have to include it in my movie collection along with ... Death In Venice ..... Nekromantik ..... Blue Velvet and The Good, Bad, Ugly ... right !! ?? People with little talent to add bloody inserts to the film or sexual events that they buy from other people should immediately raise this film ... of course, there is a fatty gold vein waiting for them, oooooooooooh !!!!!
