Jeff Morrow - Leslie Gaskell, Barbara Lawrence - Vera Hunter, and John Emory - Hubbel Eliot. Along with some auxiliary staff of the Air Force and a comic fan, they are responsible for the top-secret underground laboratory on the West Coast. Morrow is delighted when he discovers a meteor passing through the atmosphere, but is confused when a meteor decides to plunge into the Pacific Ocean and becomes a fantastic machine on the Mexican coast. <br /> <br /> Nobody knows what this colossal block structure is. Obviously, this is some kind of dense artifact, because it consists of right angles with a bald sphere half visible from above. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the machine, called Kronos, from afar Planet was sent here to rob the Earth of energy. You see, here on Earth, we learned how to convert matter into energy, but on planet Kronos they figured out the other half of the equation — how to convert energy into matter. And now they are running out of energy on another planet. Are you making notes about this? Good. <br /> <br /> Perhaps you can tell me about some of the scientific issues raised by Kronos’s mission. For example, if Kronos builders can convert energy into matter and vice versa, why not just convert some of their spare matter into energy instead of sending complex machines to Earth to turn off the lights of Los Angeles? But it is doubtful that the authors could explain this. A change in the polarity of two antennas is described as an “anthropic transformation,” which means a “change toward the person”, which does not make sense. But it does not seem like any science makes sense in this regard. The chart that Morrow draws on the board has a current going in the wrong direction, from positive to negative. <br /> <br /> There is a problem with the movement of Kronos. He runs along the coast, threatening "settlements" (read "Southern California"), but he has no joints on two or three legs. These stumps just beat slowly up and down, crushing some people. The film does not make a lot of these crushed people. They are shown as Mexican peasants, so maybe they don’t count on too much. The USAF is also dropping a hydrogen bomb on Kronos while you are in Mexico. No one raises an eyebrow. <br /> <br /> A lot of acting skills are not required and little is given. Jeff Morrow has a clear and resonant voice, great for radio or television voice-over. His face is less expressive. He has only one expression, regardless of the situation - a tough smile, as if being photographed during a Universal Studios tour. Barbara Lawrence had a beautiful, golden quality when she made "Street without a Name" a few years earlier. She was the slim seventeen-year-old wife of Richard Widmark. Here her care and behavior reduce her to the level of a B-film actress, although she is still beautiful. It's always nice to see Morris Ankrum in one of these films. He did so much that I confused them. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid the movie looks flat overall. (Although there are some good pictures of the B-47 in flight.) The kits show a low-budget venture. This is not necessarily bad in itself, but there is nothing to compensate for the fruitless settings. There is a slight tension in the script, the lack of a director's show and little effort spent on execution. <br /> <br /> You can get pleasure from it - relaxed maximum - because it is obviously not difficult. Simply, there are so many of the best films of this genre.
