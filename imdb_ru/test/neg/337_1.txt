This film was terrible, simple and clear! Animation scenes had absolutely terrible graphics. It was VERY clear that this film was about the budget for my grocery bill !! The action was just as bad .. I saw better acting in pornographic films. I would very much like the hour and twenty minutes of my life to return. In fact, I signed up for IMDb only so that other people would not look at it the way I did. Don't get me wrong, I love science fiction movies! It was more like an introduction to a video game :( I'm glad I spent only one dollar to see it! wouldn't even let this game in the background of my house while I was cleaning! The result is here, you can do better.
