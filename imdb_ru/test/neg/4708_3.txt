I know ... I know: it is difficult (if not paradoxical) for such a thing as a "believable" fantasy to exist. But, for me, there is also such a condition when TOO Improbability interferes or distracts from my general opinion about the film. The last case was for me in regards to Goliath. I not only had too many unanswered questions about the storyline, but also some acting games, it seemed to me, were too overwhelming. (Perhaps, however, it was a letter: asking them to read too many banal, predictable, stamped (excessive?) Reactions.) Others talked enough about the conspiracy. I just want it to be done - and, I think it CAN be - more convincing. P. S .: This is a FRESH commentary on this film - I just finished watching it a few minutes ago; not a memory from years ago.
