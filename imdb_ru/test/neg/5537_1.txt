How in the name of decency has this movie ever been made? <br /> <br /> It can be assumed that the subtitles simply say “terrible” on every frame of this truly grim effort. <br /> <br /> A terrible game, a terrible dialogue and lack of talent for everyone involved in this nightmare makes for an agonizing 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall impression? <br /> <br /> A group of excited drama students got lucky with a lottery grant, and it became one of the most painful films ever made. <br /> <br /> This makes Hammer Horror series look like Oscar material. <br /> <br /> And never for a second think that it falls into the category of "so bad, it's good." It's not even that bad. <br /> <br /> But the lighting scene probably deserves a different look.
