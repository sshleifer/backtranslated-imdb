Alien abductors of bodies in the desert. Small blue stones that look like they are made from cheap plastic. The general storyline is not bad if you like these things, but acting is so far from poverty that it surprises me that some of them really entertained me in The X-Files And special effects? Hello?! Where did they get their high school FX team from? I mean, come on; they could have done so much more! It was amateur and extremely simple. I didnâ€™t really like it (and my dad fell asleep during this!) And, of course, our hero falls in love with the leading lady! It is so typical and very predictable. Bleugh !!!!!
