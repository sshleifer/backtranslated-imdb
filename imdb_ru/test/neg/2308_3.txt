I remember when "The Machine of Love" was first released in theaters. I was only 13 years old, I was too young to see the awesome film, but not too old to bring my paperback book by Jacqueline Suzanne to school and look at the "pranks" with my classmates. " br /> <br /> Although I am not sure what my problem was at such an early age, I was very interested in this book. I bought and wore an ankh ring, as on a paperback cover, and I remember an advertisement for the perfume Xanadu, which was crisscrossed and awkwardly shown in the film. Despite such interest, I actually did not see the film until a few years later. I had to leave it at that. <br /> <br /> “The Machine of Love” is the worst of many bad films adapted from Suzanne’s novels ... which, of course, makes it the most fun to watch. It has many drawbacks: from the Hopstock script, which jumps from one incident to another without a connecting thread; it is outdated horny (copper instruments, I mean) music by Ersatz Baharah; apartment, first of all performances; boring sexuality - I've never seen bath robes featured in a movie before. It's like a fetish! Whenever you need sex, nudity, or something messy, someone appears in a blue robe! It is very strange that; and, of course, the circus train of the terrible fashion of the 70s, which is on endless exposure. Diane Cannon's bad work (which, in any case, is not so great, but over the other actors) is constantly decreasing due to the tremendous ups that she is meant to wear. However, the main duty of the film is the stoic, stone-like John Philip Lowe, as (quite enough) Robin Stone, the object of affection of each girl (and one of the most prominent male photographers). <br /> <br /> The law is simply terrible and acts as if it had been dragged from the street, the pages of the script were urgently handed over and ordered to be given cold reading on the spot. Just lifeless! Not only that, but he seems to be in desperate need of a blood transfusion or something. He looks pale and painful everywhere and a few pounds less than most of his female colleagues. Robin Stone should be handsome, not a handkerchief. <br /> <br /> For anyone who considers the film to be hardworking (by modern standards, it is rather slow), I ask you to stay on the piquant “battle scene”. Here, Mrs. Cannon (balancing 23 pounds of cropped hair) finally gives up her former tormenting acting style and lets out this infectiously raucous laugh, setting in motion a truly unforgettable gift for all who should have become the highlight of the film. Trying to compete with the infamous “Dolls Valley” scene, “The Machine of Love” is finally doing something right. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Suzanne’s unique trash bore is very bored Perhaps someone there owns the rights to Rona Barrett's Lovomaniacs and will revive the genre.
