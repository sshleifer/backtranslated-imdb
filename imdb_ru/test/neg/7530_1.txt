I do not want to seem pretentious here, but to call it another iconic classic is another example of the reduction of standards that directors have for themselves. This film is an insult to everything that we consider sacred, and is not a good “fanciful” way of insulting. This film becomes an archetype for a painful dialogue created by even more pathetic actors.
