If you value your life in any way, in any form or form, you are courtesy and skip this seemingly “interesting” film on the DVD rack. <br /> <br /> I know what you're thinking, "I saw the preview, and it looked GREAT!" However, the buyer is wary, I fell into the same trap. One of my friends expressed a certain reluctance to watch this film, but I made her sit down. Oh, how I regret this decision. <br /> <br /> Like most horror films, the film begins with fun at the sunny Mexican resort, where two couples lure him into the ancient Mayan ruins. Upon arrival, they are concerned about the appearance of two people from the jungle, who almost do not notice their greetings. As if this is not ominous enough, the tourist group discards a large growth of plants and declares an unused path that wildlife takes as an ideal route to their destination. I think it would not be a great film if they used rational decision making and turned around just then, but, well, it wasn’t a lot of film anyway. <br /> <br /> After some trekking, the six (the resort visitor led a friend) stumbles upon the ruins, and their doubts are dispelled by beauty and history. That is, until insane tribal people appear in the jungle, armed with revenge for no particular reason, shouting an incomprehensible language. Because when violent verbal abuse is softened by a calm, patronizing language - don't ask me - but, nevertheless, the actors still try, but to no avail. Suddenly, the sixth participant of the trail, Dimitri, was pierced by several arrows from Maya, and all hell broke loose. Firearms finish their work, and frightened travelers quickly retreat up the ruins. <br /> <br /> Now, if ever there was a conspiracy to this film, it ended here. The introduction took no more than 20 minutes, and unfortunately it was the best 20 minutes of the film. In addition to the ruins, the Five are now aware that they are stranded by the murderous local residents and are embarking on making countless good decisions, one of which is the use of a faded rope to lower one of its members into the depths of the ruins. Needless to say, the adventurer is seriously injured and then trapped in the ruins, and two girlfriends are seriously injured trying to save him. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film continues without conspiracy, without real horror, only blood and blood, as shown when one girl jerks a plant growing inside her, spewing blood streams, and then again when someone his legs are cut off, only that the same platform from inside the girl strangles him later. <br /> <My only satisfaction in this film is to watch the very attractive Jonathon Tucker, who plays Jeff McIntyre, become increasingly exhausted and upset and sit long enough to make sure that almost the entire cast dies a horrible, horrible death. Their simulated pain seems to be adequate compensation for the time that was in this film. <br /> <br /> Presumably, the storyline says that the ruin is an ancient home of dangerous spirits with an evil, flesh-eating plant to ward off it. and consume unhappy visitors. Unfortunately, I have not received such a warning from the screaming bloodthirsty plants, and the only evil associated with this film, which I really terrify, is the screenwriter.
