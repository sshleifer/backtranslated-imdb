Remember those old Kung Fu movies that we watched late on Friday and Saturday, when our nannies DID THOUGH we answer? Well, this movie plays just like one of those movies. Patsy Kensit's greatest claim to fame was the love interest of Mel Gibson's character in “Deadly Weapon 2”, and this view was one of the reasons she never succeeded: she’s a terrible actress. <br /> <br /> In Lethal Weapon 2, she thought. Pretty enough to watch some of the other films she has been in, including Likes Music, Likes to Dance, another big disappointment that obviously didn't impress me either. But, no matter how attractive she is to me, my soul screamed for me to turn it off, because it played another cheap, predictable role and did it very badly. <br /> <br /> In this film, Kensit plays the main role comedienne actress (and not very good), who works in French clubs (she could not cut herself in her native land, so they have bleeding ears) who were not lucky, but what is worse, the French government wants to expel her because of an expired visa (or maybe they just caught her act). But she marries this to Casanova (Freiss), who is also unlucky, and predictability begins ... terrible! Is there a way to give this movie a negative rating? 1 out of 10 stars above rating!
