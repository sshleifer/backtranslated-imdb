This is absolutely the worst show in the history of Nickelodeon. First of all, none of the boarding schools have a sushi bar, flat-screen TVs, and each student is provided with a laptop. It makes the show so unreal and boring. Plots are meaningless and incredibly boring. The actors are so bad that I want to commit suicide. I really hate the fact that in the series Zoe is the most popular girl in school, the most beautiful and intelligent, she gets the best marks without doing any work. She never had any real problems, and every guy wants to date her. She is so perfect. There is no such. In addition, I hate that everyone will do something for her, and everyone chooses her for each team or club. It is so annoying. Quinn is so nasty. Her experiments are miserable, meaningless and false. Chase is so weak. He says he loves Zoe, but if he tells her, it will destroy their friendship. What a pity. Michael tries to be funny, but he never achieves anything. Nicole is so funny and screams a lot. She never saw any work or study, but she is an excellent student. Lola thinks she is an actress, but she sucks (sorry for my tongue). Do I need to say more? I think no. For your own good, stay away from this show at all costs.
