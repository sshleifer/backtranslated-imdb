Perhaps, if only to laugh at how my favorite works of Jane Austen were portrayed. I may be too serious in this adaptation, but I am afraid that I am inclined to version A & E. I can hardly imagine how Mr. Darcy is portrayed by someone other than Colin Firth. <br /> <br /> Characters seemed superficial, and dialogues were often imposed. It seemed that Lizzy did not have a real feeling, which is so obvious in the book. Her passion for Wickham was exaggerated, and then her sudden love for Darcy was implausible. <br /> <br /> Darcy was portrayed tolerably well, I let him. He managed to maintain the alienation that was required, but I felt that he was not projecting the feeling and inner struggle that made his character so delightful, especially in the scene of the sentence. <br /> <br /> Mr. and Mrs. Bennet also played well, but seemed to be missing in many ways. The sneaky character of Mrs. Bennet was not completely captured by her work. <br /> <br /> Mr Collins was a good image. Very fit book. <br /> <br /> I will refrain from commenting on Lady Catherine, except that I would say that she may be the worst image in the entire film. <br /> <br /> Other problems I encountered we saw a few freedoms that they took with the order of events, such as Darcy, who was present at the first meeting with Lady S., and that Miss Lucas and Sir William did not join Lizzy during her visit to Collins. ‚Äù <br /> <br /> The choreography was terrible during dance scenes. The scene in which Lizzy and Darcy's dance loses its intensity because it is impossible to overcome the feeling that they look awkward in a ballroom. At the very least, this version of the BBC did not take into account the dialogue between Lizzy, Darcy and Sir William when he complimented the two on their dance, as they were really very bad. <br /> <br /> There were random moments that aroused my interest, but overall, I find this version a disappointment. I would not advise this film if you are not like me and you are overly distracted by such nonsense. <br /> <br />
