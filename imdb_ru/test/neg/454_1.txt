Beginning with the weeks and weeks of promoting this, ABC "The One" was supposed to be the "Real World" and meet with the "American Idol". We had to watch these singers perform, compete and see how they lived together in the house. Drama! Tension! <br /> <br /> How to start this crime? Let's start with the “judges” who were known as “Music Experts” in this program. “Experts” means they have experience. Andre Harrell, at least, had a pedigree. For a while he was in charge of Motown Records. Two others ... oh. Uncle Kate Hudson, who could be called Mr. Strange Beard. He dyed his hair in three different colors. I wonder how scared he would be with a black light! And Paula Abdul, an imitator who did something that I didn’t think, could have happened: she was even more pompous and reserved than Paula! Then she turned over and began to sharply criticize after the first episode. The farce "critics" proposed by these three were a real joke and an insult not only for the process of finding the best singer, but also for the audience, which is now fairly savvy, having done this many times on Fox. /> <br /> There was a master there. George Strumbulopoulos was not Ryan Seacrest. In fact, he was as dim as possible. He actually sucked the little energy that was on the program, dry. The way he got this job was the second biggest mystery of the show. <br /> <br /> First, how did they select 11 competitors for this program? It was literally a worthless talent show. OK. Perhaps this is an exaggeration. And, of course, performers should be relatively close in their abilities, because if they were not, there would be no “competition”. If only one person were “good,” there would be no “waiting.” So, I understand that they should all be comparable. But they all had to have * some * chops! In addition, the judges led the "Academy of singing", so the program was part of the "Glory". Obviously, these performers desperately needed these lessons. But you need very talented people to teach talented people with little talent. And this is definitely not what happened here. <br /> <br /> It seemed that during the filming of the show, priority was given to the elements of "home life", since all the players were very attractive as equals. parts to how bad they are voiced. But the captured fragments in their house were so chopped and sliced ​​that you could not get into the stories that were starting to happen, so the show also did not reflect the events there. <br /> <br /> As Poorly Designed, as it was, the “One” had an incredible, unbelievable, fatal design flaw embedded in the results that made it completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Viewers called in a vote for someone they liked more. Just like on "AI". But then, after an audience vote was announced, the three lower participants were forced to sing the final song. The “music experts” based on this performance chose one person out of three to save for the next week. And then, participants who were safe gained the right to vote for those they would like to keep from the remaining two, sending the remaining participant home. <br /> <br /> The “design flaw” was that the participants had a final opinion. I mean, if you participated in a music contest and would like to move along a path in which you could, would you vote for SAVING the best singer or would you try to get rid of your toughest competitor? Any spectator of the first season of CBS "Survivor" can answer this question! And this is exactly what happened in the program. The person who had the best potential was lost, and the participants voted for “that”, who did not have talent at all! In addition, the participant who was just saved by the “experts” was also allowed to vote against the remaining two! It was a complete farce! <br /> <br /> Perhaps if they let participants vote first, at least the “experts” will save the best of two evils to finish. But this only confirms how unprepared the show was for the broadcast, how unsatisfactory the whole process was for watching and how wrong the producers tried to do it.
