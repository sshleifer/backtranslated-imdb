I was told that John had some spiritual experience for a while. I assumed the film would be interesting. In fact, this is not the case. Not much for such a topic. "Eternity" endless life. Experiences after death and deja vu. The film is not comedic, but not funny at all, at least not yet shot. This is so naive. Charming movie, but naive movie. Must be avoided. The sequences of the Middle Ages seem to originate from fairy tales, and this is not at all the case. Eileen Davidson is very sweet, and Voight tries her best. Normal - co-producer and screenwriter of this film. The film was launched directly on the video, so I found it in the video store. This is a pity, because I know well that Voight was seriously connected with spirituality, and the film is not so deep about it.
