In fact, not so bad with Crash of the Moons. Basically these are several episodes of Rocky Jones, Space Ranger merged into a movie. It is extremely outdated, however. Winky Vienna treatment is a good example of this. It should be remembered that it was intended to be shown to children in the 1950s. In this regard, it is possible. If you like the 1950s children's fiction, take a look at it. You will see John Banner at the beginning of the sergeant. The role of Schulz. He copes well with this. In general, I would give 6 out of 10. Not very, but not bad.
