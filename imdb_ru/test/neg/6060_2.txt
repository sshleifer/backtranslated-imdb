I thought there might be some level of value in this film, and I coped with it. Summarizing, we can say that I still have a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> The film began normally, I think that Gerk’s original characterization was true to the myths. And in childhood, and in his youth, he started quite hard, but not with the brightest light bulb. But later he somehow turns into a charismatic speaker, beloved by all. BUT? <br /> <br /> Another problem: terrible CGI. The satyr looked good, but the rest of the creatures looked awful, especially the Hart, the most ghostly beast in the film. And why was Lily Sobeski's skin sometimes golden, sometimes normal? The worst part for me - and everyone should cringe - is the twelve feats of Hercules. Because the producers obviously did not want to cover them all; perhaps they thought that we, primitive thugs, watching how this garbage cannot count so highly. Instead of twelve feats of Hercules, we got FIVE feats of Hercules. Yes, five works! WTF?!? He didn’t even finish the last one, so it’s really 4 and a half jobs! Just awful. I'll take “Hercules: Legendary Journeys” for this piece of shit any day of the week.
