Scary direction from the horrible script. Even the DVD looked dirty and out of focus. Ludicrous accents throughout the map. Unlike most other commentators, I had no idea that these were boys in love in the mud, but this fact was immediately apparent from the opening scene and from all the lovingly stretched shots of naked or scarce young people, usually wet or glistening from sweat, looking longingly at each other.
