European films may develop more slowly and less in plot than American ones, but this goes too far. It also shows a whole bunch of incompletely drawn characters doing unexplainable things. This is not a fantasy, it is not even surrealistic, it is just awkward and bad. <br /> <br /> What's the message here? That people in France are thoughtful and gloomily watching a lot? What do they like to see how other people have sex? Do they spontaneously shout or touch a stranger around their neck? Do not wear watches when watching this movie, as you will be surprised at how little they explain or find out over huge periods of time. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a “police chief,” who is deeply concerned about the brutal murder of a little girl, although in fact he seems to be worried before. He is not just upset by his personal tragedies, but, apparently, mentally retarded, behaves very much like a six-year-old child with learning disabilities. He looks blankly, walks with hard hands, like a small child, speaks meekly, simplistic, tones, behaves rather strangely in all of his interactions (although it seems that no one notices or cares even if it should be a matter of police)). He is not a troubled policeman, rather an ambulatory. Imagine the character Andy Kaufman "Latka" on "Taxi", but without humor. Not only is he not believable as a policeman, he is not believable as an adult. The fact that he received an award for this interpretation of his character is truly amazing - if only he did not play the role exactly as it is written, and the fault lies with the eccentrics who wrote this thing. The plot is clearly secondary. Do not expect to see anything remotely, for example, what the police would do if a little girl was found dead. This is not so important, although the improbability of their behavior is offensive. The problem is that the rest of the film also does not make sense. This leaves long long drawn-out close-ups of fields, gardens, people’s faces, etc. The end seemed to me particularly funny - completely unsupported by the events that led to it - unless you think: “What worst way could this movie have made?” end? "<br /> <br /> There is a lot of sex and nudity, which should mean something. Do you want a vagina? You will see a vagina. Don't worry, this is art. It has a deep meaning, which I am not sure about. And the main character , despite its innocent oddity, it seems to have some kind of homeotic neck or jaw fetish. <br /> <br /> Finally, the subtitles are white and often appear on a white background - it’s very difficult to read for many of them. On the other hand, there’s not a lot of dialogue, so this is not a big problem. Also, there’s very little sound in the film - not even the ambient sounds that you expect to hear - which contributes to the emptiness of the whole experience. Old Woody Allen would have had a field day parodying this work. <br /> <br /> This award-winning film is sad. I would not like to see the films playing. <br /> < br /> Enjoy.
