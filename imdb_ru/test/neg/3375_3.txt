Yes, in this film you are seen by several small snowmen in the attack, apparently in a very warm climate, so yes, this film definitely cannot be taken seriously. This film is actually much worse than the original, because, at least with the whole film, the entire production looked more expensive than a couple of dollars and a video camera. He has his funny moments, but actually playing on the cheapness of your film and making it your intended laugh is a kind of weak film if you ask me. You can't come up with a good story, your effects will be really bad, hey, let's just make the movie look as bad as possible with horrible movies, and we have our movie. The first one, at least, had a somewhat plausible story, since the snowman attacked him in the winter, and not the resort. It also had better effects, one or two steps ahead of the Hobgoblin, as far as monsters are concerned, and you really want to be more than a step two over a bunch of marionettes. Nevertheless, all this is compensated by the super-finale, which depicts a great sea ship, carried away by a powerful frost. In fact, I'm just joking, but in fact it was the funniest part of the movie.
