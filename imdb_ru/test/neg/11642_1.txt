If you like bad movies to entertain witnesses to bad movies, bad games, bad performances, etc. As in Mystery Science Theater 3000, you will love Pacific Inferno. Jim Brown will be forever remembered as one of the greatest footballers who ever played the game ... as an actor, he will be forever remembered as one of the greatest footballers who ever played the game ... I'm not sure who Rolf Bayer was. .. but I hope that he was 15 or 16 years old when he was in charge of it, perhaps he could have been the next Spielberg in the making ... because if he were a grown man directing it ... 15 or 16 -year-old could have achieved more ... The basis or plot of the film may have had historical value and, perhaps, d even truly accurate ... but this film may be one of the worst films shot in the history of American cinema ... I kept waiting for Lee Marvin, William Holden or Charles Bronson to somehow save any "face" left from the movie. I would really like to attend the opening ceremony of Hollywood on the red carpet, in a black tie, when this film was previewed ... because there were many viewers in this film who laughed and caressed his breath ... it is on DVD for ten cents. shelving now .... look for it for entertainment value ... this film is so bad it is too good to miss ...
