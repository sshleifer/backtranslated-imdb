I am clearly disappointed, so I will be brief and will not waste your time. First, the plot was boring ... at least. The animation was even worse, we were in 2008 for God's sake, and it looked like a more brilliant version of G.I.Joe. I will not even characterize the actions of actors and dialogues. Or maybe because I just saw that in order to leave a comment here, you need 10 lines (?! ??!?!). Where we were? Oh, yes, the presentation, well, it was completely flat, lacked passion and talent, if I apologize. Now about the dialogues, as an actor's game, no memorable quotes, nothing that no one would expect. Let's hope the movie will be worthy ... at least.
