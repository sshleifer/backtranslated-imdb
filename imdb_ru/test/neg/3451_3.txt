I managed to see it on what I consider to be the second in the world, a few days after its opening at the Dublin International Film Festival. When I visited another film two days later in the same theater, I saw Brendan Gleason, Paul Mercier, and the rest of the cast and crew on another Stud ad show. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was bitterly disappointed with the film, I did not in any way expect a masterpiece, but in what was presented to me, I lacked all the most important elements of the genre in which he had set himself. Before I continue, two things, I accept that some directors like to undermine common expectations, this is simply not the case here. Secondly, I know that it is based on a play (which I did not read, but I was informed that this is not flickering literature), but this does not exempt from the mass narrative problems that permeate the film. /> <br /> My main problem with the film is the script. Forget that it is based on the play, because in sports comedy it just does not work, a team of the same players tries to win a football cup, few of the games are shown (when they are, this is very short), and we do not get any satisfaction from - for any of their sporting achievements. After reading so far, you can assume that this is not a strict sports film, but a psychological study of the relationship between the manager's “charlatan” and his hopeless team. This, of course, will not achieve this, I am not even sure that he was striving. Any attempt to shed light on the history of any character is hackneyed and secondary. Overall, I found that in many ways the script is not enough. <br /> <br /> I think the performances and music were good and technically, the film was well made. But besides the moments that should be expected from any Irish film at this stage, I left the theater very disappointed. <br /> <br /> My opinion may seem harsh, but I think that there is hope for a strong national Irish cinema in the near future, and this simply does not reinforce this argument. Since Studs has become the recommended movie “Dublin Film World” (I was part of the audience at this show), most people seem to disagree with me, so this means that you probably should form your own opinion about the film.
