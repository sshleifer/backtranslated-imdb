Simply put, the only saving grace of this film is settings, costumes and a punk concert. How HGR Giger should relate to his cyborg photograph on the cover of this film, I would not want to know. Immediately, all I could do was make sardonic comments about the main characters of the films, I hoped that the “freaks” in this film would perform them in a terrible manner. I feel SPOILERS are coming! I was wondering if this film is in the spirit of the first 20 min. should have been as humorous as everything else? Examining all the obvious political protests (the police are trying to rape a freak, discussing the superficiality between a freak and a frat guy and a punk concert with vocalist) and using time-lapse fights in combat episodes (who shout "martial arts coordinator") I just don't know . A character named “Steve” annoyed me because he was trying to grab people from the street (he needed to be robbed and raped), and he looks bad when he broke this guy’s neck near the end (I want to show you how) ?) I have to say it, although if they had developed other characters better than they did Splatter, it could have gone somewhere. If there were 0 to give this film, it would have received, but, alas, it is 1.
