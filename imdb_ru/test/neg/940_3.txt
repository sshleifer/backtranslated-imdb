I was not so impressed with this film, I found it rather tedious and simple. The storyline was interesting, the child created his own college and wrote down hundreds of children, but there was little laughter and they were far from each other. The jokes weren't really funny, and I didn't break the gut in any of the scenes. The characters were not intriguing, and I did not feel any of them, even the dark, fat guy with glasses, who was trying to join the fraternity group. It was a good first watch, but they did not hit me, and I would not recommend them. To compare it with other films of the same genre, that is, with the American pie, is simply cruel, because there is a film that was ridiculous. This ACCEPTED could not bring a smile!
