A group of environmentalists is sent to the island to uncover a secret laboratory that experiments on animals. When they arrive, they discover that they are late. Obviously, the government made the scientist test his experiment on a komodo, and, as you guessed, a cobra, because of which they became very large. I'm not sure that this film really needed or deserved an explanation, since it is almost identical to Komodo's Curse, which also sucks. Computer effects are just as comical as ever, a chest of drawers roars like a dinosaur that really gets on my nerves. Like Boa vs. Python, this film is not worth watching, and itâ€™s just as interesting to watch as it is to press your hand to the table. Avoid!
