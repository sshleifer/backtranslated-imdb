This film is just awful, the way the talent brought him to this is beyond human faith. I think they must have drunk when they thought about this idea, I feel as if 2 hours of my life have been taken away from me. distance yourself from this trash, it should have been a great crime movie, but it turns into a bloody mess of vampires. I would recommend this movie to people who like to sleep in a movie, you will not miss a thing. For most of them, the dominance of films can lift us up and remind us that life is worth living, this film simply depresses you. As DeNiro said in one film, the saddest thing in life is the lost talent, this film is a great example of this statement.
