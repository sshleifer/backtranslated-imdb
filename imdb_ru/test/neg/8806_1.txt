I can't believe that Isaiah Washington and Ice T were in this mess! The plot (and I use this term very loosely) centers around an army of rats that terrorize an urban residential complex â€” at least I think it was what it was about. The script had no meaning, I could not take care of the characters, and camera work was to repeatedly show the shadow images of rats standing on their hind legs or running around. Running is what I should have done. As an African-American man, I often read the requests of my brothers and sisters for "supporting African-American films." I'm trying to help, but enough is enough. No one should watch the trash like this for any reason. Please, brothers and sisters, no longer create video broadcasts directly to the video. You are welcome!
