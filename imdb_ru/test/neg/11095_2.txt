"The evil spirit captures the girl and spreads panic in the Louvre," that's all I think, a quick review of the film and the film itself! Which I think is one of the worst French or non French films ever made in cinema history! <br /> <br /> There is nothing good here except for music (only for the title!), a few tender moments (Sophie Marceau) and, of course, the final snapshot of the film. to be countless years that we have watched the THAT CRAP, as well as being as perfect as one magic CGI work that was too good to be true here! <br /> <br /> By the way, I want to change the plot summary like this: “The evil spirit captures some filmmakers to create lousy films.” Just like this one.
