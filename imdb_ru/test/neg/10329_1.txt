This film is No. 1 on the list of the worst films I have ever seen, with “Lessons for the Killer” on the spot No. 2. <br /> <br /> The lousy scene was terrible!), The music could have come from the movie with a bad rating, and the story was completely ridiculous. This was in common with the typical fighter: the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of monosyllabic words. But, contrary to the usual action movie, there was no real action. Boring <br /> <br /> The only reason I kept watching this was in the hope that one day there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie ... <br /> <br /> Thumbs down on this one.
