Of course, this film in Eastern Europe is filled with sexuality, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the 8 mm film by Nicolas Cage. The ambassador’s daughter and her fiancée mix it up with a local woman in a threesome that ends with taping. The tape is used for blackmail, and the stakes are getting higher and higher as the couple tries to solve it on their own, rather than turn to the authorities. <br /> <br /> Sex comes and goes - and the only reason for renting is, I suppose, if you like this sort of thing - and completely gratuitous by the middle when we travel along the porno scene in search of "another woman." I definitely question how it got into the Blockbuster, even with the Youth Restricted Sticker sticker, considering how much it is just a hint of the edge of the soft core. (Oh, that's right, this is a double standard. Art-house actual films, such as Dreamers and Y Tu Mama Tambien, get castrated versions of R, but the Straight To DVD crap is thus proudly attached to the UNRATED banner. br /> <br /> The action is terrible, the plot is simply stunningly unoriginal, but in fact the worst insult is the idea that this is a continuation up to 8 mm I would give F a grade for the rating and would be good, but considering that fool me, he got an F that he honestly deserves.
