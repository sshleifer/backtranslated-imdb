After the film, which represents the pinnacle of the Ninja genre of the 1980s, namely, the salivation of Ninja Revenge fans were “handled” to this strange proposal, which mixed the ninja-machinations with spiritual obsession ... the end result is not different from nature somewhat horrifying experience when someone watches a nugget of a human shit, swimming threateningly towards itself in a public pool. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the intended “action-filled” introduction that is found in all places on the golf course. Of course (!) Here we see how an evil green-clad ninja kills a group of golfers, apparently for no apparent reason (although I must admit that the superficial attitude towards the elite, accepted by many participants of this particular sport, is somewhat me annoying ... hmmm maybe that's why he killed them? ..... yes, I can relate to that in the end). In fact, later in the film we are told that one of the golfers was an eminent scientist, but this storyline is never developed and is never mentioned !!! <br /> <br /> In any case, returning to the entry, the police continue to surround the golf course and basically kill the killer with all their might .... and they have to keep shooting at him because he just won't stay down !!! Yes, literally hundreds of rounds of him are pumped up, and he still gets up to kill all law enforcement officers. <br /> <br /> Finally (after what seems like an eternity) our villain blows up a smoke bomb and disappears. ... or so it seems, because in reality he is simply hiding under the ground, and when our decidedly faceless officers leave the stage in search of their body, he crawls out of hiding and recoils. <br /> <br /> Then we see the beautiful Lucinda Dickey, a truly beautiful actress and in excellent physical shape, who plays the repairman here on the phone. From her high point of view, she accidentally sees a dying (LAST !!!!!) ninja. However, upon closer inspection, the man, presumably on his last legs, suddenly jumps on her and presses her to the ground. After a little struggle, our furious heroine, fortunately, can break free, but does not count on the fact that the ninja has hypnotic abilities, and she inevitably yields to them. It is at this moment that the dying ninja projects his soul on our heroine! His intention is to use her bodily form to kill those officers who killed him (the few whom he really could not destroy initially!) <br /> <br /> From this point, throughout the film, whenever our heroine notices one of the aforementioned officers, whom she subjects to incredibly horrible cinematic scenes with flashing lights, effects of smoke and a sword, which the ninja has bequeathed to her, levitating to her in the most shaky way! <br /> <br /> To solve questions, a more complex, especially annoying police officer (who has enough back and hair on his shoulders to disgrace the average yak!) is persistently trying to conquer her feelings (in the most bloody, annoying way !!!) .. .... well, of course, you do not need to give prejudice to understand that in a rather weak “shock” (less) turn by the end of the film, HE turns out to be one of the officers she must kill! <br /> <br /> But wait until there is hope! <br /> <br /> Take a step forward to the only Sho Kosugi! <br /> <br /> Yes, the ninja himself looks great as always here! News of golf clubs is obviously spreading quickly, and, having learned about the events that have taken place, he flies from Japan to sort out the situation (suspecting the worst!) In a brief history (just a few seconds!). ) Sho’s interest in this particular ninja is shown as personal after it is proven that the villain killed Sho’s father / teacher (?) And blinded one of Sho’s eyes (thus forcing Sho to wear a truly decorative looking bandage to protect against the sword!) < br /> <br /> After the theft of the body of his deadly sworn enemy from the morgue, and then stalking our heroine, which provides an involuntary abode of the evil soul, it is the culmination of the eastern temple (apparently in the wilderness) where our man Sho manages to reunite two disparate aspects. <br /> <br /> Now the evil ninjas and Sho who came to life from the dead are fighting in the traditional ninja style with swords, and the winner is ........ well yes, you can guess. <br /> <br /> Actually this film For this purpose, only two things are needed, namely: always excellent Kosugi (who always looks absolutely fantastic in this role) and sweet Miss Dicky. What a pity that the material in which they were here is such a rancid bunch of rites. <br /> <br /> Well, to be honest, I have seen much worse than it was at one time, although I, of course, still cannot recommend it except for those who desperately want to finish their Sho Kosugi / Ninja film collections.
