Yes, of course, this is the Friday of the 13th robbery, but I have no problem with that. This is a good effort, the killings are not so terrible, but the acting of one girl makes a film, which is the queen of screams, Jennifer Ritchchoff. For a low-budget movie, the effects are well done, well, sometimes you can guess how this is done. Some people have problems using the camera, I don’t see what’s wrong with that. It is so strange that so many people do not like this film, I really liked it. Of course, the script is not original, but give me one that, I mean, so many slashers are made in the forest. maybe it's all predictable, but it's worth seeing, I've seen a lot worse, I can tell you that
