This film actually starts quite interesting, but, for my taste, it too quickly degenerated into a dull and predictable melodrama. None of the performances is particularly interesting, and cinematography is just standard material for television films, so no one really has a reason to watch this film, unless it’s such a big fan of Jeff Bridges, I suppose. <br /> <Bridges plays Mike Olson, a young man who, at a family picnic, announces that he is leaving college to hit the road. His parents believe that he is "just kidding," and they say that "he has no plan." He assures them that he has a plan, and that he needs to discover his true self and his place in the world. In fact, so much so that he invites them to go with him on the road and buys a vintage bus for the trip, which he and his father are repairing in a real film about the connections between father and son in a television movie. Up to this point in the film I was somewhat interested in the plot and characters, and I wanted to see how his shy mother (Vera Miles) would react to life on the road. In the beginning there is a funny scene in which the father and son must convince her to go on a journey with them. They show her the inside of the bus, and she gradually becomes more and more interested, finally, irritably leaving with some talk of curtains against the blinds on the windows. Bridges are surprised at his father (Karl Betz, equipped with the voice of a radio announcer) that she changed her mind. Dad assures him that "the electric oven ... works every time!". <br /> <br /> But the film goes down almost as soon as they hit the road. It turns out that the only “plan” of Mike is to introduce them to some of his “friends” who turn out to be random people whom they meet at a hippie-rock festival. As soon as I saw the rock festival, I was a little disappointed ... especially since it became obvious that the rest of the film would take place on the festival site, and not on the road. But at least I thought there might be a decent group, like, well, if they couldn’t afford Hendrix or the Stones, maybe they would at least have Canned Heat or Little Feat or something something like that. No bones - obviously, the only music at this festival is some kind of horrible choral group with orchestra, which sounds like a bad imitation of the fifth dimension in combination with a annoying speaker, which should be humorous. <br /> <br /> We also introduce hippie audiences and their various medical melodramas. Katie (Renne Jarrett) is a pretty blonde girl with existentialism and nature on her mind who falls in love with Mike before uncovering the fact that she needs kidney dialysis to live and fled to the festival to die. And 2 other tourists are determined to have a child in their damp tent, representing the struggle between modern medicine and the ignorance of hippies (or something like that). In general, the longer this goes on, the more painful the film becomes for those who hope for some element of surprise or real drama. <br /> <br /> Basically this film is a waste of time, although it will probably entertain anyone who is really in the period of time in the late 60s, early 70s and films of that time. I would be just as happy if I never saw it again.
