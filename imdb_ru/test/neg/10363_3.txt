... or better yet, see Fandango if you want to see a really smart and funny college guy. Rolling Kansas sounded promising (in fact, the program’s management gave him 2.5 out of 4 stars, which usually means it's pretty watchable), but I went through it pretty quickly. Usually in movies about trips great music sounds, but I can't even remember if there was music. The only major achievement was a small role with Rip Thorn as a wise old hitchhiker / guru. Otherwise, the jokes and time was not enough all the way. The four main characters are unknown actors, and I don’t remember me seeing them in another movie. (Oh yes, I see that Tos was in it. Hayden Church, but he is in everything, good, bad, or indifferent). This movie is about as funny as watching someone else throw stones at you when you are not there.
