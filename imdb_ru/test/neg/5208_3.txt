The forbidden film by Niko Mastorakis was rather disappointing, in my opinion. A film about a couple who goes to a Greek island to kill all perverts (apparently). You know that you have something pretty sore when one of the first scenes includes a guy who has sex with a goat and then kills him. <br /> <br /> But from this point on, everything only gets worse, since all the scenes are very similar, They meet some people, so they either kill or have sex with them (preferably both). <br /> <br /> The end is all right when the couple turns out to be a brother and sister, and she just lets him rot somewhere, but on the whole one would expect more. I'm afraid there is no substance. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
