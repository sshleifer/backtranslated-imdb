After watching this film, I decided that this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I knew it at that moment when three teenage girls screamed and replayed when they (OMG!) Met again and then watched the same thing, only made by women old enough to be my mother. And it was only the first few minutes. Ish So, here are my comments ... <br /> <br /> 1. Middle-aged women + funny dance moves combined with a thigh attack and over costumes = not a good idea. <br /> <br /> 2. Pierce Brosnan could not sing from a paper bag. In fact, no one else could get into this pile of excrement. <br /> <br /> 3. The songs were so random. It was obvious to me that they, willy-nilly, were thrown into an incredibly contrived and silly plot. <br /> <br /> 4. My three-year-old nephew could write a better script. <br /> <br /> During the movie, I either mocked or laughed derisively. And I usually really like musicals. Of course, they should be a bit trite ... but it was funny. What a waste of talent. I mean, you have great actors and actresses in this film ... Iâ€™m ashamed of them, now it's part of their career. I'm sorry I spent my money and time on this piece of shit.
