Tu na there is one of the worst films I've ever seen. But on the other hand, it is better than most films from Slovenia, which are full of depressive characters and stories without any bright ideas. Tu na there is bright, optimistic and without any artistic moments. In many interviews, director Mitya Okorn tried to tell us that his film is of high quality just because it was not worth a lot of money. But to think so is wrong. Thu na there is a very bad movie for me. The dialogues are very poorly written (90% of the script consists of curses), the characters are stereotyped morons, the plot and its turns are very predictable, and the action films (this film should be comedy) are very, very bad and without any style. Okorn simply thinks he is even bigger than Quentin Tarantino, so he copies his style for 90 minutes. The humor in the film is very cheap and primitive (Okorn probably thinks that constant oath is ridiculous). In my opinion, this is a very cheap (not only budget) film with a dull history and a very, very bad game.
