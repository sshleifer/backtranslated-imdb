Barney and Friends is probably the worst kids show I've ever seen. It does not teach children anything, songs are commonplace, not educational, and the characters just worry. I am not one of those who disagree with those who hate the show. Honestly, I saw more negative than positive reviews for this show. 75% of the reviews are negative and there are really mature people. This show does not contain any educational value or age-appropriate educational material. More reasons why I don’t like this show, because of silly plots, raw dialogues, terrible special effects and horrible plot lines. In addition, it says that you should eat junk food if you are sad and that strangers are your friends. To say that this is “a model of how preschool television should be,” as Yor University researchers Dorothy and Jerome Singer put it, is nonsense. They do not know what they are talking about. I would never recommend Barney to anyone. The reason that some children continue to cry or get involved in junk is that this show poisons the minds of children everywhere. For people (parents / children) who are looking for real preschool education, switch to Nick Jr. and see “Why super!” Instead. This is much better than this turd, and Five TV once had the courage to put it on a milkshake, but, fortunately, took it off. I strongly advise everyone to stay away from this show as much as possible. Parents, I strongly advise you to keep your children as far away as possible from this show. They will thank you later. <br /> <br /> LOWER LINE: Don't worry about wasting your precious time on this stupid show. It is completely rubbish. -10000000000000/10. Rating: Z. Avoid like the plague! <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading.
