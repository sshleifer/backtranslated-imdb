I am a big fan of demonic puppets. Looking at the surface of this, it looks pretty good! You have Decapatron, puppets and a new villain in Totema! Unfortunately, the little punk that makes this project to liven up inanimate objects cannot act. He stinks! His girlfriend is worse. If they were not taken into account, it would probably be great, BLADE VS. TOTEM. I would watch it for 2 hours. But instead, the role of the dolls is diminished, and the whole movie suffered because of that. The mystical Skull that created the totem is banal at best, and the appearance of the Decapitrons is long-awaited, short and very disappointing. You'd better see the first one again.
