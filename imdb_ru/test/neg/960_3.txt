I'm a fan of the original 1950s, and about 20 minutes after this remake, I started to think that it would be as good as the original, but it is not. The motive for the kill was incredibly stupid. Two lovers in the film are brother and sister, excuse me while I grumble. The main character stops in the middle of the film to have sex, which does not make sense, given the situation in which he is. If the filmmakers wanted a sex scene, they should have put it before the main character in the film before (Dexter played Dennis Quaid discovered that he would soon die and be accused of a crime. There is a reason for the sex scene. At the beginning of the film Dexter does not live life to the fullest, so he is not interested in sleeping with Meg Ryan. I still feel that it would be more sensible for the sex scene to be cut out or earlier in the film, and the two brothers and sisters were not lovers. <br /> <br /> One of the silliest parts of the movie is related to ne an arrow of fire, a couple of people die, and one person crosses everything within 15 yards of a crowded carnival, and yet there is NO ONE ON CARNIVAL NOTICES !!! , you sink to the bottom of seconds. Not only is it difficult to believe that the material will sink so quickly in the resin, but more importantly, who builds a university in the tar pits. I would say more about how stupid the end of the film is, but I donâ€™t I want to put a spoiler in my post.
