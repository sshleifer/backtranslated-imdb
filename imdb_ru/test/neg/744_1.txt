Northanger Abbey is not my favorite novel by Jane Austen, but it has its charms. This film is not. He has some of the same character names as in the book, but the story has changed dramatically, and the sweetest person in the whole Austin canon (unless Mr. Knightley received Emmaâ€™s place of honor) is considered heartless and hired creep. One or two completely foreign characters have been introduced, and above all this hangs a tangible type of corset perversion. I was very disappointed when I first saw him in 1986; even today, he occupies one of the first places in the list of films in which the books on which they are based are disgraced. Even Robert Hardy fans should give it a wide place. There is nothing in it, and I mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G to recommend it.
