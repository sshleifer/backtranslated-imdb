As a big fan of DM, it goes without saying that I have seen this movie many times. However, I watch it exclusively for live performances ... the rest of the film is pretty awful, sadly. <br /> <br /> Director of the glorified rock music DA. Pennebaker followed Moda in their late evening. 80's Music For The Masses tour, in which a superb self-titled album is being promoted. The title 101 comes mainly from the fact that the included live material refers to the 101st and last concert of the tour in the Pasadena Bowl, but is also a reference to the film, which is a “course for beginners” for the group and how it ticks, that e. Depeche Mode 101. The filming of the quartet, playing live and exploring America, is the second storyline, in which a group of DM fans who won the competition participated, to meet with the group, go on tour on their own bus and attend the final concert. . <br /> <br /> Now, as I said above, the concert frames are great. Mode are here at the top of their form as the gods of the stadium of rock, which was a somewhat unusual achievement for the electric band in the late 80s. Although the film attracts the band even before they recorded their 1990 masterpiece Violator, here you can still see and hear countless excellent tracks, such as Driving, the magnificent "Never Let Me Down", "Everything Has meaning, just can not get enough "Years of Vince Clarke, Shake The Disease and many others. <br /> <br /> When Mode goes on stage, they are great. When they are not there, they are, well, very boring. Nothing, even of vague interest, happens to the guys when they check out the US in the last days of the Reagan rule. For example, a likely "highlight" of the material is visiting a country music store to buy tapes. Not really exciting things. I know that all bands should not be wild and foolish idiots, but these guys make the choir of the Mormon Tabernacle look like Rammstein. <br /> <br /> The only real excitement is the various clips focused on the vocalist of the group Dave. Gaan In the year 101, Gahan meets with a mild psychosis, talking about violent force within himself, which he cannot control, recalling a bizarre rage attack involving a taxi driver, and so on. There is one moment in the film where he makes a diva hysterical behind the scenes of some poor guy - it really embarrasses. This man clearly had problems that, fortunately, were resolved. Songwriter Martin Gore and keyboard player Andy Fletcher are presented as very eloquent, clearly talented, but also completely colorless men; while the somewhat mysterious fourth member, Alan Wilder, is the only quartet to film a rock star with any kind of aplomb. <br /> <br /> As for the “fan tour” theme, this is a useless dross. . Let's not fool ourselves. Maybe it's just because everything is very * very * at the end of the 80s, but a bunch of young devotees does little for me, but causes a feeling of annoyance. For humans, they are unusually small and empty people whose antics are commonplace when they are not secretive. Let me repeat .... * nothing happens in frames that are not of interest on the stage and which are of any interest. Nothing. Infinite scenes where children spray their hair, argue meaninglessly, change clothes, get lost in cities on the way to concerts and find their partners in bed with another winner of the competition makes me think about one thing - if Cure fans were this mind, bending their heads back into 88/89. The love that young people have for the group is something that I can definitely relate to, and sometimes infectiously joyful, but if what we see was the most interesting thing that was removed from their participation, then I would not I wanted to see what it looked like. <br /> <br /> But music is all that matters, and in this respect 101 is superior. A concert in Pasadena, one of the best of all time, makes the film worth seeing. The latest DVD release comes with a bonus disc containing what remains of unedited concert material (about 80% of the performance), and thus makes the DVD absolutely necessary for fans. The group’s audio commentary (with the exception of Wilder, who left Mode in the mid-90s) on the first disc is also, oddly enough, much more interesting than the film itself. <br /> <br /> As a document about the boys from Basildon during their idol-theater period, the Depeche Mode 101 is invaluable. But if you're looking for excitement, you'd better get the accompanying double live album (now available in Super Audio CD format).
