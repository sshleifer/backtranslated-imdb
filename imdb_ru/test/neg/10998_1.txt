If you like really shocking movies, this is for you. Acting is the worst thing I've ever seen, and the storyline goes nowhere. If you meet this movie in your video store, do not even think about borrowing it. The chicken on the front cover is not even the one in the film. I gave this movie 1/10 just because I could not vote 0. Avoid it at all costs.
