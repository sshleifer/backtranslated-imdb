I am the man who never watches animated films, but I make an exception for Thumbelina and Princess Swans. Being absolutely in love with the first edition of the series, I bought it and sat down to look at it with a biased mind, deciding to love it, because I spent the money to buy it. I finished the movie, and all I can think of is HORROR !!! I wanted to like it, I really did. I tried very hard, loved it very much. But I could not enjoy the second of this exhausting film. The songs made me feel like I'm tearing my ears out of my head. The dialogue was so lame that I felt like twitching from frustration and annoyance every time someone opened his mouth. The villain was funny, and I felt that I finally wanted Derek and Odette to die ... and I was absolutely in love with them from the very first movie. <br /> <br /> I am going to try to suppress the memory of this film, because it almost destroyed the first one for me. The film has one song in which there is a series of memories for the first film. The difference in the animation between them became very obvious, and I began to yearn for the first, wanting me to never see the third. <br /> <br /> Do yourself, love and not waste your time.
