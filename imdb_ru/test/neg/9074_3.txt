It has been a long time since I was in the art-house theater, and I went to visit Freyde's Soul, because he received such wonderful reviews in the newspapers. <br /> <br /> This film is connected with the fact that he has no head or tail, but there is only a fraction of the time about the lives of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> When it started, I already knew that it would take a lot of time, but sometimes things can get better, in this case, not. There is no real character development or interconnection between players. You start in the middle of a situation, a girl suddenly appears, and then a guy appears with whom he should be friends to realize his sporting ambitions, but the way of combining them is rather strange, as they seem to be "just folded together." <br /> <br /> And suddenly they have sex with each other, at least one of them you can see. The feeling of guilt or jealousy with another guy is barely noticeable, and in fact all I could think about during the movie was “when will they have sex again?”. And when you think about it, it really is crazy. Because it basically means that it’s actually worthless to watch, but three teenagers are watching it, and this, at least for me, makes it a very shitty movie, avoid it and save you money (my 7.50 is spent in vain)), there are films of better art house than this one. <br /> <br /> I give three stars for the performance, one for each.
