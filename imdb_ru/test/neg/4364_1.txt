Sorry, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I can not believe that after creating the first in the series, they were able to get a budget to make another. Not that the budget could be big - this is the scariest movie I've ever watched and laughed to the very end (in fact, I can't believe we watched it to the end), but I think this is because we could not quite believe it.
