A spacecraft in some uncertain future, where people are equipped for space travel and have laser guns for weapons crashing on the earth on a strange young planet, where dinosaurs, by coincidence, also developed and only in this world, have not yet died out until. The survivors of the crash, about ten soft characters in blue, white and yellow costumes, fight for survival against alien prehistoric monsters. <br /> <br /> "Planet of dinosaurs" - a kind of film. As I said in my resume above, the animated dinosaurs in the film are the only colorful actors. Models are rough, but spectacularly animated. And they are much more exciting and intriguing than these characters, depicted by inexperienced actors and speech lines from a script that was supposed to be written overnight without a single revision. Obviously, most of the budget was invested in dinosaurs, and although there are quite a lot of them, they are not enough to save us from our boredom. These human characters exist only to scream, run and mumble these poorly written and wordy speeches about survival. And, unfortunately, dinosaurs hardly eat them up. <br /> <br /> In general, Planet of the Dinosaurs is not a film that I plan to see again. Some people will simply love him for being so cheap and so poorly made. Sometimes I like these movies. But this particular film is too long, too boring and very tiring for the mind.
