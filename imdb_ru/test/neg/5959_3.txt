So, lately I have been collecting a lot of vipco and hardgore titles on DVD, and I must say that this is one of the most disappointing. A more recent film compared to other titles in the Hardgore catalog, it was a direct release DVD. I have always been interested in the myth of the chokeberry ale since I saw a documentary in my teens. However, this film is a terrible, badly-filmed film, and the storyline and acting are terrible, it took me three times to watch this movie to the end. While cheap horror films of the 80s and 90s are good because of their cheap budgets and comedies, this film is not. <br /> <br /> First look at the other names in the hard-rock series, for example, Boneyard is older, but much better.
