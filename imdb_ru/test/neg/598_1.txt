This film probably started with a good idea, but it’s so far away. When I read the cover in Blockbuster, I thought it promised, but it was based on the general idea of ​​the film. The film began with a professor's story about how in the future we can see creatures from other dimensions. There was no explanation of how this would happen, but this is normal, I thought it would be developed in the film. It was not In the next scene, we see two young people lying on tables with tubes attached to their heads. Next to each there are two attractive women. Men begin to ask: "Do you hear that?" Or "Do you see them?" We conclude that they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seems invisible or they hallucinate. Women do not see these creatures. It was good for the first five minutes, BUT THIS SCENE IS CONTINUED FOR A FULL HOUR. This is briefly emphasized by memories that have nothing to do with the so-called “plot” of the film. We are also presented to a person in a lab coat and what looks like Middle Eastern terrorists. What is it about? We will never know. The flashes make us believe that the terrorists are forcing the person in the lab coat to carry out diabolical experiments on these young people, but we never understand why. At the end of the film, the terrorists finally do what the terrorists do ?? they blow up the lab, but why? What is the point? We have no idea. This film contains so many disparate thoughts and ideas that there are too many of them to list, but another remarkable fact is that the person in lab coats and the terrorist appear and leave the room throughout the entire film, and never young men try to run away or even leave the tables on which they lie, even if they are not attached! The filmmakers also show comeo in the form of cockroaches several times, but, again, we will never know that this is related to the storyline. Sorry, but this movie was a waste of $ 4, and I took the time to get to the rental point and then watch it. Listen to my advice. Do not give up.
