Do not be deceived by the plot, as described on the cover (at least the Swedish version). The story of this seems rather interesting, with speculative hints. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is the saddest film that I have ever had ... It is simple and correct HORRIBLE, and it should not be sold or leased to anyone. If you still think the plot seems intriguing, think about it: phones can move, run and kill people, like any other electrical device. He can throw things at you, chase you and run after you. PLEASE DON'T LOOK IN THIS FILM, it's a shame for the horror genre ...
