After the general, the film that romanticized the life of the Dublin gangster general to such heroic proportions that he forced the sick ordinary person in Dublin along with Kevin and his attempt to portray Mr. Lynch or Martin Cahill, or the general, acting game. so bad that this crime drama becomes a comedy for his native Dub and a tragedy for Kevin Spacey’s fan. In short, is it worth it to watch a movie ... No, unless you like a bad game with funny “correct Irish accents, and surely you can be sure”. The story is torn from the commercially successful "General", which, despite the glorification of the well-known Dublin animal in Martin Cahill, is still worth seeing, on a national scale, because it shows the present working class of Dublin, and internationally because He is a true Irish actor and cast, including John Voight. In general, “Ordinary decent criminal” is not a decent film at all. Avoid.
