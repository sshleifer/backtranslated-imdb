I hated this movie. Simply put, this film is so bad that I almost want to ignore it and never mention it again. But on the other hand, I cannot resist a good beating. And if there is something that Evan Almighty does for the audience, it is that he evokes the best criticism. <br /> <br /> The film (the continuation of the much more amusing Bruce Almighty) begins with the re-introduction of the audience to Evan. Baxter, simply supporting at best the character in the original film. Like this. In this film, no Jim Carrey or Jennifer Enisten. Even a small cameo. You know that your movie is bad when the guy who agreed to do Ace Venture: When Nature Calls, there will not even be a short role-playing role. But somehow they manage to save Morgan Freeman as God. When I was sitting in an almost empty cinema, I was bored because of the lack of comedy, I couldn't help but think about how much money it took to get Freeman for this film. Then he hit me an hour ago. It's just a one-time role that takes up all 20 minutes in a 100-minute film. God just appears between the scenes to tell Evan to build an ark. Of course, I know that Morgan Freeman will not watch this film in a year and thinks that he is as good as his roles in the film “Escape from the Shoushenk” and “Baby in a Million”, but this is easy money. <br /> <br /> Where was I? Oh yes, the plot. Sometimes it's so hard to focus on the plot, when you realize that you are thinking about the plot more than the author of the script. In any case, Evan (Steve Carell), obviously, left his job as a news presenter to work as a congressman. Yes ... without moving between them. He never turns to his wife and says: "I think I want to be a congressman." This happens within the first five minutes, and you have to deal with a big transition. As a congressman, he must partner with the bill proposed by John Goodman’s character when God suddenly appears to tell Evan to build an ark. No "Hello, how are you? How is the weather?" Little. Just "I want you to build an ark." Evidence of bad writing: Evan determines that God gives him the keys to building an ark, noting that a fan holds a sign saying “Genesis 6:14,” as he walks past his son, who watches a television game of baseball. <br /> <br /> Here is the main plot of Evan Almighty. There are some occasional supporting actors who do their best to make comedies, but they are not very good because they are given almost no time on the screen. It’s just your main experience of the mill family making the Ark movie. Oh, and there is that obligatory scene where the father must abandon his campaign plans with his children and wife, because he becomes engaged in work. They leave disappointed, but understand, like all the other moments in the film, it happened. I would like to see only once how the youngest child turned to his father, hit him on the chin and told him: “You are a real bastard for canceling your plans with us. Now I'm going to turn the emo. ” There is also a drama that you expect from your father and his family when they understand (wife, in fact ... three children have no problem helping father to build an ark) that he has gone mad and claims that God wants he built a big boat. But don't worry. His family decides to stay with him. Oh, I just ruined the drama. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this film is that there is no good comedy there. I know it was decided to evaluate whether it would be a PG movie in order to get a big crowd response, but I don’t think that I’m in the minority when I think family humor is more than just guys kicked in nuts and animals. crapping. Maybe I'm wrong, and that's what boils down to high-quality family humor. And if so, please bring me more comedies for adults so that I no longer have to sit out this nonsense (no pun intended). <br /> <br /> The ending is very stupid. Suddenly, the film takes a dramatic turn of the CGI, which makes me shudder to think how terrible the waste of CGI is. I bet it was too expensive. Finally, after all this waiting, we are told why God wanted Evan to build an ark. And boy, oh boy, I hated the reason why. I’ll get rid of the details, but it was like watching or reading the murder mystery, and the killer turned out to be a man who followed the main character for one second and didn’t have any lines. <br /> <br /> Yes, and then there is a pleasant touch at the very end. The song "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" plays credits, and we then get exposed to the actors' "dances." I do not understand. They unsuccessfully spend a comedy for 100 minutes, and then they wrap it up with a thriller. I swear, I was not so scared watching Steve Carell’s dance ever since ... well, never. There you have people. Evan Almighty - the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> In general, I thought it was a lost experience. I'm bewildered by all the talented actors (Carell, Freeman and Goodman) who are participating in this boring festival with Lauren Graham, a woman from Gilmore Girls, who has not yet proved to me that she can act from a paper bag. But most of all, my willpower surprises me, in order to actually sit through the entire movie without leaving home. <br /> <br /> Rating: * out ****
