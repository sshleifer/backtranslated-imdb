This illustrious documentary on the discovery channel, partly biblical research, partly a treasure hunt, all misappropriated, may have been well reflected in its television origin, but failed as a feature film. At first glance, its obscene type of cover can cast doubt on the integrity of this serious subject, shown in the first case in which the search for the tomb of Jesus is translated into a common action font that looks more like “National Treasure” or “Tomb Raider” than any deliberate debate . and examination of the historic burial site should. This is the behind-the-scenes path that all hearings rotate. <br /> <br /> Simchi Jakobovic’s research is more curious than a researcher’s worth and seems self-satisfied, and his research is manipulative. Despite all the amazing revelations, this director is trying to convey to his audience the alleged evidence, the flow of repeated statements, repeating the same research and findings, again and again proves that "The Lost Tomb of Jesus" has very little information to reinforce the bloated, although fascinating assertions, What this makes up is a very frustrating attempt to beat the audience over the head with the same little factual evidence in support of the authenticity of this grave, which is canonically it detracts from it. While tirelessly tying together many of these mini-coffins, found together to support the theory of Jesus of Nazareth, this study refuses a comprehensive approach to continually pursue the exceptional obsession of this romantic archaeologist. There may be some impressive evidence that helps shed some light on many traditional dogmatic beliefs adhering to Christianity, but, in fact, the shadow nature of this project made it just a part of the operation funded while the entire Da Vinci Code was completely furious. . <br /> <br /> In the end, the cheese cover was right. Despite my appreciation for the documentary form, “The Lost Tomb of Jesus” always takes an interesting topic and turns it into a long and unchanging geriatric adventure hunt, replacing any relevance and sacredness for this team’s inspired motives. By the time these raiders to the graves had finished their research, reluctantly stopping the research due to social demands, the audience was left with the impression that the director insisted on faking this secret, whether it was there from the very beginning or not. There are several truly powerful moments when the halls of this story pass through this documentary in unpretentious ways, but all the decoding, research and theorizing in the world still leave this misguided part of vanity in the uneasy emptiness of the apathetic response.
