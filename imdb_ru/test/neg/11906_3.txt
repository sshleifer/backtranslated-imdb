There is a certain irony in the parody of the gothic genre, which turns into a cliché mess by directors who either didn’t know what the purpose of the plot was, or simply didn’t care. All the distinctive features of your usual family movie are stupid younger brothers and sisters, an ill-tempered teenager who does not want to move, not sympathetic parents who cannot see the vision, and of course a romantic plot. The film has very little to do with Wilde's original story, which was mainly written to play a trick on the melodramatic gothic novels that were in vogue at the time. If Wilde had seen this version, he would probably have laughed, and then, of course, he would have written a parody. One can only hope that the children who watched this soft, mass-produced dad, eventually found the wit and brilliance of the original version.
