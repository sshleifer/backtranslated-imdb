There is a reason to call it a teen flick. Out of 100 possible points, I would put it somewhere in adolescence. This is predictable, the game is terrible, especially the minor roles, and, above all, it is super predictable. The end is so hoarse that I had to leave early and perhaps he would have passed. By the way, could you call the man the leading pervert? I bet if it really happened, someone from my school district would say that. Finally, in the school where I grew up, even though there were over 1,000 students in the middle class, we could call the boob Josie as a crook, and we would choose her from the crowd. My last word is to save your time when watching something better on TV, for example, stock quotes.
