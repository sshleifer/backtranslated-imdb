Cult buyers, of course, are familiar with the term "video shit". It was the notorious British list, containing all the films that can cause "damage" to society if viewed by irresponsible viewers (dramatization). For blood lovers, this is an excellent checklist, as it contains inhumanly cruel and disturbing realistic films (Faces of Death, Holocaust Cannibalism, Killer Killers), as well as horrible and horrible horror films , “Killing with Instruments”), with this in mind, it is rather unusual to see “The Night of Bloody Monkeys” among other “filth”. Of course, this is terrible, but the blood and violence are so poorly represented that I cannot imagine anyone offended by it. And a stupid conspiracy (about a desperate doctor transplanting a gorilla's heart into the chest of his dying son) is not quite what you would call disturbing, real. All that remains is a pretty funny click of horror with a terrible game and meaningless meanness. The effects of makeup on monkeys are ridiculous, and nowhere is there any tension or atmosphere. In other words, it is nice only if you are in a good mood. A few episodes featuring detailed female wrestling matches (which one of the leading actresses earns a living) are very cool.
