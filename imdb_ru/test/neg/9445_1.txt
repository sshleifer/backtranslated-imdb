I have to say that this is the worst film I've ever seen in my life, I can't believe I spent 10 dollars on a blockbuster; this film must be burned, and those who have ever thought of it have problems. Who actually spent the money to create this film was insane = D In this film, terrible actors, and some scenes have absolutely no meaning. Well, the whole movie does not make sense. Also, the part where these "men" enter the snack bar (national securities department), which turned out to be the worst part of the film. How dare they pronounce the name Frank Sinatra in vain? Also, what happened to these glasses? When a boy and a girl are in a car and she “drinks” water, you can completely say that she doesn’t even drink! Except what happened to the fancy dining guy. And everyone knows that you do not slaughter tires, you chop them.
