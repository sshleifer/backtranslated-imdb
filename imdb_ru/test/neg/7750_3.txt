Even with glasses dressed in geek mode, Kathy Ireland looks very easy on the eyes, but its game is not so easy to watch. Most of the actors in the film are either out of control (not counting the "merry fun"), or are a little embarrassed by the fact that they are there. The effects and soundtrack are nothing special and fairly budget. The plot line REALLY stretches the ability to suspend disbelief. Catch it to make fun of it if it appears on a premium movie channel or online on a Saturday afternoon, but donâ€™t waste money on this thing. <br /> <br /> One of the most noteworthy in the details - one of the underground bandits plays Deep Roy. Deep is now known for playing (and does it well) all the Oompa Loompas at Charlie and the Chocolate Factory of Burton.
