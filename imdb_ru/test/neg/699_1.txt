I study in the cinema, and I know that I don’t know everything about the film, but to be honest, this is one of the worst, stupid, backward and useless films I have ever seen, and I have seen NAPOLEAN DINAMITE. they are both equally awful. Konrak is boring, and nothing interesting happens in the film, it’s not a very heartwarming story, and Pat Conroy doesn’t overcome anything! I'm not saying that there should be fights and rubbish, but it would revive it more than a soft film. the children they wanted to play in this film may have been real children from the island of Yamakra, they sounded silly and could not act, as far as I can tell, it was a stupid idea for a book and an even worse idea for a movie I don't know why this film was even made, deviantly included in the top five films of all time.
