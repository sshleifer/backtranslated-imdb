I hoped that “Pulp Fiction” would be an interesting film, but I was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> Fiction has very little storyline, and what happens there cannot interest you. It was a real struggle to keep watching it. When it's over, you say to yourself "yes? Is that all?!?". This is what you think about after watching, why did they bother at all? <br /> <br /> This is very bad, as Michael Kane is a good actor. I also hoped to see the great Lizaveta Scott in this, but she only appears on the screen for about one minute. Scott is one of the greatest girls of all time, filming Noir, the Fatal Woman, and this was her last movie. <br /> <br /> Oh well ...
