There are spoilers, but trust me, I do you a favor. <br /> <br /> My friends and I very often watch crappy movies. Inspired by the Mystery Science Theater and our joke on the spot; We decided to find films that are worth watching, which are really ... not worth watching. However, trouble goes to heaven, when these films can be found only if you buy them. And I firmly believe that I will not give a cent to such a group of worthless scum. So, as another reviewer said, such films are the reason why downloading films for free should be legalized. I prefer the idea; instead of right in the video you have right on the Internet. Thus, the bags with asses that made this parody will never be profitable. Unfortunately, you know what they are doing. They hire a group of actors who cannot act, special effects from the high school classroom, rubber snakes that can be bought at the dollar store, constant vomiting of green jelly and two main characters who seem to switch between bordering leaps of Mexicans who speak only Spanish, with Arabs 100% fluent in English, random naked bodies, a guy who was shot 10 times, including one on the head, and the lively and most backward finale in cinema history, books, rock paintings and magazines al for tourists. The fact that I actually predicted that the stupid serpent girl would actually turn into a snake about halfway, scares me ... <br /> <br /> In any case, it's great to make fun of the movie, but you be sure that you are at least four, and you all spit out jokes on a fast fire, because if you watch at least one second of watching this movie in which you are not laughing, you will feel physically sick. I am not kidding. My friends and I ate chicken wings, and now I can no longer even look at it without a reminder about this piece of W! T. <br /> <br /> This film is the same as Alien vs.. The Hunter, which is the second worst film ever made. And I saw a lot of bad movies. By the way, this is the same production company as this film, and this bald guy is also in both. I just thought you might like this little funny fact. -100 out of 0f 10.
