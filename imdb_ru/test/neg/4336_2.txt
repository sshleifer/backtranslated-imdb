Talk about a boring snore. This 3rd-level biker movie put me to sleep as soon as the captions appeared on the screen. The shame is that there were a lot of great actors in the cast, including George Kennedy, Karen Black, Leo Gordon, Richard Lynch, Lance Henriksen and William Forsythe. <br /> <br /> The rise of the western classic movie “Noon” is basically the story of the former green beret of the US Army (Henriksen), trying to get someone to help him save the city with one horse from the gang of bastards. <br /> <br /> Everyone is trying, but the script is at the elementary school level. It is sad to see that the Kennedy Academy Award winner is so desperate for his outstanding performance in Cool Hand Luke. <br /> <br /> If you have trouble sleeping at night, this will be the perfect video for hire .......... you'll sleep instantly!
