The drama and drama included in the film are fantastic, but the facts and research are far from conclusive. Quoting Dr. Bovon, where the documentary is trying to establish contact with Mary Magdalene from Mariamena, Dr. Bovon later explains that it should be used for literary purposes (i. E. In the fables of that time), and not for the historical person. In fact, he declares that he does NOT believe that the Mariamena’s crypt at Talpiot is Mary Magdalene. He further comments on his public letter that he was not informed that his words would be used for this documentary, but rather for information about the acts of Philip (literary work in the 4th century). <br /> <br /> So we have a director here who took one clip for Philip's fantasy “Acts of Philip” of the 4th century and used it specifically to support the inscription on the 1st century crypts. A very sad cut, and Dr. Bovon calls the link between Jesus and Mary Magdalene "science fiction" - since this documentary must be properly named.
