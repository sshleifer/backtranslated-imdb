Of course, you can see some tits, but if this is all you are looking for in a movie, you will get more runtime from YouTube. I just paid a dollar from the Redbox because I saw the name Val Kilmer. Bad move. The plot did not thicken, the dialogue was shoddy, the characters at best undeveloped. Someone said that the cinema is all right, but do not expect too much. This film progressed very slowly and ended without grace. Black list. I spent most of the film, wondering if any event or color scheme of things was symbolic. I never rewound to understand this, because nothing was explained at the end. No turning. It also left a lot of questions, which, as it turned out, I had no desire to hear the answer. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
