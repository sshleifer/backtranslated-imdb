If I had heard the presenter say: “This is insane!” Once again I would have struck. The film is one big cliché, with fake glances to “tear him apart under the heel. No man in this film has one redemptive quality; reminds me of Soviet films with highly politically oriented messages. I could not even understand WHY between the presenters were attraction, and could not wait for the final.
