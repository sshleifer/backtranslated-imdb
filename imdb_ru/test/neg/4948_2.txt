This is a terrible movie. Angie Dickenson is a group act, and she is fine, but she no longer gets many roles, and she must have needed money to make this film. By the way, it is on the screen less than 10 minutes. Oooh, wait, this film has one feature that helps to redeem: Meg Foster plays a small role in this film. Meg has been on the screen for 35 years, and she is not particularly good, but she has the most terrible eyes of all the actresses I've ever seen. By name, you probably do not know her, but one look at her eyes, and you recognize her. To sum up: the acting is terrible, the story is bad, and even the filmography is terrible. The screen turns black every time the director wants to change the scene, idiocy. See anything else besides this, even Mr. Ed is starting up again!
