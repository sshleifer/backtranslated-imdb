“Robot Holocaust” is about the lamest, most pitiful attempt to make a post-apocalyptic film I've seen. And I thought that the Italians were the masters of the wretched madman Max. Some of these films, such as Escape 2000, are truly brilliant compared to this piece. The plot is meaningless ?? even with the storyteller setting up each scene. And the boy is dragging it. A scene behind the scenes where nothing interesting happens. Special effects (and I use the word “special”) are socks dolls. Yes, it's right ?? socks dolls! The game is terrible. Angelica Yager is on the verge of the worst performance I've ever seen. Sure, is she French or German or something else? but man she is bad. I can't remember a single positive thing about the film. Therefore, I will dwell on this, because ten sentences about this garbage are about ten too many. <br /> <br /> However, fortunately for me, I saw the version of Robot Holocaust for MST3K. Some of the things that made the film so bad helped make this episode MST3K a winner. During the first season, riffs come quickly and violently and almost every time they hit the target. On my MST3K rating scale, am I giving this episode 4/5 ?? look for it.
