Revival: Angels and Demons <br /> <br /> Film director Ron Howard. He also starred in such famous films as The Da Vinci Code and Cinderella. He also directed the famous television series 24. The most famous actors are Tom Hanks (The Da Vinci Code, Green Mile, Forrest Gump) and Ewan MacGregor (Cassandra's Son, Moulin Rouge, Star Wars: The Threat of Phantom ", ??). <br /> <br /> At first, I was shocked because they changed the beginning of the film so much. Because they changed their father Vittoria Vettra (Ayelet Zurer) to someone else, Silvano Bentivollo (Camren Argenziano). Another change is that Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) never goes to CERN. It was nice that they were filmed on the set at CERN. <br /> <br /> Then the film continues. This is an exciting car race in Rome. I also really like the role in the Chirstian Archives, when they destroy the work of Galileo, it was fun. It was also funny that when they were locked up in the archives for the second time, did Robert Langdon destroy half of the archives, and when they burned, did the electricity start up ?? <br /> <br /> I found it very stupid that Robert Langdon did not get into the helicopter, but that Camerlengo (Ewan MacGregor) gets one, another detail is that in the film Camerlengo - the adopted son of the Pope. In the book "He is the real son of the Pope." <br /> <br /> When I need to give the best performance, I must say that Pierfrancesco Favino plays Inspector Olivetti. The worst actor was from the killer, played by Nikolai Li Kaas, I think he did not succeed, because in Adams Apples he played “Fabulous.” <br /> <br /> I think the whole movie was not successful because director Ron Howard made some stupid changes. I would rate the movie at 4/10.
