While I was watching it, I was going to write an explosive criticism of this “movie” (actually this video), but then I saw that someone had already done it. I pretty much agree with him. But, again, it seems that you need to put a lot of effort, and millions of lire went for it, so I think you should give them credit for trying. However, as they say, anyone who does not yet know the world of Lovecraft and that this is what they tried to convey would probably think ... well, I suppose that this is not only really bad, but it also makes absolutely no sense. Thank God, I read part of another review (“maybe a little sentimental, maybe?”), Which showed that this guy also starred in “Avoidable House” (which looked pretty bad, judging by the DVD box), so now I can avoid it and spare my mind the further impact of such desecration of HP Lovecraft's brilliance.
