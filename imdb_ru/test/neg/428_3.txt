This film would probably be good if they didnâ€™t use CGI (computer generated images) for werewolf scenes. This made the creatures look fake, and the werewolves looked cartoony. CGI is great for certain effects, such as dinosaurs in Jurassic Park or Twister. But when we see a movie where the creature should look absolutely real, CGI is not the way. Look at the American werewolf in London. No CGI. Just makeup and mechanical being, and what you came up with, was more realistic than what was shown in the sequel. In this film there were really some jokes that were interesting to watch, and the humor in this film seemed to attract me, but it was just a film that, it seemed to me, was fine, and that was not enough. In my opinion, the American werewolf in Paris does not maintain the original.
