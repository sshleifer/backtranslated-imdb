This is proof that filmmakers and their financiers, who treat their audiences with disdain, are not new, since this was done in the 1940s, and HOUSE OF Dracula is a great example. You might think that having a movie with Dracula, the Wolfman and the monster of Frankenstein, the producer dictates the scriptwriter so that all three will appear in the scene. They had a chance with HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, then, when they bit off the cherry again, they blew it up again with HOUSE OF Dracula. To lose one chance is a misfortune, to lose two tastes of cynical earnings. <br /> <br /> Obviously, manufacturers do not care. Larry Talbot reappears, despite being shown to die in the previous film, which sums up the cynicism of the franchise. It also shows what a bad scenario it is, and we mistreat such horrible plot twists as the state of Talbot curable by a special type of plant that softens its skull. I think screenwriter Edward T Low might have softened his skull if it were the type of things he came up with. <br /> <br /> Director Erie Kenton cannot improve the script and adds a few wrenches. His personal. For example, Talbot is amazed to see Dr. Edelmann lift the elevator on a cart, but casually watch Edelmann climb the wall and jump into the castle courtyard. One cannot help thinking that the Talbot reactions were mistakenly switched during the editing phase. <br /> <br /> Lon Cheney, Jr. is known for his roles in horror films, but he had no particular career outside. Perhaps this is due to the fact that he is not a good actor, and here he performs the worst type of acting - to be very wooden. It's not really his fault, because all the characters spew out a rather awful dialogue and all are pretty wooden, partly because of the dull director Kenton. <br /> <br /> HOUSE OF Dracula feels a million miles from the 1931 James Wyll movie its continuation from 1935 and it would be a very sad note to complete. But ironically, Universal decided to make another film to wrap up their franchise in a horror comedy starring Abbott and Costello.
