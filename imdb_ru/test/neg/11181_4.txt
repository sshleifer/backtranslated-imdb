Brown's father’s thesis is that a good dose of Roman Catholicism will solve all life problems. A bit of proselytizing, I don't mind, but sometimes it gets a little ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Over the years, some good actors have played Brown’s father, Kenneth More and Barnard Hughes - two good examples. Alec Guinness plays it in this film and does everything with it all right, but you did not see much demand for future films of Father Brown. <br /> <br /> I believe that if you are a faithful Catholic, all this is fine. common sense. It is much more important to catch a thief and convert him to his religion than to see that he was brought to justice. <br /> <br /> But this is what was asked to accept here. In fact, there is a preliminary story before the main action of the film. Guinness in clerical clothes caught while trying to return the stolen items, which one of his parishioners Sidney James inherited during the robbery. <br /> <br /> This is the story that he tells the local policeman, and, of course, this is what James has trusted him so that he could not break the confession. <br /> <br /> Now for the big game. The main thief Flambaugh, played by Peter Finch, stole a cross that was entrusted to Father Brown and was said to belong to Saint Augustine at that time. But Father Brown is more interested in getting Flambaugh back to his faith than seeing him committed to justice. Therefore, he is misleading the cops so that he can fulfill his mission. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but it was all too much for me to swallow. Father Brown, I would not want to say that he was guilty of the obstruction and should have been arrested. And he was not obliged not to reveal anything that he knew about Flambo; this man did not come to him as a penitent, seeking absolution and spiritual advice. <br /> <br /> Author G.K. Chesterton, a very famous Catholic layman in his time, considers all this very reasonable. Having led to his logical conclusion, we must replace all police forces with an army of priests. <br /> <br /> Guinness borrows from his own Rev. Ascoyne D'Askoun from Good Hearts and the Crownman and from Barry Fitzgerald in Father's Way to Go His Way Of course, Brown is much smarter than the other two. This image also has a bit of Colonel Nicholson. In Bridge over the River Qui, Guinness also played a character who, due to a rather strange interpretation of the rules, lost sight of what was important in the situation in which Nicholson was. <br /> <br /> Father Brown is an interesting guy when he deciphers secrets and makes the authorities look stupid. We liked Brother Cadfael doing this in a medieval setting, and the American audience liked Father Dowling, whom Tom Tom Bosley played a few years ago. <br /> <br /> This film was supposed to be interesting.
