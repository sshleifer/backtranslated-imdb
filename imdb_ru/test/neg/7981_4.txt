Recently I was in the stage version of this play. And on the last day of the run, I was excited to see that he would play on TV. I inserted the cassette, as it was late at night, and watched it the next day. I have to say that I was very disappointed. The actors in the film made several discoveries that are in the script. This is understandable, since the process of re-search is probably different, but it was frustrating to see. Many of the original scripts have been modified for the film to make it better for the screen, but I'm not sure if it helped the film at all. I gave these 4 stars only because I know the script, and the writing is much better than what the movie depicts.
