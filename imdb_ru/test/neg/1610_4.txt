The plot of The Stranger to some extent reflects the 1969 film Journey to the Other Side of the Sun (shot by Jerry and Sylvia Anderson from Thunderbirds and Space: 1999). The land of a parallel universe is a prerequisite for both films. But there is a difference. While the world in “Stranger” shows a totalitarian regime for suppressing the freedom of citizens, “Journey to the far side of the Sun” simply showed a true mirror world, where handwriting, roads, houses, cars of any kind and Of course, all internal organs were in the opposite ( or mirror) order. Thus, the similarity of the parallel Lands is the only connection of both films. <br /> <br /> Likewise, the series “The Land of Giants” preceded both of these films, which ran from 1968 to 1970. a world that was almost parallel to Earth, except that the planet was inhabited by giants, 12 times larger than the people who crashed. The idea of ​​a totalitarian government to seize and hold "little people" was more like the premise of "Stranger" than "JTTFSOTS". Perhaps because of LOTG, The Stranger series has been postponed. If he had turned into a TV series, it would have been a sci-fi version of The Runaway, where Glenn Corbett star was chased by villains from week to week, hiding in different places, etc. D. By the way, a stronger script could have helped this movie together.
