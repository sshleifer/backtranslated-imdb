I just watched this movie on DVD late in the morning and was so disappointed that I even thought it was a good joke for the audience. In other words - the creators planned to make the comedy is not dramatic. Anyway, at the end I realized that Mr. Tony Giglio takes this film very seriously. It is a pity because: dialogue is ridiculous, acting is poor and lifeless, history is a fairy tale! Poor Ryan Phillip - despite his best efforts, his character in the film is probably his worst performance! What can I say for Jason Statham - the lack of all kinds of skills to develop a role that is an imaginary invention ... For these reasons, I vote: 3/10
