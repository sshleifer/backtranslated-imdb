If you and your friends find as much humor and pleasure from the terrible acting, jokes, props and general making of films, like you and my friends, you need to rent it. <br /> <br /> From a simple reading of a string tag, seeing how funny it is, you must assume that it is no longer funny, of poor quality, great and fun. This is a story about children who defy all the laws of physics and reality and fly back in time with the help of a modern large-screen TV to the world of dinosaurs, who eventually become their friends. Not to mention the fun and serious scene where T-Rex becomes the father of one of the children. Yes ... <br /> <br /> This should be in the comedy section, but you will find it with children's films, if you find it at all. So call your friends, relax, relax, get ready to laugh and enjoy. You will quote funny horrible inserts in this film for several weeks. "What with all the noise ?!"
