This is a terrible film, hardly recognizable by the book, although they have similar plots. The time it takes to watch this movie (which is only 1.5 hours) will be much better spent doing something else, including watching grass grow. Adding poorly done fantasy scenes makes Katherine seem unbearably stupid. The actress, who plays Catherine, is also dizzy as all good and looks constantly surprised, even when she has to look lovingly into her Tilney's eyes. Fair!! The film ends with a scene similar to Catherine’s fantasy, where one cannot help but wonder whether this has happened, or if it’s just raving, and not in such a good way that makes you think, but in a completely horrible way, which basically sums up the terrible movie, The Only Good The movie thing is the name Miss Austin herself wrote. I generally love the production of BBC, but it's terrible.
