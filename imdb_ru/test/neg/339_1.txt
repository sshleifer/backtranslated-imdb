I really didn’t like this movie ~ !!!! it was boring and didn't interest me at all .. I'm more of a fighter, and he has NOTHING. I went and rented this film because of another comment that was left .. but was completely misled! Do not get this movie if you do not like dessert and a lot of boredom. I just really didn’t like the movie. it was not my style, but it could be yours ... you just need to watch a preview or something like that, but this is my recommendation, if you're a girl ... don't make this movie! This Scandinavian production relies on some of the Godfrey Reggio Koyaanisqatsi observational strategies, which allows us to reflect on the patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from both intimate and broad perspectives. it's just not for me!
