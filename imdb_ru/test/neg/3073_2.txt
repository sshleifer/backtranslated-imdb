Some films are made so badly that they can be watched solely by the deterrent factor. The disciples made me cringe so that it was uncomfortable. I watched all this, not believing what I was watching, didn’t anyone know how bad it was when they were filming? The combination of the most downtrodden performances from the most wooden actors, the terrible scenario in which every comment from all the “actors” sounded as if it came from the same character, and the most hasty editing that tried (and failed) to make the film character pace. All this is combined in a film that takes you several hours of your life and will not give anything in return. Avoid EVERY cost.
