Neil N Nikki is recognized as the best of the worst films of the year by Planetbollywood. It is hard to believe that the famous Chopras created this lousy movie. It was presented as a film for the whole family, but it turns out to be a ridiculous sex comedy. And it does not make you laugh, but the cry of boredom, and at the same time it does not have sexy girls to make the film look sexy. The title song is the most annoying song of the decade, I'm Neal, I'm a man, a rock star superstar. Udai Chopra - one of the worst Bollywood actors in all of history without acting talent. After making a lot of super flops and not getting a single film from the producer, not from his family. He gives a complete crap idea that tires you to death. Tanisha, who has always been and will be known as Kajola's sister, gives a terrible idea. Both actors have the most annoying chemistry, and they are very immature for their age. He has a special appearance from a very nice Richie Pollad in a pitiful role. The ending was so stupid and stupid, I can't believe that I actually paid the money to rent this shit.
