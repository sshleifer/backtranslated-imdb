When I saw 6.0 on IMDb, I was pretty impressed and thrilled to watch this movie, since 6 for a horror movie should be quite interesting. At first, I thought it would be some kind of disturbing, invisible evil force (not having read the book) to scare the audience - but it turns out to be something rather mundane - a killer of plants. Despite this, I am a rather open-minded person when it comes to films, so I thought that maybe the film would bring some kind of breakthrough on carnivorous vines. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he did not live up to my expectations due to an excessive amount of cliches and lack of originality. To top it off, the main character of the female continues to annoy you with his stupidity. If a movie is not a deliberately bad B-rated movie that entertains with mocking evil, no movie should ever have a protagonist annoying you if you expect the audience to take care of it. Such roles should be reserved for minor characters. The characters were undeveloped, the monsters (in this case, the plants) remained unexplained, and the cliches dripped everywhere. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is mildly effective is some bloody / bloody scenes, although the blood fades. compared to films like High Tension or Ichi The Killer. Sequential unsuccessful logic (for example, why a character does not follow the top of the rope during the second attempt to descend into the ruins when he just broke and almost killed someone), even if it is insignificant, it takes shape and just continues to annoy the audience. The film could save itself by using characters or some kind of plot device to reprimand or “redeem” idiotic characters who simply did something stupid (or at least allowed the character to recognize or regret their own mistakes). But the continuation of the resolution of idiocy, of course, will force the audience to abandon all care about the character, which, in turn, will eliminate the horror of the film. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a poorly made movie. An example of a well-made film in which twenty-small people were killed is a remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (and the prequel too), which certainly inspired fear and had far fewer flaws in logic. Thus, if you have a lot of time to kill, look at it if there is nothing else. Otherwise, do not waste your time with this film, and see something really scary and very pleasant, for example, a remake of The Hills Have Eyes.
