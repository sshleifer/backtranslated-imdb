I have to admit that I really liked the earlier episodes, but probably because I was younger and stupid at the time. I was a little excited about the return of the family guy, until I saw the “new” shit they were releasing. Not surprisingly, it was exactly like the old nonsense. There were all joking jokes, including flashbacks, except that this time they added a joke about an old creepy pedophile who seems to be in EACH ONE EPISODE. this is just one of the annoying family guys from whom the family lives, and for some reason people continue to look. no longer funny, just annoying. let it die. <br /> <br /> Perhaps at some point the family guy was funny, and cheap laughter and jokes were original and fresh, but now it’s not funny at all. if you really find a family guy funny, then you must be backward or borderline.
