Wow, even American Idol and “So you think you can dance” are now more adult material than WWE (at least there are many people at the auditions insulting the judges), but WWE is one of the worst steps in the history of television. turning into PG. Now, when I sometimes switch to see what happens, this is what I get: <br /> <br /> 1) Hornswoggle, an ugly dwarf sharing his space with the main evenings, apparently for no reason, except for excitement young fans and of course, in every fight he defeated Chavo Guerrero, an able wrestler. <br /> <br /> 2) Every week the invited host (damn it !!) spoiled a teaspoon of fun that was otherwise present. All these hosts are cheap B-rank celebrities, trying to eject again, glorifying horrible 5-year jokes and making silly references. <br /> <br /> 3) Cryme Time and the female wrestler (who forgot her name, most likely Eva) gives lessons on various “street” words (sobs) that are neither street nor cool. Previously, they had fun, stole and talked loudly. <br /> <br /> 4) Divas are dressed in invisible outfits, trying their best to look "sexy, smart and powerful" (by the way, I hate this catchphrase) Remember when Torrey, Trish and Sable were there? These were the times. Plus, these divas are bad fighters, which exacerbates the suffering. I saw some old WWE matches in the Vintage collection, and the divas were “professional” there, not a fan. <br /> <br /> 5) The movement of PG restricts so many things: almost no blood during matches, DX is terribly annoying, John Cena makes even more of his patriotism, the crowd, in which many children (who are so annoyed) have almost no heels and so on. <br /> <br /> 6) And yes, why so often keep PPV. Once a month they lose it? No real hostility or rivalry is created, and those that are made. Look fake and just-while-PPV-interrupts. <br /> <br /> 7) Vintage Michael Cole and several of his quotes: <br /> <br /> “Ladies and gentlemen, you are wat ching the longest TV show in history" (every week "<br /> <br /> "Brutal and cruel assault (he does not use it for anyone else) Randy Orton / Legacy" <br /> <br /> "Violent attack on Stephanie McMohan, Triple-H husband !!! ??? ???" WWE is almost on the verge of death, I hope that Vince gets up from his sleep and does something (returns TV-14 or an orientation era) 2 out of 10 for the current state of WWE.
