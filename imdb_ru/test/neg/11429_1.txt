Oh, here it is! A film that people say reminds me of the epic "Trainspotting". Oh, I was a fool to believe it, and OH, my buttocks hurt after I forced myself to watch this shit from beginning to end. After the first 10-15 minutes, I just wanted it all to end, or at least they could add a little nudity, action or a cool acid house to make it worth it ... But no, when I finished After that I put it on the shelf for the CD and I hope that I will never again have to choose it to show it to some friend who wants to see it so much that he / she does not want to listen to my warnings.
