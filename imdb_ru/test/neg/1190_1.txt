In the first 25 minutes of viewing, it became obvious that the writers really wanted to make a full-length film, and they probably probably liked the whole process, but then they seemed to forget the fact that this requires a decent plot! If the best thing they could do was to make 3 of the most stupid characters enter the real world and have “all kinds of funny capers,” then they would have to be left alone! I never laughed once, and all this “Adventures of Baron Munchhausen / Time Bandits” that took place in the middle was very, very poor! Valuable, contrived and very free. It just looked like a whistle that, in their opinion, could “work” by simply dragging it to some function. <br /> <br /> Full of holes, for example - the characters of Royston Vasey need the authors to continue writing in To save them, yet Jeff managed to enroll in the story / time filling William and Mary and the era. If he could do that, then why didn't they just continue to write Royston themselves? And listening to Herr Lipp? What was it for? I mean, what was the point? He did it, and we heard nothing more about it? <br /> <br /> My main point is that, although I loved the show, it was a poorly thought out, seemingly in a hurry project. Let's just say, the plot was so poor that if we didn't know the characters yet (and as a fan I had a certain loyalty to keep watching), and we relied solely on the plot itself, it would fall flat on the face! At best, it would have gone straight to the video, and at worst, it would never have been done in the first place! Or maybe it should be the other way around? Really awful ....
