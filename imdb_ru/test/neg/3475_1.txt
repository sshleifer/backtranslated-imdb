What a disaster! Usually, when someone criticizes a historical film, it is always fun to point out the inaccuracies that the authors usually add to create more “dramatic” situations. However, Imperium: Nero is a whole cleaner animal species. In this film, you try to find ANYTHING in general, as evidenced by historical records in the midst of nonsense and fiction, presented as the life of a bad boy-emperor of Rome. <br /> <br /> And it’s a pity, because Nero is one of the most interesting of all Roman emperors. His life was filled with enough turbulent events and interesting people to make a really good film. The producers of this mess chose another way, which only leads to the fact that any knowledgeable viewer scratches his head. <br /> <br /> A few examples: <br /> <br /> 1. Nero is depicted as a boy of 6-8 years old, when Caligula killed his father for treason, expelled his mother Agrippina and sent the boy up for education in the countryside . “Ten years later,” the story resumes shortly before the assassination of Caligula. Facts: Nero was born about six months after Caligula began his four-year reign, and he was only three years old when he was killed; Nero's father died of natural causes; Agrippina was briefly banished for bad behavior, not for treason; and Nero was not raised among the slaves, but he had the typical education of a young member of the imperial family. <br /> <br /> 2. Well, according to the authors, Nero is now about 16 years old when his great uncle Claudius becomes emperor (in fact, he is about to turn 4 years old); Agrippina will design the fall of Empress Messalina and marry Claudia, who adopts Nero. Then he goes to conquer Britain and was poisoned by Agrippina shortly after his victorious return. Nero was declared emperor, although he may still be only 18 or 19 years old. Fact: Claudius conquered Britain in 43 AD, two years after the beginning of his reign. He lived up to 54 years. Nero was supposed to be by that time 31 years in any normal chronology, but he actually ascended the throne at the age of 16 years. <br /> <br /> History tells us that then “Five Good Years” followed “where Nero ruled wisely and well under the tutelage of the philosopher Senek and Praetorian commander Burrus. This is shown - in some way - with the exception that Roman Senate as opposed to the good measures of Nero falsely. Senatorial opposition to Nero began only when he began to show signs of madness and began to kill senators for real or imaginary betrayal. <br /> <br /> 3. Mother Nero, Agrippina, is a controlling figure, who killed with of his husband-uncle, to make her son the emperor. After a while, Nero gets tired of her intervention and decides to kill her. In the film, he sends his minion Tigellin to kill her to death. and it was not easy for her. Nero tried to poison her three times, but she herself, like an old poisoner, was savvy with all this, and he failed. Then he tried to crush her to death, destroying the ceiling of her bedroom, but it also failed. Then he sent her on a journey on a ship that was intentionally built to fall apart and drown; when she descended, she jumped into the sea and swam to the shore. Finally, he stabbed her. Now showing everything that would definitely improve this movie! <br /> <br /> There are many other mistakes: Nero's mistress, Act, was not a childhood friend, she never rejected him, and there is no evidence that she became a Christian. Nero did not commit suicide, cutting his wrists, sitting on the shore of the lake. And so on. D. And so on. <br /> <br /> The sources of Nero's life are, first of all, the Roman historians Tacitus and Suetonius, both of whom belonged to the class of senators hostile to him and his memory. But the facts show that he remained very popular among ordinary people, unlike one of the last scenes where a crowd of vegetables threw him when he left the city to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> WHY are writers? and the producers take an interesting story with lots of good stuff for any movie and do THIS piece of shit? Oh, and I already mentioned how crappy kits and costumes were? Lol. <br /> <br /> One star, because there is no way to rate it below.
