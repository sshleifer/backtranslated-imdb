This is supposed to be based on _The_Woman_In_White_ Wilkie Collins, but the only similarity with this story was the names of the characters, the time period and settings. If they were going to change the story so carefully, I donâ€™t understand why they had to keep pretending that it came from Wilkie Collins. Go read the book. This is much better.
