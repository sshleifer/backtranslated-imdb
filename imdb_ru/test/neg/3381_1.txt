This "space fragment" was kind of stupid. I guess it should have been an unexpected shocker finale, but IMHO, it was just a huge disappointment. Joseph Campanella and other land related actors do an excellent job with this task; their performances are not justified by such a stupid ending. I donâ€™t know how this final could ever pass through any review by producers. Another comment here is not true, the language in the cheeks, vignette appeared only in the second season, this should be taken seriously! Producers and writers might be a little more creative with the finale to pay homage to the rest of the episode.
