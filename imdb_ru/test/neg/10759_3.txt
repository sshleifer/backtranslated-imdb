Although this series and, in particular, the mini-film, were very important at the time of release, I feel that the series as a whole was written rather poorly with a weak cast of actors. The essence of the problem is very well described, but it is difficult to understand and understand the problems in the film when the action and the script are not convincing enough (especially when watching a mini-movie). <br /> <br /> Also do not believe that this mini-movie or series has stood the test of time, as now many scenes are quite funny. Problems are still crucial, but Boys From The Blackstuff cannot fully help in understanding the problems in the UK in the 1980s.
