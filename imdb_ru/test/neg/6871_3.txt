And only one, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This reason is Margaret Leighton. She is a wonderful actress, both on stage and on screen. Although we have little chance to see her. I think this is especially true in the United States. <br /> <br /> Here she plays a sympathetic role. Not only that, but she is also very pretty and should be something of a bomb. <br /> <br /> Walter Pigeon does not support the traditions of Drummond performers. He is always reliable, but he is not very cheerful. He is not a villain or a crook. Consequently, this seemed to me a talkative matter with a small amount of action or expectation. But check it out for Leighton.
