Not only is the cover of VHS and DVD (at least in Europe) showing a scene that has nothing to do with the real plot of the film, the acting is so bad that the film calls for being laughed at. If you have nothing to do, you are with some good friends and want to make fun of the film, which should be serious, see Tycus and Peter Onorati, the person who will teach you how to beat the bad guys with empty cardboard boxes! Shame on Dennis Hopper, following the example of Travoltas, filming in his own "land of battle." For those who want to watch a good film about how the earth is being destroyed by a terrible force, please do not choose Tycus, but do yourself a favor and watch “Armageddon” 20 times already!
