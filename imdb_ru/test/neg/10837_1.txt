Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. In almost every way. <br /> <br /> I threw the DVD right into the bin - I didnâ€™t even think it would be fair to give it to the local thrift shop. <br /> <br /> The effects go beyond the joke. The dam control room looks like cardboard. Water looks beyond the scale with the background - nothing works. <br /> <br /> And then a sluggish plot appears - about the same depth as the Scooby-Doo cartoon. <br /> <br /> I could not wait until they drown.
