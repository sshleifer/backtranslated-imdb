What if someone shot a horror movie that was completely devoid of the plot? <br /> <br /> Well, I think he will most likely be a bit like this. I don't think I ever saw that the movement was so steady that its transition from being beaten (at the beginning) to full shit (towards the end). I just stuck to it, because I kept thinking that it could not be worse. Well, to the very end, Necrophagus / Cemetery of Horrors proved that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Who would suspect that a film with an undead lizard man, evil cultists, robbing graves, and crazy scientists, abandoned for no apparent reason, can suck this bad? You might think that at least there will be some meaning of humor ... but not here.
