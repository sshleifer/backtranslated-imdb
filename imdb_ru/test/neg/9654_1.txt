I bought it because it was $ 1.99, and Harry Carey was in it, and my friend was in it, and for $ 1.99, how bad could it be? Then I read here some of the comments on the film and started to get worried - maybe it really was a lost gem, one of those amazing little B-films that everyone forgot about, but which deserved resurrection. WRONG! I'm not sure how anyone else can compliment this thing that she received in some quarters here, but I found her one of the most tedious and frankly pathos-filled films I've ever seen. And I’m not talking about Richard Carlson’s crazy Texas accent (I think right from Georgia). This is just stupid. No one in the film behaves like a real person. No one. No one. And no one does anything believable or interesting. This is not even a cliche festival. It takes only more than 80 minutes of frames. It even made Harry Carey, Mary of the Assumption, and C. Aubrey Smith boring. Now it is incredible.
