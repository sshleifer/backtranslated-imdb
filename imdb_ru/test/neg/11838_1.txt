This film does not even deserve 1/10. This film was a scam. <br /> <br /> I swear that at least 30 minutes of the film were FREE copied from Carnosaur 1, 2 and 3. The whole Raptor film was based on the film, and it was a really pitiful attempt to become a copy of Thriller, Action, Dinosaur. I liked this series, and I see how it is shot in a film that cannot even afford or want to copy, without making its own models there - that’s what America is aiming for. I recommend that you watch the movie “Carnosaur the FIRST” (all of them), and then watch it and you will understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> Spencer
