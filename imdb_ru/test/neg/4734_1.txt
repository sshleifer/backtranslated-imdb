This is the worst film I've ever seen, and it takes the price of a rotten 2007 film (which I made), in any case, this film misses all the elements of a good movie, I mean, the actors had bad performance, the story is just crap. I am very, very disappointed, they could have done better than this piece of garbage. I just wasted my time and money on this film. I wish the production company could get my money back. In any case, I have high hopes for this film, and I am disappointed. I do not recommend anyone to watch this. so if you want to spend your money on something, do it on something else besides this garbage.
