I first saw this movie on a Saturday matinee, when I was very young. I thought it was cool, and often thought about it. Well, I finally flashed it to DVD. It was still very interesting, but different. This should be recognized as one of the silliest, wildest science fiction films of the 1950s. It seemed to be filled with a stock of military video. The dialogue is unnatural, and the effects are rough. There is one line of dialogue that made me sew up. The line that Jeff Morrow says while on the beach with the kid. Rent it if you need a movie to watch with drunk friends. This is a classic.
