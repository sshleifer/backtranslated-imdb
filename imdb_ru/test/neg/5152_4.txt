The story of the fair of brides is funny and fascinating, and, to the credit of the director, he is going to portray the rural Minnesota with the same respect that is usually inherent to the inhabitants of the coast. It is strange, however, to find an independent film, the brainchild of one person, as unusual and clich√© as a barbarian Hollywood bowler. <br /> <br /> Designed a portrait of rural residents. to be gentle, I think, but these characters do not sound believable to me - I ate quite a lot in the canteens, but never heard of the merits of various 19th century English writers.
