Drab, wistful and a complete waste of my time. The plot is incomprehensible (so do not think about it too much). The game is strange and wooden - I would swear that they were all professional bodybuilders trying to play luck, but it can be an insult to bodybuilders. There are no interesting special effects to rescue this catastrophe, but a lot of fires, explosions, useless sex scenes, etc. The only thing that caught my attention was that this happens after the war between the USA and Iraq, which somehow becomes nuclear. ..hmmm Is Roger Korman a psychic? Hopefully, “Iraq” was simply a good choice for Korman and that the rest of his script did not come true. <br /> <br />
