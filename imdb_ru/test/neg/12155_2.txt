Worst movie I've seen in the last 12 months. The plot of this story was not interesting, the film ended when he became Gingesh Khan, I always thought that something really interesting happened later. I knew that in Mongolia and in all areas where the film was played, there were beautiful landscapes, but the film did not benefit from this. The jokes there are really poor. The narrator, Gingesh himself, could tell a little more about the history of Mongolia, traditions, etc. My interlocutor did not know anything at all, so he was a little confused. I was looking forward to seeing this film, but I was still very disappointed. It was one of three films that I had ever seen in a movie, where I decided to go all the way.
