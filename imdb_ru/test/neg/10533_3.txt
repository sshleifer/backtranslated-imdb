Half Past Dead was unlike any Steven Seagal film I've ever seen. Very little Segal, himself in action, and I agree with the last review I read, Nia Peeples steals the show. <br /> <br /> I didnâ€™t see anything truly new here, just the same old stuff from other films has changed a bit. Nii had the best fighting scenes when she kicked her ass again. It was interesting to see her as a bad guy after watching her for two seasons on Walker, a Texas Ranger who is still awake, but for the good guys. <br /> <br />
