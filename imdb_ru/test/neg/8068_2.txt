so if a guy meets you and says: “I want you to look at my erection!” don't be alarmed, maybe he wants you to watch a movie he made about how his house should have been built. Yes! this is the only thing that happens in this movie! it's like the worst Warholian SOUND I've ever seen! it’s like taking off the inside of your toilet before you wash it, in fact it’s less interesting to look at it. <br /> <br /> But if you watch Lennon's Erection, keep in mind that he knows a lot about the noise in him too. I mean, really, as if the building is attacking cosmic mutants from hell or something like that! At the same time, construction in progress is growing, since an erection can also do this (in almost 20 minutes, what an achievement). <br /> <br /> so if someone asks you to watch his erection, make sure he wants to take it all off on video.
