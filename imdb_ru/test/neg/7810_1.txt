I was intrigued by the nasty character of the boss, since I myself and the daughter of this boss were attractive, and it was interesting to see even younger Ashton Kushner, but this film is so childish that I had to turn it off. Watching this was a waste of time. When people started peeing around the living room, there was too much to watch. A painful, terrible shit movie. If they only softened it a little. Are there really people who find this funny and like it? I was glad to know that IMDb readers rated it so low. A career in history was intriguing, as was the young man who tried to get a promotion and win bosses. I liked this part. In addition, the initial scene with colleagues in the train was cool, because I like the characters of his colleagues. If you can sort out meaningless movies or you are quite young, then this may be one that you can digest.
