Someone told me that Pink Flamingo was, in a word, "insane." Now I doubt if this guy has ever seen this, because I would not sum it up in one word. Disgusting, absurd, more disgusting ... do it. Every time you think it can't get dirtier, it is. One of my favorites was when the Divine had her birthday party, and when the police came to bust her, they were killed and eaten by guests. I admit that this is one of those films where it's so grotesque that you just can't look away, but this is by no means a creative work of art. This is just a shocking value. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the guys from Jackass look like a bunch of pussies.
