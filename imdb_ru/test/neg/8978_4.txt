Although it was the first documentary by Hunter S. Thompson, I saw it at best on average, despite the participation of such huge stars as Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Gary Busey and some others. I was disappointed with this, and yet it was a bit interesting. What made me look was some of the old Fear and Loathing clips in Las Vegas and Where the Buffalo Wander. Not very good, mainly due to the fact that the old guys are wandering and everything that any fan already knows. I still think they milked it, because it could be compressed at least by half. However, if you are a fan, I would like everything related to the hunter. with respect
