When A Killer Calls should be the biggest robbery released by Asylum so far We are talking about a sex nurse on duty who receives terrible calls from a creepy voice who constantly asks her: “Have you checked the girl?” Naturally, the police are tracking calls (after how they had to perform some really unnecessary tasks - hang up when “he” calls, wait ten seconds and dial * 57). Sounds familiar? Yes, so I rented it too. <br /> <br /> Well, that should be it. And I hate to say it, but it could be more exciting than shit on the big screen, which was released at about the same time, if not for one fatal mistake - instead of reveling in the glory of the B-film robbery, tried to do something original. She tried to arouse sympathy in the protagonist, instead of playing a funny cliché with her. Keep in mind, this might work with a talented actress. But she was not. Of course, she looked good, and she screamed and cried, but. oh well whatever. <br /> <br /> Then came the terrible end. Not horror in that it was terrible, horror in that it was boring. Walking up to this point (about an hour) was indecent, cliché and fun. He then moves in a different direction and deviates from yet another silly, funny slash film with a sexy “teenage” actor in the movie “Hostel-Esq. Borefest”. <br /> <br /> I guess this is “Well, okay, in any" category. The main actress failed? Well, okay, whatever, I do not want to take it off. Did we forget to give the killer motivation? Well, okay, whatever, I do not want to rewrite it. Does the pace change completely halfway? Oh well, I do not want to shave for fifteen minutes. Errors of succession? Well, okay, whatever. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie (stupid, trashy, predictable, obscene movie with sex actors), then everything will be fine until the very end. The end is stupid, it’s not fun, it’s not scary, it’s not picky, it’s not silly, or it’s evolving quickly. In fact, it was almost exactly five minutes until the character did nothing but was connected (and this is not a spoiler, because he was on the back of the DVD) and looked at things in the room, then shouted and. , , no difference.
