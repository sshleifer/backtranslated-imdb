worst. movie. ever did. EVER. I have no words to say about it .. otherwise, then it really did not make any sense, no conspiracy, no ... nothing. just shit !!! I don’t know how everyone in the film didn’t shoot the shelves after watching this movie .... .... .... ... .. I love vampire films and riddles, and I alternate abstractions outside the movie boxes and .. .. it was not one of those. I mean, what the fuck !!! I can't even tell you what the film is about, because I still don’t know, and I just spent an hour and a half of my life watching it ... The bottom line ... I think the creator of this film just wants for everybody to do drugs. this is the only thing i got from this movie. please don't watch this ... I mean, for the "stifling sensual vampire click" there wasn’t even the expected nudity you get from a vampire click. anyway, back to my point of view ... this film is blowing. go set yourself on fire instead .... .. ..
