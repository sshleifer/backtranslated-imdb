This is another one of those films that I just knew I would hate, but in the end it was not as bad as one would expect. <br /> <br /> It has a lot of T & A and even a DVD menu full of female breasts. In the first few scenes of the film there was a lot of sex and nudity, and I was starting to think that there would be no story just using nudity to make money on the popular prequel 8MM. <br /> <br /> While I was still watching, there was more sex and naked people and main characters that I did not care about, but then the story began to unfold, and I began to understand the meaning of all this, and it was a little better. <Br /> <br /> This is a man whose fiancé is Ambasador’s daughter, and they all have a promising future, until nude photos of heroes appear and there’s no sender card in the jokes. The man and his fiance should now understand who sent the photos and how to shut them up. <br /> <br /> The film, first of all, has nothing to do with part 1, it doesn’t even have everything related to 8MM about the sexual video, although I can see similarities, however small they may be. <br /> <br /> The game is neither good nor bad, just no one plays the role that anyone can play. The value of film production is the middle of the road and its pure dramatic yawn. <br /> <br /> I really liked to go on a journey to understand the motives of the blackmailers. I expected answers that were much more than I could say for the first one, which I consider garbage. In this film, there are nice turns, which are always welcome. <br /> <br /> This is not very good, and very slowly, but ultimately entertains. I have not been on the edge of my place, and I will not rave about my friends, that this is a must-see, but, hey, if you watch a lot of movies and are always looking for something new, it can entertain you for 90 minutes.
