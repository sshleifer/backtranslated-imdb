I bought a DVD of this movie because I'm a fan of William Devane, and I was very disappointed with the “Christmas guest”. The plot of the film is so boring and slow during development that you just want to turn off the TV or DVD player after about half of it. The conversations are really bad and relate to the daily soap opera, but not in a television film. William Devane was fine on his part, and he behaved quite well, but he did much better in other films and projects. Meredith Baxter was terrible and could not really bring the audience a warm spiritual mother. Instead, she played very cool and was no better than a middle-class actress. I absolutely can not recommend this movie. Leave your time and money for it.
