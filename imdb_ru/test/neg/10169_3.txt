The owner of an antique shop in New York, played by Joan Wally (Valerie Alston), will stand trial by a jury of the US District Court in the case of the famous mafia Armand Asante (Rusty Pirona), and most of this very slow movie revolves around trying to make Pirona try to make Wally justify him in the murder, threatening to kill her son and himself. This is followed by many actions, including horrendous mobs of mobs, in which the mediator is Willam Hurt. Much of this stupid, incoherent confusion surrounds the obsession of Hurt and Asante Wally, the scenes in the courtroom that we all saw again and again, and the incredible finale. 3/10 is likely to be easy on this waste of time.
