This is a joke, right? Can't it be a real movie? Is it not even a real video? Give any Harvey Milk High School child a video camera and he can make a movie better than this one. The director can't be serious ... right? Is that a satire? Comedy? Did the drama go wrong? The script is as focused and boring as possible. Ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop can come up with a better script. The dialogue is not clichéd. Cliche conversations can raise this festive mess to something like a fun-filled camp holiday - but this is not the case. Worst of all, the hostess wanders around the dramatic scene in a private apartment, dressed in a bathrobe with a frying pan, like something from the episode of “Just Married”. Whaaa ??? I have seen the best play in high school theater clubs. One of the findings is attractive, the other is not. Both can not even convincingly kiss. So much for romance. Supportive players are tremendously exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Everything is underlined by a disgusting soundtrack, and the sound seems to have been recorded in the back room toilet. Much of the dialogue (fortunately) is unintelligible. <br /> <br /> This stale cinematic cupcake isn’t even worthy of being the next ROCKY HORROR or MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 festive release. It's just bad. In every way. VISIONS OF SUGARPLUMS will not dance in your head - they will crush all your expectations. Have an eggnog and look mindlessly at the neighbor's festive lights - it will be better spent time.
