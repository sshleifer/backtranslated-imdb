This film is a big disappointment. Director Vicente Aranda has provided many interesting films for his long career, some of them were marked by strong and powerful actions of the Spanish actress Victoria Abril. In JUANA LA LOCA, he also relies on a gifted actress, newcomer Pilar López de Ayala, but this is perhaps the only positive element in the horrible mess of the film. While Lopez de Ayala is struggling to portray Juana as a romantic and passionate young woman, completely obsessed with love for her handsome husband, it seems that she could not develop her character because of this one-dimensional feature; Juana was an important figure in Spanish history, and the politics of the time was important in her story ... but here she is presented as the romantic leading lady from the soap opera; this is very unfortunate, and the film lacks the ability to show how personal life can influence history and vice versa. Worst of all, Italian actors Daniele Liotti and Manuel Arcuri find themselves in very poor performances, which in the case of Liotti presents a real problem, as he portrays Felipe el Hermoso, a key part in this story. It seems an obvious choice to attract a young audience, as they both look like the top models of this era. On the other hand, talented actors, such as Giuliano Gemma and Rosana Pastor, are completely wasted on supporting roles, clearly underdeveloped. Even if it was a film with a large budget, little attention was paid to creating a good script or creating “periodic plays” on the screen. The costumes are especially grotesque in some group scenes, as if they were taken from the source material, without regard to real consistency. In general, the main problem with JUANA LA LOCA (and this is what makes the difference with such excellent historical films as LA REINE MARGOT or ELIZABETH) is the lack of a director's point of view. This is a strange turn in the career of Aranda, since he was able to develop it in other works (I remember LIBERTARIAS and AMANTES), creating very personal and interesting films, while this JUANA is really nothing more than an ordinary academic part of history. good at it!
