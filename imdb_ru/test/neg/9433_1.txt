Get acquainted with Cosmo (Jason Priestley), a knowledgeable young bookmaker, happy with his boring, crispy life number for the crowd and living in a harsh basement apartment in the center for the elderly. His only entertainment is to watch TV and sometimes meet his freaky prostitute boyfriend, Hani (Janine Garofalo). But one day everything will change when the mafia boss is killed and the respected Cosmo is chosen as a sleek and convincing new chef Gordon (Robert Loggia) to become a full-fledged killer. This proposal, which reluctantly Cosmo cannot repeat, cannot refuse, and he quickly changes his worldly, lonely existence for an accelerated course of revenge under the tutelage of veteran bandit Steve (Peter Rigert), a relaxed, suburban buddy who enjoys the maximum work pay and minimal clock. In the blink of an eye, Cosmo surprises himself and his mentor Steve, demonstrating an absolutely strange inclination to work. Although he had never touched a weapon before, Cosmo turns out to be a well-aimed shooter and, after an initial wave of moral hesitation, a tough, aloof killer. Soon, Cosmo sends out ruthless customers with speed and style, and his natural talent with a gun quickly makes him an invaluable addition to Gordon's mob. <br /> <br /> Reality interferes, although one night, while massaging honey, Cosmo admits that she feels a little agitated, and she recommends him to try yoga to relax. Cosmo accepts her advice and joins a nearby yoga class led by a beautiful young woman named Jasmine (Kimberly Williams). Cosmo is instantly addicted to kind and gentle Jasmine, who is soon drawn to Cosmo. Now, if she can just get rid of her annoying, insulting guy, Randy (Josh Charles), maybe she and Cosmo can really start something. Cosmo, using some of the "skills" of his new profession, finally convinces Randy to disappear, and his relationship with Jasmine begins to develop. <br /> <br /> Writer / director M. Wallace Volodarksy, twice Emmy Award. The winner for his work in The Tracy Ullman Show and The Simpsons created a script that combines his three genre addictions: “I like comedies, gangster films and romances,” explained Volodarsky, “so I essentially broke all three to create this film "But he came up with a film so scattered and incredible that it looks like a very long sketch on Saturday Night Live. His monotonous tone doesn’t so much coincide with a sense of humor, but rather emphasizes the fact that Jason Priestley spent a lot of money on a car to blithely ruin His pretty image of a guy who doesn't even fully succeed, because he plays his character not as a nerd, but as a laconic zombie. A nerd can be naive, but a nerd has a passion. A passion for internally directed things. But Priestley plays his character as mentally retarded, almost anti-Forrest Gump. Unfortunately, Coldblooded doesn’t make sense to BE an anti-Forrest Gump. <br /> <br /> Peter Rigert (local hero, Animal House), usually plays great, and Kimberly Williams tries his best with what She has to work, but Jane Garofalo (Larry Sanders show from HBO) is practically lost in the role of Cosmo's friend. Probably not for long. Garofalo has all the enthusiasm and charm of an apple waiting to be taken away, and it is only a matter of time when she gets a meaty role, we hope that I will make a command mark with Marisa Tomei. <br /> <br />
