Necessary Rudeness (1991) was a bad comedy / drama that, at every level, tried to be a serious college football film. Many current and former superstar athletes appeared in this performance during one of the comedic scenes of the film. Besides this is a very mediocre film. They were just supposed to create a direct comedy full of realism. Instead, the filmmakers are trying to play in both fields, and they find themselves on the short end of the stick. When will someone make a decent student football film that will be fun and realistic? <br /> <br /> Not recommended, unless it is free on tv.
