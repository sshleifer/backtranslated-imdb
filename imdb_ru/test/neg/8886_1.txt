We rented a movie, and this is probably the worst movie ever. On the box they had in the video store, on the cover was a cool looking monster, but in reality he was a creature from a black lagoon mask. Awful, terrible, terrible ... you may actually have to rent it, it's so bad. It feels like you're watching a weird home movie.
