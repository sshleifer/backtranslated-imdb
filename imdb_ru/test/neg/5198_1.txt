Yes, dumb is the word for this actress. I know that many mentioned her beauty, but it seemed to the viewer that her empty-headed and boring woman was looking at her with her bleached hair, lip gloss and not so perfect body. See how she goes in these jeans, showing a rather big ass. Her ass extends over the shoulders. What does this tell you? As for the leader, who was played by the great Mark Humphrey, he was superbly played. The Exorcist However, he and Lancaster simply did not match. She was out of place in front of this beautiful guy. Good game Susan Glover as sisters. Angela Galuppo played a small role and was fine. But film director Philip Gagnon spent too much material on Lancaster. After a while you are tired of looking at her and watching her dull acting ability. And what a bitch she was a wife. Watching her husband, be nasty to him and just spoiled by a boy. I was happy to see her hit by a dart. I thought it might be the end of it. But, alas, the script tells us the opposite. After the torment and re-observation of this loser, I continued to criticize. Lancaster is boring to watch. This time around her hair guys. Her hair constantly on the face, constantly throwing them back, began to annoy. I question the writer, the reason for Alexandra Komisaruk, why a good-looking rich man, such as Philip, would even worry about such mischief as Allison. When there were so many attractive smart women, with class, to choose from. He chooses nothing. Is this Rochester / Jane Eyre? Well, okay, the whole matter of taste, I guess. This Sarah Lancaster is not my cup of tea, guys.
