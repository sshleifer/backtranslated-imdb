Sex, drugs, rock and roll, without a doubt, the worst product of Western civilization. Monologues are both uninteresting and meaningless. In a rare monologue that attracts the attention of the audience, he is quickly lost due to excessively long repetition and unnecessary additions (recalls “Hell's Angels at McDonalds”). The length he considered justifying the price of admission. <br /> <br /> I would rather sleep with my aunt and be hanged upside down and drained of my blood than see Sex, Drugs, Rock and Roll again.
