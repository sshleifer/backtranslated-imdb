Of course, this is the worst Halloween movie. The game is bad, with the exception of Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasant. The girl who played Kara (forgot her name) was fine, but overall this film was mostly a big disappointment. Nothing moved the story forward; it lacked content, and it scared what made Halloween and H20 so good. All and all, skip this movie, it is not worth the cost of rent.
