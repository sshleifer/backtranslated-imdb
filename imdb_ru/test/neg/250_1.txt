Despite the fact that I have a very nice leading lady (Rosita Arenas, one of my boys in love), acting and directing are examples of what should NOT be done during the filming of the film. <br /> <br /> Located in southern Mexico, Popoca Aztec Mummy (by the way, the real Aztecs did not make mummies) was awakened by leading characters and begins to create problems in the suburb of Mexico City during the first film (Aztec mummy). In the second part, the lead man and woman want to find the mummy and put it in the final resting place (a fireplace would be my first choice ...) <br /> <br /> In this appears The Bat, a criminal brainless stereotype of criminal genius who creates A “robot person” (some idiot inside a robot suit) to control Popok and (get it) take over the world. The final match between the robot and the mummy is fun, this is one of the worst choreographies ever seen. The funny thing is that this film was shot and released a serious Mexican film studio! <br /> <br /> Playing the movie in Spanish is just as awful as it is in English (they called excessive playing!). You should watch this movie through MST: 3000. Comments are even funnier.
