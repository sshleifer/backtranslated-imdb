Sideshow is a good example of a very interesting idea that went completely wrong. As for horror films, and especially because of the influx of films about teenagers, a film based on a group of teenagers attending a mysterious weird show is something you can have a lot of fun with. <br /> <br /> However, the writer decided to make a very straightforward, very boring, very simple story about five teenagers who become part of the show when an angry dwarf Abbot Graves turns them into freaks, using some kind of pathetic car, turning them into beasts. <br /> <br /> Five teenagers are selected one by one until the last guy leaves, and his “punishment” is that he cannot join his friends and, thus, “stay alone” . What a load of trash! <br /> <br /> “The actors” are really poor, there’s no comedy in this film (and it could be so funny!), no blood (and it could be so terrible!), no action and no horror (and be so much!) <br /> <br /> The director failed in his duty to even try to make it a little interesting to watch. His experience in the soft-core obviously deprived of his creativity, since all the frames were the same, with very few edits and little movement. The quality is generally poor. <br /> <br /> I am not prone to nudity in the movies, but believe me, the only vivid feature of this film was a pair of breasts.
