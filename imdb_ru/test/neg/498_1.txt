Critics love this movie. I personally found it pointless and tasteless. This is the millionth time when I fell into the trap of "critics love it" and went out, wanting someone to throw boiling water into my balls, because it was less painful than watching a movie. There are many scenes that are completely unnecessary. Warning for animal lovers: Do not watch this film if you do not want sheep to be killed and molested. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good Asian film, see “Africa”. If you want to watch a film about escaped convicts, take a look at the classics of Gene Wilder / Richard Pryor Steer Crazy. Avoid 9 souls like the plague.
