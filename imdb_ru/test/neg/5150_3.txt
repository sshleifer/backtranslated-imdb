This film started from scratch, but it had to be with an imperious mother, a witch-rival and an indecisive beauty queen, who always goes in second place. There was some stupid reappraisal, and a few implausible plot points (does she take second place in EVERY single contest? ALL of them?) Unfortunately, the film suffers terribly from the need, well, to be a television movie. Instead of ending at the end of the film, with a funny twist, in which (almost believably) the killer is revealed, the film continues for another twenty minutes, just to make sure that justice has triumphed. Of course, now that the killer is revealed, she suddenly undergoes a complete personality change - her character is completely rewritten, because the scriptwriters no longer need to keep her identity a secret. Cheese is completely drowned in what could otherwise be a ridiculously funny movie.
