Plants in the ancient structure of the Mayan pyramids kill everyone who comes. Yes, it is strange, because travelers do not understand, until everyone starts to go crazy. And in such a film, I just wanted it to be absurd when the marching groups attacked the plants owning the machete. <br /> <br /> In any case, a group of people from America is resting and going to the mountains with a couple of other newly minted German friends who know about the place. When they got there, the Mayas began to shout at them and hide in the building. And when this happened, then the plants decided to remove them, imitating the noise of a cell phone, people and dead people of the ancient Maya. <br /> <br /> There was nothing terrible in the film and it wasnâ€™t even entertaining. Even a strange ending could not save this piece of shit. I kept looking for something really good, but nothing. Well. "F"
