I saw it at a late, late, late, late show, when MST3K was just a shimmer in the eyes of Joel Hodgson. I had the honor of seeing this, not knowing exactly how bad it would be. I did not know that a woman with an arrow in her chest could run “to the edge of the earth” in about an hour and a half (thank God, her father gave such specific instructions), and then spend a few days to return to her. lock using. I did not know that a barbarian type sword could crash into a forest and create a hanging bar and explosive powder bombs in less than 30 seconds. I had no idea how fragmented a movie could be. <br /> <br /> This is bad, children, very bad. If you like bad movies, go for it.
