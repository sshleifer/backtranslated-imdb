If you look like me and see the original Benji phenomenon from afar, finally seeing the film for the first time 30+ years later, you may be shocked to discover how terrible it really is, and even more puzzled by its popularity. in 1974. <br /> <br /> My judgment is not entirely objective, since I tend to treat films with a positive bias and for this reason greatly weaken them. On the other hand, I have always hated this particular dog, a feature of the past two seasons Skirts Skirts. Never a big show, the early episodes without dogs were at least a good demonstration of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog, reducing their screen time. <br /> <br /> Benji - a 86-minute mega-dose dog followed him in several daily circles in the city of McKinney, Texas. If this sounds boring, you would be advised to give birth to "Benji" widely and never allow the remote control to fall into the hands of a "Benji" fan (if there are any). <br /> <br /> Unlike “My Dog Skip”, “Monkey Business” or “Because of Winn-Dixie,” actors in the cast are extremely weak. "Big Valley" Peter Brek plays the standard strict father and seems confused by the idea of ​​the appearance of something such a settler. <br /> <br /> If one of your children (of any age) thinks that Benji is entertaining you, you should think about reducing their medication. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
