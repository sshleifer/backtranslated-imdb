How? I wondered why I did not see it in cinemas or even in advertising, and then, seeing the film, I realized that I was deceived by HARDCOR. I'm a big Transporter fan, and a big Blade fan, so when I saw this, I imagined a scene of a killing fight between two teasers, many skirmishes, a whole bunch of things. Instead, I got a short cameo film by Ryan Phillip from Statham and Snipes. The guy who makes audio and video in the crime lab got more screen time than Wesley. It was like making a film with Jackie Chan, waiting for a bunch of kung fu and getting Erin Brokavich. I expect bad movies from Hollywood, but actors like Snipes and Statham should be better for fans.
