Oooh, MAN, this movie is terrible! <br /> <br /> This kind of jokes give Canadian cinema a bad name or not. Well, to be honest, I think most Canadian films give Canadian cinema a bad name. <br /> <br /> Next to the characters (there are a couple that are the most annoying in movie history), the most annoying thing is editing and the pace of the movie. It's like a drunk snail wading to death. <br /> <br /> Thank God, it’s nice to look at Melanie Doan. She is the only thing that made me look. Unfortunately, the rest of the film continued to be interrupted. <br /> <br /> However, for laughter, if you have a bad evening in Canadian cinema. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Melanie? Dawn? The only good point is (too bad that they didn’t make sense to keep the camera on it for longer than a moment). <br /> <br /> Another addition to Canadian Hall of smelly films.
