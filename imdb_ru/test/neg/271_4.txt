The people who shot this film were looking for him as cool and attractive as the first, and this is not so. This film was supposed to be the exact opposite of Ocean’s 11th anniversary. This was talked about by many actors, as well as director Steven Soderberg. Ocean 12, although it lacked an exciting plot, collapses because it was different from what people wanted. If he had been released before the 11th Ocean, he would have been perceived differently, and not as an unfortunate continuation. The problem with sequels is that people come to him with a predetermined idea of ​​how it should be, and have many expectations. They should enter this film with an open mind and not expect it to be “11 in the ocean” again.
