The only good thing about this movie is that I now have a movie on the worst list. Rest Stop being at the end of the spectrum where I can compare all horrible movies. In fact, this film is the worst plot, the worst director, throughout the film, all I wanted to do was pull out my hair and kick the writer and anyone who made this film a possible ass. I deployed a soldier, and when I spend my precious downtime, I watch these movies. These people must feel terrible, they had to watch it before it came out, and must have been too lazy to repeat, after they noticed that it was fucking sucked. I am so amazed that our great country allows them to create another. Honestly, I commented on the film for the first time, I had to tell the world not to waste my time. Remove this movie from the face of this planet. It makes us people look backward.
