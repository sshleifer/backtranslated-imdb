Code 46 is one of those science fiction films where the government controls who you can love and will actually punish you if you try to give birth to the wrong person. The possessors and the have-nots live in completely different territories, the forces that can remove your memories, etc. We have already seen this before, but this is normal - no film is 100% original. This kind of background is always interesting to consider. Unfortunately, just presenting such a future is more interesting than viewing Code 46. Characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting. It may be a commentary on a dehumanized future, but it’s still boring to look at it. It is sloppy. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the images are good, but usually (in combination with the “memorable” soundtrack) they just look like famous perfumery advertisements. Code 46 also sometimes uses the kind of camera that annoys me. You know, two characters are talking, and the camera shamelessly "floats" on one side. Two seconds later, he swims on the other side of them in a vain attempt to keep your attention. <br /> <br /> This film was liked by my friends. If they tried to make me see it again, I probably wouldn't have done it if they had not agreed to pay me $ 50.
