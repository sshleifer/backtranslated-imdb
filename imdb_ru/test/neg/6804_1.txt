I haven't heard too much about this movie, so I went and saw it. I realized that this film attracts only those who did not live in the real world. And even these people think that this movie is moving too slowly. <br /> <br /> When the film opens, you see Nicole Kidman going to the nudist camp. Wow. Shock. This scene, the dialogues, were great. And then the film went down. <br /> <br /> Although I respect the vision that the director should have, this film sucks. It was too slow, too predictable and not enough moving. Robert Downey Jr., as usual, is great, but this film is not good enough to sit down. He tries to be shocking and abnormal, but he uses the talents of all the actors badly. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money, even the sex scenes were boring.
