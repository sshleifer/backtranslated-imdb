Dogmatist, as described by another reviewer, is the right word. The idea of ​​the director was to present Bach without a plot, game, fun, theater, dialogue, narration, or drama. Mission accomplished, Monsieur Straub. "Pretentious?" Yes. "Cinematic?" Never. This is an anti-movie. Nobody moves. Hardly anyone says. The camera takes static pictures for 10-12 minutes at a time: very rarely does the camera get into it. You can catch a glimpse of Gustav Leonhardt's fingers moving along the keys. That's all. <br /> <br /> If you like the idea of ​​staring at the back of the harpsichordist for 7 minutes while listening to Bach, this film is for you. I'd rather listen to Bach on my stereo with my eyes closed.
