I am glad that I did not expect too much when I saw this continuation of one of my favorite children's films. The storyline was boring and unconvincing, like the characters, and I was disappointed that some of the characters in the original were not in this sequel. I also did not think that the characters themselves were similar from the previous film. Charlie has changed, and now he has a girlfriend. In the first film there was good music, but the music in this film was memorable. In short, this film just did not do it for me. And looking at the reviews of other users, it seems that he did not do this for many of you. It is not worth watching.
