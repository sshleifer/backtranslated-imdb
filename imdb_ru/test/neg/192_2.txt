Sadness was the emotion that I felt after the screen went dark. Puzzled, was different. Why would two experienced vets, such as Mattau and Lemmon, sign up for this putrefactive project? I got the impression that they did not read the script before the cameras began to rotate. The whole cast is wasted in this unfunny, uninteresting and unimpressive film. Unfortunately, it was one of the latest elegant projects of Edward MÃ¼lar, here as heavy. Diane Cannon tries, Hal Linden looks bored, Donald O'Connor reads a few lines of profanity. (?? !!) I'm not from the Legion of Decency. I want to say that they were cast out because they heard him using obscene language. This is a desperate attempt to bring into the picture "humor". In fact, he really delivered the film only a piece of pleasure, although he walked along the dance floor. I leave my harshest criticism for leadership. Walter Mattau should have known better. He still gives excellent solo performances (IQ, Dennis The Menace, etc.). His character, although affable, rather dull and one-dimensional. I saw him once, I saw him all. Jack Lemmon gives another one of his trademark, sad, "damn sensitive" male portraits. When he starts this mode, I gladly want to give him a box of napkins. OUT TO SEA is terribly unmixed, and the one who made this mess must be forced to walk on the board.
