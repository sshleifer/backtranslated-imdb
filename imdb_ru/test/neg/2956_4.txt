Anna Christie (Greta Garbo) returns to her father Chris (George F. Marion) 15 years later. He is the skipper of the boat, and she remains to travel with him. During this time, she meets Matt (Charles Bickford), and they fall in love. Matt and Chris do not see face to face, and Anna has a secret to confess ..................... <br /> <br /> What a boring story ...... everything starts badly with George F. Marion and Marie Dressler playing drunkards in the bar. The scene goes on forever, and they are both terrible. They are also difficult to understand. In fact, it's hard to understand the whole cast. I missed entire sections of the dialogue between Bickford, Marion and Garbo, because it is incomprehensible! Garbo is obviously something special, as you attract her every time she appears on the screen, and her presence gives this film the 4 stars I gave him. But in reality, nothing happens - it's a boring story with terrible accents. You will be good not to sleep.
