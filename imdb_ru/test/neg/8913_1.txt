I like to watch Steven Seagal's films not because of the huge holes in the plot, but only because it makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> Oh, it makes me laugh so much that this film is completely meaningless and is ridiculous compared to this film Pearl Harbor Rock !!! Ben Affleck doesnâ€™t need an acting school at all, just to give the impression of how bad it is. <br /> <br /> First, there are so many stupid things and bad behavior, and it only gets worse when Stephen tries to get out of prison. First, the helicopter lands on a security notice, and they make them land, when they suddenly fly off, when the guard suddenly starts shooting <br /> <br /> or when he killed that guy in the car, he and Treych both leave, you cant See oil on the ground behind him, Stephen notices that there is oil, not even watching the crackling light a lighter, and the car explodes. <br /> <br /> and many more stupid things, Stephen uses his main action when someone points a gun at him, he grabs it and shoots him completely garbage !!! like some gangster would let that happen. <br /> <br /> On the fight scene in the open-air prison, the game is also very bad, and Stephen is clearly waiting for it to take effect, just rewind it a couple of times and you notice that the game is bad <br /> <br / > it just makes me laugh, I hope that one day he will come to the cinema here in Holland, then I will go there with as many friends as possible just to laugh at myself to death
