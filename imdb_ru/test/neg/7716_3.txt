If you have not seen the first, you should at least know someone who has, and you should know that it was painful to sit. There was simply nothing good to say about it at all. So what is different from the second? Why make a sequel for a film that was lame? This one does not take itself too seriously. He knows that this was done for television and is not trying to impress with a big or serious dialogue. There are moments when he tries to become “serious” or “tense”, but these moments are so banal that you have to laugh. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, any elements of Uwe Boll and any hint that this came from a video game (except for the name of course) have disappeared. Do not enter this film, expecting something that is worth mentioning to your friends, unless they are not in the camp, do not lose in films about zombies, or are not interested in drinking the game from this film. Take two pictures when the character Ed Quinn mentions his dead brother! Take one shot whenever a bullet is better placed in the head of a zombie, instead of punching three in the chest! etc.
