This film may have some historical significance, and, of course, it is surprising how well the facts are together, the setting, the rocket, the spacesuits, the surface of the moon, everyone shouts "classic" - but in the end the result makes a rather boring movie for today's eyes , and the technical scenes of the 50s, for which you may be hoping in such a film, are far from sufficient to reward yourself for watching the entire tasteless dialogue and predictable development of the plot. Characters and plot may reward for scientific sociological analysis, but many times carry too much entertaining value. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie seems like a good movie for nine year olds. Mature themes, human drama and violence are also brought to a level suitable for children. <br /> <br /> Images of the Earth and the Moon, seen from space, may in fact be more accurate than those in “2001,” but what if their use is drastically ineffective. Especially 2001 may seem to be a stretched meditation on the themes of this film, and didn’t Star Wars somehow modeled its space scrolling introductory titles on the opening credits of this film? But again - a minor inheritance. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a truly revolutionary and mega-influential classical fantasy of the 1950s that you are looking for, check out the Forbidden Planet.
