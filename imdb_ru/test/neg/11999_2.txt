Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce you ?? Toltecs! This ancient Latin American tribe, even before the Aztecs, was supposedly the most vicious and bloodthirsty sorcerers, but their donkeys zadolbal couple student sloops and a seven-year-old lawyer with a whip! But before you see it, you need to overcome more than 40 minutes of pure boredom, infantile hoaxes and slovenly episodes that do not contain any real meanness. In case I have not fully realized: “Dark Power” is an indescribably trashy and inept piece of horror shit from the 80s that still manages to be funny because of its obvious and somewhat charming nonsense factor. The intentions of writer / director Phil Smoot are obviously admirable, but is he ?? as well as the rest of the cast and crew ?? there was not enough talent and financial resources to do something even decent. Smoot carefully watched "Evil Dead" and other similar films in the demonic theme, and for some reason, must have thought that he can cope with this. The film begins with an old Indian boy dying in his isolated village house; barely uttering his last word over a whisper ?? Toltekov. His grandson quickly rents a house to a handful of female students, including a typical 80s, aerobic, cute black girl and racist girl. Soon they will find out why the old Indian lived as a hermit, since he was in fact the keeper of the ancient Toltec cemetery. Toltec sorcerers buried themselves alive in order to reappear after thousands of years and eat the flesh of the living. And honestly, does meat taste better than bimbo? As mentioned earlier, the first half of the “Dark Force” is terribly lame and causes sleep. Irritated jokes, delayed dialogues and ridiculously long shots in which Lash LaRue revolves around the whip seem to be forever. Then the film loses its last authority when the Toltec sorcerers emerge from the ground. Instead of threatening, they look like stupefied hard rock stars with crazy masks and drunken gestures. It is worth mentioning ONE bloody moment, when the guy's lips stretch across the skull, but in general, even the slaughter of this film is disappointing. The only remotely standing moments are completely meaningless, for example, when a 9-year-old child (named Cletus!) Goes for a ride on his uncle's truck or when a naked naked chicken sips a beer in a bath after a workout. Seriously, if you are not turned on by the sight of a western veteran of the 1940s who doesn’t swing around the whip, I would advise you to skip this film.
