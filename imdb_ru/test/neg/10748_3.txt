There are places for political commentary in the film, but “Masters of Horror” is not one of them. I get enough of this material from Newsweek and any other newspaper editorial. Now I have to watch this in horror movies? C'mon! All I wanted was a good zombie film, not another "Bush is bad!" recitation If Joe Dante wants to express his policies, release him to Air America. And if you have to insist on making the movie "messages", be a little smarter about it. It was all hints that you were struck in the face with dead fish. <br /> <br /> By the way, Joe, do you really want the left voting block to be associated with dead zombies? It may be worth thinking about this before shooting another political horror film (God help us).
