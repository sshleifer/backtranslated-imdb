The respected western author Budd Boetticher is terribly out of place with this changeable modern story about cops and robbers, who suffer from a severe lack of believability. Boettiher seems to have given up time for rehearsal and settled on the first take, as presenters Joe Cotton and Rhonda Fleming put little effort into their roles, performing direct and without energy. <br /> <br /> Moderate employee Leon "The Foggy" Poole works as an internal employee in a banking job that goes bad and kills his wife. He escapes from prison and immediately goes to kill the wife of the detective who killed him. Hundreds of policemen mobilized to prevent him from getting to the house of the alleged person, who was moved to another place, but don't you know, in the last moments of the film we have foggy legs behind the victim (someone thought it was to take the bus back to the house) there was a healthy move), while a company of policemen was watching what action to take. Sounds ridiculous? You should see this. All this and more. <br /> <br /> Operator Lucien Ballard does a decent job of bringing noir to the outskirts, but the editing is inadequate and shapeless, and this drains the film with its intensity and pace. Like Poole, Wendell Corey is the best thing in the film that can evoke great sympathy as he moves from a tender soul to a murderer. In addition to these attributes, Killer equally fails in building and executing, making his message clear. Go west old buddhas.
