I had a bad feeling when I saw a cheap title job. It only took a few scenes to confirm that this film is a real bastard! The only pleasure I got from this is to laugh at technical flaws (for example, the background sound of car audio simply disappears during the scene with Danny and Dog in Dog's car). Production shows a complete lack of imagination (an example is the slow movement of fire from a machine gun repeated many times). Sandra Bullock plays essentially a small role, a completely unnecessary plot. To say that this film actually has a plot does more justice for writing than it deserves. Old computer equipment is quite interesting. This film was released in 1982 (and not in 1987, as the IMDb database indicates), and then the high-tech screen was a 4.8 MHz yellow IBM PC with floppy drives. Perhaps the PC was a real movie star ... at least it was interesting. <br /> <br /> We got it on DVD for a couple of bucks in a WalMart shopping cart. As another reviewer notes, we paid too much!
