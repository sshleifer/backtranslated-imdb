on Saturday matinee in my hometown. I went with an older friend (he was about 12 years old), and my mother let me go because she thought the film would be fine (with a grade of G). I was attacked by loud music, strange images, a lack of plot and the stubborn refusal to have ANY sense. We left halfway, because we were bored, we were upset and our ears hurt. <br /> <br /> I saw it 22 years later in the Renaissance Theater. My opinion has changed - it is even worse! Basically everything I hated about it was still there, and the film was VERY 60s ... and outdated. I got all the little jokes ... Too bad they weren't funny. Constant shifts in tone quickly annoyed, and absolutely nothing firmly to hold. Some people will love this. It upset me ... by the end of the movie I felt like throwing something heavy on the screen. <br /> <br /> In addition, all the songs of Monkees in this film suck (and I like them). <br /> For ex hippies only ... or if you are stoned. I give it 1.
