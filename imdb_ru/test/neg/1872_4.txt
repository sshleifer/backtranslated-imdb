Just caught "Rain People" on Turner Classic Movies late in the evening. The film was released in 1969. Stars Shirley Knight - Natalie, a housewife from Long Island, who - the exact reasons are unknown - leaves her husband and goes on a journey, not knowing exactly where she goes. Natalie is also pregnant recently, which complicates the situation. Along the way, she picks up the brain-damaged former football player Jimmy (James Caan), who was kicked out of college and he hitchhikers. There are a lot of turns between these two ways, and Natalie struggles to take care of Jimmy, and she begins to understand that he is mentally limited and cannot take care of herself. Needless to say, she is experiencing her own struggle and is unable to take care of him. Natalie seems to be a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown; she makes strange phone calls to her husband, who asks her to come home. Natalie is trying to quit Jimmy several times, only to have him enter her life again because of the circumstances. Young Robert Duvall plays a strange and restless cop who is friends with Natalie. You always feel that this film will end badly, and it is. This film, of course, is sometimes uneven, and the script is somewhat lacking. Francis Ford Coppola oversaw this, and, of course, he will soon become very famous for the next several years as the director of The Godfather. Needless to say, the actors are good, since in the film they all have a future ahead. Shirley Knight is the least well-known of these three, although she is also underestimated as an actor. James Caan is especially effective here, and he seems to be just living in this character. This film remains a little more than curiosity, without a doubt, because it is an early Coppola film, and I confess I have never heard of it. So God bless the Turner Classic Kino for bringing it to a new audience.
