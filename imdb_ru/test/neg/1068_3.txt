This film made me think ... about how I could write something about it, not to deny personally the director and all the actors, whom I, as an Australian, am proud to have really come there and made the film. <Br /> <br /> But the film itself? Let me tell you a story .... <br /> <br /> I found this DVD yesterday at my local box office and had vague memories of feedback during the release of the film here, so I decided to let it go. <br /> <br /> For some reason, I decided to watch the “special features” before watching the film itself, not what I usually do. Turned off the “creation” halfway, as I had to cringe over, “aren't we wonderful that we connected such a heavy film with such a rough script.” <br /> <br /> Movie? Ugh. Complete cliché and pathetic development of character. Actors? Well done, guys, you are Australian, and I applaud you. And, just as a sports team is good only as a coach who leads them, you, unfortunately, did not have a good script for work. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film actually trivialized many of the subjects that he seemed to want to cover. I have seen many reviews here that relate to it as nothing more than soap. Agreed <br /> <br /> Finally (and forgive me if I didn’t correctly formulate it), I was extremely disappointed that there was no optimistic implication at all. Yes, we all know that life is full of difficulties, and yes, we know that such things as incest happen, but it’s really hard for me to applaud a film without a single piece of joy. I believe that the director is obliged to put him there somewhere. As for the rest, the film is dedicated to IM and their feelings; they created it for themselves, not for the audience. <br /> <br /> I think that is why this film is not so good. Special mention suggests that the director wrote the script at the 36-hour meeting, the day after he tried to commit suicide. Well, that might have been cathartic for him, but the film smells like indulging yourself when you know the story that made it. "I feel terrible, I'm going to write a movie about the feeling of horror." (Note: I read an interview with Andrew Urban and I understand WHY Talluri needed to write something to help him solve his own problems, but I think there is a feature in the film that cannot be crossed - the line of making the film is exclusively for my own emotional needs, and I feel that this is what happened unintentionally here) <br /> <br /> By his own admission, the director had no technical experience at all, and, unfortunately, because of this, the film looks like nothing more than a twelve-year media project. <br /> <br /> With regard to the recommendations that this film should be studied at school or that all teenagers should watch it, I am not sure there either. Because at the end there is a VERY dangerous line. I, too, was in a place where I thought that someone who no longer needed to “face life” was “lucky”, but as an adult I really worry that this line can have an impact on the young viewer who is in a vulnerable position. boundaries of reason. Maybe there to facilitate discussion, but again, this does not reflect the possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole. In fact, it almost indicates that there is still a lot of sadness ahead. <br /> <br /> I did not see the Elephant, but I could just find it, given all the comparisons here. <br /> <br /> Nothing personal, guys, I hope you someday make another movie and we all have to start somewhere, so forgive me if I was too harsh. I am glad that you are proud of what you have created, which, after all, is life. This is not a film that I would recommend. <br /> <br /> Oh, I REALLY liked how often the time frame collided, I thought it was an interesting way to make a movie. <br /> <br /> But all "These are the quiet ones that you should watch" - we already know that.
