None of the monograms are better (not trying to be funny here) Chan's recordings. The Shanghai cobra has a lot of things, but in the end, it is too tangled and cluttered to unnecessarily satisfy. The film begins with a killer named Shanghai Cobra, who has already struck twice, and now is somehow going to the stage at the diner. We have a boyfriend, a girlfriend, and another boyfriend who has some kind of hidden connection when one boyfriend dies outside. Yes, I simplify things here for the sake of brevity, because it really underlies the problems with this film - there is too much of it in it without any real, full explanation. I didn't even go to the diner, which has some kind of participation and a music box that talks to you and has a screen, and everyone seems to have no problem with that! All this in the first five minutes or so. Then Chen enters the film, working for the government and flying out to help a friend. He also has the right to check the radium shop in the bank and is looking for a man wrapped in bandages, whom he helped arrest in Shanghai many years ago. I found the plot very confusing, as stated earlier. Toler returned as Chan. He is always friendly. Benson Fong and Mantan Moreland are back too. Both do a good job and are pretty funny. But the intricate plot simply did not convince me, and most of the film was watched with a strange, questioning look. This is a good film, not only very interesting, with the exception of Chanâ€™s most devoted fans.
