After the events of September 11 in New York, this drama about American firefighters was conceived as a salute and a tribute to their professionalism. The story is told through a series of memories, where after firefighter Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) collapsed across the floor of a burning building, and spoke only with captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) on the radio. Memories basically show how Jack turns from a rookie, seeing in Kennedy his father figure, in the legend of a fireman. Of course, these days, Jack’s firemen try to call him, but they’re too late, and eventually he lets them leave him and he goes to his funeral, where he is praised as one of the best firefighters they knew. Also starring Jasinda Barrett as Linda Morrison, Robert Patrick as Terminator 2 as Lenny Richter, Morris Chest as Tommy Drake, Billy Burke as Dennis Gaukin, Balthazar Getty as Ray Gokina and Tim Guiney as Tony Corrigan. Ultimately, the flame of the film is all I could pay attention to and enjoy the way the characters deal with them, the rest is too talkative, in my opinion. Adequate!
