CAN CONTAIN SPOILERS For the past four years I have been a big fan of Ali G. Sasha Baron Cohen, undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy, and, in my opinion, his best creation is Borat, as funny as hell and completely unconscionable in what he does and tells people. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the movies. I did not bother to pay money to see it in the movie; I suppose because I didn’t expect much, but when I recently hired a DVD, I found it all pretty sad. Much of the way Ali picked Mickey from others was largely absent, and the plot was damn terrible; connect all car batteries together to blow up the safe - REALLY !! ?? <br /> <br /> This film shows that I think that some things can last too long and are definitely not translated to the big screen. The film also had that purulent, sweet end that I expected from British films. Where have all the good British film making ideals gone? However, there were strange, very funny moments, such as a dog in Ali’s bed and Ali’s audience with HM the Q with the comment “Shaven Shelter - RESPECT”. <br /> <br /> So, I, Ali G and I and a fan of Borat enjoyed many of his interviews (in particular, the interview with Anita Roddick from the Body Shop), but I didn’t like this film. If there is another film, I hope that it is much better than this old nonsense. <br /> <br /> Weasel100 <br /> <br /> Canberra, Australia
