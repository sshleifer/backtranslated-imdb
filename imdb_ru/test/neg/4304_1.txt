Poorly acted, poorly written and poorly directed. Special effects are cheap. The best performance is Yvette Napier, but that says little. Story is a tangled mess about corporate greed leading to sabotage the space station and trying to save those on board. <br /> <br /> There is little waiting and even less action. There is one car chase, which is not bad, but the rest of the film is just a waste of everyoneâ€™s time.
