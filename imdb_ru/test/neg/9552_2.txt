I saw it early on the Fox channel quite by accident (my dog ​​woke me up) - I saw it many years ago and thought that I remembered it well. As a child I enjoyed it. But now? As another poster commented, several drums were out of order, and although at first they were disorienting and bizarre, they seemed to be suitable for production — something that was just terrible, became surreal and funny. Musical numbers for what I think was a “big” fundraising show (“you're in show business, I'm in show business, most children in show business, let's do a show”) that came up from nowhere before all the talk about staging the play, and then completely unrelated "direct" scenes disappear without applause. The main man’s girlfriend appears, spits out lines and lines of dialogue, and then disappears. I half woke up and loved every crazy minute of it.
