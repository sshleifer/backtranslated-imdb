Even by the standards of most B-films, this film is the worst I've ever seen. The graphics are so bad that a man in a monster costume looks more realistic. The effects of ocean water are particularly ridiculous, including one scene where they sit on a mini subwoofer, and the “water” looks like frozen. There are so many problems with this film that I’ll stop here for the details. Needless to say, I am not joking when I say that even Uwe Toilet Bull himself could have done better. Avoid this movie at all costs, there are other films of class B, which, despite the horror, are at least a good way to pass the time.
