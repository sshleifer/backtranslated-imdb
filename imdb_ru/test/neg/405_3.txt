36/100. This should not be confused with decent arachnophobia, this film is a very low budget and cheap plagiarism of this film. This is so bad that it actually has a certain entertainment value at this level. There are a lot of unintended (I think) laughing out loud scenes. I did not expect much from the film, and it was actually worse than I had imagined. <br /> <br /> This is a clich√©, predictable and direct video. Fortunately, this does not take yourself too seriously. Acting, as expected, not quite the Oscar caliber. The special effects are bad, worse than I thought. Poorly edited and assessment is intrusive.
