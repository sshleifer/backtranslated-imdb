I am a lover of Shakespeare since childhood. I am also a Jew. The Venetian merchant is anti-Semitic through, no matter how hard the scholars and literature lovers try to rethink it. <br /> <br /> In the play, Shylock is portrayed as demonic and cold-blooded and has no forgiveness. There is no warmth, no love, except money and cruel revenge, while Christians are good, moral people. His motives in the play revolve around money (he plans from the very beginning a revenge based on the damage done to his business, as well as blind racial hatred), noble ideals or racial pride, as this film wants you to believe. And this characteristic is given to him by Shakespeare himself, and not by other characters. As a final proof, a happy ending is when a Jew loses his money and is forced to convert to Christianity. <br /> <br /> I admit it and continue. This is part of the story, and I like Shakespeare, despite this fact. Therefore, I expect the film based on this play to play straight. I would prefer to see a job adapted for her rich language and storytelling without whitewash. <br /> <br /> But many of the cunning subtleties of the bard and the playful characters are lost in this film. For example, in the last scene, where men discover the secret work of Portia as a man who also took their rings instead of a playful play of words and misunderstandings, when truth reveals itself, it becomes a vile game in which two bitches women mercilessly play with their future husbands. <br /> <br /> Instead, we only had beautiful detailed scenery, fragments of a rich language with poor reinterpretation, poor casting, one tense scene in the courtroom and controversy. <br /> <br /> The truth is that I think it would be much easier to identify anti-Semitism in history and move on if it were left as it is. Despite all the whitewashing of the creators of this film, taken from their hats, a lot of hatred remains, only now people can justify themselves and pretend that the image of the Jews is not so bad anymore. <br /> <br /> Finally, another problem is that most actors do not work. Pacino is a way out of his league, and he really dislikes the language, not to mention the monstrous fake accent. Fiennes as Bassanio insensible and clumsy with tongue. Irons, as always, is reliable, but does little with his role. Portion is somewhat in order, but unlikely and covered with poor makeup, as in the film.
