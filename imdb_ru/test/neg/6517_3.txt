This film tells about the meetings of 7 couples in the Hampstead Heath area on one sunny afternoon of Wednesday. <br /> <br /> It describes 7 different types of couples: married, divorced, relationship breakdown, homosexuals, the elderly, blind dates and escort services. They are not related to each other, except geographic location, so this is a disappointment. The film is a collage of conversations, without any noticeable plot. The film moves from pair to another without any logic. I find this film boring and purposeless. The only ransom feature is great weather throughout the entire movie. Sadly, films like Ewan McGregor and Sophie Okonedo are lost because of this film.
