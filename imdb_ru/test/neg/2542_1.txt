I just finished watching this movie, and for me .... it will take forever, because it's so boring ..... and the storyline is very bad. <br /> <br /> now ... where should I start .... Oh .... the film is called "Japan's immersion" .... yes, yes ... it really shows that Japan is really Actually it sinks, but the action is very bad. Compare with the film “the day after tomorrow”, I would rate it at least at 8/10. <br /> <br /> “Sinking of Japan” says little about a catastrophe that actually happens right in front of us. eyes. there is no excitement at all ... boring ... all I can say ... <br /> <br /> one more thing ... I would recommend this film to have a better title ... something is possible like "romance of drowning Japan" because there is a lot of talk in this film (waste of time ... senseless nonsense), and the love story is extremely boring and stretches too long ... honestly .. I almost get disappointed. <br /> <br /> In general ... there are not enough details in this film, for example, about natural disasters. many people run like hell to avoid death ... part of the love story was not touching enough for me. <br /> <br /> but hey ... although in this film we have to appreciate one thing ... & he has good songs!
