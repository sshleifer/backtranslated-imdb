A boring game, a weak script ... the worst Spanish movie in recent years ... <br /> <br /> I was attracted by the (naked) beauty of Paz Vega, but she as an actress <br /> <br /> is useless, you are almost you can’t understand what she says ... <br /> <br /> It’s not so difficult to say about history ... we heard about it <br /> <br /> before, but how is This "modern Carmen" , we find several changes: - The French soldier is now a Basque soldier. - Meri himself is a character in the story. - Carmen is a dangerous “bandolera” in love with the famous <br /> <br /> “matador” and she can speak Basque fluently ... <br /> <br /> Can anyone understand this mess?
