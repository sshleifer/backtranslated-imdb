This film, like many others (Remember the Titans, Miracle), follows the basic formula of a sports film: there is a guy, he is a moron. Jerk does badly. Jerk should play by someone else's rules. Other people's rules change jerk, jerk becomes good. Insert tragedy (death, drugs, riots, etc.). Tragedy affects the jerk, causes it to completely change. Jerk should now play in the championship. A lot of close-ups on sweaty players and balls. Jerk wins. Quote from a coach or news or something that explains the name. Credits. You did not touch? These films can now be used to deal with the moron of society. Anyone who pays to see it in cinemas should get slapped.
