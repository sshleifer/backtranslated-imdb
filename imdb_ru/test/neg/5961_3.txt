On the back of my DVD, there is a story about “El Chukabra”: after capturing in the desert, the legendary bloodthirsty creature Chupacabra escapes into the city, creating chaos and panic. When they pursue a deadly beast, animal control officer and scientist Dr. Starlin Davide understands that vigilant with his own suspicious plan also tracks the elusive killer for the mysterious research center run by the devil Dr. Goodspeed. This putrid click of horror is somewhat amusing if you watch it under the influence of alcohol. The script is completely stupid, the acting is wooden, incredible, and the direction is amateur. Two Chupacabra rubber suits are the best thing in this film.
