I had high hopes for this after reading the back of the DVD "In the spirit of American pie and animal house ...". After going through this, I realized that I just blew up $ 2.50 to rent it. This film began slowly and became slower ... short and fleeting moments of levity proved that it was the spirit of the American pie, if you mean "spirit" like a dead thing. not very interesting or fun! Do not be deceived like me, and expect something barely noticeable, because this film will overwhelm you more than entertain you. â€œWe need to fill three more lines for this stupid film, which is not worth the effort ... what a stupid piece of ignorant dirt. This film is shocked, even sucked because of short nudity!
