Playmania is very boring. This is the basis of the show. Mel or Shandi ask very simple questions that a 2-year-old child can answer very slowly. This show lasts 2 hours, and they are likely to play only about 10 games during this period. People may like this show, because the hosts love it so much, but their hotness is completely ruined by the fact that they are damn annoying. <br /> <br /> During the show, they mention that we need more players a million times. The top 5 surveys they conduct take about 20 minutes. This show is probably one of the worst game shows ever. One of the reasons they probably have no subscribers is because the show is very cheap with money. Most of the money I’ve ever seen handed out was $ 210. I would not be surprised if this “game show” will be canceled by the end of 2006.
