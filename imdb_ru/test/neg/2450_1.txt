I ticked the box “contains a spoiler”, in case I say something that is a spoiler, and I don’t realize that I said this until I reread it after publication. So just in case. <br /> <br /> In any case, back to watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie about space films this afternoon and according to the description Skye gives (these people should be on acid) it sounded pretty good, but then when I actually got about 30 minutes, I was shocked. In this film, in my opinion, the worst writers and actors / actresses - ever. A young girl who fell in love with a boy from Los Angeles in about 3 hours, a really stupid, unconvincing heroine who has an annoying, whining voice and coarse hair. -.- Then there is her beloved, who is an idiot, and also very much whined. In fact, maybe they fit together. Then there is the boy’s mother, who is on vacation with him, and surprise, surprise — she’s a doctor, and — oh God, wait, there are even more unexpected surprises! The virus suddenly breaks out on the island, and she knows everything about viruses! = O. A HORRIBLE HORROR! Yes, right. Lol Then there is this crazy religious guy who keeps talking about “erbahs” or something, and how the Lord knows everything. Everyone on the island seems to love him, but in fact he is stubborn, arrogant, pumped up with steroids (you really only need to watch this movie for the scene where he comes out of the sea after swimming, his head is tiny and his body is MASSIVE. funny jester who drank too much. <br /> <br /> In any case, after all these faddish characters, including the stone-sighted taxi driver, the religious guy finally gives in to the doctor and she takes a blood sample and they immediately start searching cures for this because for some pr he was radically saved, right up to “erb and God.” And oh my God. Yes, there is another surprise! You never guess what !! At the very last moment, 11 minutes before everything on the island is actually dead , including her son and his girlfriend, she finds a cure and introduces everyone, and everything is solved !!! What a pitiful movie. I mean, I knew that it sounded like an obvious ending from the moment I first started watching it, but actually I thought it would be good, and there were some plot twists somewhere, but no, no, it was just boring and with ho. /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. You will find yourself like me - stunned for 3 hours and then demanding the hour and a half that you spent from your life watching it.
