If someone in National Lampoon is reading this, PLEASE STOP the Cotton that snatches from its backside, really now! Why the hell are you doing these movies? They are not funny, and watching them for sexual content is a waste of time, really. This is such a terrible movie that you can shoot yourself while watching. I'm serious, guys, it makes Harol and Kumar look like blah blah blah like a real good movie (and we all know that H & K is one of the worst films ever made). He really sucks, he REALLY does. How bad is it? Well, even losers who really love National Lampoon will hate this movie ... they will want to kill the director, I swear to God. I hate you, National Lamphun, I'll die. Die.
