Anyone can make a movie these days. The budget, the cost of production or an experienced team should not interfere with the self-realized “director” “to realize his dream” in our days. <br /> <br /> Respect for the art of filmmaking or even just respect for any film aesthetics is no longer a prerequisite for the actual performance of the film. <br /> <br /> Director Bill Cowell must have thought that he hit gold when Lion Gate decided to sell his original film as a continuation of the film, to which he had nothing to do. do with. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think that the Lion Gate is much more erroneous than Cowell, due to the fact that Dark Harvest 2 is available to the public. The deceptive marketing of this film "The Lion's Gate" must be investigated by the state's attorney general, and the Lion's Gate officers must be salted in sulfuric acid and kerosene for their complete disregard for films, filmmaking and common sense. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, it’s not even worth commenting on.
