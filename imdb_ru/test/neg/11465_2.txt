Just saw it in the movie. I have not read the book. This movie is nothing new. <br /> <br /> Bad guys seem to die from a few blows, no matter how many times our hero was hit by a big sword, he continues to look the same (ish)! There are several action movies, but they are very unreal. the filmmakers seem to get the impression that when they fail to choreograph the scene of the battle, they simply bring the camera closer, move quickly and turn on the music ......... This makes me feel deceived again. <br /> <br /> I admire the fact that they were trying to cope with the dark storyline without normal Hollywood cheese, but I am sorry to say that the filmmakers failed. Two-dimensional characters. We barely get to know them or even treat them. The leader has a charming farmer's accent on the ear ..... although it seems that he has nothing to say ... <br /> <br /> Do not worry if you are not bored and you do not get it half. price from blockbusters ....
