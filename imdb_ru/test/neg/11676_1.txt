Good. I really tried to use the (so-called) stupid and surreal humor that this film intends to be. I was told that the Japanese version of this film is much shorter than that delivered to America (go to the head!), And has less political references. Besides all this, I found this sexual / political farce as boring and pointless as standard porn. Central female leadership is easy for the eyes, and could actually act. I would really like to see her in a non-pink film, where she could actually flex her acting muscles (and no, not the ones you think about). Obviously, Japan can (and does) produce as much shit as other countries. I could not recommend to anyone, with the remote perspective of someone who has Jones for Asian porn. Go see a real Japanese movie.
