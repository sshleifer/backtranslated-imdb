Terribly disappointed with CITY MEN after CITY OF GOD. “Lost” is an exciting and unpredictable storyline, and instead is soft predictability with obvious attempts to manipulate the audience with a surface pretentious production and distribution team. This story ultimately looked more like a greasy soap opera, and not like the fragile indie function that was supposed to be. This is what happens when distributors try to find a wider audience (ridiculous radical shots of the Rio coastline, etc.) due to the exciting story and characters. I really didn’t care what happened to one of the characters in this film - they were all so two-dimensional. In short, a sad waste of potential that should have been trash after an exceptionally inspired CITY OF GOD. Boo!
