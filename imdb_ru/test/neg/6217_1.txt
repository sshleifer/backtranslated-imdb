I can't remember a more trivial, stunning and shallow movie, in other words, a real movie about the tiptoes of the worst kind. How can you watch this movie and recommend it to others? Only if they do not like to admit that they made a mistake. It seems to summarize the worst of women's aspirations. No real substance for all this is happy and superficial. Yes, it will please the masses. Well, not this member of the masses. What a banal load of fuss. I wanted to leave the cinema 5 minutes after the start. And I think I paid Â£ 7 to see it! I think this, however, represents the dullness of cinema, as in most media these days. So I like a little reality in my musicals to call me sad or what?
