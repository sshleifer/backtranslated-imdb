I think it’s two years ago since I watched the movie, and still it’s the worst movie I’ve ever seen. The only thing that I thought after watching this film was that it was made for some tax reason. So, after all this time, I finally spilled out my intuition;) And now IMDb says that I have to fill 10 lines with comments: <br /> <br /> "Sorry, you must provide at least 10 lines in the comment. Please return to the edit window (or use the BACK option if this is not a new window). "<br /> <br /> Please have nothing more to say ... <br /> <br /> Sorry for poor English.
