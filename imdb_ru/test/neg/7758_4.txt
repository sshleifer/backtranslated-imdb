1960s children's show with former vaudeville playing mercenary assistants. As you can expect, they are a disaster in everything they do. During the 11-minute episodes (leaving 4 minutes to advertise in the 15-minute interval), they do such things as installing a fence between the warring neighbors, help the magician on the stage, and deal with the found trunk and wallet. /> <br /> As a child I never came across this show (which seems to have been filmed in New York). It seemed to me that I had heard or seen most of the children's performances of the period when I watched them as a child or watched nostalgic conventions. Until Alpha Video released it on DVD, I didn’t know if it existed. <br /> <br /> The show sounds like “Three Puppets”, mixed with Abbott and Costello, as people who imitate routine do. (Indeed, one of the couple claims to have created the legendary routine “Turning slowly ...”, which was improved by Abbott and Costello). This is not bad, but in fact is not very good, since everything seems blurry. The time often does not coincide (although this may be due to bad direction), and the jokes were reworked years before the show began. Most likely, you've seen it all before. On the positive side, this is the type of thing that would be ideal for introducing very young children to the magic of a vaudeville comedy, but this would be an attempt by parents to survive even short episodes. <br /> <br /> Only for addicts nostalgia. Everyone else should look at the originals of Abbott and Costello or Three Stacks.
