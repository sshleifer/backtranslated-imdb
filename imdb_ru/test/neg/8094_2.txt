What can you say about the movie in which the funniest episode is a fat man fighting a garden hose? Acting, especially the role of the protagonist Jerry O'Connell, is embarrassing. The dialogue is so contrived and unmixed that it makes you cringe. The control idea is actually not bad for this genre (children's comic comedy), but the director somehow does it in the least way. I rate it 2 out of 10.
