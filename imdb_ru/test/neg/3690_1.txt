Sit in the basement with the lights off for half an hour. This is about the same thing as watching this underground search for the door of the devil. American researcher Owen (Vincent Gallo) goes to Moscow and gathers a team of rescuers to search for his friend Sergey (Rade Serbedziya), an archaeologist who disappeared into the catacombs under the Russian capital. They will be shocked to discover underground inhabitants thriving in a damp and dark complex system of caves and tunnels. The seekers will meet with the gatekeeper of hell, Andrew (Val Kilmer), and make a deal to continue their work; only to succeed in being scared almost senseless, realizing that they are among the walking dead. Also in the cast: Joaqu√≠n de Almedia, Oksana Akinshina, Sage Stallone, Joss Ackland and Julio Perillan.
