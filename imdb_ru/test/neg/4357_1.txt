Killjoy 2 slightly exceeds the first movie. In this material, improved acting, makeup and plot Killjoy. This film is more like a bloody holiday, there are no such supernatural elements as in the first one. In this issue, Killjoy kills his victims in more conventional ways, he sets fire to them, and he does not shoot them from the bullets that were in his mouth. The only thing I didnâ€™t like about this movie was that the end was a little half, in fact it was half, they killed Killjoy in a very cheap way. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves horror movies. Seriously, the first movie was good, but the second is better. ten.
