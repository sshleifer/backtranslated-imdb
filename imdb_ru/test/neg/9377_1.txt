This is the only film that I can remember where, after it ended, I was seething with anger, spending money and time on myself and everyone who participated in its creation. Not surprisingly, after this defeat, Alan Moore refused to have anything to do with Vendetta (a phenomenal film). <br /> <br /> This is entertaining in terms of entertainment, as in Showgirls. It is bad that makes you want to gouge out your eyes. Mark holes the size of the planet. The worst script in memory. Awful game decent actors. Visual effects that should be great, but somehow fail. <br /> <br /> It could be so good ...
