Perfect stars (Heather Graham) along with (Casey Affleck) and (Luke Wilson). This is the story of Jolene, who is determined to find her ex-husband, who is in the midst of a midlife crisis. <br /> <br /> “Devotee” turned out to be not at all what I expected; he lacked comedy, which ultimately was a genre. It was not just stupid and unrealistic, Casey Affleck showed good performance, Graham's recent roles were impeccable, and this is not an improvement. <br /> <br /> Graham’s most recent role was “Blessed”, which I also found in error and didn’t appeal to me at all. <br /> <br /> Pluses Affleck <br /> <br /> Cons: Predictable, Unrealistic, Bad action and not a comedic movie!
