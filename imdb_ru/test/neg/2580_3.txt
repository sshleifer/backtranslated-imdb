The Patriot (not related to the Mel Gibson film of the same name) came out that Stephen Seagal was still doing this “environmental saving” thing in his films. What well. But it will not benefit. <br /> <br /> When the plot (?) of this film finally came into action, I saw a turn (?) At a distance of a mile. Seagal's position in the field of combating war, caring for mother and nature is not very subtle. For the film, which was originally supposed to debut in cinemas, it is very similar to a television film, despite a few remarkable shots of the country, shot by Dean Semler, photographer for “Dances with Wolves”. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal does as the 1 fight scene in the whole movie, and it is absolutely boring. As a fighter, he fails, as a drama stinks, as an environmental message, this is obvious. Avoid as Ebola, crossed with the plague.
