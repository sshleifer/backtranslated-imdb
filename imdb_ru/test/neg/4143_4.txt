I wanted to star in this film, but for some reason I can't find it in myself. <br /> <br /> Featuring the duality of fighting styles, this is Lee vs. Lee in a somewhat decent battle for supremacy. <br /> This is one of those films in which the plot carries the performances. Lee's acting is extremely amateur, hesitant and tough for most of this film ... right to the end. At first, I deceived myself by making me believe that he was just doing this for one of his two characters. You know, to show the difference in personalities. But it seemed inexperience or lack of talent. It got a little better, more relaxed, towards the end. But this was not enough to save his speech. Jet Lee's acting game improves as his career progresses. I do not hate his game. I just hated him about it. <br /> <br /> I also have to say that these were effects of class "B". What are the effects. <br /> <br /> The story itself had great potential. It was uniquely creative, bold and fresh. Unfortunately, either the budget was insufficient for better coverage, effects, quality of films and some acting lessons, or the director simply did not care for such small details. He also did not bother with SCIENCE in science fiction. A fact that was a great foe to this film. <br /> <br /> The combat sequences were a bit one-sided, as he seemed to give more to one character and a little to another. But in general, the storyline is made for a very pleasant attempt. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it was nice, I could not help but think that this is just one of those films, you cannot help but watch that it MUST BE, and not what he is. <br /> <br /> On a scale of “B” it is estimated at 6.0 / 10 points. <br /> <br /> This is 4.2 / 10 (on the “A” scale) for a good plot, from ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend :.
