Can someone give me a reason why only one American dies in this film, and when he does this, it is assumed that this is a very emotional scene, but when the “Operation Delta” team kills hundreds of Russians in slow motion or Thousands Arabs, also in slow-motion scenes, you should greet and say: "Take this, non-American monsters!". I know that I often used “slow motion scenes,” but this is because, as you may have guessed, every scene in this film is slow. Every last one of them ... And this squad should be called the “Invincible Force of Avoiding Slow Motion”, as they seem to have supernatural powers that help them dodge bullets. And if this supernatural force fails, they have some kind of superpower of rebirth, and that’s all they need to kill the entire non-American army that stands between them and the victory. By this moment nobody cares, as they were put to sleep with another ridiculous time-lapse scene ... That is, if they do not laugh out loud at the bad game, the stupid dialogues and the incredibly bad story. What I did ... The cast is made up of unknown actors who are likely to remain unknown, since they don’t even play characters. They just play guys with guns (and, let's not forget, superpowers) ... The only quality is that special effects are surprisingly not so bad (albeit in slow motion) for a television movie ... But it still sucks ... and at the same time so bad, that’s good ... Well, maybe at the end it gets too repetitive ... <br /> <br /> 25%
