Blimey! After the first five minutes of watching this “movie”, I was tempted to insert a bullet in the brain and end my life. It is difficult to describe what this film is about. Honestly, I don’t know what kind of person could finance part of excrement. It looks like the film was shot on video or 16 mm. I usually have no problems with SOV movies, they are made from 16 mm films, but it was just awful. And where did they find these "actresses"? I have seen some bad actors, but it takes the cake. Look at the first 5 minutes and you will understand what I mean. BCI Entertainment should boycott the spread of this terrible dirt. It must be the worst movie I have ever felt to my displeasure. I want my 74 minutes ago! If you can sit the first 5 minutes without taking off the TV and not committing mass murder, take a picture. In the end, what should you lose?
