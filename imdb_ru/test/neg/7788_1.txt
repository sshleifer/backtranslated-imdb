It is difficult to do this through this film, without choking on your own vomiting, to be honest. Scanty animation does not help, as it looks like a ten-year-old video, which you will find in the Morrison 99p cart. Nevertheless, this is better than a horrible scenario, which spends about a third of its length on unnecessary extras, such as today's Bell problems, material about Scrooge's father and a lot of runaway fan jokes with TWO ANTHROPOMORPHIC MUSCES. These fancy additions devour time on the screen due to elements that you think would be very important, such as Dickens's dialogue and key fragments of his plot - the film, for example, confuses the game of twenty questions and sometimes does not provide an answer. scenes in the right order. Absolutely hopeless.
