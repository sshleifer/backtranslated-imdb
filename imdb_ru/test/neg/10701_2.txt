This film is stinky. It is not much more. The final fight looked like Walker was fighting with my grandmother, and not with some kind of supernatural demon with a force of ten people. I found the ad more interesting. The plot twists and jokes could be seen a mile away. The only redeeming quality of this film was that it ended. Avoid this at all costs ... unless you like the bad films of Chuck Norris.
