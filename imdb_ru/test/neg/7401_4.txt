I just saw the first part of this and concluded that I would not miss anything if I did not watch the second episode. Cinematography was fine, but other than that, the plot was just as usual as any other military history. The actors and actresses play their characters without any passion, and the makeup is really bad (Heiner Lauterbach with his gray hair and Kai Wiesinger, respectively, as if some dyed white hair can give them more dignity and common sense). I mean that if you watched more than two or three films about the Second World War (like most of us), then you would have a problem seeing the third or fourth film if it promises some new ideas or changes in the plot. But Roland Suso Richter seems to be afraid of this, you almost feel his fear of not meeting the expectations of the bourgeoisie and hujuni of the conservative ZDF channel while watching this movie. Millions of euros have been spent on perpetuating the boring and unimaginable German film industry. These millions of dollars could be spent on creating three or four independent films, but no, let's give the director who will make a film telling people that war can be explained by rational means. My advice: read Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut instead. They will tell you what war is! Or give me a million euros, and I will make a better film than this BS load! And yet: why are German films nominated for an Oscar only when the film tells about the Second World War or the Holocaust? Probably because it is the only thing in which German cinema works well. And this should make us think, right?
