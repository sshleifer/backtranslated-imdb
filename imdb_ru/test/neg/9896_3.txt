CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia. The American by birth, George Greeno, for 35 years, traveled and photographed himself, friends and, more recently, dolphins in Australia, using different cameras, which he either strapped on his back, on board or in a boat. In the mid-70s, he teamed up with Surf Mag editor and budding director David Elfic to create this visually interesting story about this life and photography. The 75-minute CRYSTAL VOYAGER feature is the result. Even in the 70s, the audience was a little puzzled by this film, neither surfing film, nor surfing film, because George is floating on a children's blackboard, not on a real surfboard ... this compensates for George’s tedious buzz (sometimes then fool or fool, that it was actually funny ... how to almost burn yourself or fall on something) with an impressive “you are” power to slide through the wave that lasted 23 minutes, everything is tuned to the music of Pink Floyd. In 1974, when the Sydney Opera House opened, it also had a cinema. Crystal Voyager was commissioned there as an art and sports photo OZ and by default became a hit: since "tickets to the opera house" cost much more than a movie ticket, viewers flocked to see this film as an excuse "to be the Sydney opera house." .. thus, the film made a record business as a low-budget attraction to locals and tourists who wanted to tell their neighbors that they had seen the show there. This created this myth that the film was a huge crowd, and the reputation spread. As a result, he teamed up with the fantasy cartoon FANTASTIC PLANET and double-checked the trip around the UK and Europe. I ran it at the seaside cinema in the 70s, and the crowd was confused. Recently, George has appeared again in the “Lord of the Flies” style with another well-photographed sea adventure called “DOLPHIN GLIDE”, which invites viewers to dive and swim with the wild Byron Bay dolphins. This is an eccentric 20-minute short with an even more eccentric 20-minute short "as George did." In January 2005, each of them was greeted by a collective spectacle of both the media and the public ... all this makes the CRYSTAL VOYAGER a happy coincidence “you should have been there” all these years ago. However, on a special evening at Oz Surf in the open-air cinema last year, 2,000 people came ... but then 2,000 people came every night to see something there during this summer film season ..... so damn thing failed another box office binge. How much really liked, very open to discussion. Again, they were just puzzled by this insane movie with an amazing reputation. However, since 1975, Elfick began a stellar career as a major producer and director of many acclaimed Australian and international films. Look for NO MEN, STAR, DON'T CONNECT OR CRYSTAL FENCES or LYMBO IN LIMBO to get clear and real applause for your achievements. George, however, is still floating somewhere, buzzing and looking for something else to remove or drop the camera.
