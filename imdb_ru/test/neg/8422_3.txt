For the first fifteen minutes, the story of NAGAYA FAME is interesting: the two end of the thirties, male porn stars in a seemingly healthy relationship decided to leave the porn industry and try the world of singing and acting. Two very loving and clean people are Colton Ford and Blake Harper. With the help of Kevin Avians and Mark Berkeley, Colton makes a dance track, which is then sold in New York, in the hope that Colton Ford will become an instant star - a unique disco singer advertised his background as a porn star for PR. /> <br /> The rest of the film grumbles and wrestles and comments porn producer Chicha LaRue and the film slowly sinks into repetition and decline. A good idea for the film, if in the desire of each character to show a little more depth, to move away from a successful career (although the one that was strongly influenced by young people, who both heroes lost), to the alternative one. Just a song from one note is quickly exhausted. Grady Harp, November 5
