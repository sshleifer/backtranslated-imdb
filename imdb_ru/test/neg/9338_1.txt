In short, this film was terrible. <br /> <br /> I understand that this is a Disney film, which is usually shallow, with mediocre plots and a bad game. HOWEVER, I have to say that this is the worst of all Disney films, with a bad game, MANY ANGRY HORRIBLE GIRLS (my god) and an extremely unrealistic plot. Even when I'm 12 years old, I wouldn't love this movie so much. The only way this film could have been worse was if they tried to put it in cinemas or tried to sell it in a local video store. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and change the channel before watching, no matter how boring you are on Sunday afternoon.
