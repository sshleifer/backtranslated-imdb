I think I will win a “discount” contest for this film, since I received it as part of the Martial Arts Movie Classics DVD collection with 50 films of 20 bucks each, which means I paid about 50 cents for the opportunity to watch a movie. "Black Fist" - a version of the film, released as "Bogard." <br /> <br /> For the main film “Revenge,” “Black Fist” is not so bad, although it is clearly hampered by a low budget. One of my unofficial "practical rules" when watching a film is that if the main actor is better than his director and script, the film automatically receives at least three stars. This is definitely the case here; Lawson has some presence and some charisma, and he probably deserves a better film career than he got. <br /> <br /> Street fighting choreography (supposedly the reason for the film) really will not impress anyone who has ever participated in martial arts or even got hit in a school fight. I only spent about two years studying basic kung-fu, but even I would never have fallen in love with the front “stamped” punches, stretching hands and turning punches. But the atmosphere is good - dust, blood and screaming crowds, and the actors bring some feeling to the fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> Less believable plot. Dawson's character "Leroy Fisk" is portrayed as a smart street, smart young man who is looking for a job as a fighter in illegal, unauthorized street games. And yet he is surprised and outraged when he has to pay the cops? Sorry, but I grew up in a small Iowa town, and even * I * knew (from watching "Hard Times" with Charles Bronson) that the cops should be rewarded for such actions, and that the guys who fight needed repairmen to get their matches, and that the repairmen cost money. Thus, you should watch this film with some deliberate dismissal of your critical abilities in order to accept it as a film about “repressed black brother”. (Most of the other non-black fighters in the stable also get hit in the face for the same deal, right?). <br /> <br /> The film suffers from short attention span. The director clearly did not have the money to shoot some of the scenes he needed, so he had to fill in the gaps with some rather ridiculous scenes of presentation (the scene “I defeated him, I had dinner, and then killed him”) just does not work) comments and montages that are clumsy and inconclusive. This is especially true of the whole romantic perspective, which seems to have been taken as if it were an afterthought. This is not good, considering that the death of Fisk’s wife should be a stimulus for his revenge. <br /> <br /> But when the film fully transitions from the “young fighter rising through the ranks” to the theme of revenge, it is gaining momentum and playing with more confidence. I'm not sure that the final return is worth building up - Roger Ebert calls these things "a long trip for a short day on the beach" ... but it really connects things in a reasonably satisfactory way. <br /> <br /> If Sylvester Stallone made this film with a real budget and the same actors, skillers and costumes, as well as with the hero himself, people would call it the following “Rocky”, who goes to show you how circumstances and accidents can destroy the dreams of future filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It’s worth looking once at various decent frames and lines and see how Dabny Coleman confuses herself in the role that is under him.
