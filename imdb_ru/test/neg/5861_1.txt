* Spoilers ahead, but that shouldn't matter, since I hope that you won’t see it anyway * <br /> <br /> If you plan to see this, I strongly advise you not to do that. Because it was one of the most wasted hour and a half. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is the full plagiarism of the glorious movie “Royal Battle”. It's as stupid as watching any inconclusive American TV show, such as Cops or Hidden Camera. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely predictable. One of them is pregnant, and the other is a nurse, and everyone who practices logical thinking understands from the very beginning what should happen between them. <br /> <br /> The concept is broken, as mentioned earlier, and there is no violence in the film to make this movie enjoyable. I mean, the preggo shoots a guy in the back, and he has no blood or not even a stab from a backstab. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever, not finding anything good about it, so take your money and get a copy of the Battle Royale instead of watching this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10, very bad, I could not rate it below. Almost makes Scream 3 a masterpiece ..
