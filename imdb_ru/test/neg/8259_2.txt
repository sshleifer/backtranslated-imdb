What a wonderful cast and what a pathetic film attempt. The script is full of holes from start to finish. Not connected, not connected ... completely ridiculous. One of the most talented and beautiful actresses in the world (and I am talking about Nastasya Kinski) has no memorable lines here. Worse, she supposedly dyed her hair halfway through the film, but it is obvious that she just wears a cheap black wig bought at a costume store for transvestites. The best moments are given to the character actor and his dog in the apartment building in which the actor Peter Coyote lives. Fairuza Balk is poorly photographed. She looks like an overweight newcomer who has too many buffets. I was so looking forward to this movie. I would like to, but I would like Nastassja to read a phone book with her own hair.
