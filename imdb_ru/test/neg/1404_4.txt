It was a character movie. The plot was not so hot when it was there, but the characters were interesting and acted very well. The story tells about the family of Travis after the suicide of the eldest son. I say it fluently, because the story is mainly about the surviving son and mother, because if the father had to focus on him too, they edited the film pretty badly. The game at all sites was very good, especially Emil Hirsch as a surviving, confused son. All the characters were very interesting, and I did not mind watching them until the late stage of the film, when it seemed to be dragging on. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint, however, was the story. The son who kills himself should have become the center of the plot. However, in reality it is not. This was what happened at the beginning of the story, but then everything went in different directions. Then they mentioned that the son committed suicide to remind you that it was the central thread. Another thing was that the big bends of the plot, of which there were many, were never explained or lined up, but were simply added there by chance and often from the far left field. In fairness, the ending was very, very cool. But it was also clear where the inspiration came from for the story: about half (half, which was not completed) was largely learned from the story in the song Pearl Jam Alive. Which reminds me ... <br /> <br /> In the film, there was a “poem” that someone supposedly wrote to kill himself. I could not be the only one who found out that this poem was taken word for word from the same song. I don't know, it was a movie that I had hope for, and they really dropped the ball.
