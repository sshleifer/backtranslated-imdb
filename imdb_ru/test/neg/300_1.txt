Jeffrey Dahmer was one sick guy. Little can be said about him that has not yet been said, except that many documentaries and films about him are probably better than this one. This is ridiculous silly. It's so stupid that the guy who posted the entire movie on YouTube added a few annotations to make the viewer laugh. <br /> <br /> Karl Crew (Who is he?) Filmed as a serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, whose life began in 1978 with a young guy with whom Dachmer just wanted to be friends, finally in 1991 with a man with whom he I wanted to have sex and eat. <br /> <br /> I did not bother to watch the entire movie to the end. This is mainly a documentary film that tells about all the attacks that Dahmer conducted before he was caught. And since this film was shot in 1993, a year before the damer was beaten to death by another prisoner, the death of the damer is not shown. but it would probably be as cheesy as this cheese feast. <br /> <br /> 1/10
