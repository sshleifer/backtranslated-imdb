Well, I have to admit that this film made me laugh for a while. Good, but that doesn't make it a good movie. Most of the characters are terrible stereotypes and really unconvincing. Not all of them give excellent acting, but some do try, but fail because their characters are poorly written. Julia Koshitts is a perfect example: she changes her eating habits from one conversation to another, she does not drink alcohol in one conversation, she suffers from champagne allergy in another, she feels too beautiful for most people (in fact she is) but it still ends up with a “perfect” fit regarding appearance, and refuses to give a chance to some more “realistic” guys, and so on ... The end is very stupid, although I like one of the final scenes when everything finally stops talking and the director a us a chance to catch my breath again. Shoppen is basically a movie that offers some cheap ridiculers (mainly because it’s about sex and relationships, I suppose) and maybe some short entertainment. However, the whole picture is one big stereotype, and there is nothing special about it.
