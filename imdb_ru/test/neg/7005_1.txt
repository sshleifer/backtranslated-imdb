I heard about this movie from a friend, it was supposed to be a thriller, but what I was watching was not a “thriller”. It was more like a weak attempt. Amber Smith was a bright spot - it might give her too much confidence. The scenes where she lay in bed with actress Erica Michelle were lame too. The two actresses did not seem to click with each other at all. Amber Smith was the way out of this girl's league, and this was definitely shown on camera. She did not appear at all in these scenes. I was disappointed because my boyfriend-friend, of course, he pumped this film to be something “big”, but it was actually more like watching a dime of a porn store.
