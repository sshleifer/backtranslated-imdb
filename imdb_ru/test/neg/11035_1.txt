I watched this movie with an audience of just .... 5! There was a choice between Lakshya and Asambhav ... (understood then, I had to go to Lakshya). A typical conspiracy ... India against Pakistan ... but this is not cricket, since in the center of Kashmir. The Indian superhero is sent on a mission to save the President of India from some Pakistani rebels who are involved in a mass drug smuggling rocket. I left the movie halfway, since it was just boring, and the plot was confusing and ubiquitous. The songs were also terrible, the film tries to hide the flaws with its special effects, but, unfortunately, they are also outdated. <br /> <br /> Overall ... avoid it, if you can, it must be the worst movie Iâ€™ve seen this year.
