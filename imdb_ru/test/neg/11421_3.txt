There were not many thoughts in the storyline on many fronts. It's a good action movie, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> - The film says that the Lycans were held to protect vampires during the day. Yet they are contained in cells and have collars around their necks. Thus, they cannot transform into their wolf form or do what no other slave can do. How does this protect vampires throughout the day? From whom do they protect vampires? Uncontrollable Lycans? Slaves in human form are nothing else than peasants. <br /> <br /> - As I understand it, vampires are immortal and do not age. And yet Sonya is aging from child to adult. Do they just stop aging at a certain age? I understand that Victor is old because he was turned (as explained in the second film). But the vampire age? Strange. <br /> <br /> - I didnâ€™t realize that vampires need torches to see at night. However, we see that they carry torches throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Silver was the only thing that could harm the lycan. However, wooden steaks fired from huge crossbows also kill Lycan. <br /> <br /> These are just some of the things that demonstrate the lack of thought embedded in the story.
