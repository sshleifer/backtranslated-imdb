*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Little can be said about this film of the era of early talk. (I do not dare to call “Cimarron” a “film” because I feel that this word is too esoteric.) But what can be said about it ... mostly speaks against it. <br /> <br /> Take for example, the abuse of the image of Indians as bad people. In one scene, the little boy of the film’s protagonist — an overbearing and overly ambitious family man who wants to create a newspaper business — plays next to his father’s office. Native American kneels in front of a child. “Hello,” the boy says very politely to an Indian. The Indian gives him a quill, gets up and leaves. <br /> <br /> Yancy Kravat Jr. excitedly runs to the office. "Mother Mother!" he shouts, holding the Indian gift. “Look what the Indian gave me!” <br /> <br /> “How many times do I have to tell you!” She snaps at the boy. “Never talk to these dirty Indians!” <br /> <br /> Yansi Yeats (senior Richard Dix) looks like a man speaking with a forked tongue. At the beginning of the story, he seems to have a definite plan for giving his family a better life. But, as we will soon find out, he is not too successful - especially an absolutely motivated person. His slave child, Isaiah (Eugene Jackson), is one of the signs of this. <br /> <br /> After his family’s first campaign to church service on Sunday morning — one <br /> <br /> When, oddly enough, Kravat should preach - Isaiah tries to come dressed as Kravat, a suit with a long tail, holster, gun and all that. Kravat tells him to go home. "I don't want me to come to church with you?" Isaiah speaks with pouting lips. <br /> <br /> "No!" Kravat straightens him, patting him on the shoulder. "You do not understand! I want you to stay and guard the house. And if someone comes at all ... you shoot him! ”<br /> <br /> The characters — not to mention the actors — in Cimarrone could not get out of the burlap, despite the obvious efforts. And nothing in the script was too commendable. (Of course: the incomparable Edna Mae Oliver, notorious for playing the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland, also released in 1931) actually manages to look good when she removes her pompous old woman, which she was better known.) But, besides that, well ... <br /> <br /> Yancy Yates has not been popular in the city since the first week of his arrival, <br /> <br /> and one of the culprits decides to take off the white Kravat's hat when he and his wife (Irene Dunn) accidentally pass by. Despite his anger at the man who shot, Kravat just does it with full dedication. <br /> <br /> This story not only didn’t “shoot at realism”, but was also very <br /> <br /> lacking in several key areas: for example, Kravata’s newspaper was never seen. (Bulletins and posters, yes, but not any newspaper.) Perhaps the strangest of all this: it happens in a small town in Kansas. However, for one reason or another, Yancy Kravat doesn’t know when <br /> <br /> calls his article “Wigwam in Oklahoma”. <br /> <br /> There have always been very few good westerns. and far between - the only exceptions are Clint Eastwood's so-called “spaghetti westerns” in the late 60s - early 70s. On the other hand, the cliché-westerns are a dime. <br /> <br /> If you like cliché-westerns, Cimarron will be proud of you, but as for me ... it made me embarrassed. <br /> <br />
