I mean, you just have to love the Italian film industry. Someone came up with an action movie after the end of the world (“Warrior on the Road”), and the Italians for years were busy playing one robbery after another. Then some other one came up with a successful barbaric film (“Conan”), and the Italians were busy ... uh, see above. <br /> <br /> In addition to countless other variants of the topic (one of my favorites is the “Clever People” Lenzi “Barbarians” with the participation of the Paul twins) created the “Ator” series. And this, the second, is probably the worst (or the best, depending on your point of view). <br /> <br /> Ator is triggered by his old teacher, who discovered some kind of nuclear energy; this, of course, must be protected in order not to fall into the wrong hands. The old man sends his daughter to Ator, and after several complications, Ator, his boyfriend Tong and the girl go back to the castle, which meanwhile fell into some kind of atrocity (of course, the old "classmate" Ator). Somewhere along the way, the heroic trio forgets about conspiracy and destroys some giant cult of snake worship for fun (not before some virgins are sacrificed). Just before the madman finally lost his temper and killed the wise teacher, our heroes remember their duties, invent hang gliding and grenades and save the day. <br /> <br /> Included: the terrible actions of all the participants (especially O'Keeffe)), incredibly funny “special effects” (you just need to adore the scene of the fight with snakes, which should be a kind of humiliation of the Bride of the Monster ”) is bad organized battle scenes, numerous mistakes in continuity (Ator flies on two different hang-gliders during a climate battle, watch her, just an example) and a general misunderstanding of the concept of history (cavemen, “civilized” barbarians, castle builders, all abandoned in one film) . <br /> <br /> If you, like me, are passionate about bad movies, this is one of the TV shows you can see, you will probably end up with ROTFL. For the record: the third part, taken in Malta, is actually quite watchable. <br /> <br /> Considering Joe D'Amato’s other efforts, this is perhaps his most entertaining film, as he, of course, was not able to release watchable horror films or erotic films. But I firmly believe that this happened quite by accident. <br /> <br />
