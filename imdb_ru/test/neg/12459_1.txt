It was so disconnected — it seemed to jump from place to place — and the “thief” was obvious. It was a poor thing (not to mention high school) "Less than zero." I would like to transfer this film, since it has very little to add. So many questions remain unresolved, and this is normal - but the fact that it goes to the point where you are wondering what exactly is happening is terrible. Voice overs is needed because the film does not work by itself. Avoid this movie and watch anything else about rich adolescent fear. I am sure there are many others to watch. Do not waste your time on this.
