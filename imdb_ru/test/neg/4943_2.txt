I'm very disappointed. First, the German sync is bad. Perhaps in the original version (with subtitles) it would be better, but the whole film looks as if the director saw Luna-Papa and the Black Cat and tried to create something in this style. But failed in all aspects. This is an incongruent mixture of a strange, incredible story and very childish jokes. No atmosphere, no life. Extremely primitive sex humor. I voted for 2, because 1 is the worst, and another moment for Sibyl is very nice. Sorry - I like Oriental films, but this one is really superfluous.
