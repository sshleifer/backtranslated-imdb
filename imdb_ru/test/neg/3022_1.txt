4 Real, son, my game, I'm losing my mind, I can't wait for me to go to the show and get into the club, do it in the style of 905 with crazy models and bottles, son! <br /> <br /> No, I'm just kidding. This is a sad show, created and intended for sad men. Men who are so sterilized by modern existence that they direct their frustration to clubs, where they evoke fleeting self-esteem, hunting for chickens, hoping to touch their little sarkam to try to dull the bite of loneliness and make them feel for just one night, as if their place on the Toronto Sausage Board is a little less permanent. <br /> <br /> I read some comments here that said that this show symbolizes that Canadian television finally got on par with American television or something else. Well, this is not a goal at all. It's like, yes! Pat yourself on the back, Canada - you finally cracked the elusive formula for such revolutionary American content as Stud, Heart Change, Elimidat and Fifth Wheel. You see, the real brainchild here is to post “... meets an impartial camera” on the field. Genius. And there is nothing that could cross this fine line between the spirit of fraternity and hidden homosexuality, as a group of adult men filming each other for covert surveillance cameras, admiring each other's “game” in the club. The male love presented here is so tangible that they should think about renaming it to “Keys to a steam bath”. <br /> <br /> By the way, how interesting it is that the people who gave this show seem such vivid reviews to register an IMDb account for the obvious purpose of doing this (I think it’s my fault that I used the same tools here to do the opposite). My personal favorite is an enthusiastic reviewer who claims he comes from the United States and says: "Now it’s clear that Canadian talent is capable of producing high-quality American television." <br /> <br /> Smooth. <br /> <br /> But why bother to create an online buzz at all? In the end, you can not cancel - you're in the Canadian network Comedy Network, baby! The public will ignore your show for many years. In all likelihood, you will be fine, sitting comfortably along this notorious mediocrity with most of the original Comedy Network programs.
