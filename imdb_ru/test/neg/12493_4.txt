Another version of the film about the material gangster films is the classic “The Godfather” and another case of excessive advertising due to the circus in the media. Sarkar, the 13th Hindi film about Ram Gopal Varma as a director, is also the weakest in his Trilogy of the Underworld, including the other two - Satya and Company. Charisma, the magnetic persona of two bachchans, playing the duet of father and son for the first time, is definitely an event worth paying attention to. Not only strong performances, but also their flawless chemistry - this is the biggest result for which Varma deserves praise. However, the same duet equation is missing with other characters in the film. The reason is that other characters are more like cardboard cartoons, especially. Villains represent typical Bollywood villains. The character that attracts attention is the eldest son, played by Kaikai, but again, he can not resist because of the unfinished characterization. , Drama and conflict come to life thanks to the excessive use of close-up filming, which brought the claustrophobic effect that is rightly needed to create an atmosphere. Ghostly Score (Amar Mohile) and sound design (Kunal Mehta, Parikshit Lalwani & Anup Dev), along with a dark, muddy background, overlapping bright vivid images (camerawork by Amit Roy), create visual effects typical of Ramu style. But there is an overuse of music, although fortunately there are no songs in the film. But is it possible to maintain the interest of today's “intellectually growing” audience only on the shoulders of two performers and strong visuals? I do not think so. Of course, the audience "Manngeya more" and here the film is not able to deliver. In any adaptation, in order to add a new dimension, the biggest prerequisite is a scenario that is sluggish, not at all precise, and therefore the pace often slows down. In the end, the audience is exposed to a very predictable, very banal drama with very few unexpected elements. Directed by Top Stunt Allan Amin Ghani is also not in the best shape. Some scenes that require a different attitude include: the minister talks dirty about Sarkar, and the son hears; Sarkar Jr., a very amateur shooter in prison on Sarkar, escapes from the clutches of his enemies, the Son easily motivates to kill his own father, the son secretly enters his father's room to kill him, the police commissioner slaps Sarkar Jr. - all this requires more realistic , hard approach, which is the basis for creating the necessary conflict. Dialogues are weak, for example. look at the amateur line, where the CM says to Sarkar Jr. ?? “In Joe, the police commissioner, we have a main hut diya” ... Women who accept Sarkar's work are completely ignored. Continuous negotiations about criminal activity, while Sarkar and his family also look a bit out of place. In fact, the film follows a schedule that is very similar to its own production of Ramu-Ab Tch Chappan. In the image of the battle between good and evil, the other side of life - the law, the police, the administration, the politics are completely ignored. Of course, more is expected in the content. Here the film definitely falls short and cannot rise above the average tariff. Dear Rama, I agreed that now, when you laugh, turning to the bank, you definitely need to take some radical repair measures at your film production factory before it is too late.
