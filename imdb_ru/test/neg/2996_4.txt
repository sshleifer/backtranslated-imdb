I was pretty lost for most of this film, and Iâ€™m the one who usually understands the work of such mysterious great cinematographers as David Lynch (Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me) and Darren Aronofsky (Pi). This is not to say that Northfork does not make sense at any level, it simply does not combine to form a fully connected film. With the passage of time, his themes and intentions become clearer from watching the film, but during my initial viewing I was really confused, and I discovered that this was the main mistake of the film ... its lack of direction. The plot is concentrated in the city of Northfork, Montana, in 1955. The city was devastated and will soon be flooded to make room for a hydroelectric dam. The main problem is that not all of its residents are ready for evacuation and relocation. A group of people is hired to force the remaining residents of the city to leave the city before it drowns, and for the most part they succeed in quite strange situations with citizens. At the same time, the film tells about Irvine, a very sick boy (or is he a fallen angel?), Whose adoptive parents brought him back because of his illness to Northforka, from which he was adopted. Father Harlan (Nick Nolty) cares for the dying Irvine, but Irwin imagines (or does he?!) That a group of angels (including Daryl Hannah and Anthony Edwards) arrived in a deserted and empty city in search of a fallen angel. Irwin has scars on his back and on his head, and he is trying to convince the angels that his scars are where people amputated his wings and halo. Oh yeah, and during all this, on stilts is a strangely surreal walking animal that roams the whole landscape. There are many other small events that occur in the film, but none of them leads to much more than an instant intrigue. You can appreciate the artistic quality of the film (obviously, the filmmakers deeply cared about this film) and its rich cinematography, but the film still tries too hard to be different, and then gives up and whimpers to the end, without making much of a statement. As I wrote earlier, some time after watching it becomes clear what might have happened in the film. Irwin dies, like Northfork, and, coping with his own loss and death, Irwin most likely created characters from the ideas he receives from the objects surrounding him in the orphanage to console him when he is abandoned, and his life nearing the end. But then again, maybe he really is an angel, and he has found his appearance and can now return home. I must emphasize that there are truly beautiful moments in the film, heartbreaking, bright, full of loneliness and sadness. Unfortunately, the film as a whole is simply cut off and somehow incomplete.
