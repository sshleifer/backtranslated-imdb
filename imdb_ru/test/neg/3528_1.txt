I do not know who financed this and why, but this “want to be” film about vampires is really terrible. He is trying to be fashionable and attracts a young audience of the MTV generation, but this is just ridiculous. The game is terrible, and the direction is terrible. I heard that the budget was $ 600,000. I want to know where all the money went?
