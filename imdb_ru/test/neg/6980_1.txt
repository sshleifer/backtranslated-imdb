I gave this film a chance just because he had very good reviews. After watching the trailer, I thought - what kind of unfunny movie full of cliches. But I decided to do it, because trailers often do not depict the film very well. What a waste of time ... The film is worse than a trailer, and, having spent 2 hours on watching it, I could not remember a single line that would make me laugh. The funniest parts of the movie were parodies of CSI, but itâ€™s also pretty dull. I could not relate to any of the characters, nor hope that they would be together, because I found them completely stupid. The plot is extremely predictable and unconvincing. Unwise comedy for people who are still in high school or think so.
