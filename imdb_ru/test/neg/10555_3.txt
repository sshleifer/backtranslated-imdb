This is a frequently used line, but it really sums up this movie ... "If this is the current state of gay cinema, then we have serious problems." I watched this movie on SIFF because of the high IMDb rating (7.6), and if there ever was a case when there was a vote on IMDb, then this is it. Just see how the number falls in a few weeks of the movie. <br /> <br /> Easy conspiracy ... The boy finds out that his former school boyfriend (boyfriend) is marrying their girlfriend, so he returns to his old hometown (still carrying a 10-year-old torch) to watch what happened. <br /> <br /> First of all, I liked The Last Days, the last function of the director, even though they had cookies and characters, but you have to become a better director with each subsequent release. I donâ€™t know how you get terrible support from many television veterans (Robert Foxworth, Joanna Cassidy, Tori Spelling), but somehow he succeeded. The letter was Lifetime Network quality (in the distant past, when they were REALLY bad), and the situations were unbelievable And uncomfortable to watch them. I continued to reach out to the nonexistent remote control for fast forward, but in the end I forced myself to stay until the end, hoping for a decent end. Phew ... no. Even unreasonable male nudity, which appeared during the film, was so impudent that it seemed to keep people in their places. <br /> <br /> To be fair ... 2 leashes, especially in gratuitous naked scenes, were great. During their incitement of friendship between them, real sweetness arose when they learned how they separated. And the film looked great ... good quality and color saturation for an independent film. <br /> <br /> How is it that network television can give week after week wonderful, entertaining weekly episodes (for example, "Nasty Betty", "Desp. Housewives", etc.), But are there many functional issues Can similar genres be as bad as this?
