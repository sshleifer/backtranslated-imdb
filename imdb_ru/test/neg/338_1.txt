I have computer games over 10 years old with the best special effects! The plot is changeable and very predictable. Most actors seem to be extras without experience! All have Scottish accents. Itâ€™s like watching the Scottish team from Star Trek without individuality and charm. Unnecessary scenes of people breaking tents! Tents with all supposedly high-tech equipment! The actors looked as if they were not sure that the camera was on them. Nothing to worry about whether these people will survive or not! Looks like it was done in someone's backyard and in the garage using budget equipment! Nothing seems original or even a bit interesting. Do not waste time!
