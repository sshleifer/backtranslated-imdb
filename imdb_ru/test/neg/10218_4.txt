This stereotyped film (the hero's girlfriend marries a villain) simply did not advance fast enough, given some of the circumstances of the story. Scott seems too old in this, and too often his character turns away from decisive action, blowing off the scenes. He reacts weakly to the death of some of his hands; he escapes from Knox's gang, hiding in a full barrel of rain; his flight to a high country and the pursuit of John Russell seem superfluous, like most of the film. The plot could be toughened. <br /> <br /> Highlights of the film: watching Ernie Fordâ€™s Tennessee without a mustache, singing Man in the Saddle; Too short scenes of Alfonso Bedoy as a cook; color photograph of the high country and the scene of the struggle with John Russell.
