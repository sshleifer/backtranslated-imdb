"Once again, we have a film that packs about 20 minutes of entertainment - most of which sometimes includes funny band texts - in a 90-minute package." For anyone who is old enough to remember, this is in line with the first “Bill and Ted” WITHOUT the storyline. If it doesn’t tell you how brainless this film is, think about Jack Black singing about 20 minutes of the film, and you can say that. If you really like to listen to Tenacious D because of their musical skills, then cut out and buy a soundtrack. Don't waste your time with it though. If you are a stoner looking for a good bad movie filled with laughter, you still bark at the wrong tree. Regardless of the strength of your kidneys, you will still wish to see Grandma's Boy again instead.
