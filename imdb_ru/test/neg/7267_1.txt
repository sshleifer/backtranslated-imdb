Honestly, in general, everything is said. The planet Andromina (not to be confused with Aunt Jemima) is represented by a cheap strip club LA. There are no strippers, so the most recent male visitors are sent to recruit strippers. <br /> <br /> Men are mistaken for kings or arrested for spying for women (although despite the fact that this is a planet of women, we only get two women who participate in any sex scenes between girls and girls) in the end, as it always happens in science fiction clichés, women become convinced that men are good for something. Well, in any case, not the men who shot this movie! <br /> <br /> But, man, we can see a lot of this in an incredible amount of erotic sex and nudity. In this film, there is less plot than usual for such films, so change the channel if you don’t like this film and grit your teeth if you like such things.
