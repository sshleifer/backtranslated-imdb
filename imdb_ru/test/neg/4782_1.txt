The God! Where should I start? From start to finish, I couldn't help but hate this movie. Vines? Vines that make mobile phone noise ?! Oh yeah, I'm so scared - I'm going to get rid of the weeds of the earth! Come on people! The plot came to a standstill when the group discovered the ruins, and the villagers (without puns) came to warn them and brandished weapons in front of their faces, don't worry, Amy (Jena Malone) was there to take a picture! This whole scene really made me wonder why she didn't take a picture of her boyfriend Jeff (Jonathon Tucker), who sawed off Matthias' feet (Joe Anderson). When the idiots first threw the rope after Matthias, the way the rope was at least ten feet from the ground, but how it could end up being two to four feet from the ground. I can't begin to cover everything that was wrong in this film, too much to cover. I will say that the graphics to the blood was amazing, but that meant nothing, since the game and the script were terribly bad.
