It would be promising if this was a student film. It never seems to know where this is happening, as if they are choosing every next scene when they are making a movie. The result is a lot of repetition and decay rates. There is a completely confusing procedure by which ghosts influence people in this world: Internet, phone calls, computer science experiment, suspicious graduate student, detached behavior, red rooms, dark spots and suicide. Good luck in figuring out the connections, or when the character is still a ghost or is just behaving strangely. The characters are barely drawn, which may be good, but they are completely uninteresting. It takes too long and ends only when it reaches the promising scenario, although the conclusion is meaningless. The weakest point: when the "boss" sits down to give some disjointed advice.
