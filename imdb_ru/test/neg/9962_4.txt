George Zucco was like Boris Karloff in that no matter how poor his film was, he always maintained his self-esteem and turned into a beautiful performance. “Mad Monster” is no exception to this rule. By all standards, this is a bad (albeit interesting) movie. The filmmakers obviously did not know how to make the most of their low-budget scenario, and the script looks as if it was completed in one or two days. Nevertheless, Zucco is good and believable as a mad scientist. <br /> <br /> The film itself is enjoyable at the camp level. Normal horror film fans for the most part will not like PRC films. However, these "Poverty" productions have a small, but loyal cult. Sometimes they go beyond their limits, and “Diversion” is the best example of this. Usually they looked like this. With all its technically bad qualities, “Mad Monster” is a fun way to kill a rainy day. It is recommended to use the DVD from Retromedia, as it is combined with another PRC product, The Black Crow, an original theater trailer, and best of all with an interview with Glenn Strange, telling about his role in this film.
