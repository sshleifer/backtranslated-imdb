Mod Squad is not a movie, but emptiness. Is this the most exciting thing about it and what made me look? I have never seen a movie that offered absolutely nothing before. This is a film without any reason to exist, apparently deliberately designed to attract no one, as if he was contracted to someone who really does not like the studio. There is no plot, no characteristics, no specified action scenes, not even scenes as such, just a sequence of more and more empty frames projected at 24 frames per second. I’m not talking about empty, like in a silent summer blockbuster, but about empty, like in “We don’t have any pages yet, so just point the camera at something and stop when you have 90 minutes”. It makes you appreciate the “artistic achievements” of Charlie Angels and C.AT. it is much more. What he proposes is too much of Giovanni Ribisi in his most tedious performance of his bastard son from a thousand assholes imitating the routine of the Marlon Brando method, Michael Lerner dancing with Omar Epps and ?? no, that's it. Oh, Claire Danes has a nice smile in one shot. And Denis Farin makes sense to kill early. Truly the most meaningless movie ever made, it’s like “L'Humanite” without joking, but, you know, for children.
