This film is one of the worst examples of deception. People who read IMDb comments may be tempted to see this complete waste of time, like me, with fake tags such as “Returning to the horror of the 80s” and “what-no.” This film sucks, from acting to directing to history. Awful, all across the board. And I really like GOOD horror films, I'm not a snob at all. It sucks. For reference, I loved The Grudge 1 and 2, Black Sheep, Planet Terror, Texas Massacre Chaisaw The Beginning, Others, The Ring, Jason X, Slither, Planet Terror, and really hated The Ring 2, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (re-do) Wolf Creek, The Hills Have Eyes (remake) Hostel 1 and 2, and this film. Gore does not exceed fun or originality.
