I found this film completely and completely incomprehensible. I knew some of his facts about Caravaggio, but here they were perverted and perplexing. The images were strangely interesting, but I was looking more for the biographical and / or critical report on Caravaggio’s life and work, rather than the LSD drug trip. distracted. If it had been called a “feature film,” I would not have bought a DVD; I now have a DVD that I will never watch again, and who will buy it? I prefer mainstream movies, rather than those that require translation or clarification. Thumbs down on this one for me!
