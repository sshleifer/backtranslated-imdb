Before we begin, let me say that I hope that you have already eaten when reading this. What for? Because after the first time I saw this film, the appearance and sound of the bird made me want to eat chicken after the word “End” appeared on the screen. So do not say that you were not warned. <br /> <br /> Fred Sears may have shot Earth Against UFOs (a good movie and one of the most prominent examples for Tim Burton’s Attack of Mars) Giant Claw is not a huge movie. Yes, this is a prehistoric monster that flies in the air, attacks planes and cities, and sometimes heals itself with a parachute. The beast is gigantic, except for scenes where it is much smaller, but who needs the constant proportions in the film? Fearfully? It could be, but not in the event that the plot is hopelessly stupid, and the monster looks like a puppet who has run away from Sesame Street.
