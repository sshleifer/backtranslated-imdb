First of all, let me say that those of you who voted for “10” are only deceiving themselves and trying to get votes at a decent level ... something that this film does not deserve. (The only films that deserve 10 IMO are classics ... The Godfather, Shoushank, etc. See the full list of films of all time for the full list.) I also noticed that many people voted to be as realistic as it looks like inside a cave. Although I would have to agree with them regarding the environment, they just do not appreciate the film as a whole ... they are delighted with the environment, but miss the general overview. It would be similar to how I voted 10 for the film “From Justin to Kelly”, because I think that the scenes on the beach remind me of how this happens in the Florida Keys ... although it can to be true, it does not deserve to receive film 10, because the film as a whole was rancid. <br /> <br /> I would like to tell you that something saved this film, as usual, if one thing stinks in horror, something else rises or compensates for weakness (Ex. - Bad actors are clouded by a great storyline and / or great camera work and scenery.) We started the DVD, and it all started pretty well. We jokingly began to find out who would die first ... after a short trip and a hike, they camped out for the night. At that moment I introduced some things that really made me turn off the rest of the film. I had two major problems: bad effects and even worse storyline. The first thing we all noticed was that the fires were not real ... you can clearly see the "cgi" or the fake flame in which they all sat. In order for a horror film to have such a clear flaw, I should have told you what I would do for the next hour. <br /> <br /> A few minutes later they showed me how badly this film was written. I don’t remember exactly how they came to this moment, but basically we learn that “nerd-token” is writing a book about exploring caves, etc. Another guy in the group wants to tell a story about the experience, but hesitates to say: “ I don't want this story in your book. ” The author convinces and persuades the other that he will not put the story in his book and that he can trust him. (Direct quote: "If I tell you this story, you will surely want it in my book.") At that moment, I fully expected a good 5-minute story filled with memories and a soul game. What I received was a short, poorly spoken (and valid) statement. I say a statement, because what he finished was about 10 seconds and 5 sentences. I don’t remember exact quotes, but basically he says: “We were in a cave, the cave was flooded, the girl died when our friend watched her sink.” You may think that I am too exaggerating and really critical, but this is not too far from a direct quotation, line by line, from the movie scene. <br /> <br /> For the next 50 minutes or so, the film takes place in a cave, and although the lighting is what I imagine, like in a cave, I could actually do without a really fuzzy one / a foggy look at the film, and camera shake is just what I didn't do. (I have really good eyesight, and after watching the main parts of the film I felt legally blind.) I was emotionally divorced from this film, so parts that probably should have been scary were not. Perhaps if I could miss the very slow and poorly-played start of this film, I would at least be scared, but I don’t remember anyone in the dark room even jerking in any of the action scenes. /> <br /> The last scene was probably one that I will never forget, and this is not a good thing. Mostly two women were trapped in a bare room. The "monster" comes to attack / kill the women ... he stops when he sees a photo of a little boy. The memory happens when we learn that the "monster" was injured like a little boy and spent his entire life in a cave. Cut to the present, and he takes his “mask” (a big skeleton with what looks like a buckskin shirt). He looks at the picture, and two women seem to have found the weakness / weakness of the caveman. At this point, he strikes and kills one girl, and then figuratively rapes another woman. After about 30 seconds of observing how the camera sways and shakes, when he rapes her, turns over the captions, the film is over. <br /> <br /> Honestly, if I had to do all this, and I wasted money renting this movie, I could save an hour and watch the first scene and the last scene of this movie, and still get away with those same thoughts about it as now. <br /> <br /> Those of you who compare this with Blair Witch are very off ... if any of you read about how the director and screenwriter directed Blair’s shooting, you would understand how revolutionary this is. .. handing each actor the script of the day / night of filming, so that other participants do not know what the other actor was doing genius. <br /> <br /> If IMDb allowed me, he would get a negative result ... I do not understand how someone in their right mind would recommend this film.
