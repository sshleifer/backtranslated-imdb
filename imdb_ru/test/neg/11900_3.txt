I rented this type of “soft core” before, but I can honestly say, I did not expect it to be in the same style as “Rod Steele: you only live until you die” - which was both sexy and funny. He had a good script, a sincere host and a sense of purpose. It also has a Gabriella Hall, which is hot. The reason I didn’t expect this film was that there was a “Must be 18 to rent” sticker on the box. I was looking for more cheese and less cheesecake. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think that films should not start with “actors” rehearsing a role in the talent agency (or wherever “actors” rehearse). In this film, the “actors” rehearsal underlines the lack of preparation that led to the action of the real characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Well, after learning that this film was a program, I don’t necessarily turn it off and demand my money back. But the dizzying way of adding “erotic” scenes in the video to what was probably the late release of pay cable television is very annoying and easy to transfer without constant quality, say, Rod Steele. You know, they must have had some money, because I think some of them were filmed abroad. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the main actor, trying not to shed an invisibility potion on himself, is one of the most Uncomplicated actor's work I have ever seen. And I saw Torgo from Manos! Perhaps it was worth the rent in dollars (this is also Gabriella Hall). Nevertheless, there are the best banal films that can be rented with friends.
