** Possible spoilers ** Dreamwork and director Peter Chan's “Love Letter” is a romantic comedy taking place in the picturesque coastal village of New England, where lonely mother Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a strange little bookstore. Once at work, Helen came across an anonymous letter (the “love letter” in the title) that somehow got stuck under the cushions of the reading sofa. After reading in her love prose, she believes that it was written to her, deliberately placed on the sofa to search for her, and, for her own reasons, thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer. By chance, however, Helen leaves a letter where her collaborator Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds it, considers it for her, and, of course, thinks she knows who wrote it. Then circumstances bring him into the possession of a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), who believes that Helen wrote him a letter. And before everything is settled, you can only imagine funny situations in which all involved were involved; and I mean, imagine, because, as this film is played out, viewers get a little more from it than what it brings. There are two particular areas in which this romantic comedy fails: it is simply not very romantic and not funny; and this is a powerful combination that makes this film smash from almost the initial titles. After the setting and the main character (Helen) were set, for the next ninety minutes or so they almost never left. By the time you finally know who actually wrote the letter, and who you do not care. The cast is completed by Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Julianne Nicholson, Gloria Stewart and Geraldine McEwen. It is a shame to see how such a talent is wasted on such nonsense, like this, and it looks bad in the balance. Kate Capshaw, who usually makes the screen brighter, just appearing, looks tired here, while Selleck seems to have just come out of a three-day spell that lasted a week. Ellen DeGeneres really goes in search of the best of all. It is said that travel is often more fun than a destination. However, in the case of the “Love Letter”, it would be better for all interested parties if everyone would first stay at home. I rate it 1/10.
