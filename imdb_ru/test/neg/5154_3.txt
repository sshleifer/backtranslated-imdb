My mother took me to this film when I was about seven years old, that is, thirty years ago. She did not know that the family film would be so cruel. My most vivid memory was that the boy's father had a pain face when he was wounded in the stomach and killed. This image haunted me for several weeks. I learned that I live in a world where a person can strike my father at any time. How could I stop them? How could my father protect himself? You must understand that this blow is not a fantasy for a seven-year-old child. It is as real as evidence of a real event, and does not take place in the innocent mind of a child. Sadly, we still do not understand the impact of violence on the lives of our children on both our children and our society. If only parents protected their children from images of violence with the same energy that they protect them from images of naked people and sex.
