I can't even describe it. this is the worst movie i have ever seen (i'm a good guy when i call it a movie). Just another big budget made for someone who doesn't like to think. It's not even scary. It's disgusting when there are great movies that never go to the big screen, and then this ... “thing” comes in to deceive movie fans. I think big producers do whatever they want. <br /> <br /> Just take a big producer, hot chicks (albeit horrible actresses) and a bunch of horror movie clichés, and cook them for a week or so, and you get the Nun. <br /> <br /> And I thought that Bad Boys 2 was terrible !!!!
