This film finished it on CGI, I mean sci-fi, in fact they did it, "BATS", better, it does not use CGI as a sequel. in this film, they are ordinary people fleeing mutated killer bats. and really bats in Afghanistan ?! The plot includes American soldiers who find the terrorist and are attacked by bats and die <_ <, but the reason I gave the film 3 stars is how the camera approaches the soldiers. acting is bad and it doesn't even look like a horror movie. Throughout this film is a pretty good television film for a sci-fi channel. but if you like science fiction movies, you will love this movie, because you just love channel 43, and if you fall asleep during the movie, don't be surprised. oh sorry i think instead i give 2 stars.
