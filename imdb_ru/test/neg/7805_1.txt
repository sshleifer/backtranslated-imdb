I saw this film (unfortunately) because it was the only option at the time, and because David Zucker was the director. I saw his previous Naked Gun (both parts), Airplane and Top Secret, and I liked it, at least I had a good time and laughed. I'm not saying that the films I mentioned were masterpieces, but were fine. I don’t remember a single more stupid movie except this one. It’s incredible how much the Hollywood industry is in decline. If a studio spends money to create this terrible picture, it is not surprising that such stories are more common today. This is a clear reflection of a decadent civilization, in which sex symbols and silly scenes are created for the entertainment of ordinary people. I have nothing to say about this movie. If you are planning to rent or buy it, please do not waste your money or time, avoid it, no matter what. Even if you are a fan of one of the actors, it is not worth it. In fact, this can be a very good example of what the director should avoid. I will no longer watch the Zucker film. (He plans to shoot the fourth sequel of the movie "Scary", imagine!). Pathetic. Awful.
