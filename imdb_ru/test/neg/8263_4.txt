I agree with most of the critics above. Even more, I was shocked by the presentation of love scenes with a homosexual couple. What for? because while they are the director, the producers? - had no coercion to represent different heterosexual couples in the most passionate embrace, including nudity and super-close-ups of French kisses and all sorts of naked deformations in bed, completely unnecessary in their length and in history, when the moment came to show the same experience with homosexual in a couple, they only dare to go to a painfully painful embrace, almost among the learned giggles, with two very nervous actors. So, in fact, the creators of this film found homosexuality NONRAL, as one of the characters in some scene says. What is the difference with the Spanish cinema! I remember being present at the screening of the film “Almodovar” in the Italian cinema in Rome and was completely amazed by the complete lack of reaction of the Italian audience, they were afraid of the reaction !! when in Spain people fell from their seats, laughing at all the risky situations and incredible wit and talent of Almodovar. It is obvious that in Italy there are dark forces in its history that impede the free expression of some very normal and natural emotions. A pity. I must add that I was very surprised to find that the same comment was condemned by another correspondent. This is very bad and dangerous when the narrowness of others does not allow us to express our opinion on certain issues. Where is the freedom of speech? I do not know whether this censor will approve the changes I was forced to make to this comment, and I hope that he will not receive the same appeal from some other restricted judge. Take pity again.
