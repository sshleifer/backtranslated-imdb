I just watched it today on tv. It was in the Sunday movie ABC. <br /> <br /> It was not a very good film, but for such a budget independent film, everything was fine. There is some uncertainty in this, but there are so many bad qualities that really destroy the film. The script is rather weak, and the plot elements are not very realistic, for example, as the 911 operator laughed and hung when someone reported a murder. I do not know what the writer was thinking when he came up with this idea, but it is not very realistic. <br /> <br /> I thought that this film would be a good thriller with uncertainty, because several scenes that seemed to lead to something good, but, unfortunately, they did not. There were several plot elements that were used in other films like this, and, in the end, were not very creative. <br /> <br /> If there’s something good about this movie, it’s Cast. Each actor in this film coped well with what they had to work with. The terribly underrated actress Elizabeth Pena was great in this movie. She is very sexy and has an incredibly sexy voice. However, if you want to see her really good film, watch The Incredibles superb animated film. In this film, she used her sexy voice. <br /> <br /> What can I say, this film is really not worth your time, but the actors were good. Unfortunately, they were all wasted on this film, which is a real shame. This film tried to be a good thriller, but in the end it failed. If you want to watch a good movie, similar to this one, but much better, see “The Traveler” If you want to see something with the actors of this film, watch every other film of theirs. You can easily transfer this movie if you ever have the opportunity to watch it.
