WOW, I would not want to seem self-assured, but anyone who rated this film higher than me should have I.Q. it reaches unimaginably low depths that go beyond time and space and connect on the planet "Hopper is the retarder to create this film." WOW this movie STANK. Fred Ward's haircut looks like SSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPIIIDDD! In fact, I was thinking of sending money to Fred Ward as compensation for this pathetic hairstyle he owned in this horrible movie. Jodie Foster, of course, did not have anything to work with, but she still controls the terrible game. Joe Sands, oh god ... Joe Sands (mysteriously not played) plays the ULTRATIVE stereotypical movie hero Joe Sands, complete with killing mobs and using the word F all the time. You wonâ€™t believe your eyes. Dean Stockwell, watching him in this mess, made me feel bad because I really thought he was either intoxicated or temporarily retarded throughout the entire film. John Turturro himself must have been drunk when he agreed to take part in this, along with Vincent Price, Bob Dylan and Charlie Sheen. I know what you're thinking, BIG ACTOR! I know, and it was the BEST wonderful acting film I've ever seen. Dennis Hopper directs the stars and does equally badly in both areas. How could a person direct EASY RIDER, and then it is far from my superb imagination. His VERY bad accent in the character of the hired assassin is beyond the terrible realms, and only he has a funny bad ending. They (Hopper and Foster) are the most uninteresting couple, I believe that I have ever come across my world of cinema, and you will be rooting for the fact that they lost, and then they will be extremely happy with the final. What exactly do they wear on this conclusion? I don't know, but I know that if I ever meet Dennis Hopper, I will make fun of him for being responsible for this waste of celluloid. Join me! UPA
