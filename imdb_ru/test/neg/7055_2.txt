The name of the movie makes it sound like porn, but it's not even a sex comedy. Instead, “Hot Summer” in Barefoot County talks about an official sent from a southern state to a small town to find and arrest self-racers. Moonshine comes from an old woman's farm with three beautiful daughters. Almost everyone can guess what will happen next, but, oddly enough, the film is very tame. It hardly even claims to be a PG rating. Moreover, the low budget is evident in almost every frame, and acting is soooo amateur. This film was probably intended for a crowd of drivers, but it was unlikely to satisfy them even in 1974.
