Jim Varney's first real film is very good, but donâ€™t expect to see Ernest P. Warrell anytime soon. I felt that the wide range of characters depicted by Varney was great, but without words the rest of the film should be placed in a mulcher or something like that. A rather strange beginning for the movie icon.
