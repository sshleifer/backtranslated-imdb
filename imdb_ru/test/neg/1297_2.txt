This film was a complete trash. I sat and looked at it absolutely in a rage that it was funded. They definitely spent their entire budget on special effects, not on the writer and director, but on some actors. <br /> <br /> At first, acting was soft and trash. The story was not attractive enough for the audience. Instead of looking at the storm from the point of view of the people, the story was told more by government officials and the army, which is not really a way to contact them, as most of us hate politicians anyway. The author tried to add a human element to unrealistic characters by adding a short story about a father and a son who failed completely. <br /> <br /> As for directing ... oh my god, his methods to try to create tension and anxiety are repeated and overly. The acceleration of camera movements, and then the sudden flash of a pause on the characterâ€™s face when something terrible happened, was pitiful. <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched to the end was to see special FX. What is bad, since special effects should not make a film, but only strengthen the history and experience. There was no story. <br /> <br /> I really would not watch this, full of trash and embarrassment of the British film industry.
