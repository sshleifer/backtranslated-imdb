This film should not be reviewed in descending order, it just made me decide that I would not go to watch the next Tarantino film. And I loved the Tarantino films. <br /> <br /> Not fanciful, not entertaining, not witty, not funny, nothing, just boring and stupid. If this film were Tarantino first, he would be the last. <br /> <br /> Tarantino should pull himself together, otherwise his next film will be a 3 hour pointless, boring and boring dialogue. It seems that he fell in love with his dialogue - and his love is blind. <br /> <br /> After you have finished your popcorn, there is no longer any reason to sit in a theater.
