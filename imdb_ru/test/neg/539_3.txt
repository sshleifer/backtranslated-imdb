Well, I saw The Wrath of the Ninja. <br /> <br /> I would not advise this to people who are not seriously addicted to Japanese militants. This is a kind of film about Japanese martial ninjas with a complex plot. This is about these three old ninja schools that have had these 3 "Swords of Magic". I saw the version with subtitles (by the way, it is NOT recommended, something is easy to miss), and I didnâ€™t really follow all this. There were some good scenes there, but, in general, I didn't like it very much.
