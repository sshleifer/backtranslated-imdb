The Concorde ... Airport '79 begins in Washington DC, where a man named Carl Parker (Macon (McCulman)) contacts the high-level television news reporter Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely) to hand over secret documents confirming his boss Kevin Harriosna (Robert Wagner ) The owner and president of Harrison Industries, which develops weapons for the military, illegally sold these weapons to other countries. However, Maggie sees that Karl was killed, and she is barely escaping from her life, Maggie should catch Concord to Paris the next morning. intends to blow the whistle to Harrison, who also turns out to be her boyfriend who can kill him. Determined to save himself, he reprograms his high-tech "Buzzard" homing missile to intercept and destroy Concord during a test launch, killing everyone on board. and destruction of documented evidence ... <br /> <br /> Renamed Airport '80 - Concorde for movie theaters and home video releases, because it was released here in 1980, and not in 1979. The last entry in the Airport franchise was filmed by David Lowell Rich, the infamous bad film that was apparently laughed at during the press and tests, prompting Universal to promote the film as a thriller. The first thing to say is that The Concorde ... Airport '79 is a really stupid and frankly stupid movie, but on a purely entertainment basis I can think of much worse movies that can be spent on watching 108 minutes, I really can. I really liked the absurd plot that a rich industrialist wants to kill his television reporter's girlfriend before she can expose him as an illegal arms merchant, but this guy does nothing tricky and decides that the best way to do this is to blow up Concord with his own guided missile, and then gets the Fench fighter pilot to try and shoot him down before finally sabotaging him, so there are actually three mini distress clicks here, since every time the super-pilot Joe Patroni tsya to save the day. You know that Joe Patroni, played by George Kennedy, appears in all four films of the Airport, and from the mechanic in the first experimental film Concord, I also think that he jittered a little, because for nine years he was bound with four major aviation accidents. I think the real reason why the Airport series stopped here was because Patroni resigned after that, and the evil eye was removed. Some things that happen here are just stupid, Patroni makes barrel throws, flies upside down and maneuvers the guided missile in the huge Concord, not to mention that he lands and launches missiles from his window to destroy the rocket. keeping a calm head. This guy is good, very good. Then there is a character, a saxophone playing a black dude who smokes weed in the toilets, an old woman with a bladder problem and a team of Russian gymnasts with a bad accent. In addition, despite the fact that the passengers of the Concorde were almost hit by a rocket and then attacked by a fighter jet, it seems to me that they are not worried and returned safely to board the next day, I don’t know about you, but after that I probably find a safer way to travel and why don't the police or authorities ask anyone? Why is the Captain of "Concord" Patroni allowed to just sleep and sleep with a French prostitute? Concord ... The airport is 79 years old, of course, not boring and full of unforgettable moments, and I was entertained in some way, although this is far from a good movie, and modern audiences may not have enough patience, damn it, I liked it that it was stupid, but it is not a kind of classic. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Concord no longer flies, it still looks pretty cool on the plane, and there are a lot of videos that were used in Concord ... The airport of 79 was the seventh. This Concorde was also the same aircraft that crashed after a rupture of the fuel tank due to a tire outage and a fuel leak caught fire on July 25, 2000, and during take-off in Paris, unfortunately 109 passengers and crew members died on board and 4 people. on the ground. When it was broadcast on television in the United States in 1982, nearly twenty minutes of new footage was added, with most, if not all, filmed two years after the initial production was completed. I know that the effects here are from the majority, but I don’t think they are too bad, considering that this was done in the late 70s, I think they are pretty good. The camera moves during the snapshots, instead of real toy models, real shots of real planes are used, which, in my opinion, would look much worse, and I, of course, could see what the manufacturers were trying to do with limited means and limited technologies. In a strange way, they are impressive, not even looking so good, if you know what I mean. Probably the most active of all the films of the Airport are rockets, exploding planes, bold crash landings, murders and a guy named Robert Palmer (no, not a singer) who heads a woman in the jacuzzi. <br /> <br /> IMDb says that it had a budget of about $ 14,000,000, which is actually more than I thought, maybe these special effects are not so impressive after all. Filmed in Utah, Washington, Los Angeles and France. The game here is not very good, people do not look so worried that they are about to die. Gurge Kennedy gets bad unidirectional roles, while Robert Wagner plays the bad guy. <br /> <br /> The Concorde ... Airport '79 is entertainment for bad movie lovers everywhere, and to be frankly honest, I’m rather watching this entertaining mess of the movie than two hours Oscar nominated
