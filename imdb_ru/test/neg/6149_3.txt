But then again, what ever? I took it at my local store for 99 cents, you guessed it, for 99 cents (plus tax). I remember seeing this on video in my teens and thought it was a cool movie. It is a pity that the film and my memories do not match. Despite this, itâ€™s not a terrible way to blow a couple of hours, and it's nice to see some vintage Bill Paxton and Mark Hamill. Bla ... Bla ... Bla ... Dude, I can't think of anything else to say about this movie ... (Just fill in the space to follow the ten line rule ...) bloody lines of text? Anyway, ten lines of text, eh? Hmm, it's hard to find ten lines when you can't remember the squats about the movie you just watched.
