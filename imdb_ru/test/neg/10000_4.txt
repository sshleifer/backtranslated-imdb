This is an example of why most militants are the same. General and boring, here is really not worth watching. Total waste then barely revealed talents Ice-T and Ice Cube, each of which has repeatedly proved that it is able to act and act well. Don't worry about it, visit New Jack City, Ricochet, or look at the New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz n the Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for the Ice Cube and see the real deal. Ice-T's horribly closed dialogue alone makes this movie jagged, and I still wonder what the hell did Bill Paxton do in this movie? And why the hell is he always playing the same character? Starting with “Strangers”, in every film I saw with Bill Paxton, he plays exactly the same annoying character, and at least in Strangers his character died, which made him somewhat encouraging ... <br / > <br /> Generally second-rate garbage. There are countless better movies to watch, and if you really want to see this one, look at Judgment Night, which is almost an exact copy, but has the best game and the best script. The only thing that made all this worthy of attention is a decent hand on camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing, which is close to compensating for the horrible film itself - but not quite. 4/10.
