This film is claimed to be a comedy. So where everyone laughed went. I forgot to put them on the version I was looking at. Like a football movie, it's a little interesting, I think. Maybe I'm just a stick in the dirt, without a tangible sense of humor. Or maybe this movie is just not funny. It is also annoying, with such an excellent musical score “you are the winner”. And it's strange that the team failed through Most of the season won only the last two games, and the last game meant nothing, because they were not in the playoffs. So what's the point? Do they celebrate mediocrity? I do not see it. If someone knows, please let me know. In any case, this film is not great or even not very good. I give him a low 3 *
