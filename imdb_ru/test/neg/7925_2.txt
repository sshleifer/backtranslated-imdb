This film is so stupid that I want to return my $ 2.99 for which I paid !! At first, this film begins with a group of fans from the tree of actors with a talented performance, as if they were fired somewhere from the street, because the “real” actors either did not appear because of a ridiculous script, or simply could not despair enough to make this movie! The music in this movie is enough to put you to sleep, and the flute music created for fairy dancing in the desert is not even suitable for this movie! And the guy dressed like Satan looks like he is all dressed in a special K-Mart Halloween costume! There are no dead scenes except a few lame scenes. When I saw how terrible murderers look in these bath robes with Nosferatu’s faces, I just laughed! This is what the whole city should run away once a year! This movie is one of the worst demonic films I've ever seen. Avoid this!
