Hell's Angels came out of the losers in this film. Sonny told the director that NOBODY does this with the Angles and gets away with it. His version was that two guys should have been shot to death, but his proposal was ignored. They could not even appear, much less be “technical consultants” in the smelly bomb in such a film. Corners of hell on jap bikes? C'mon! (although in Sonny’s autobiography, he says: “F $ # K Harley Davidson!” and that if they were smart, they would ride a Honda. (ST1100) Read his car ... he hates Harley. the city on their sewing machine that sounds on Japanese motorcycles? Not too frightening. They will laugh outside the city.
