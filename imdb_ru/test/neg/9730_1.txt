When I saw on the voting panel that some people gave this film 10 points, I assumed that they did not know that the score was not out of 100. This is a disaster film in the real meaning of this term. Poorly written and poorly directed with so-called actors, unable to act, but able to grimace when they are ordered. For the first 60 minutes, the story seems to be moving in one direction, then it changes tactics and gets involved in a powerfight with extremely bad special effects. Unable to come up with a clever way for a hero with limited abilities to beat a villain with supernormal abilities, the “writer” is deceiving. Obviously, the father was added to the so-called storyline, because it was easier than working out an acceptable outcome. Not that the letter even contains the word “denouement”. Some movies go straight to DVD. This one had to go straight to the dustbin.
