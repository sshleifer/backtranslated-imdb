The fact that this rough series can cause dozens of comments (and especially hundreds of “votes”), says a lot about the decline of the Western (or, at least, American) civilization. <br /> <br /> Read, Proust, assholes! ! Or at least the anthologies of Dave Barry or Calvin and Hobbes. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris. Wrap your brains with the fact that in order to rate or write about this series, you would have to spend minutes ... no, HOURS ... to watch this poor shit treading on boards and spewing lines with less emotional impact than the girl who used to cancel the correct time in your local service. <br /> <br /> PLEASE DON'T LOOK THIS SHOW !! FORGET THE MULTIPLE REMAINING BRAIN CELLS!
