I haven't watched this show for months, but for a while I had to watch it every day, because I had a roommate who liked it. So, perhaps, in all this time, it has improved significantly, although advertising and rating 4.2 on IMDb are not a good sign. <br /> <br /> It was just a quick replacement for Chappepel's show. Even Mencia says so. And although I wasn’t even such a big fan of Chappell’s show, his jokes were at least original and clever (and much sharper than Mencia ever). The jokes of Mensia are completely unoriginal and stale. If you don't see it, I think you just have no hope. But honestly, here are a few examples: <br /> <br /> - Mencia frankly tears down a parody of Lil John in Chapelle. Just take it. <br /> <br /> South Park shoots an episode about Scientology. A week later, Mencia jokes on his show about how he insults Scientologists. Keep in mind that the joke is not about Scientologists, but about how much he offended them on his show. When, up to this point, he had never made a single Scientology joke. <br /> <br /> Two photos of AP appear on the Internet after Hurricane Katrina, in which a black man “robs” products and a white woman “find” them. A few weeks later, after millions of people had already seen it, Mencia presented it on his show as if he had discovered it, and this is shown for the first time (The Daily Show would be something like that in a day). Sorry. <br /> <br /> Even more annoying is how Carlos advertises himself and his show, claiming that he overcomes some kind of barrier for the PC (whatever), and that if you don’t laugh, you should be a weak prude. who can't cope with jokes about race. Yes, Carlos, this is not because you are not funny, but because we are too offended to laugh (if it was really true, then why Shapelle Shaw was so popular?). He constantly scolds his audience for “not understanding this” if he lacks laughter, and often repeats and explains his jokes - a technique that most comedians stop using by the age of 14. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, that Mencia, it seems, is not very smart. It's tragic that dozens of funny, more insightful comedians try to do this while this guy is rolling on money. His show presumably ranks third in the rating of Comedy Central, which baffles (again, this site has a rating of 4.2). Where the hell do they get these numbers? Comedy Central tries to make itself known as a “sharp” station, but as long as it tries to reach out to the most stupid audience, this will never be the case.
