Let me start by saying that I was looking forward to the release of this film for a while. After I finally got the chance to see him last night, I'm sorry to say that I was incredibly disappointed. It's hard to imagine a film that could have made last year's “Exorcist: The Beginning” look good, but Dominion does just that. No, wait ... it looks like a BIG movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I’m too excited about this film, and it contributed to frustration. In the end, the idea that Warner Bros. releasing two versions of the same film within six months of each other, was exciting. In addition, I am a big fan of Stellan Skarsgard, and, in truth, he is a great performer, despite the often ridiculous content of the film. On the other hand, the cast in this film is terrible. Clara Bellar seems to be capable of only one expression - an empty look and conveys all his lines in the same monotonous tone, while Father Francis Gabriel Mann is ridiculous. The effects in this film are ridiculous at best, and the mere frivolity of all this is enough to deprive the film of any chance of being taken seriously. This film caused a more sultry giggle than anything else, and except for one really scary shot that lasted about three seconds and made my girlfriend close her eyes and whimper, he also did not offer anything in the intimidation department. I could go into details and maybe give away some spoilers, but, frankly, I'm too tired, thinking about how bad this film is to write everything I would like to say. <br /> <br /> The saddest partly, the main idea that both versions of the film tried to give ... is a story about a priest who lost his faith and then regained it after reconciliation with his troubled past .. . had tremendous potential especially with Skarsgård as lead. Unfortunately for us, this potential has been missed. Go and see this film only if you are really interested in how it differs from the Harlin version, but don’t expect to see a good film, otherwise you will regret spending your money and two hours of your life. Otherwise, be happy with the released version and move on.
