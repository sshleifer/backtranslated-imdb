We arrived at the theater too late to see Rendition, which was our intention, and Return was the only film that had not yet begun. It seemed to me how bad the film was after reading a short advertisement at the box office. When we arrived, the theater was empty, and only two others entered before the movie began. <br /> <br /> The writers and the director threw all conceivable sports clichés into the audience, not causing a single laugh, not a single one during the entire film. Think about all the football films made and that schools and fans spend millions of dollars a year of football, and you understand how ripe it is for it to be parodied or used. If you add Texas to your mix, you should come up with a sporty version of “Little Miss Sunny,” rather than a big yawn. <br /> <br /> The first movie that came to mind when we left the theater was “I Can't Stop the Music” For comparison, it was “I Can't Stop the Music” without Bruce Jenner, Valerie Perrin or the Village People. <br /> <br /> If the film had a single grace, he saw Matthew Lawrence grow up.
