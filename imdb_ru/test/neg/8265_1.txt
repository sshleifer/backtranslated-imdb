This episode was boring and was not even terrified, so while this season Masters of Horror prepared one really good episode ... Damn thing ... itâ€™s still early, I believe that episodes will be better, I admit that the vampire was fine, but he lacked a solid storyline. The episode with the couple who caught the serial killer started off boring, but the last fifteen minutes were really good. However, I'm just disappointed by the lack of originality and horror that episodes of the first season had. Please save this season John Carpenter! I believe that Pro-Life will buy for the whole dim season so far. <br /> <br /> "You are an evil little elf!"
