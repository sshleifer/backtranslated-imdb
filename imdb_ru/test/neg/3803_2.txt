I accidentally caught it in the middle of flipping through channels. I immediately recognized almost everyone in the cast, the “excellent” haircuts aside, and thought what movie could attract such actors from both past and future stars? Not seeing the original, I guessed that this could be the "Adventure of Poseidon", since he was clearly on a ship in distress. Was I wrong? I cannot imagine why any of these great (or promising) actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with such garbage. There is no story, all the performances looked compelled, the characters - a parody of the usual roles in disaster films, which unexpectedly unite the event, and begin to talk about the real meaning of life at the level of philosophy bumper stickers. <Br /> <br /> One has only to see the extraordinarily terrible speeches of such great people as Sally Field, Michael Caine, and others. They must have needed money very much. Can we blame the director?
