This is by far the worst movie ever made. I have no doubt. I saw such crap as Manos, Cosmic mutiny and whatnot, and I can honestly tell you that they do not hold a candle in Science of the Mad. <br /> <br /> The Science of Madness has no obvious plot. Something about a guy making a woman pregnant with turkey, and a child born hours later, fully grown and ready to kill. Of course, being a newborn, it takes about an hour to kill people. The director constantly shoots shots and takes about fifteen minutes to arrange an awkward death. There is a whole dialogue page for the entire movie, but the dialogue appears about a minute after it is spoken about. <br /> <br /> An example of a scene: a monster is walking down the corridor. We know this because he has about ten minutes of looping shooting his legs. In the intervals between cycles, we treat two working women. Repeat until nausea for about 20 minutes. When the monster does appear, no one moves, and everyone looks like deer in the headlights, as it takes the monster another 10 minutes to get to them to kill them. In terms of action, you could guess that people are already dead. <br /> <br /> I know that my description does not seem too bad, but believe me, I cannot fully describe the pain of science. Crazy. <br /> <br /> Stay away and boycott all the video stores that carry it. :) <br /> <br />
