It is sad to say that this is one of the most stupid westerns of John Wayne from the series “Poor Star” for Lone Star Productions. Here he is the US Marshal on the trail of a gangster, known only to me, I do not joke like Shadow. <br /> <br /> No, this is not Lamont Cranston, but some dude who gives an order through an open wall in safety, so his people do not see who he is. But the voice is unmistakable, you will know after 10 minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> And another reviewer here is completely wrong, there wouldn’t have been any screams and groans from the public side, because Gabby Hayes still played different roles, and here he is clean shaved. He has not yet found his niche as a handsome old-fashioned assistant to various heroes of cowboy films, such as the duke. <br /> <br /> Later, he really leads his people quite openly in the climax, so I'm not sure what the point of the original trick with the wall safe is. I do not think that those who wrote this, also knew about it. <br /> <br /> Wayne gets here Yakimu Kanutta as a Korean girlfriend, and the relationship is about the same as that of Lon Ranger and Tonto without a mask. <br /> <br /> This is all pretty stupid if you ask me.
