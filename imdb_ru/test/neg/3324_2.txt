I should have known when I heard that Ann Rice left the project, that the film would disappoint me. I could not predict that years after it was released, only thinking about the film still makes me angry. These novels are amazing, and although I understand that a lot is lost when translated to the screen, this film became the big middle finger of her original work. I hope one day someone will try again, correctly, starting with “Vampire Lestat”. They change the roles and appearance of the main and minor characters, but without a good reason. They destroy the history of Lestat. The Queen's play is exaggerated before the comedy, but I just can't make myself laugh. The charm and charm of the novels simply does not exist. The film is a bad excuse to squeeze as many musicians and “dark” images as possible into one film, hoping that America’s tiny goths will rip it off. Part of the attraction of Louis’s first film of the story is that he finds himself between his humanity and his curse. It is assumed that Lestat will lead and show the magic and excitement of the world of vampires. Thank God, I first read the books, otherwise I would never touch them after this movie.
