The problem with this film is that it tries to compile a 6-hour film in 2 hours. The result is clear. It seems too forced, unclear and too simple. <br /> <br /> The only positive side is the beginning. This explains well why and how Hercules was born. The rest of the film was ... just awesome, that gathered together. It can become as wonderful a film as LOTR, unless it is forced in 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Acting is not very convincing either. OK, not so bad. But most of them are. The special effects are stupid and look as if they were made ten years earlier (although the 1st monster is pretty good). Overall, I give him 4 out of 10 for the reasons I described above.
