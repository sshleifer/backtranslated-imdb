I really saw this movie in the cinema. At that time I worked in shifts and went there during the matinee on a hot summer day when I could not sleep. The cinema was air-conditioned. <br /> <br /> It was an early multi-screen complex, and I somehow got the wrong way. I intended to nap through something else. But, as it turned out, will not sleep. Shortly after the wrong movie began, I was further embarrassed by a group of female cleaners who entered and used it as their social club. I was the only other person there, and this is a measure of the attractiveness of the film, that they usually expected the place to be empty and asked me if I was against their presence. I did not do. <br /> <br /> In about half an hour, the janitors' conversation turned out to be more interesting than the entertainment I paid for. <br /> <br /> This film oozed out of the screen with the dampness of very stale mayonnaise. A view that has some dark, hairy, tufts growing on the surface. I especially remember how my senses attacked sharp musical strings that flashed with very little warning and even less meaning. The cleaning staff gave a pre-emptive signal by inserting fingers into their ears. <br /> <br /> The idea was that some urban bird would live in sticks among a dense forest, setting them straight, but at the same time teaching a moral lesson or two by itself. How do you. A sort of "way of discovery". Throughout the performance was grim complacency. In particular, the lead actress had an annoying habit of looking at every hik with some kind of strong blissful compassion, as if she herself was the patroness of fools. <br /> <br /> And I believe that at some point she wrote a book. <br /> <br /> Long before the end, I was fascinated by one of the silent and wet tails of the obscenity cleaners. <br /> <br /> There is a suspicion that there are those who sit quietly for several hours and not think - this is meditation. The best I can say is that I would not like to share my salad. <br /> <br /> I have never seen this movie advertised as a TV show, which surprises me. This is just a fern, which is shown in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having a job. <br /> <br /> If you ever work in shifts, be sure to get into the right theater. Or hope for the cleaners.
