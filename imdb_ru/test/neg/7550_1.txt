I saw Rick Mayall in Blackadder and the New Statesman, so I decided to try this movie. <br /> <br /> Around 4:00 pm I bought it, around 8:00 I started watching, around 8:15 pm I quickly ferried the remaining film to see if there was anything watchable for a person with a brain .. but it was not. At about 20.45 I threw the DVD into the garbage can. And this is where this “movie” belongs. What happened to British humor? Humor is so thin and witty, clever and cunning, that you will find in “Yes”, “Minister”, “Black Adder”, “Vicar Dibley”, “Falti Towers” ​​or “Fast Show”? Black humor for which Britain is so famous? I do not want to insult anyone, but I believe that even stupid children will not find it funny. They deserve smarter fun. And Rick Mayall, you can do better, so please do it!
