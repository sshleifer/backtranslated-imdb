This film is definitely there with the worst films I've ever seen, probably in my top 5 worst films. I laughed once, and then Evan: “I'm building something” Secretary Evan: “I hope this is a hairdresser” <br /> <br /> This was literally the only time I laughed in this comedy, terrible compared to Almighty Bruce, who as a big fan of Jim Carrey ... was not even so great! <br /> <br /> This movie lacked the humor of having the power of God, and it was more about family ties. I would refer it exclusively to a family film, definitely not to a family comedy. <br /> <br /> Watching bird's poo on someone’s shirt is not funny, and the beard does not grow instantly! <br /> <br /> I didn’t even think that the special effects were great, the animals looked really stuck, it was like watching a movie that wasn’t “glued” properly <br /> <br /> 2/10 - avoid!
