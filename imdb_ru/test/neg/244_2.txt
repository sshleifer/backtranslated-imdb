After an incredibly atmospheric original and a ridiculously stupid second, this incredibly boring, slow and adventurous sequel seems like a serious disappointment. Once again, the infamous criminal mastermind Bat (Hammi Luis Aceves Castaneda) is trying to steal valuable jewelry from the Aztec mummy Popok. The bat builds a hilarious, clumsy, clumsy robot with a human brain to achieve this disgusting goal. Directly directed by Raphael Portillo, with the talkative and tedious script of Alfredo Salazar and Guillermo Calderon, coarse continuity (for example, Bat was clearly killed at the end of the previous film, but miraculously alive and healthy here!) two films, a tortuous narrative, a terrible lack of action and impulse, a largely dull passage of movements (not) acting on understandable disinterested actors, and poorly organized Iâ€™m a climate battle between the mummy and the robot (the film eventually rips the foolish life with such a big blow, but, alas, it barely lasts two lousy minutes and thus turns out to be too small too late to soften the weight of the overall overwhelming boredom), it is stunningly dry, dirty, and deep breathing with snoring as a complete flushing.
