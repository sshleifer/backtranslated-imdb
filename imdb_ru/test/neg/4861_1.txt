I would like to put 0.5 but unfortunately I can not. Who can write such bad scripts (I watched the movie for five seconds and knew that Sutherland would be the “bad guy” - you need to pay his taxes when you see how good he is in the Redford movie “Ordinary People” and others!). <br /> <br /> Although I don’t like it, but I had no choice, I saw the film in French, but I know that to hear the real voices of Shin, Sutherland and Hamilton would not have changed anything, except maybe be due to the fact that it makes it more pathetic. <br /> <br /> I feel sick because people make a living doing this bad thing (I forgot to talk about Mr. Waterson, far from the Woody Allen films that he once played in). <br /> <br /> We had another film on another French channel: stupid James Bond with Brosnan (I'm not talking about real connections with Connery (please, this is the end of the holidays, wake up!).
