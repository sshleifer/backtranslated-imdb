This very free retelling of Carmen begins on a high note with a smoldering, sexually-revealing dance between the prisoner Carmen of Sengalese and her prison guard, but the bright moments of discovery never light up in any coherent film. One minute, Carmen is a completely sexual predator, the next time she dances to protest her unfair government, and then suddenly becomes a smuggler on the high seas ... Although the film deserves praise for posting the first carnivorous bisexual "Carmen" the broad strokes that he paints so similar to the vignettes and not backed up by any narrative link that the film sounds like a schizophrenic, undisciplined melange of Basic-Instinct, meets “Bound”, meets the African version ollivudskogo musical.
