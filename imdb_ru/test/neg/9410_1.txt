This film was absolutely and terribly terrible The plot was so predictable and boring, and the script so banal and pretentious that at the end I wanted to whip out the eyes with the nearest pen. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write reviews, but I was amazed by the amount of positive feedback he received. While I admit that in some parts the acting was fine, the flaws of the script more than outweighed the decent play. The only reason I watched it was because several of my friends watched it, presenting it, most likely, like the worst movie ever made, judging by the trailer. We were not disappointed in the least. His only salutary grace is that it contained my new favorite pick-up line: <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I just want to meet you. <br /> <br /> GIRL: You just want to get into my pants. <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I want to penetrate your mind, your heart, your soul. I do not see you wearing pants in this equation. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would rate this film as the worst I've ever seen that took me seriously.
