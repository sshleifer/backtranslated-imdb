Having no idea what this film is about, but considering that John Leguizamo appeared in it, we decided to watch it. Well, this was not the wisest decision. In fact, as stated in another comment on this forum, we were embarrassed by the actors who participated in this film. <br /> <br /> Although the film is by no means terrible, it does not make any sense. William Baldwin's unsurpassed performance also does not help the situation. John Leguizamo is a talented actor who deserves the best. It seems that the main problem of the film was a project that began with good intentions to make a small comedy, and the responsible people on this path ran out of ideas. The result is an uneven film.
