I don’t know what some of these directors are thinking about, creating the same type of cliché film over and over again where the bad guys win (in this case the bad girls). A weak game and very predictable. There is nothing original in this. This same film was shot again and again - no different from “Good Love” (1989), “Slow Burn” (2005) or at least ten other films with the same storyline and ending. In the film, too many holes. As if they ran out of money and they just stopped taking off. Or perhaps they ran out of ideas. But do not waste your time on this. It will only upset you because you spend time watching it.
