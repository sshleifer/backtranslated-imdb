Does anyone care about any characters in this movie? - Or in this respect, what happens to them? - I doubt. This is a key problem - in order for the tragedy to work, we need to take care of at least one of the characters, and none of them cause sympathy or have any redemptive qualities at all. <br /> <br /> What may have worked in the 16th century, of course, does not work, one can only assume that “post-apocalyptic Liverpool” really was what it was supposed to be. The problem is that the characters in the post-apocalyptic "Liverpool", still moving in cars, using mobile phones and watching TV, returned to talking in Shakespeare's language - with Liverpudian dialect. Oh my God! Bad enough, do you think - but it often comes down to sheer pranks - with comments like “ahhh, are you a cockney?” And this was the announcement of Merseyrail during one of the scenes filmed in the underground? Well, the good news is that in the post-apocalyptic Liverpool - the trains still run. <br /> <br /> All characters without exception are poorly drawn, wooden and more resemble caricatures on the Joker / Penguin lines in Batman and Robin. except that there is no real storyline that could be talked about — or, if there is, it is one that does not work in a modern setting, where half the sets are gloomy and “run along the edge” and the other half are fluorescent or just is normal for the 21st century, Costumes are also mixed up with half wearing their casual clothes (Parkers is big in post-apocalyptic Liverpool - obviously) and the other half wearing suits from the remnants of a costume party? <br /> <br /> The film explores the ideas of lust, incest and revenge in the most meaningless of all possible ways - the tragedy is that this film was made at all. <br /> <br />
