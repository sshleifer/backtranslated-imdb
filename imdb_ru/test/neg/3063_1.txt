Some people may remember Ms. Russell from films like The Black Widow, which had some appeal and critical acclaim. The boy must have really needed a rent when she signed up to tackle this dog. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are those who like causeless violence and nudity. But you need to sit back and ask yourself a backdating question, which prompted someone to spend money and time to do it in the first place. I just watched this movie on one of HBO, and I can't believe they shot it. <br /> <br /> In 1996, Ms. Russell did not have the physical attractiveness she had previously in her career. But come on! Having her play Ma Barker ??? All her "sons" look like they are her brothers. It's also creepy because you think that incestuous relationships will occur (thank God, no, I hope that this is not considered a spoiler). With Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano added to the cast, this B-movie is “straight to the video” completely. <br /> <br /> The scenes between Purvis and Ma Barker, in person or by phone, begin in terrible, terrible action. Oh, wait, I also forgot a terrible, terrible letter. Take this experience. Bad experience.
