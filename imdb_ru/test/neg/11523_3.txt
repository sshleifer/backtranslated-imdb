I really should have known more about this movie before renting it. It was one of those films where you continue to watch it, believing that it will be better. Then, when it ends, you feel silly, having spent precious time in your life, which you can never return. Ice-T did its job with the bad guy, and, well, that was the highlight of the evening. Pictures of the shuttle look as if they were made with a small toy inside the box, and the scenes in the space were fun because you could see the strings attached to spacesuits. There was a lack of a script, and the chase scene with a bleeding and unconscious guy was incredible because he drove better than I could on one of my best days. In general, I have seen worse, but this is definitely not the one that I would recommend or want to remember.
