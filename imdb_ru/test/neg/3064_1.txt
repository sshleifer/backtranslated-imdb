Like Michigan, I got Michigan jokes. It's very funny to poke fun at Pontiac, Ann Arbor, all these lame Detroit suburbs. Yes, yes, I have heard these jokes a million times. I commend them for the accurate depiction of Gross-Pointe's lameness. He could not get more whites. Did you hear these lovely nasal Michigan accents? Where do girls say so quickly that you don’t understand a single word that comes out of their mouth (nose) ...? No matter how I loved Michigan, I hated this film. <br /> <br /> I have never met a single person from Gross-Pointe who I liked. Listen to this terrible live band and this annoying and terrible background music! What it is? One of the groups of your householder Gross Pointe? Probably. Wow, what a great "Detroit scene" you guys have there. It's funny how people from Gross Pointe always say they are from Detroit. They are so white and rich that they would like to have something to complain about. <br /> <br /> In any case, this film is blowing. All the way from lame jokes about girls in thongs to terrible character development. Oh, wait a minute, you mean that the whole basis for the character is that he says a lot of e-word? What a deep personality. Great job, Grosse Pointers! And I love the whole sexist jargon, as, for example, the narrator calls the first killed girl, whom we have not even heard of, saying “naive”. It is very nice. <br /> <br /> And these homemade masks with contact lenses Marilyn Manson are really great. And I like how it made sense, why bikers came and killed people. And how did their narrative master play such an obvious role in the film ... ?? The main dude guy was so boring that I fell asleep looking at him. Three guys are idiots (or were they two or four? How can I say, they all look and behave the same!) They so desperately tried to make me laugh, but Beavis and Butthead already came out of my enthusiasm with laughter back in 1994. What about funny jokes? No wonder that this film sucks - all participants should have some minor problems with their masculinity, and guys? <br /> <br /> The main saving grace of this film was the main girl. Despite what other people have said here, she really was a good actress. Teenage girls speak as she spoke. They really behave like her. Her game was very natural and believable. I really thought she was a Grosse Pointe shopkeeper. .. maybe she is! And yes, she had big boobs, most women are here. You know, Michigan is the fattest state in the union. In all aspects. <br /> <br /> So, those of you who believe that this is a view of Detroit, it is not. This is the suburbs of Detroit. They are very white and full of aimless teenage fear. Limp Bizkut, ICP (yes, ICP from one of our suburbs) and baggy khaki pants for $ 75! Lame children who are mad because they have a lot of money and nothing to complain about. And they make bad movies too. <br /> <br />
