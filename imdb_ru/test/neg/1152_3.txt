I never heard of this movie until it was released on DVD. I was immediately intrigued by everything: the actors, the title, the cover, and especially the author. Arthur Miller, you are not mistaken with him, are you? Yeah. I did not read the novel, but I think it was much better than the film. I had high hopes for this film. I love Macy and Sod, and it looked interesting. Unfortunately, this film never rises above the reports of racism and fanaticism. If you have never seen other films on this topic, or have never known that America is based on fanaticism, this film may surprise you. Others are likely to find it predictable, stale and generally mild.
