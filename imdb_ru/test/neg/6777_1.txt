Once I accidentally saw this cartoon on TV, when I could not fall asleep. It did not help in the least. I found myself looking at the ceiling, trying to forget that face. I could never again see this cartoon, just because of that face. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong: I love fairy tales and nursery rhymes just like everyone else. But this distorted and terrifying performance just bothers you. This is basically a cruel laugh and exaggerated features that scare me, and because of this I still have nightmares. Please, I urge you not to let your children see it. This is far, Far is too scary. Please pray you keep it away.
