Elderbush Gilch was a big disappointment to me. I heard how great it was, how important it is. It just did not strike me. It had a bold storyline, as well as some moronic and sadistic Native American characters, who by modern standards are absolutely offensive. Although most of D.V. Griffith films have depth and intelligence, in this it looks more like an image of a program based on a formula. <br /> <br /> I liked to see Lilian Gish and May Marsh in the roles before the birth of the nation, and also some of the battle scenes were pretty good. According to Griffith’s future operator, Carl Brown, the audience stood on their seats and cheered as soon as the cavalry approached at the end. I did not feel anything. And believe me, I look at Griffith's early work in Biography. This film is simply not what it used to be. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film is that, despite all its flaws, there are many touches of Griffith in it. He copes well with his main actors, as well as with the stage where the Indians surround the cabin, which reminds the culmination of the film “The Birth of a Nation”, a much higher film, which in a year will shift the shock waves throughout America.
