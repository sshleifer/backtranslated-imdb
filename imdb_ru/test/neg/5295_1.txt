This film is a waste of talented people and the Hollywood budget. It made me think that everyone in the film benefited from being in it, because they were all out of place and lost talent in this horrible movie pile. This is a contrived story that is simply pitiful, unreal, and does not even look like fun or interest. The only thing that aroused my interest was the numerous big names in the film, which appeared for no apparent reason and had no actors or good lines to contribute to the confusion of the film. I kept expecting it to have good things, since all these people were cool in other films. But that never happened. This film should be shown in prison as a punishment, but it would be cruel and unusual. You will be shocked to see so many recognizable people attacking such a terrible pathetic script with flat lines and terribly bad game. This film reminded me of another complete waste of time with the many recognizable faces of BIG TROUBLE (2002), which also went beyond the limits of the readable scale on suction.
