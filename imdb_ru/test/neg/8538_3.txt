First, the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw, which I do not understand, how it was missed - you constantly see how the top microphones jump in and out of the film. The first time I saw this, I just said, “Well, mistakes happen” and shook it off. At about the 10th time, he became incredibly annoying and distracting. If you have not seen the movie, try to calculate how many times you see the microphone; can make for a pretty interesting game. <br /> <br /> Now about the film. This film began with the creation of a rather solid "ghostly" story; however, the turn of the plot at the end simply destroyed it completely. You begin to watch a movie based on the assumption of a television advertisement that a haunted house consists of ghosts that only children can see; especially young children, which makes it even stranger, because they will not be able to effectively warn the family about the impending danger. The opening scene well misled the audience that this will remain the premise of the film. ** (SPOILER) ** The film begins with the fact that the family is pursued and eventually killed by "invisible" forces in the house. The idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the daughter at the beginning of the film asks her younger brother to tell her where "this" is right before "this" grabs her and drags her cry into the basement. The young boy also witnesses how this alleged “invisible force” kills his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed. After his family is killed, the boy tries to escape and hide only in order to be captured. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film began with the creation of a rather creepy movie in which the family was being pursued by "invisible force" with their only hopes for survival, based on the observations of a two year old child. It began to collapse less than halfway through the film, as the daughter also began to see ghosts; completely destroying the “only children can see” illusion put forward by advertising and the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the film is not really "spoiled" until the plot was distorted at the end. In which the person who helped the family develop the farm turned out to be the person responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the film. Suddenly, after the attack a flock of crows, the man snaps and tries to kill the mother, daughter and son during a psychotic disorder, in which he believes that they are HIS family; which he killed in the beginning. <br /> <br /> The whole plot of the plot at the end simply created a whole list of unresolved issues and left me in a dead end. Firstly, why are the souls of the family trapped in the house? If the director was going to follow the path of Ju-On (The Grudge), in which the family, dying in a fit of rage, pursued the house and killed anyone who enters, why did the persecution stop after the father was “captured” by the ghosts of his family? If ghosts wanted to kill only the person who killed them, why did they attack the new family? Here is another one for you. It takes several months from the time of sowing the seeds until the full bloom of plants at the time of harvest. This tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning, the man whom the ghosts seemed to have displeased with the whole film, lived in this house for several months. In all this time, the ghosts just did not kill him? <br /> <br /> This film included many ordinary "horrors", as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror films. However, I tell you, this film could still handle well if it were not for the plot turn at the end. As if they just exhausted their budget and just collected something for the ending. In order for this film to succeed, they had to adhere to the premise “only children can see them” and end up with the fact that the family could barely escape, or be killed, like the family in the beginning (they would open the door for possible continuation too).
