"I remember how I waited to be born ..." <br /> <br /> "The vision of the quest that was the American West." <br /> <br /> "We went to a psychic ..." <br /> <br /> "I am sure that their first reaction is that she is a cuckoo" <br /> <br /> ".. . the place is often visited ... "<br /> <br />" I think there is another dimension here. " <br /> <br /> The artist (Marta Becket) and her husband many decades ago left the hustle and bustle of New York and moved to a god-forgotten city with a population of 10 people in Death Valley. There they repaired the theater - drawing it very homely. And when she finished, she practically did not make dance performances for anyone. In many ways, he is very reminiscent of Werner Herzog’s FITZCARRALDO or DREAM FIELD - although AMARGOSA is a documentary about a real person, and not about a mythical lunatic such as Klaus Kinsky or Kevin Costner. Her husband eventually leaves - most of this is obviously due to the lifestyle she chose. So, today she lives with her ten cats and a donkey shelter with her new companion, Tom, in the end. <br /> <br /> What you think about this documentary depends on your perspective. If you are passionate about New Age ideas and are open to these feelings, then you will most likely appreciate the film. Her talk about how she remembers her birth, ghosts, quests, and psychics, frankly made the psychology teacher cringe, and this will definitely be the case for many people. In addition, her donkey sanctuary and an attempt to keep horses in the desert will most likely appeal to PETA and many other animal lovers, although with my experience in ecology and biology, I see donkeys and horses as decay that can destroy the locals. plants and animals. Thus, on two different occasions, I am inclined to think that this is completely opposite to Martha, who is more “sensitive” and “sensual.” Depending on how you feel about this, it will definitely affect your opinion - and I am sure that most people will think that she is a genius or a psycho! You just need to guess what I think. <br /> <br /> Now, in spite of all this, the film is interesting, and Martha’s life is definitely NOT boring — especially because in recent years people have really begun to travel to the desert to see her performance. She and her unusual little world have certain fans. Although I would not be as positive as most of the reviews, I also cannot be as negative as one, as there is a certain merit in this strange documentary. I like films about unusual people, and Martha, of course, is unusual! I also appreciate her love for her art and happy life - this is a rare gift. <br /> <br /> I teach psychology at an art school, and it would be interesting to show this to the staff - where I am sure that we will get a strong positive and negative reaction to the film - perhaps depending on whether the teachers taught art lessons or The core curriculum! That would surely be interesting. <br /> <br /> By the way, and I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but when Martha's husband had business, with whom did this happen ?! In the end, they lived in the middle of no where, and I wondered where he would find partners. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you want to see her performance and / or stay with her.
