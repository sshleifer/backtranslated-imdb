I would not recommend this to anyone except film fans who love to laugh at the film, not at it. <br /> <br /> A rather promising premise and recruitment of actors are getting worse compared to a movie, which ends up possibly the worst ending ever seen in a movie. I won't spoil it, but basically the most frequently used set of movie cliches is done poorly and without enthusiasm in the most disappointing last five minutes of all films. <br /> <br /> The film also includes the most exciting scene that ever existed in the world - an attempt to screen chemistry between the two leading roles, when we were presented with a close-up of Angela Jolie, stroking finger with love, Denzel Washington. This may be the only thing he could move, but it is possible that the viewer is exposed to the magnification of Washingtonâ€™s finger stroked amid dim lights and music suitable for the sex scene outside of me. I laughed out loud and shook my head. <br /> <br /> The direction of the storyline is largely borrowed from Se7en, but here it is much easier and too obvious. To call it Se7en for the poor would be an understatement, it really is nothing but a TV movie, and even the best efforts of Jolie and Washington cannot convince that this is a box-office film.
