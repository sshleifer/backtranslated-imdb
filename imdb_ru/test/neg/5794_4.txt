Even Disney is guilty of dairy cows disease, after the stormy success of the Love Beetle in 1968, the mouse's house fell into the hands of Herbie Rides again, Herbie goes to Monte Carlo and Herbie goes to bananas. None of the sequels that captured the charm and harmless appeal of the Love Beetle back in '68, in this we find racer Jim Douglas and his girlfriend Wiley Applegate, entering Herbie on the Monte Carlo rally. Naturally, things outside the race are starting to take on priorities, they are mixed up in a diamond robbery, and Herbie falls in love with another car! Car stunts, of course, are pleasant and easy on the eyes, and it would be foolish of me to really release poison on such a friendly piece of fluff, the film simply does not go anywhere quickly, and now I personally see it at a coin. A motivated piece of work is this. However, you can see how Herbie takes a bath, interferes with the villains and, of course, dances for the lady in his life, so everyone will find something for themselves, I think ............ ....... 0.4 / 10.
