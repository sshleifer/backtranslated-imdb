This is what my friends and I continued to ask each other throughout this film. We could not believe how stupid it was! I think that someone shot it on his video camera at home, threw it into the cinema and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anyone would rise. Well, I think that is a joke on us. <br /> <br /> I think I should first go to this site and read all the reviews he received, everyone says that this film is HORRIBLE, STUPID, and again and again. And boy, they are right! Although it gave a pretty good laugh (my friends and I were pretty drunk), because it's so stupid. We just can't believe that someone was stupid enough to make such a crappy movie! I swear it had to be done in the 70s, before they had good technology for films and other things, because every scene looks really stupid, but when I looked here, she said that it was made in 2001 year? What kind? Of course, this is not like a movie that would be made today, but I think this is what you get when you use a video camera and make home movies using strobe lights and really fake lasers, and instead use real people from your own city ​​actors or even novice actors. By the way, some of these chicks (or they dragged the queens, we could not say!) Were so awkward that even my drunken horny college buddies did not touch them with a 50-foot pole. <br /> <br /> So in this film there is absolutely no attraction, bad game, bad writing, bad direction, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. Do not waste your time or money on this, you will be completely disappointed!
