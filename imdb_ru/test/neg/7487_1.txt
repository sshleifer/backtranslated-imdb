I thought it was a very bad movie. All the while I watched this movie, I could not help but think and think about how bad it was, and how it was $ 3.69 to the wind. The plot was so nervous. In the beginning, they did an excellent job explaining who met whom in high school, but after that they never explained anything. Was it a supernatural thriller? Was it an ordinary thriller? Apparently, you can decide for yourself, because they did not see the need to explain. I understood, basically, what happened, I think. What confused me was that it was all up to what happened with bloody noses, phone calls, etc.? Is this guy back? Did the wife send Carrie or something else? Who knows? You certainly won't be after watching this movie.
