Another sequel! Why on earth do they continue to do this? This is probably the weakest “franchise”, but it is still funded and generates a sequel. SCARECROW GONE WILD - which I only looked at so that I could officially destroy the entire series - returns an evil straw figure, which, again, kills some college students ... That's all. Acting sucks (as usual), death scenes outside pathos, and do not be fooled by the title, this thing does not have as much nudity as you think. A pair of cute topless girls, but the pants do not tighten. Let me end my constant insult (or review) of this film with the words: if I come across SCARECROW IN SPACE or FREDDY VS SCARECROW on the shelves of a video store, I will be in complete fear ...
