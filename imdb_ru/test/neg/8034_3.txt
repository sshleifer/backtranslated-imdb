Riccardo Frieda can have a good reputation; but since we now, that many of his best films were, in fact, directed by the late great Mario Bavoy; it is clear that he was not one of the most talented Italian directors in the seventies. This film pretty much proves this, despite the simplistic plot; it’s a sprawling mess, and on the whole, I would even have to go so far as to say that the Tragic Ceremony is SEA, than the tasteless effort of Frieda Giallo, Iguana with the Language of Fire. Frieda clearly denied this film, and I certainly don’t blame him! The plot just follows a group of children whose gasoline ends in the wilderness. They get into the house while searching for fuel; but it turns out to be a bad choice, as the owner is about to hold a satanic ceremony ... ho-ham. The film shows the main role of Camilla Keaton, who will play the main role in the classic film “I Spit on Your Grave” a few years later, but does not make any impression here, despite the fact that she performs alongside the worthless performers. The film shows one decent blood scene by the end, but this is really not enough, considering that it takes eighty minutes. I have a high tolerance for trash Italian films that do not make sense - but even I could not bear it. Skip this, do not miss anything!
