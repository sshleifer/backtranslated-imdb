Friday night with Jonathan Ross should be those responsible for Ross rubbing their sweaty little palms. They know that the BBC lacks imagination when it comes to talk shows, so when they have Jonathan Ross at their disposal, they may well just sit back and allow half the wit to command this prime time. <br /> <br /> Ross spends the most on the show, caring for his ego and smiling about how much the BBC pays him. The show is a complete copy of many American chat shows - Leno, Letterman, Conan O Brian, this list goes on - but he and his team clearly saw that working with the masses can also be performed for the dumb masses in the UK. . <br /> <br /> Unsuccessful situation - he has no competitors? Parkinson came to the conclusion that he had never had anything special but to care for the ego of celebrities. Can't we have someone funnier and more fun on British screens instead of Jonathan Ross? As soon as Ross increases his ego, he will move on to a very boring concept of tough celebrities in the green room - so he tries to get along with each other. If A-Lister is present (which is often the case today — since there are no other chats they can turn to — to promote their latest film), he will spend the next hour either flirting with them or trying to be their best friend in the universe. . Sqeamish, when he had Ringo Starr - a man who doesn’t care about licking his ass - Ross sincerely asked for his mobile phone number (since the general policy on this show for Jonathan Ross is to dial everyone’s number so that he can be seen when not working). Of course, Ringo said he did - and he simply said: no, I don't like you - a serious pan. <br /> <br /> Ross should be excluded from all awards and television shows - the masses will cope with this. ,
