Carlos wants to laugh at positive actions, racial stereotypes and related topics in his show, which makes him very much like the judge of the High Court of Thomas. He is there because of his race, and then slanders him. Allegedly, he can laugh at Mexicans endlessly, because he is a Mexican himself, and I also argue that he can come to terms with mockery of the mentally retarded, because any layman can say that he is not the most acute tool .... tool of some kind. <br /> <br /> He is a hack comedian who, even with a group of writers, cannot bring together 3 minutes of really funny material in a 30-minute show. I can't remember a single comedian regularly televised by whom Carlos can hold a candle, except maybe for Larry the cable guy (no wonder he also has a show on Comedy Central, which no doubt serves exactly To the same audience. <br /> <br /> If you ever see how great people, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, John Stewart and others, talk about comedy, you really feel the amount of work and thought needed to create funny interesting comedic voice. All this work b la completely missed by mencia, his comedic voice is partly stolen from other best comics and partly hidden by his inclination to shout about his unfunny, plundered racist joke. I believe, watch how he feels better because of his dissatisfaction with discouraging society, unfortunately, Carlos and his fans are part of the problem, not a solution to this topic.
