They give you a setup, and then they tire you to death by the constant pursuit of cat and mouse. The main characters participate in one constant confrontation, where they threaten each other, every five minutes or less. And I would like to see the police, which would allow one of their policemen to remove a piece of A. Garcia. This is similar to how some local policeman expels Charlie Manson from prison to bring a cup of coffee. Become a real one!
