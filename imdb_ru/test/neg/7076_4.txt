I work in a video store, so I needed to see him for free - thank God, if I paid for it, my review would be less forgiving. <br /> <br /> Well, the main idea of ​​the movie (disgusting) girl fucking revenge is not so original, there are several parallels with “Carrie” (playing a vile joke with a loser, except for one cute girl who actually regrets about her, tamaras and has a bad family background). I still think this is a fun idea for a cheesy teen horror movie, unfortunately, they did not take advantage of the great potential that is present here, and instead focused on all the wrong things. <br /> <br /> what worked: I liked the actress who played Tamara. she looked great (when she was hot), and her feline features were funny ("Sean can't come to the phone. He's damn expensive!"). <br /> <br /> that didn't work: all this Wicca was stupid. I usually prefer rational explanations (she could plan it all along with her teacher or one of the boys to get revenge). there were a lot of logical wholes, and the blood looked really bad (when the boy cuts his ear and tongue - please !!!) <br /> <br /> the whole idea was not related to Oscar, but I just think they had wasted the comedy and the potential waiting they had. It was tolerable, but far from good!
