I could not watch a lot of this shit. This is your standard trash, which some annoying women love in ancient English drama with lots of costumes and clichés that seem to come from Oliver Twist’s novel or some other Dickens novel. It uses the usual clichés of the Victorian era. Some idiotic people really think that all the emotional torture of this culture, which is so bloody suppressed, is somehow charming and romantic. It is a juice, clean and full of garbage and boring, like growing grass. As such, it is ideal for women who crave some kind of English romantic Victorian snoozer drama, but for this man this film is nothing but torture, cruel and unusual punishment to watch a bunch of boring scenes with extraordinary characters who say this. squalid forced and fake English accent.
