This film is a comparison of various super bad bad biker characters, loosely connected, but without a real storyline. Some scenes are beautifully filmed. If they shot the same cast and film crew and shot a movie called Gent, which was the coolest character in the film and came up with an interesting and lengthy story, perhaps this could be decent. Get ready for a lame series of intro for cool guys, each of whom does nothing, except that he rides a whole day on a bicycle in the desert and causes trouble when everyone stays without tanning, keeping his hair and clothes perfect and never needing to search. . house or money, etc. There was some kind of background on how the characters depict the dead people and the treasure, which probably should have become a plot.
