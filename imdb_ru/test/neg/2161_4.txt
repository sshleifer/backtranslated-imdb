In the early 1990s, “Step-by-Step” became a tedious combination of ultra-raw “Full House” and the long-existing classic hit “The Brady Bunch”. The difference between “Step-by-Step” and the two aforementioned shows, of course, was better written, excellent comedy stories from almost all of its actors, and much more amusing situations that were not as covered with sugar as this extremely popular predecessors. It must be admitted that, despite the great improvements in the main dynamics of the show, all this was not completely impressive, nor was it so memorable in the long line of tricky family programs! You could say that it was a much better pastime compared to a full-house-causing “Full House,” which, by coincidence, managed “step by step” with “step-by-step” during this time period in terms of overall popularity. The show, now in syndication, is certainly suitable for family holidays, but one should not expect much from this when viewing.
