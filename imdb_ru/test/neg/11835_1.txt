Why is this film not on the top 100? Raptor is without doubt the worst film I've ever seen in all my fifteen years of life. I have never witnessed such a disastrous mess as this one. Absolutely everything in this is awkward and cheaply made. <br /> <br /> No one in the cast has several decent results. The dialogue is completely incoherent, and humor is not funny at all. Corbin Bernsen was the most painful part of all this. I can't stop shivering when I recall some of his lines, such as “In or not? You're worse than a cat! ”And“ Your friend is not a very good poker player. She just opened her hand. ” <br /> <br /> Predators is a joke. Even I could have done more realistic dinosaur effects than these directors shamelessly did. This is an insult to real velociraptors or any dinosaur for that matter. Not only that, but the murder scenes are too horrible even for me. I do not think that these animals would tear their prey to shreds and throw pieces all over the ground so that everything looked better. In addition, blood and guts are useless when you see death emanating from miles and miles. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of films in the Jurassic Park and dinosaurs. Maybe the filmmakers did not expect that someone with intelligence or feeling would neglect the bad film industry to stumble upon this film on HBO late at night like me. If I could say anything to someone who participated in this film, I would have to quote Dr. Alan Grant from the first Jurassic Park ... <br /> <br /> "Just try to show a little respect."
