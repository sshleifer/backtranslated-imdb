It may not be fair for me to comment on this film, because for the first time I turned off the film, because it was very bad. I can watch anything, but this film was very boring. I was bored before I put it on a DVD and thought that it could be a funny fighter / action movie to cheer up. It's not even the point that this is a device that increases the boredom level by a power of 100. I had to turn it off after 45 minutes, because all that had happened during that time was that some people were scuba diving and a big mole was discovered . Seriously, this movie is not worth the time, even if you can enjoy a bad movie like me, avoid this movie like the plague. The worst thing I've seen in recent years.
