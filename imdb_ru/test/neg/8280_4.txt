A rather sad and terrible villain when someone kills members of a high school track team after their star runner dies during a competition. <br /> <br /> Christopher George plays the role of coach in track and field athletics. I don't think anyone ever took track of athletics as seriously as Chris did â€” even at the Olympics. This is typically a divine performance of computer graphics, and if you're a fan of man / legend, you should run and grab a copy. <br /> <br /> But we are watching the killings (you know, this is true). ), but not performances, and the graduation day does not work in most cases (there is one really good murder). This horror comes only during the performance of the group "Felonia". Never heard of them? See graduation day and find out why.
