I'm glad I never watched this show when it came out. <br /> <br /> I just wondered why it lasted 4 years. It reminds me of the horrible 80s with fake people, fake clothes and fake music. How did I survive growing in this era? <br /> <br /> In most episodes that I watched, the actors are forced. It makes for a very boring show. The plot lines are not very interesting, as the old Twilight Zone shows. The old show inspired the imagination and made us look forward to the next show. <br /> <br /> Stick to the old Twilight Zone shows and relieve yourself from the pain by watching the trash.
