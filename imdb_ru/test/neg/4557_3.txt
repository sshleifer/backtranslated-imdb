Another PM Entertainment bastard, and fortunately one of their last. <br /> <br /> Firetrap is a very low-budget remake of The Towering Inferno. like some effort to put in them - there is no effort in "Firetrap" is the star Dean'Superman'Cain, who is an absolutely terrible actor, seriously he has all the acting abilities of a porn star, but he turns out to be the best actor here, and that says something the rest are just a bunch of hopeless ones, given the shoe from different daily soaps. The special effects — just rubbish, shots showing the burning building from the ground — are some of the worst I've ever seen; the fire looks like someone scratched an orange handle in front of the camera. In addition, there is not a single character for whom you are really sick - you hate everyone and hope that they all die well before the expiration of 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The script is embarrassing - the red herring are well marked in advance, someone else mentioned it, but “The scene where the janitor fights the blazing fire that engulfed the building with his broom ... hilarious, or the same janitor entering to the room labeled "Dangerous Material", were these scenes supposed to be crafty? for some reason, I doubt it. <br /> <br /> The only good moment and only one good moment was that there were many actions among the day soap playwrights that held my attention, but so little attention was paid to everything in the film, I can't recommend it - see 'The Towering Inferno' instead. <br /> <br /> 3/10
