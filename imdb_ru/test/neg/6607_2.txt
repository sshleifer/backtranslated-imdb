There are three main problems with the film. Or rather, there are three reasons why he does not even claim to be more seriously considered. <br /> <br /> Firstly, and this has always been true, it’s not as good as in books. At the very least, however, we might expect to reflect some of Sapkowski’s wit or depth. <br /> <br /> Secondly, we have production. Fantasy movies, in my opinion, the most difficult to produce well. Everything, from props to costumes, scenery, tricks and (especially) computer graphics, is of poor quality. <br /> <br /> Finally, and this is very subjective, I just cannot take acting skills seriously. I was not brought up in Poland, so I can not judge - this may be my lack of familiarity with Polish films. Yet the lines seem very amateur delivered ... Casting might also be better. <br /> <br /> To sum up, the only possible redemption feature of this film is the rest of the translucent plot: a slightly different diamond ring on a rotting corpse. <br /> <br /> On a separate note, I heard that books are published in English. I have not yet seen them, but I have no idea how they could be translated ... I would ask the reader who speaks English to take this into account when evaluating the book.
