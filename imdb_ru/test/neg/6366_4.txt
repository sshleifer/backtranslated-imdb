Tom is going to fill up Jerry's delicious sandwich when a huge bird of prey falls and flies away with his snack. Tom is not at all pleased that his sarni was stolen right from under his nose. Tom goes on hot pursuit, deciding to pick up his mouse piece. <br /> <br /> No matter how much I loved Tom and Jerry, I have to say that this is a bit strange: the story is quite mundane; it introduces a poorly thought-out peripheral character that lacks charm; and he throws out the old "dress a cartoon character like a woman" shut up to death. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, “The Flirty Bird” competes with “Fragile Cat” and “Mouse in Manhattan” for the title of the weakest Tom and Jerry Kaper
