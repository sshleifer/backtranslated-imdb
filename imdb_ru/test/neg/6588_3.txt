The main problem of the 9th company (9th company) is that it is not sure whether it wants to save Private Ryan or the all-metal sheath. Attempts at Spielberg's sentimentalism are confusing, for example, Sergeant Burley is crying in a field of red flowers !!! Sequences of training have neither the intensity nor the realism that Kubrick gave them in his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Another apple of discord: Afghan fighters are called Ghosts because they are hit, and you can barely see them. Here they attack the Russian strong hold almost in the ranks, not trying to use the shelter. I am sure that tactics began to evolve from the time of Waterloo. <br /> <br /> Each scene in this film was seen earlier in other war films and is made significantly better. <br /> <br /> I have to ask: why do all talented shooters need to chew a match? <br /> <br /> Finally, I am always suspicious of a film that starts without a narration, but at the same time needs to qualify an end. <br /> <br /> "We won!" ... err ... no, no.
