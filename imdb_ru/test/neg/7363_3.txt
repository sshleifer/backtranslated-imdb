As the main expert on the history of Canada, I first want to say: HISTORICAL FACTS ARE NOT EXACT! How can a producer do this? The deportation of Acadian was not in 1759 when we saw Franklin in London, but in 1755! How can he convey this in a movie? The scenes in Londo were also useless. Then for the story for anyone reading "Les Anciens Canadians", you have a storyline right there. This is the story of La Coriveau, this "witch". Add also a love story and a tragic relationship between mother and daughter. Of course, it caused tears in my eyes. But that's all. Then there is the fact that it is obviously established in Quebec City, but it is mostly filmed in Forteresse de Louisbourg. Of course, this is a historical place and it corresponds exactly to the time, but it was obvious that not all scenes were filmed in Quebec. In general, if you are looking for a documentary about New France, find Candad: Folk history, a real documentary about the history of Kanda and New France. If you need a love story that will bring you tears, a story created in a wonderful forest, see “New France”.
