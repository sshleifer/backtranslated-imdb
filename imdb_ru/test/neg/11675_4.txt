My wife and I met in 1982, filming a professional production of "The Merry Widow" - in English, but with direct translation. <br /> <br /> In this “adaptation” only the most basic skeleton of the original plot is visible. ". Most of the characters were removed along with the entire plot B, and all the remaining characters, except one, were renamed. Most of the characters in the film are also not in operetta. The action was moved from Paris, first to Washington, DC, and then to the fictional country of Pontevedro, which the film renamed “Marchóvia”, and only later to Paris. The end result is that we will not get to the beginning of the original game in about 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the main voltage source on the plot is also removed. In the original, many years ago, Count Danilo and the heroine loved each other very much, but his family refused to allow them to marry because she was poor; it was his broken heart that made him a casual playboy. Now that she is a widow, she is the richest woman in the world, she still loves him, and he still loves her, but his pride will not allow him to admit it to anyone, even to himself, and she has to carry out three acts, playing on mind of the game to break it. The path of an aristocrat with money problems, who does not admit that he is in love with a rich woman because of the fear of what people think, provided the main plots of a significant part of Vienna operettas for decades after the 1906 Widow. In this film, they have never met before, which pulls out not only the essence of all this, but almost the whole comedy. <br /> <br /> Although Lamas does a pretty decent job. <br /> <br /> An interesting musical moment is that several times we heard an excerpt from “Trés Parisien”, an additional song written (in English, despite the title) for the London premiere, which, as far as I know, was not. usually found in American manufactures until the 1980s or so.
