The film begins with Charlie (Jeff Daniels), a business man who is just finishing his lunch at a neighborhood grocery store. Looks like he doesn't have enough money to cover the check. Instead of reaching for his plastic, he sneaks around to see if the beach is free and avoid the place without paying. Unbeknownst to Charlie, “Lulu” (Melanie Griffith) watched him from the other side of the deli. <br /> <br /> “Lulu” is decorated with what looked cool in the 1980s, with a page of brunettes being cut It follows him to let him know that she saw what he did. He tries to deny it, but cannot avoid her accusation. Thinking that he is in this, Charlie is surprised when "Lulu" says that she does not work in a grocery store, and then invites him to return to work. <br /> <br /> When she heads in the opposite direction, this way she starts jumping across the Mid-Atlantic coast. <br /> <br /> We should be amazed, because the perfectly modern Lulu puts Charlie with straight hair in degrading situations. It's okay when two adult people agree a little more comfortably in a motel room, but it scares when they erupt by paying a check at a family restaurant. To steal work from hardworking people is not my idea of ​​“wild”. Charlie is a jerk. <br /> <br /> Lulu is an abnormal moron. She starts to give Charlie for her husband. First, to her mother (who carelessly tolerates the charade), and then to her conveniently planned 10-year secondary school reunion (an event used later by another film “too cool for his own good,” “Grosse Pointe Blank”). br /> <br /> “Marriage” came as a surprise to the real husband Lulu (Ray Liotta), who was recently released from prison for armed robbery. Ray meets the two welcome guest and shows them how terrible the crimes really are. <br /> <br /> I can’t add any irony when I wrote that I watched it for the first time, going to the cinema. No, I don't do that. I removed it from cable television and assure you that I watch it strictly in the privacy of my own home. <br /> <br /> So I thought why I recorded it when I didn’t like it very much, and came to the conclusion that 20 years ago I played reggae, and the soundtrack for the film “Something Wild” differs markedly from reggae. The final credits begin with the treats of sister Carol, who performs her version of The Wild Thing.
