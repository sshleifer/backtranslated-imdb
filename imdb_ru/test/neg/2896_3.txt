In addition to other genres, I am also a fan of fiction, and I especially like movies from the 60s and 70s with their idea of ​​“idea over effects”, in which so many clever and pretty stories were shot. In a nutshell, I fully agree with Scott-886's review of this film. I heard about this film, and, as I mentioned earlier, an SF lover of the 60s and 70s with a tendency to tell SF stories with a twilight tone, I expected a lot, and my expectations were raised thanks to reviews evaluating the effects from this film "second best" to Kubrick "Space Odyssey 2001". What the “Journey to the Far Side of the Sun” scam was a common, confusing, half-burnt, stupid-looking film, with ridiculous amateur special effects (and I remember, I love the films of that era and despise CGI) such as “Marooned”, which “Journey” reminded me a lot. The idea underlying all this is not so bad, but building a story on a twin planet with Earth, on which the same world was turned, asked a master like Kubrick to lead. I must say that Robert Parish is not at all like this, so he made a boring and stupid film that looked and felt like the morning series of that time. Do not waste your time, even if you are an absolute fan of the genre.
