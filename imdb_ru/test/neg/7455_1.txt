Why in Canada you can find good movies in any genre, except for action? I caught the Dragon Hunt on TV the other day, and it was like a train wreck. I just could not change the channel, it was just stupidity that undermined my willpower. It is significant that the actress IMDb "ascribes" to this monster, apparently, never worked again. <br /> <br /> Bad game, bad writing, bad story, bad music, bad hair, bad cinematography. It just goes on and on. The film really has nothing to recommend. If you are looking for bad action movies to enjoy a laugh, there are many other films that will not require you to burn out the retina. <br /> <br /> I hope that this film did not help get money from the government for financing, otherwise I will never pay taxes again.
