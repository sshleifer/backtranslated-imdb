This film could have been a decent rework, and the devil knows what he was trying (or Miss English tried). Gathering talented actors along with a successful and experienced screenwriter / director should be the formula for a decent film. But Ms. Inglish’s experience - according to her biography of IMDb - is exclusively limited to television work, and this is evident in the whole film. <br /> <br /> I’m surprised that none of the reviews I read mention that I’ve found the most incredible thing in this film, and that prevented him from reaching even part of his potential: he looked and felt like as if it was made for television. To pay tribute to Ms. Inglish, many jokes that simply did NOT work on a movie screen would be terrific on TV (and perhaps the track of laughter would help). Most camera use and lighting would look great on TV, but it looked awkward or weird on the big screen. If the whole movie were cut into a mini-series or a comedy series, I think it could work. But this movie, and, unfortunately, the talents of Miss English are not transferred. I squeezed in the most different moments of my embarrassment for actors and writers that it seemed to me that I left the theater half wrinkled! Meg Ryan - her usual cheerful, sweet girl (except for the terrible plastic surgery on her face), but where did she have a chance to use her talent ?! She made films in which she did not recreate her stereotypical role, and made them well ... but not here. Annette Bening seemed to just go through the motions - such a wonderful talent and yet such a bad job! I liked other female characters, but they were a caricature rather than content, and it was sad to see. What worked in this film in the 1930s does not translate into the 2000s, and no one helped Miss English understand the changes, updates, or subtleties correctly. If only she (as a writer, director, and producer) had asked for some help, I think it could be good. But this was not the case. <br /> <br /> I am so sad to go to the cinema, where there are good stars and a good writer or director, and leave, feeling that it is a waste of time and money of everyone! This cartoon resident of New York, which I saw yesterday, is appropriate: several filmmakers have a meeting, and the caption reads: “Let's remake the classics with the worst of everything!”
