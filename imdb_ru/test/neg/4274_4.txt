This film is about a young girl who goes to live with her rich cousins, falls in love with one of her cousins ​​and rejects the promotion of the amoral groom who brings problems to the family. Having seen the version of 1999 and having read the book, I decided to look at the old version. I found that this is indeed true for the character Fanny in the book, but it was also a boring character. Fanny's character, played by Sylvestra Le Touzel, was dim; she often seemed to faint. I also did not like Robert Burbidge, who played Henry Crawford. I could not imagine that he was interested in Fanny or her cousin Maria. Jackie Smith Wood, who played Mary Crawford, was fine, but the wig she was wearing was so ugly. I lost interest in her game and kept looking at her wig. I expected this to roll her head off. I could also see a strip of her real hair under a wig.
