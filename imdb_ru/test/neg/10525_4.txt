Whatever I do to rewrite this movie. Great disappointment because of the great beginning, Solo Dios Sabe degenerates into a mess of a superstitious bull after half way and ends on a note so ridiculous, stingy and melodramatic that I could not believe that I watched the same movie I started with. The film had numerous elements in its favor, such as the chemistry between Diego Luna and Alice Braga, so tangible that I thought the screen would start to sparkle, a great soundtrack and beautiful places. Instead of ending up with a hard religious mumbo jumbo, the film should have focused on being a frothy road film, perhaps with some tinge of fate and superstition against logic through to the end. I understand that the director’s whole idea in the film was to make him about religion, but the fact is that he just didn’t work, and from the very beginning he threw out so many wonderful things.
