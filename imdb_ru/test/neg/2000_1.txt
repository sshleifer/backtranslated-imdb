This is my first movie commentary here. I have to say that out of all the bad movies I've ever seen, including Braindead for example, this is really WELL! I promise. Don't even look at it. It's boring, a bad game, a bad script and plot, bad effects, the whole movie is one big piece of shit! If I could, I would give 0 stars out of 10, but since the lowest is 1, which is terrible, I need to vote for it. But I would say that the film is worse than terrible. <br /> <br /> Do not suffer, seeing this film and hoping that it will become better, because I can tell you now that it will not be! I was hoping that one scene might be worth seeing. There was no good scene at all. <br /> <br /> What a great piece of shit. <br /> <br /> And Kulio as a vampire? LOL! LMAO! YARGH!
