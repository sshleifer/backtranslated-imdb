A man with a black face lands on a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in a shack with a monkey. He connects her with a telephone, and she teaches him like Charleston. Then they fly away in a spaceship, leaving the monkey behind. In addition to the short film that causes irritation, this short film does not make sense. I think this is a plot, but I'm not sure in the long run. This is not to say that this is Renoir at work, despite his characteristic humanism. Good use of slow motion though. I suppose it can be found in the series “Experimental Film” No. 18 of the film “Appendix to New York”.
