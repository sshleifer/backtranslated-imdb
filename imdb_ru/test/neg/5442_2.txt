For various reasons, a group of people goes deep into the jungle and finally finds a lost city (where, apparently, diamonds are King Solomon) and a super-gorilla race ... Now you know that you have problems when you put up fine actors such as Linney and Curry, in one movie, where the stars ... are a talking gorilla, and this is just the beginning. Well, what else ...? <br /> <br /> For an action movie / adventure film ... well, all that is missing is this. The first hour (!) Of the film is not even in the jungle, just trying to get there, with the plot behind the plot (something about the local military regime, whatever), and when they finally do ... it's just not fun anymore. <br /> <br /> The effect of the film is only such and such (and very bad compared to the early film in the Jurassic Park). <br /> <br /> Now the final .. The father does not care about the death of his son, but is simply interested in diamonds? Yeah ... only in the cinema, only in the cinema. <br /> <br /> A complete waste of talent is an adaptation of Chricton (Jurassic Park, Twister, ER). 2/10.
