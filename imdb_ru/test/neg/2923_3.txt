A very disappointing film by Oliver Stone, which, unlike his recent epic "J.F.K.", does not stimulate any real emotions. Talk Radio talks about the host Barry Champlain, a very loud, self-confident person who manages to upset many people, but at the same time attract an audience, most of whom want you to ring up and insult him. His boss in the film (Alec Baldwin) sums up his character very well, saying that he is just a seller of shoes with a big mouth. And since Barry (Eric Bogosian) receives a death threat from a death threat, the final result is almost inevitable. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that usually has something very strong. However, "Talk Radio" does not give serious comments and remains a disappointing, meaningless film. <br /> <br /> Thursday, September 17, 1992 - Video
