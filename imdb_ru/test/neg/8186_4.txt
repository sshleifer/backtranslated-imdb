If Jacqueline McKenzie and John Lynch were not such talented actors, this film would probably be even worse than it really is. The story of two people with mental disorders who fall in love and give birth to a child is interesting and should be studied. on the other hand, as the story progresses, the plot becomes more and more unexpected, and the choice of music becomes more and more bizarre, so by the end I laughed when I learned that the director intended to cry.
