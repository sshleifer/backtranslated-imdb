I used to love Tim Burton. I liked Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands and even Mars Attack. But I hate this movie. The scenes of costumed drama at the beginning were something of a poorly made, heavy thing that interfered with historical drama 25 years ago. Then there were all the dizzying scenes that just left me alone, and I think it should mean something. Yes, there were some beautiful bare trees and foggy evenings, and jumping a horseman from a tree was a good special effect, but overall the film was just boring and meaningless.
