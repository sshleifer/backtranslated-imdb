Described by one scared witness from Quebequa as “La Carcagne” - she’s the devil in a wolf-faced storm and a woman’s body with wings, more than I can say, “this says little to Canadian women, because when we finally see him in focus, it is a cross between an overgrown buzzard, a chicken hawk and Gonzo the Great. But is it not just an old giant turkey ??
