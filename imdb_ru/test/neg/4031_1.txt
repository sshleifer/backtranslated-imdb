It was so bad that I had to turn it off in the end. I have never watched such a pathetic movie. I love movies B and looked forward to the same, but, unfortunately, was disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is the worst acting game / plot / director / script, etc. From everything I've ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> My advice to all who think, watch / buy / rent, do not go there!
