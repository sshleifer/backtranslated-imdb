(DVD) The movie "The Tempest", filmed by Jack Bender, was published in 2001. He did not get into German cinemas, and neither the director nor the actor could receive an important award for this film. The film belongs to the Shakespearean play "The Tempest", which was published at the end of the 16th century. The director tried to create a modern version of this play, but failed. At the beginning of the film, the owner of the plantation Prosper is in conflict with his brother Antonio about the treatment of his slaves. Antonio goes on a journey to his brother and tries to kill him, but with the help of a witch, Prosper can escape and run with his daughter and a slave named Ariel to a small island near the Mississippi River. For more than twelve years, he has been living alone on this island, until lucky chance will allow him to take revenge on his brother ... If Prosper is lucky, you must find out for yourself. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this film is really an unsuccessful attempt to create a modern version of the original play by William Shakespeare. The story of the film also confuses the characters. Prosper does not have the same abilities as in a storm ..... END OF PART I
