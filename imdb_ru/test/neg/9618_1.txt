The DVD version released by Crash Cinema was very poorly written. The mastering engineer must have been drunk, asleep or not even in the room while it was being done. It seems that it was mastered from about the tenth generation and approximately in the middle of the film, the synchronization of sound disappears. Dialog approximately 10 or 15 seconds behind the audio. If you are thinking of buying this DVD, please save your money. I remember watching this film in the theater in 1973. In addition, a VHS copy of this film called “When Taekwondo Beats” looks better than a DVD, but the remaining few minutes of the film are “missing. Where is the original camera negative?
