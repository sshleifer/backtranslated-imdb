Watching this movie really surprised me. I never stopped watching the whole movie, because $ 3 for renting a movie is a good amount and, hell, I should at least watch it all and get my money. I did it in about 30 minutes of this absolutely crappy movie when I thought to myself: now I'm a little dumber after watching this movie. I can't believe that the director and actors in this film really had such a low self-esteem to allow it to be released! <br /> <br /> I can't say anything that was not said by other reviewers, but even in the worst films there are usually one or two decent performances ... not in this pathetic garbage. I have seen how best to play in school plays. Everyone, and I mean that every “actor” is bad outside of faith, and what's really amazing is the homogeneity of the bad ... damn it, it was the director. Where did they get these people? <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. Although it is interesting in some places because of its ridiculous script and even weaker acting, and I use this term very loosely, unfortunately, this film was not devoted to the hellish movie “B” for all eternity. What might be a good idea was destroyed by an ultra-low budget, poor sound and effects, and actors who probably earned their wings in children's television, and poor children's television in that. <br /> <br /> Please stay away from this movie. Not even worth a minute of your time.
