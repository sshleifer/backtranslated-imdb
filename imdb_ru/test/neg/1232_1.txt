Please do not waste six hours of your life watching me. The fact that I did this is not a good reflection for me. Wes Studi was the only redeeming actor in this clanker. As a “prequel” with similar roots, there can be no even in the same universe as the “Lonely Pigeon” outside of me !! It was an incoherent, incoherent, incoherent story. The scenes were not developed, the fighting scenes were almost ridiculous, and the big end (disappointment) was the appropriate ending for this mini-series. Val Kilmer, whom I considered a respected actor, played one of the strangest roles I've ever seen him. His last scene in the series was to be the director. I have been reading these reviews for many years, and this show prompted me to register !!!
