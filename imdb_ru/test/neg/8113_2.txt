The traveling couple (Horton and Hamilton) stumbles upon the city of Gatlin, where children kill adults and always seek to kill more as they separate, and Peter Horton, of course, must save his wife from these tedious, ugly jokes in this very bad adaptation King's best stories. In the original story, King managed to create tension and attract the personality of his characters, but all of this was ousted from production, and all that remained was repetitive boredom, which was too predictable to be as tense. In addition, the effective ending used in history is in favor of a “happy ending,” which makes the overall effect dumb. There is a certain atmosphere and stylish direction, but there is no plot to support it. Children are also very unconvincing. <br /> <br /> 1/5 Matt Bronson
