How could they take such a beautiful animated gem like Don Bluth's All Dogs, go to heaven and kill him with an inhuman, tender, boring sequel. Haunting music and delightful characters have disappeared, now they have been replaced with sticky animation and an extraordinary storyline. <br /> <br /> Pros: Charlie Sheen is sometimes as cheerful as Charlie, but he lacks the charming attitude of the guy who brought him to life of Bert Reynolds. I especially liked the songs "I will always be with you" and "Here is too heavenly." <br /> <br /> Cons: There seems to be no connection between this and the original. At the beginning, Charlie talks to Carface, but wait a minute. Isn't that the character who was responsible for killing Charlie and kidnapping the cute little orphan he loved? I suppose things are changing in Heaven, but why isn't Anne-Marie even mentioned? If itching to heaven, wouldn't Flo and Killer come too? What's up with Annabelle Whippet? In the original, it sounded feminine and charming, and later it sounded like a tearful parrot. New characters are not so good (except for Sasha). And the animation is better compared to the usual Saturday morning cartoon. The constant cartoon “humor” is flat and unfunny, and the “heart” simply does not work when compared to the original, which had such a touching, elusive touch that makes me cry every time. <br /> <br /> All Dogs "Go to Heaven" is one of my favorite films. I don’t understand how Don Blute made this sequel. <br /> <br /> LOWER LINE: Not all prequels go to heaven.
