This is a type of film that makes you wonder about your past admiration for one or another director before stopping and reminding yourself that very few people whose work does not contain a few clokers. <br /> <br /> Acting in the films of Lelouch is of great importance because he puts the viewer in such close proximity with the characters. Actors need to bring real screen magic to live up to intensity. Otherwise, it's just a void. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, none of the actors in this film possessed any magic on the screen. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons and Patricia Kaas are behind the lead. Irons is a talented actor, but he was mistaken in this part. Attractive rogue did not suit his strengths. His charm brand also hit a fake note for me here. The persona Iron is too inclined to decadence to fit into the love story of Lelouch. <br /> <br /> Although I would not like to miss any opportunity to hear an English accent, I also think that an American actor would work better in this role. So many songs that Kaas sings are so closely identified with the Americanism of a particular author of the lyrics, then it seemed that Jeremy Irons was playing a love interest, even though it didn't matter. It still screwed up the movie stream somehow. At least for me. <br /> <br /> Of course, it would be the right American. I think George Clooney would be great in this part. And he would have brought the magic of the screen to the spikes. Brad Pitt could also really cope well with his special charming and sharp combination. <br /> <br /> I was also very disappointed with Patricia Kaas. Reading about her, I learned that she has a very successful singer career and a lot of fans, so I know, but it seemed to me that her presence on the screen as a singer was very boring. In fact, she was a much better actress in her scenes than the singer in those scenes in which she had to interpret and sell the song. Nothing she sang touched me. She was pleasant but polite. <br /> <br /> Unlike her, Kate Hudson, who is not a professional singer and has only a French voice trainer, would still have coped with this part a million times better. Not to mention all those amazing French talents that could be involved. It was awful to see Patricia Kaas take a seat on the screen when there are so many charismatic French actresses who could be played instead. <br /> <br /> The music in this film was so important that it could not work without music. And since Kaas did it so badly, the film never had a chance. <br /> <br /> Lelouch decided the fate of this film when he starred as Patricia Kaas. SME.
