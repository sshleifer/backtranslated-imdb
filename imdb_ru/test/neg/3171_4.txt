I think “Homegrown” - a slightly wrong name for this film - more like “Plantation grown” - but this is not exactly the same. My guide described it as a comedy, but the miserable suffering of these unfortunate jesters is not my idea of ​​laughing on my stomach. Still in the genre of farce-thriller / drama. The characters developed quite well - the cast of the stars made him very promising, it’s just a shame that the plot was obviously absurd. Ted Danson provided a beautiful cameo, as did Jamie Lee Curtis in her walking part. Jon Bon Jovi has this amazing ability to measure THC content in the front seat of his car! I assume that if you soak a few in advance, you should be able to come to terms with it - at least not for shy paranoids.
