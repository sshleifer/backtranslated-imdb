It was a shame for the game FarCry, which I expected, but it all ended in a nightmare. In addition to the poor effects of visual effects, the plot tricks, even the humor used in the film, was an absolute failure. The film is generally not worth watching. The funniest thing was when the girl came up and kissed Jack to give him the key to the cuffs. I guess she kept getting the keys to the handcuffs all the time. I hope some good director will ever turn this fantastic game into a movie. And I will invest good money to get the right visuals and the right scenarios, as well as the right ACTION. But until then do not waste time trying to watch this movie, because it will surely piss you off, especially if you are a FarCry fan.
