Well, this is a monogram from the terrible period of the 40s, when studios from poor families released quite a lot of horror films that are almost unimaginably boring ... So I expected the worst. <br /> <br /> The story tells about a doctor who worked to restore the life of the dead, using a room full of unused electrical appliances that sparkled beautifully. The dog's heart hangs under the hood and violently twitches, which, as we know, is proof that his method has been improved. <br /> <br /> A brief discussion of the metaphysical consequences and the mentioning of an important plot are preceded by the inevitable death of a young man, who is being revived in a rather inextricable sequence - not ramat even with sparks. The important point of the story is that the convicted murderer was executed just at midnight, and this is exactly when the young man is revived. Not surprisingly, the young man is very different from his experience; apparently amnaziak and with a strange desire to visit the sanctuaries of the underworld and get to know some of the gangsters ... <br /> <br /> It’s hard to explain why all this is not completely unnoticeable, but perhaps it’s enough to say that it’s a bit interesting and contains several kills and a couple of interesting characters. Towards the end, he even begins to move along with some real tension and confrontation, which is the direct Hitchkian. SPOILER <br /> <br /> I must warn of a very, very bad end. Tag on the unnecessary, pain in the ass grade ends. After the plot is solved quite effectively ... <br /> <br /> You know what it is ... It's all a dream. It never happened.
