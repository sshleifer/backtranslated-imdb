The Shuttle is an indie thriller about four young people who took a bus ride from the airport late at night to find out that the driver is a sadistic psychopath. scary and this is an unusually interesting plot work, some aspects are simply not there. Bad dialogue and incredible characters give good reason not to care about them. But often the obscurity triggers and asks you the question “What would you do?” And usually what you would do is not what these idiots in the shuttle do. <br /> <br /> If you expect a meaningless, bloody horror film, you will be mistaken. This is a film that makes you use your mind, but unfortunately, not completely. <br /> <br /> Four out of ten.
