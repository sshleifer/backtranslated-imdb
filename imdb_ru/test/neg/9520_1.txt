What kind of self-indulgence! Duncan Roy’s film appears to be autobiographical, but it’s impossible to find any glimpse of emotional truth in this chaotic, poorly acting and sadly amateur fiasco. <br /> <br /> In a sense, you have to admire human eggs, thanks to grim determination and a very generous benefactor manages to make a film about his own rise and fall - from an insulted working class to a criminal English lord. However, the tone is either so pitiful or so arched that it is impossible to interact with the characters or the plot. Raw materials are potentially excellent material, but Roy does not seem to be able to tease a fairy tale that should grab you by the throat and then lead you to tears. And this is a complete mystery why it was ever created to be shown as a triptych of images - perhaps because one image would be too tedious to view. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see so many good actors who would otherwise be good - Bill Nyei, Diana Quick, Lindsay Coulson are the worst performances in their careers.
