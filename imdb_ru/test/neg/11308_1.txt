It must be the worst movie I've ever seen Nilsson. This film simply does not have what it takes to be funny. I think the reasons for Naked Pistol and similar films are that they do not require Nilson to be funny. He just played the roles as straightforward as he could, while the whole comedy was mostly visual. But when you shoot him in a movie, where he should be funny, he is not. The film had only one good part, and this can be considered a spoiler, and that the initial captions were animated. If the whole movie were animated, it could be good. I was not going to watch this movie when I saw an advertisement for it, and the only reason I saw it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them at a radio contest. This is the first and probably the only film in which I have ever left. On a scale from 1 to 10, I give this film a rating of -100.
