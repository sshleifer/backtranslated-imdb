Danny DeVito shows us that he is definitely, really endless, the best performer on screen than turned off. He plays the role of Owen, an unhappy potential writer with a naughty old mother (adorablely played by Anna Ramsay), whom he would like to see dead. Billy Crystal - Larry, a very upset writing teacher who has an alienated wife, to whom he feels the same. Therefore, Owen, after watching “Strangers on the Train,” Hitchcock invites them to exchange murders. <br /> <br /> As a director, DeVito’s control is inconsistent, as he wastes this clever idea for nothing, while his film comes from the very funny in the softest. He and Crystal are all right in the lead roles, but the series is owned by Ann Ramsey as the disastrous Mrs. Lift. <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 20, 1992 - Videos
