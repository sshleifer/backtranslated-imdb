Every time I watched this film, I got the same impression: some of its parts are so surprisingly stupid / bad that they infuriated me, they were not intentional, and there are many of them; the rest is just bad, stupid and / or irrelevant. A film such as The Evil Dead deserves praise for being bad at its own expense, because it is the intended result - it is stupid and stupid, because Sam Raimi succeeded in what he tried to do. This film does not have this excuse, it is stupid and stupid, because the filmmakers failed. The result of shit accumulates at the top of the performance of shit and shit writing, so it is embarrassing that the lowest rating a film can give is “terrible”. Watching this movie has the same effect as listening to Billy Madison's essay: "Now everyone in this room is dumber listening to him." I should be able to give this movie something around -5.
