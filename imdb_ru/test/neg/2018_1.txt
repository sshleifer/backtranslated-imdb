Dracula 3000 is the epitome of painful cheese cinema. From the very beginning, I assumed that something rather unpleasant was waiting for me. What to expect from actors in which Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Kulio and Tiny Lister participated? Well, let's just say that the expectations were crushed ... <br /> <br /> If I really start, I feel that this review will last for ages, so we will keep it simple. Vampire is not even called Dracula. The space crew carries coffins from the Carpathian sector of the Transylvania system. In his big stage, Kulio talks about the most terrible things that have ever been said in the history of cinema. In 3000, everyone wears bad clothes by today's standards, they have nothing more advanced than a modern wheelchair, and they are decorated with neon lights that seem stolen from the rink. <br /> <br /> Top it all ... end. Dear merciful God. It does not deserve to be destroyed. In this you need to believe. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie as "1" and I would like to give it a zero ... but I feel obliged to make you watch it. What is this madness?
