There were a lot of “creepy” westerns created in the 30s and early 40s, and although this has a strong start, it is not. Randy Bowers (John Wayne) stops at Halfway House, discovers that there are a lot of dead bodies there, the bartender’s body is thrown over a bar with a gun, eyes are looking at Randy because of holes cut through his eyes in the photo and playing the piano "The most beautiful night of the year." <br /> <br /> This was the result of robbing a gang of Marvin Black to get Ed Rogers $ 30,000. Randy is an investigator who “works alone,” who spends a bit of time getting him arrested, escaping (with the help of his daughter Ed Sally) and literally landing in the middle of the Black Gang's hiding place behind a waterfall. Everything is moving pretty fast. Only one too much harassment after Randy slowed him down. <br /> <br /> We even have George Hayes, clean-shaven and playing two roles - Marvin Black, the ugliest villain, as well as the Citizen, Matt the Silent, who communicates through handwritten messages. It was a good idea to get him to play two opposing roles, but writing messages would quickly become obsolete even for him, as he eventually quits doing it at the end, saying to Sally: “Oh, I'm fed up with this!” In the series “The Lost City” (1934) George can be seen playing a vile, nasty double villain. <br /> <br /> I think this is the only film Lone Star whose name refers to or is mentioned in the movie! Sally holds out Randy’s hand and says, "He's not alone anymore!" Then squeeze them around each other as they watch to the lake. Sally escapes from Randy, seems too harsh and not prepared enough. Too much time was spent riding on the flight from the sheriff. <br /> <br /> Not so bad, considering everything, but not so great. would really give him 4 and a half.
