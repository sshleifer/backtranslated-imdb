What a ridiculous waste of time and money !!!! This film was the biggest loser of the year. All the hype was a warning. I'm disappointed for Julia Roberts, of course, she is the most talented cast. I think her ability to really act carried the film. The boyfriends club was too fake, and to add insult to the injury, why try to play Catherine Zeta-Jones? She has only the opportunity to spoil the movie. She lacks the ability to have chemistry on the screen with someone, not to mention the fact that she lacks the ability to act. She lacks chemistry with other characters: she reminds of America's Beloved. She made the terminal terminal. This film is not moving anywhere, what a shame, please do not tell me that "13" is on the way!
