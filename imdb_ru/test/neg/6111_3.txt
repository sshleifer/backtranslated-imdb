For several years, for some reason I could not see this film, although it was quite successful and caused a lot of discussion in Israel. I am sorry that I did not postpone indefinitely after seeing this. <br /> <br /> The theme “Kadosh” is very real and painful for those who know the Jewish religious world - the place of women in an Orthodox family. and society. The basic situation that underlies the film is possible, the problem is that the way it is displayed on the screen and the “solution” that the described conflicts get in the film is wrong. Gitai doesn’t seem too sympathetic to men in the religious world, but his approach to choosing characters who are either fanatical or unable to express their human feelings makes the whole story simplistic. Nor does he serve his female characters much better, although here, at least, he shows more sympathy, and he also likes the participation of two beautiful and gifted actresses in Yael Abecassis and Meital Barda. In general, Guitai’s vision is too one-sided, his cinematographic tools are too simple, he focuses on the technical details of Jewish religious life, which may be of interest to people who do not know them, but in fact have no relation to the context at all. the whole story. Based on interesting prerequisites, we get a boring movie that seems longer than it is, with a very static way of acting, obsessed with using music that plays in the same register not only from a musical, but also from an emotional point of view and very inconclusive if not tangled end. What is the difference between this film and “Ha Ushpizin” inspired and described the same social landscape and which managed to convey the human feelings on the screen. In Kadosh, there is too little cinema and too little human emotion.
