I remember reading that Darwin had a key experience in the Galapagos Islands, saw a huge spectrum of animal life there, and the intern wrote his own theory of evolution. Not according to this film - it was inspired by the British countryside. Good, and as John Cleese would say, right. I also did not think that Darwin was a man suffering from deep personal conflict, and a man who suffered from dark dreams and flights of torment. In this film, he was. Sadly, he obviously lost one of his daughters due to illness, but I do not think that the loss of a family member would greatly affect a personâ€™s scientific abilities. Well, not according to ... you get the picture. I think that there is nothing worse than when science turns into a fable, and to some extent this film tries to debunk the evolutionary theory, saying that it came from a person who was emotionally unstable, which for me is just rude. I think that Charles Darwin was the soul of scientific research, cold-blooded and calm, and always thought logically. This film aims to dramatize non-dramatic and sensational scientific research. It's like a canterbury tale. I would not recommend it.
