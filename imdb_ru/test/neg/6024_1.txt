I remember that, hey, hey, fuss, and I saw Jackson Jive, it was a pretty straightforward comedy parody, but I saw it, and it's free and comes out? Did I miss something? If the black community should complain about any racist comments on the TV show, this should be so, and if you read my previous comments, I am not one of those who are easily offended. The main plot is that the African American moves along with this white guy, and they make these racist comments, as if the value of the house will fall only because of the black neighbors, and the white guy makes the links look like ) Nig-Nog Jungle Boy Sambo. (I'm sorry, but it really happens in this show, I'm really a guy who gets along well with the black community) People can say: “Hey, lighter, but even when you remove racial insults, it's not funny!” : I saw that someone's eyes are focused on something unrelated to the situation. In general, a terrible comedy.
