I can’t emphasize this, do NOT * NOT * this film for children. <br /> <br /> However, it’s best for you to save it from adults. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe I'm exaggerating a little. This is not the worst children's movie ... no, let me rephrase that. This is not the worst movie made by bewildered adults, for bewildered adults and somehow promoted for children (it would be “Jack”, which I was going to watch / gut like a fish). <br /> <br /> Adults will not learn something amazing (well, if you need, move forward to the end to get an educational space about an interesting cosmic phenomenon). We, as adults, usually do not do what we want as children, because reality tends to interfere. Well, I could tell you that (like, by the way, four years at a college in an art school, but I'm leaving). <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the hell kids can get from this film. Most likely, this will only upset them (we will see a moment when Russ was injured at eight years old). There is a better movie, Kiki's Delivery Service, which is essentially the same message, but it is processed literally, and does not cut into your head. And adults will like it too! <br /> <br /> By the way, there is a moment in the film made with the amazement of MST3K, if they think about an OTHER Bruce Willis film with a sad little child. in that.
