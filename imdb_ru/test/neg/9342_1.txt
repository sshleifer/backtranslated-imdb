I will not comment much on what to ??? Stereotypical characters, absolute ignorance about the reality of Colombia, a terrible stage scene, bad color choices, NOT funny (it must be a comedy, and they expect you to laugh because some silly music is beyond meaningless scenes) actors (if you see these people somewhere, I mean translators, you will understand that they are at least good, but seeing this so-called film is impossible to guess), you are tired of music ... this " comedy "there is no rhythm, the only good rhythm, at rap, singing in the closing credits .... pity, is not it? and so on and so forth. I have not seen such a bad film in a long time!
