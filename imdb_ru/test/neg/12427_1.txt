I think this is one of those few films that I want to rate as low as possible, just to make a compliment. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie for about 25 years, so I really can not say so much about it. It still seems very hard to find on the video. But I remember how my brother and I stumbled upon it somewhere in the poisonous brew of the late night UHF television channel of the mid-1980s, when I was about 10 years old. So I never saw the beginning of the film, but I saw most of it. The first thing I remember is that this couple is sneaking out of the camp, and they are rowing to the island to figure it out, and then they are attacked by a mad Scot in a kilt with an ax! They manage to escape from him, but they are attacked by the monster Loch Ness, who in this film is just a head and neck without a body. The monster's eyes and mouth don't even move, it looks like a pinata. <br /> <br /> I mean that I have never seen anything like this before, and it just blew my mind. I saw some bad movies on TV in the early 80s, but I have never seen something so inept, so carelessly and thoughtlessly constructed that it seemed that the people who made him spend less time and effort on him than we did watched it I have already seen some of the films of "Troma" and the like, which is trying to deliberately be "polite", but it was pure and real material, and this was my first meeting with really great bad films. This film was like the last breath of the driving era, and I felt it just in time. In fact, when we looked at it, we could not understand whether it was done in the 50s or 70s. It turned out that he came out just a few years before I saw him. <br /> <br /> Later, I met Mystery Science Theater and learned about many old B movies and shows, but I already saw it in this movie. The film is so funny that I never even laughed at the team of Monty Python, Bill Murray or a comedian. After watching this film, I always tried to find “good bad” films, and many of my friends were included in it. But this film was in principle impossible to find. I never found out who he was at all and who Larry Buchanan was until the 1990s, when IMDb took off, the Internet took off, and information began to spread. But this film still has to be discovered by many others who could appreciate its transcendentally bad qualities. Look for it.
