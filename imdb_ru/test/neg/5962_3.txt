This is a great example of what could be a great movie and a great idea, but the process turned out to be very bad. I was mostly tempted to get it because of the DVD cover, I was stupid, but I did it anyway, and I was amazed, in a bad way. This film essentially tells how El Chupacabra wreaked havoc around Los Angeles, and the local animal policeman and writer must do this to save the day before two corrupt police officers and two evil scientists destroy them. The main reason why I didn’t enjoy this movie was because of the big errors of continuity that it was hard not to notice. Along with a bad game, good lighting and nothing scary, this film did not hit me as much as it should. However, compared to other Chupacabra films, this film certainly stands at the top of the charts. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the continuity in this film is still far away, and I mean from the shoulders and into the ditch. There were so many moments when the characters said or did something, and then on the next frame they don’t, or the changes never happened. Case in point: the main character has a pistol, attacks the Chupacabra, he snatches talent from nowhere and distracts, and the pistol disappears. The girl runs while he defends himself here with a mysterious talent, and she has no weapons, then the main character runs with the girl and holds a gun. Where did the talent come from and what happened to the gun? Time of the day is ruined. In one minute, the sun is already setting, and you can still see the sun, and in the next minute it looks like midnight. There were some holes in the plot, how, why was the Chupacabra there, what did the scientists do, what happened to this guy and why did he shoot the animal, and it still lives? These things got me off track, and no answer was received to any of the questions. <br /> <br /> Next on the list is acting skills. The boy was wooden and bad. The protagonist Navarro, played by Eric Algeria, seems too calm in some moments and too devoted to find out what killed several dogs, and when the tragedy happened, his emotions simply did not exist. Elina Madison, who played Starlina, did a pretty bad job. She was the author of the best-selling book about Chupacabra, and she was simply not interested in her role or her play. Her game was kind of funny and poor. Even for the author, she knows too much about this and knows how to turn off the security system with a high degree of protection in a hidden laboratory. Tony Criss was fine, but he seemed to have calmed down a bit to some of the things that were happening. The film reminds me of a poor reconstruction of a murder for some crime detection show, where actors and actresses are not really so committed to their work. <br /> <br /> I rarely get such an anal when it appears to be lighting or editing, but for this film I couldn't help but be harsh on the lighting. It took me out of the movie several times because the lighting was so badly directed. There were times when they tried to be creative, adding color filters to the scene to make it more “comical”, but it had the opposite effect. Worst of all happens at night when it is dark black outside, but the scene is so saturated with light that it seems that this is her day. They constantly switch from bright light to soft for random scenes, and the lights seem so bright that the actors squinted. It should not be so bright that there were dark shadows at night. During sunset, when the lighting was perfect, it was the only time that the light was good, except that it was terrible. <br /> <br /> There was no panic in this movie. There was only one time when I jumped, but other than that, it was not scary. There were moments in which it could probably be scary, but it was so damn light that you could see how the chupacabra was approaching a person, but if it were dark, it would be better. Even the design of the Chupacabra creatures was bad, it looked good, but it was a short man or a child in a tracksuit. They did not hide his face; they showed it without a sense of mystery or mysterious appearance. There was a fair amount of blood, but it seemed unreal. This film was simply not scary, that's all. <br /> <br /> In general, they Americanized the great South American legend in a bloodthirsty cannibal, which is not the Chupacabra. In fact, he was afraid of people and killed only goats, sheep, dogs and deer, because they said that he hates the smell of people. But then what would be the story? I did not like this film for any reason, but I commend them for trying to make a good film with good intentions. I would not recommend this movie to horror lovers, but if you like indie or bi-films, you should check it out. In addition, if you are easily seduced by a cult classic, you will like this movie. I didn’t see, I’d never see again, but in some deeply peaceful way I like such films just to see what the other side of Hollywood does.
