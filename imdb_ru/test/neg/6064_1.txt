The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece. John Garfield, Ann Feast, Lilly Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee ... and filmed by one of the greatest filmmakers who have ever graced the screen ... James Wong Howe Despite the presence of Rod Staiger, Joe Mantegna and Jennifer Beals, there is nothing valuable here, and it is a shame that this product bears the same name as the brilliant original. Only the name of the main character, Charlie Davis, is the same in both films. I do not think that in this remake there are any redemptive qualities. I am amazed that Rod Steiger participated. This may be the only bad movie he ever made. Maybe he needs a salary.
