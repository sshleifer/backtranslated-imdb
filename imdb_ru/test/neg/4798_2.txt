Just saw Coronado ... Around here is the only line they came up with to sell it "from the FX team after Independence Day". I think it says a lot. Do not talk about writers, directors, actors ... <br /> <br /> This is a small adventure story in a banana republic in Central America, but the plot is very thin. <br /> <br /> All Throughout the film, I continued to think about how this movie looks like the commercials from some action-computer game. Although the effects are good, they are too often seen. Just like scenes in the style of computer graphics, such as Command'n'Conquer. <br /> <br /> You almost immediately find out that there has never been such a specific truck, background, bridge, castle or jet fighter. It looks smooth and beautiful, but not in the way we are expected to expect from Action Adventures today. The film lacks a lot of obvious filming on the spot. <br /> <br /> The acting storyline is below average, and the effects are good, but do not meet the standard of feature films. I'm not surprised that this thing went straight to the video / DVD. <br /> <br />
