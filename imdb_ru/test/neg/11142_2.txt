I like underground films when they have something to say or show on this issue. I tried my best to love "Garbage." I tried to see some artistic achievement or an interesting idea about the life of New York in the early 70s. Or at least amused by it? But the film stinks, and it can not be called neither art nor entertainment. <br /> <br /> “Garbage” is basically a reason to expose Joe Dullesandro’s naked body for 2 hours, while he meets other uninteresting, annoying figures I agree, this is a gorgeous body, but there is no excuse for this, right?). Holly Woodlawn, like Joe's girlfriend, by the end gives some good laughs, but then it's too late to save those spent a couple of hours. Lou Reed's classic song "Walking on the Wild Side" is the best depiction of these people and of that time, even if it is more exciting than they really were. 1.5 / 10.
