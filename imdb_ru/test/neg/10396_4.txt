Fan documentaries are always confusing, and they should not be overlooked, but I found this one, made by the fans themselves, more than incomprehensible. As a veteran of Tolkien’s original fascination, forty years ago, I was hoping for something more than the obvious - which is not always equal to the truth. If there is someone living who does not yet know the nature of the fandom, the fandom due to the fact that he was or is known as a fan, he will not find it here. Between irrelevance, banality (to which actors from films are especially prone) and acting out (by the fans making the most - if not the best - their only throw in fame), I could extract some special appeal of LOTR, the particular emotional reactions that it causes, and the range of particular creative forms that these reactions can take. In addition, the film is rather lazy: it neglects some facts that could be found without much effort, for example, what was the exact legal loophole (wording of the copyright notice) that allowed unauthorized publication of books in the United States. "This is not true. It was the work of Jack Gogan, a very capable illustrator of that period, and some fans, including me, found them more suitable and attractive than the covers on the set of rivals. ”
