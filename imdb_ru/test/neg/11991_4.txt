One of the boxes is better than trying. It simply shows that if you do something long enough, you should improve by chance. It is still not good, but it is at least watchable, which is an improvement over blood. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry is that the Farcry story was not the strength of the games, while the Bloodrayne had a strong story, and so Ball had more chances to spoil it. <br /> <br /> The action in this film is actually quite good. Sometimes touch overdone, but in a good sense of the word and worth it to look. <br /> <br /> Acting wisely, it was pretty decent. Most of the actors are pretty good, but you can say that they don't take it seriously, based on comparison with other performances. But the lighter mood it gives the film really helps. <br /> <br /> Although I think that if you get a little closer to the plot of the game, it could make the film a little better, but the changes made are quite practical and not big enough to change the situation. Especially considering the plot of the game, it is unlikely that Oscar won only the FPS slaughter car. I wish it was happening in the jungle, as it was quite an integral part of the game, but in Canada there is not much jungle, and, at least, it is located in a certain tropical forest. <br /> <br /> Why does Ball feel the need to change the already professionally prepared scenarios of game scenarios that I donâ€™t know, but he does. And until he starts to let the source material speak through his devices, he will always be missed. Watch a movie for a laugh, it's good for this, and perhaps for watching at a party, like party food.
