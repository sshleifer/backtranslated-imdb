Notice, I only saw about the second half of this film, so feel free to take my review with any amount of salt that you think is suitable, this is what was said, to see what I saw was more than enough to convince me that Star rating is enough for this. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a dark carnage of a wonderful predecessor (NL Christmas Holiday) with a Chevy Chase, only there is no Chevy Chase in it, and it happens on a common tropical island, in fact, not associated with Christmas at all. <br /> <br /> Ol Chevy probably didn’t want to participate, because the plot lacked real fun, instead they got mad cousin Eddie, who, again, was gorgeous in the original, but in this he is simply exorbitant and extremely bad for all films that consider the plot and acting. Attempts at humor are of a general nature to such an extent that even a modern television comedy is superior to it, and, given that it must be a comedy, I doubt that I need to say more. <br /> <br /> This cannot be seen for his quality, because he doesn’t have it, but because of shortcomings and the way Hollywood sheds the blood of its life in pursuit of a quick dollar. <br /> <br /> I think I’ll see the original before the upcoming Christmas season just to try to regain my innocence in childhood, from lost time when the movie was more than just big-budget but meaningless rubbish.
