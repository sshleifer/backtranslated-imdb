well, i'm really into King things, but that’s just awful. the whole movie, I'm waiting for the main character to do something deep with his new youth and strength. I can tolerate the worst of the films, because everything is better than watching a sliced ​​movie with ads. but it takes a cake. I gave him 2, and I would never recommend it to anyone.
