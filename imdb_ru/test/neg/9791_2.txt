Obviously, SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last film that Julius Harris took part in. I have not seen all of his films, but Julius Harris starred in many good films, and I remember him best from Live and Let Die, where he played Tee-Hee, and which was full of voodoo references that often occur here, in South Florida! I always thought that LIVE AND LET DIE is a great movie because there was some kind of atmosphere and mystery in it, unlike most 007 films. In SHRUNKEN HEADS, Julius Harris is back as Voodoo! He has a great style for mysticism and the occult, and his role in this film is excellent. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a bit of a comedy. SPOILERS: Three children who look as if they were fired from the cast of LITTLE RINGS, kill the bully next door who looks like he was fired from the cast of FAME! or as a dancer on American bandstand Dick Clark. In other words, these children give a LOW BUDGET another dimension. Julius Harris goes to the funeral home, cuts off the heads of three children (and no one notices), and then takes them to his condominium, where he has a giant boiling liquid pot. Three heads are thrown in, as well as herbs, spices and voodoo items. At some point, Mr. Harris has ugly little heads on the table, and he sheds his blood on them, and they come to life as talking heads! They can fly, joke, roll their eyes and take revenge on the Villains. They usually look pretty funny flying around, but the effect is not bad. For some reason, one of the children always has a blade in his mouth, and he uses it to cut people's necks and cut holes in tires. This film is strange and funny, but only for the first time when you see it. Meg Foster is in this film, and she looks fatter than Rosie O'Donnell, and Meg plays the male leader of the local gangsters. Strange movie.
