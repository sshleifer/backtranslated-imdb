The obvious customized car for Ryan Phillip. It seems that the studios were hoping that he could play the role of a tough cop and not look like he was forever 16 (he can't). <br /> <br /> Heavyweight Jason Statham and Welsey Snipes serve as frontmen for Philip, but when they are On the screen there is no Philip Kambal; his fine acting style has nothing to rebound. <br /> <br /> The script is a typical bad cop of the late 20th century, with an incredibly predictable plot and dialogue, filmed in 1970â€™s TV shows, such as San Francisco Streets. Snipes repeats his role as an eternal villain in a black hat, playing a little less crazy madman than his role as the Destroyer. However, Snipes and Statham had nothing to chew on. Statham's character announces that he has given up nicotine and caffeine - something that is essential in this film for injections. <br /> <br /> A truly forgettable moment: Ryan Phillippe expounds Buddhist dogma: Galloway: Are you a Buddhist? Decker: No. This is just what I picked up along the way.
