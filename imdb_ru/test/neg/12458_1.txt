Why do people make bad movies? Didn't anyone working on a picture know that what they were doing didn't make sense? There is something in this picture that baffled me, besides the fact that I found this “film” unrealistic, pathetic and terribly active. I admire them for trying, but the “actors” in the film sometimes try their best, and not a single character has a substance or says something softly clever. This film deserves zero stars. But I did not have this option, so it gets 1.
