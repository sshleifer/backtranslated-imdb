... and in this series I was annoyed to laugh with a fun hairdo. Remember my friend Marco, who got all the good lines in the books? Well, in this series, his one-line players disgraced Mr. Freese. Remember our evil sworn enemy Visser Three? He is a bald guy with meaningless phrases. Remember Rachel, "Xena, Warrior Princess" and Cassie, my sensitive and caring love interest? 10 (!) Writers turned them into meaningless pranks, who decided that the original characters are not cool enough for television. Remember the amazing extraordinary Ax that was cool, smart, and really, really loved cinnamon buns? In this series, he is Alien Sign, with an extremely annoying voice. Remember the witty banter that our team had in the books? In this series, our dialogue is so dull and stupid that it is obvious that the writers condoned the lowest common denominator. <br /> <br /> Forget everything you thought you knew about Animorphs! It was Cassie who was allergic to morphing, not Rachel, thinking * should * repeat, and Visser Three and Ax, rarely, if ever, appeared like andalite (no, it has nothing to do with the budget!) /> <br /> I'm not crazy. And I'm not lying. Nerds around us. And if you're unlucky, one of them can adapt one of your favorite books, TV shows or graphic novels to a really terrible TV show. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> "Finally ... TV is worth watching." ~ (very bald) Visser Three <br /> <br /> (r # 91)
