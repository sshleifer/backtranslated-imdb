I usually do not write reviews for shows if I have not seen them in full. However, there were so many positive views on this show that I felt I needed to balance it with a bit of realism. <br /> <br /> This show is hysterically bad. I don't think it should have been, but it is. I see that the show has a lot of praise, and I, frankly, cannot understand why - this show is so badly played, the dialogue is so terrible, and the plots around their holes are thin. <br /> <br /> I think this show is interesting because it is a litmus test of your standards. Some elements of the show work, and perhaps these elements are just more important for some people than those who do not work, which makes the show almost inaccessible to people like me. <br /> <br /> If you like to make fun of a show while watching, anticipating clich√©d strings and the like, it can be pleasant to make fun of the show if you have such time. <br /> <br /> The pilot is a pretty good example of an entire show. If a meaningless ending of a saccharin cliche does not leave you in a stupid shock, then this may be the show for you.
