I know that you Americans find it difficult to find European films on video / DVD, especially from the 80s, but please look for the original version of Vanishing - the name Spoorloos (1988) - and you will understand why the Hollywood version of The Vanishing screw I’m very I love Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland, and especially Jeff Bridges, but this is so flimsy compared to the original. What, where do they think? Can you imagine the “Seven” with a happy ending when Gwyneth Paltrow happily runs into the arms of Brad Pitt in the final? The fact is that the original was such a major international success, was due to the shocking finale. So why do you take this kind of sheyt remake? Indeed, avoid it and GET the ORIGINAL.
