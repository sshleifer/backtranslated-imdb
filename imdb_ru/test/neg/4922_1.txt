Movies are no worse than that. A horrible plot, horribly timed, pathetic characters and effects, and yes, it uses the "B" standards. <br /> <br /> And for the guys: nothing, this film is terribly disappointed, a couple of scenes that could be great but you get nothing but to build without delivery. <br /> <br /> Nobody likes this movie, a terrible movie, it's bad; plot, acting, "B" flavor, special effects and everything else. Plus, no nudity or erotica for guys or girls.
