Reading most other reviews, I tend to agree with most of the comments. The only thing I would like to add is that the film was directed and produced. I think that some of these creators of the new wave think that they are smart, using unusual (sometimes sharp) camera angles, and fly from one scene to another. It goes well with these film festivals and with some of these indie-type critics, but it spoils the film for me. I noticed in the reviews one comment that none of the films of this filmmaker became a blockbuster. Perhaps this will prove my point, as the film has a sense of “urgently finished”, which makes one wonder why such a beautiful film lacks a smooth flow. As for the comment that Kiefer Sutherland is a big name for a poster, I would argue that he cringed when he watched the final version. This is a story with real potential, spoiled by attempts to be different in its production. Worth seeing, but not many will return for a second viewing.
