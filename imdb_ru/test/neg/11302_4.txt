Typical old b / w movie. Dialogues are sometimes good, but too often - especially in the second half - they become naive, sometimes terribly naive, sometimes close to the point where they are unintentionally comical. The first third, with his background information about Ladd Gatsby, featured with a series of interesting memories, is the best part of the film. But as soon as Gatsby moves to his new villa and makes moves to Betty Field, the film becomes overly melodramatic. The ending is another ending of the excuse; I don’t know if the novel itself contains this dumb, clichéted finale, or the film’s producer has made some changes to it, but I have always believed that car accidents are a bad way to add drama to the end of the story. I have seen this plot machine a million times (or, if this is not a machine, then this is a fall from a horse); the writer does not know how to finish the story, but he knows that he wants it to be dramatic, so he adds to the car accident. Lame. And what's worse, the accident is outrageous and ridiculous, both in plot and in time; The plot, because Field’s lover’s mistress (Winters) was killed by Field, and the fact that Winters seemed to be running from the gas station into the street, as if she had never noticed during those years that she lived in it, that there was a dangerous road right through her house — and, of course, at the very moment when she goes out, she sees Ladd’s car and takes it for Field’s husband’s car, and then shouts, “Here! I'm here! so tragic ending! "; from time to time, because Ladd and Field have an accident on the very day that they are preparing to tell her husband about their novel. In fact, there are too many forced and artificial ironies in this accident. It also does not really help this film. when Winters' husband, Da Silva, got his revenge to kill the guy who hit his wife, he basically does it by walking like a zombie, moving from car to car looking for scratches and acting very badly. And Da Silva’s game and his behavior the character throughout the movie is terrible and confusing proper. <br /> <br /> Scott Fitzgerald was upset several times about how his novels were adapted for the screen by the writers of Hollywood, and — although he was dead long before this film was shot — perhaps he was right Judging by the naive scenario of this film. Or maybe his novels are even more stupid and naive than this film, and were actually improved by screen adaptation. Or films are very similar to novels. I could, of course, read this particular novel. to find out, but I just can't be bothered. Fitzgerald’s name doesn’t quite inspire me to read any of his books (and I don’t mean what his name sounds like). Of course, he was not Heller, Clavell, or Twain. More like Hemingway ?? a lot of noise about anything.
