Do not be fooled into thinking that this is a remake, since this year's THE TIME MACHINE remake is based on an earlier film. This is not because it is a meaningless film. That is, the director used the original script of the camera, shot for shooting, similar to the “remake” of THE GET AWAY, made several years ago. The scenes are identical to the original, the dialogue is identical to the original, the camera angles are identical, no attempt is made to decorate or restructure the original script (but with a director like Van Sant, we should be grateful. He sure is not Hitchcock) that costumes can be the same, because the private eye wears a pork hat. Didn't they go out of fashion in the late 1960s? <br /> <br /> Outcome: avoid
