Well, last night, August 18, 2004, I had a clear displeasure when I met with Mr. Van Bebble at the screening of the film “Manson's Family for Three Pennies in Chicago” at the Chicago Underground Film Festival. Here is what I have to say about this. First, the film is the obvious rip off of every Kenneth Anger, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam film that I have ever seen. Secondly, in the short question and answer session after the show, Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he had never spoken to the real members of the Manson family, or Charlie himself, calling them liars and saying that he did not want to have anything to do with them the film was based on his (Van Bebble) trial when he saw it all from his living room on TV and in the news (and I guess from the autobiography and the book Helter Schelter, which were directly imitated in the narration), so I had second spell on questions, I asked if he tried be a stranger, Mtv, sex and drugs version of rock 'n' roll, and are not necessarily true story. This question has clearly angered the already accursed director, who began shouting: “Damn, you shut up, it's true! All these other films are nonsense **! ”<br /> <br /> Well, anyway, I didn’t even think about how ridiculous it was until the next day when I read the slogan for the movie:“ You heard the legal side of the story ... now listen to the story as it is told. the manson family. “Sorry if this guy has never even talked to his family and considers them to be liars, with whom he wants to have nothing in common, how in the name of God can he tell them a story! This is the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard The film was obviously focused on sex drugs and a rock and roll audience, as it easily attracted a small, dimly lit theater, and was even more obviously generated by sex drugs and the rock and roll mind of a person. who could not even watch his own movie without getting up every ten minutes to bring more beer or shout out Rocky Horror's phone line to the actors on the screen. This film represents more than distorting the public image of real events (which helped shape the state of America and much of the world today) into a kind of Slasher fantasy / Comic Book / Porno / Rape, clearly invented by a small person. <br /> The film was definitely very impressive. The soundtrack was refreshing, as it contained real samples of Charlie's work with the family from his album Lie. Editing was enjoyable and changeable to mimic the nauseous vagueness of most modern music videos. In general, this film would be a much better addition to the Mtv catalogs than to the Underground Film Festival or, for that matter, the mind of any intellectual observers. I felt as though Rocky Horror watched the audience dress and behave at midnight (probably the best part of the experience). The cast was very good, with the exception of Charlie, who looked like a kind of stoned Dungeons and Dragon-enthusiasts more than the actual role he played. The descriptions he gave in the film were full of energy, threw ten things at you and were very physically fit all the time, which did not correspond to the slow, sluggish and plump presentation that was actually presented. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is mainly due to the fact that Sadie (or maybe it was Linda) at the end declares: “You can write a bunch of stupid ** books or make a bunch of stupid ** movies .. ., and so on. D. And so on. D. "". The point is. Even a disclaimer "Based on a true story" is a dead sell signal, indicating that somewhere under this psychedelic pile of garbage lies the foundation of a real story with content that will change and make changes in the world. All you have to do is a bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the crap, or maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead. <br /> <br /> All I can say is when the movie ended, I got a free beer, so I'm glad I left, but I'm not very happy that I spent fifteen dollars on a ticket so I was told to shut up so that ask the director a question. World.
