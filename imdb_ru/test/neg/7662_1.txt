This last part of the Airport franchise was so terrible that it took me some time to realize that this is not really a comedy like Plane. George Kennedy, who fired a flare gun from an open window to divert rockets seeking heat, was ridiculous. What would happen to your hand if you kept it in the window at 2 speed? You would lose your grip on the weapon and get a broken arm. The passengers were unintentionally cheerful, as was the interior of the aircraft. The exquisite Frenchwoman going to the slobbering George Kennedy was like Jackie Kennedy going to Ernest Borgnine. Not going to happen Susan Blakely, a talented and undervalued actress, did not get any points in her resume for this. Robert Wagner too. This film was so lousy that it seemed surreal.
