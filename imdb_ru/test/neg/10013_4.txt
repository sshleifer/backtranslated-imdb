This is, of course, the average Italian post-apocalyptic view of the hunt / killing of people on the sports theme, aa, “The Most Dangerous Game”, “Shooting in Turkey”, “Gimmkata” and “Running Man”. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film reviewed here is far from being so good. It's funny, like the other recordings listed, and besides, it draws because of the poor voice acting at work, as a rule, serene sequences of actions, a number of completely tasteless scenes, such as a long sequence of rapes and some really silly and illogical moments everywhere. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the end of the film, when our hero manages to penetrate into the composition of the villains. First he kills the guard and leaves him in his jeep. On the detection of the specified corpse responded villains? (bearing in mind that our hero brutally killed them all) They decide to wait until the next morning to find the culprit (!!!!!!!!!!) <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I suppose to be fair, the film, however, remains watchable if you can suspend your disbelief during such silly scenes and brings immense benefit to the presence of the always-excellent Woody Ströde (even if his screen time is very limited). <br /> <br /> Not a classic for any imagination, but still about Worthy watches for Italian B-Movie enthusiasts.
