It was the worst movie I've ever seen. I have to admit that I didn’t watch it from start to finish, because cleaning the toilet was more interesting. <br /> <br /> “The Star” was the most unpleasant character I have ever seen, neither funny nor attractive, in fact, creepy and unpleasant are too complimentary. <br /> <br /> It is painful to watch, there is no acting skills, especially from the side of the star, which behaves like a frivolous, mentally unbalanced takeoff on one of these loud sounds. Mouth of black actors. <br /> <br /> How terrible to watch, as one of those who cannot shut up black actors, watching a Puerto Rican is even worse. <br /> <br /> The name of the film is descriptive, it is a pest. This movie should be missed.
