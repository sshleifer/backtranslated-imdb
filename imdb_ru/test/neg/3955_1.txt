In addition to Frankie Muniz's chatter, too quick to understand (Malcolm’s memories in the Middle?) not related. The plot of the plot: killing a ghost lures victims through a video game. Throw in a little spray of blood and special effects, and you get yourself another bomb, it will be a horror. Ghostly friends remind too much of the ghost in Ring Two. The acting and constant and dramatic change in everyone’s emotions is incredible. Save your money.
