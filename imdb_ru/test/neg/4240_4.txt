This show can be most accurately described as TV Bubble-Gum: it chews, has good taste and lasts a long time. But, like Bubble-Gum, it can leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth after a few too many chews. <br /> <br /> This show has very simple questions that take the form of simple games such as Hangman, guessing a simple phrase or guessing items in a short list. Subscribers are participants and everyone can play. <br /> <br /> The questions, however, are very simple. In the background, some techno music is pumped in, which is built in a continuous cycle. It seems he never gets old, but in any case he never adds much to the show. The hostess, however, no matter what, he is extremely personable, pleasant enough to watch and can make some very funny facial expressions. I like this Briton more. <br /> <br /> But this show is nothing. This is simplistic and unconvincing, although it can be interesting if absolutely nothing is included.
