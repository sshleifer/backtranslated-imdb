Well, if you like your monsters, dark, tough, starchy and insanely boring, but with a lot of choking, then head straight to Lady Frankenstein, a stately, lush Italian walking corpse. Joseph Cotten (“Citizen Kane”) himself plays the mercenary old baron, and he must really have had to pay the rent. Sexy Sarah Bay, who played in the cloudless European B-films, usually in the role of Rosabla Neri, including Hercules Against the People of the Moon, plays her ambitious daughter, a surgeon in a graduation gown with ruffles. Cotten makes an ugly monster with a big head (maybe it's really so much effort to do good ??), who immediately chokes Kotten (who took his test of royal power and ran), and wanders around, strangling everyone in sight. Tanya (Gulf) decides to switch the brain of her lover (who is old and wrinkled) to the brain of a young man (who is “handsome” but is stupid) so that an OTHER monster strangled the first monster that Cotten made Rove around strangling people. Well, after a long exposure and some suppression, the two monsters throttled each other a little, Tanya stabs the first monster in the back, and then has sex in the flaming ruins of her mansion with the second monster - just to strangle her! Doh There is so much choking that you almost still lose sight of the fact that the film is as exciting as a dead carp and moves just as fast. The alpha video version that I saw for this review was largely edited, and it is surprising that many ugly people were knocked out by a cow, not that it significantly improved the film. Director von Taymermer has previously led a multitude of class Z Euro assemblies, including Jungle Warriors, Isle of the Dead (like Mel Wells) and Crucified Girls of San Ramon. MooCow says you need to avoid this film corpse, and find something that moves to its fullest ... gas. <br /> <br />; = 8)
