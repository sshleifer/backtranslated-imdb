I have to say that this film was really terrible. acting was average, the pace of the film was terrible, as well as the soundtrack and cinematography. I found that I was bored in most parts of the film, and the cliches did not do anything for me. the two boys who played the main roles sometimes looked terrible and did not evoke the emotions that were necessary in the film. the little girl was creepy at times and looked like a doll that was scary. the final was not satisfactory, although the film, which was supposed to end, did not make me feel something for the characters. this film was boring and did nothing for me, I would not recommend this film to anyone.
