It is always interesting to watch a horror movie, having heard so much praise from other fans. Experience has taught me that you should never summarize the tastes of fans in the genre. My expectations for this film were much higher than my opinion. <br /> <br /> “Children should not play with dead things” is a film with a well thought out plot that works too many times to carry it out. I was intrigued by the whole idea that a group of actors would reanimate dead bodies. However, everything degenerated into cinematic chaos. Actors who were for the most part competent and strikingly expressive were offered roles that did not stand up to consistent characterization. Some of these characters move from ambivalence about the whole desecration of a cemetery, to frank criticism, and back to ambivalence. It’s one thing for the characters to change the heart during the film; this is another way to create an overly dynamic, circular relationship that repeats every ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Another controversial element of this film is the premise. Does the protagonist intend for the ceremony to be a theatrical joke, or is he really conspiring with the dark spiritual forces to resurrect the dead? Even with the above drawbacks, I would recommend this movie to other horror fans, since I believe that only true horror fans will appreciate the dark atmospheric components and will be able to ignore the inconsistency of the plot. The scene in which the dead rise from the grave becomes extremely haunting (even for experienced zombie enthusiasts) thanks to the excellent combination of scenery and sound, as well as the large selection of experienced actors chosen to play for the animated dead. Current directors should learn from CSPWDT about using the right video and audio technician in the development of mood. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are a modified zombie movie like me, you need time to find and watch this movie. This is a fun watch.
