I just finished watching Disappearances at AFI FEST 2006 with about 30 other people in the main hall for 1,000 seats. The programmer of the festival, having seen the lack of viewers, began his introductory comments: “Well, at least some of those present at the festival have good taste in the cinema”. Well, Mr. Programmer, after watching this movie I have to answer, "No, we do not, and neither do you!" This historic play of backwoods follows the young (not so) Wild Bill, as he and his mystical family dangerously smuggle illegal Canadian whiskey across the border during America’s ban. Old criminals (Chris Kristofferson and company) not only need money to save their dilapidated Vermont farm, but also want to acquaint little Wild Bill with the virtues of manhood. <br /> <br /> Despite the beautiful photography, this adventure story lacks what makes films of this kind good, "tense" and believable. Christofferson's poor rendition and dry monologue remind me of a dream I once had when Al Gore played the role of Willy Wonka. I just didn't care, and when the grandmother-grandmother of Wild Bills came out of the air to give him advice, she simply did not fit. Yes, I almost fell asleep more than once. <br /> <br /> Gary Farmer copes with the role of Cameron Frye as Ferris Bueller; Big Bill's son-in-law, while teenager Chris McDermott does use those piercing blue eyes for his acting advantage. <br /> <br /> But overall, expect to see Jay Cravens disappear in Block Buster for $ 2 near you.
