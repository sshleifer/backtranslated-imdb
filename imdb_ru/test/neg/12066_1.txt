A WARNING!!! SOME POSSIBLE SPOILERS OF THE PLOT AS IF IT IS POSSIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Well, if you haven’t dealt with the plot yet, I’ll give it to you. Two couples are sent to the campsite, but the killer appears in the mask of a clown and causes all sorts of unrest. <br /> <br /> Now it's time to give these couples some tips. <br /> <br /> 1. Never, never go to a camp that locals call camp blood. 2. Do not have sex and do not understand in front of the killer. 3. Do not chase the killer if he runs away. 4. Do not shout profanity on the killer. 5. Make sure your cell phone is working before you go camping. 6. Everyone should take a sharp or dangerous weapon with them and always carry it with them. 7. Wear loose and comfortable clothing and bring good sneakers. No tight fitting and obligatory clothes and no high heels or sandals. 8. Wear glasses or contact lenses if you need them, so as not to strike the wrong person. 9. Always carry car keys with you. 10. Put out the fire when you go to bed. 11. Watch your step. If you stumble over something, you will break a bone. 12. Check backseat for an unintended guess. 13. If the murderer has cornered you, at least make up. <br /> <br /> And guess what? At least one, but usually all four main characters violate all these rules of common sense. These are the most stupid characters that have ever been in a movie. <br /> <br /> Now for a few brief comments. This slasher film had a very limited budget. So low four of 7 or 8 actors play more than one role. Action, writing, direction, sound, lighting, camera work, drafting, editing, etc. are all at the bottom of the line. But, as is the case with the classic movie JACK O, it works very badly, it’s a very interesting and fun fun level. So rent it and have a good time and laugh. My rating: 5 out of 10.
