I turned it off in about 50 minutes! Whoever is an idiot, who decided to steal the idea of ​​the book by Koushan Takami (Battle Royal) and turn it into a script of a miserable reality show, deserves to be shot! <br /> <br /> This made the film industry a nice turn, although now directors like William Malone (Fear Dot Com) can say, "Well, at least it's better than in the 7th series." This piece of shit and Dracula 3000 tie for first place in the worst 100 films ever made! <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that this is not “So bad, this is good!”! <br /> <br /> It's a shame for filmmakers everywhere! <br /> <br /> Never watch this movie!
