I was wondering when anyone would try to turn this whole mess in Matamoros into Goriporn. In any case, here are a few things I learned about Mexico by watching this movie. <br /> <br /> ~ All Mexican women are very hot - remember that little deserted town in Undiscovered? Yes, it must be a sister city in Mexico. Do not even worry about prostitutes, just make a few smooth movements to the hot bartender. She will be as hot as a prostitute, and probably there will be no children either! <br /> <br /> ~ Half of Mexico is controlled by the insane Palo Mayombe cultists who worship Satan. Yes, karamba! The other half, as everyone here in the US knows, is controlled by drug dealers. Fortunately, this doesnâ€™t hinder the sex trade trade, and our factories have ultra-low wages there. <br /> <br /> ~ Mexican cops are useless. Do not go to them. Go to the nearest occult bookstore and ask the hot chick behind the counter what happened to your disappeared friend. It will be much more useful than the police. <br /> <br /> ~ When the aforementioned bloodthirsty cultists torment you severely, do not actually read psalms or any part of the Bible. You just mess up the mojo.
