If filmmakers / producers / publicists want to promote the film as “based on real events” and make a film that is meant to inspire and make sense, then, to maintain any kind of creditworthiness and honesty, you would like to keep the film as honest as possible. . <br /> <br /> The team, wearing all-black jumpers and doing hack in America, is just stupid. Any half intelligent person would know that "All Blacks" is a team of the National Rugby Union of New Zealand, and all their jumpers are black, and they perform hack as part of the traditional Maori dance. <br /> <br /> Having such nonsense in a film without explaining the reasons simply reduces the credibility of the film to zero and negates the message and inspiration that the film is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> Why? Why would you do such a stupid thing and for what possible benefit? <br /> <br /> I can only conclude that the writers, directors or producers saw it on TV before the match of the international rugby union and thought: “Wow, that would be great in our film, no one will know that this will never happened, they are too stupid to know about New Zealand and all blacks, it will be great. "<br /> <br /> How would the American audience act to respond to a film made in New Zealand about American Iron bars with a team dressed in American Indian costumes and military paint performing a military dance of Indian Indians running in circles with cries of "oh-oh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo." worth reading their heads. For some reason, the industry believes that they can "fool all people." <br /> <br /> This is just that is stupid!
