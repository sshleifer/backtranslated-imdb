Solo is a bad movie that can't be ignored. The acting is for the most part very wooden (the only exception is Adrien Brody's performance as the creator of Solo Bill), and the story is light enough for you to probably forget about it while watching the movie. However, such films are more about action than about plot / action and, as such, live or die with the help of film shooting scenes - which ultimately is the goal of such films - to give 14-year-old children something to smile while adults watch movies of real content. And even in this Solo can not cope with the tasks - little has been done, boring and boring. After watching the trailer on this on television, I was hoping for something like the Predator with the robot replacing the Predaot. Instead, I got a rather lifeless fighter with a poorly designed depth attempt, accepting a message that robots can also feel. Instead, look at Terminator II or Predator. Both classics that this film desperately wants to become, except that he lacks inspiration or, frankly, a budget.
