I sincerely wonder why this film was made. The Bulgarian-Italian co-production in the version of Berlin, where all Germans speak English with a German accent, and all Turks speak English with some Turkish words between them, is hardly credible. English vocabulary is basically limited to “fuck you, bastard,” and the game is worse than anyone can imagine. In addition, racial tensions in Germany can be an interesting topic, but in the Germany I know, there are no gangs shooting at each other in the middle of the street in bright daylight. And if all this is not enough, a serial killer also appears around, killing Turkish children and painting them white. To create some tension, we see a serial killer and hear him singing the lullaby of Schubert, but we will not see his face. <br /> <br /> I don’t even believe that they really shot it in Germany. In Berlin, there are several street shots that are clearly visible, but the actors are not visible in these shots. This is probably Bulgaria with some German signs added here and there.
