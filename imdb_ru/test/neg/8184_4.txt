I barely managed to watch the entire movie ... Only after about 85 minutes from 110 minutes of the movie began the journey to Mars, and then it was 5 minutes before closing. These 85 long minutes were VERY boring and contributed nothing to the film. When, finally, drove to Mars, the plot was not much better. All this could be entered in a much shorter time, and would not have missed anything. <br /> <br /> What I can’t understand is trivialities, saying that because of the film, newborn children were called “Aelita” ... Why would anyone want to name their child after a villain , despite the fact that he has only one eyebrow, obviously, there are 3 breasts ??? <br /> <br /> The only interesting thing is the sets and costumes for the Mars scene. This is an interesting experiment in constructivism, just like Dr. Caligari's Cabinet for Expressionism five years earlier. <br /> <br /> I give him 4/10 for a great looking design ...
