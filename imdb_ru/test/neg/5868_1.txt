This abomination and the continuation of "ONE MORE TIME" (no, thank you) and the disgusting calamities of Jerry Lewis, such as "DON'T LIFT THE BRIDGE, UNDERSTAND WATER (why not just rinse instead)," forced the cinema owners to close their doors and not to run these films, Truth: in the 60s, movie theaters continued to impose movie reservations in unhappy suburban and suburban theaters ... this means that in order to get a good movie, the cinema was forced to launch such horrible timestamps as these: I remember well how in 1974 I was fond of cinema Fiddler on the roof or something like that; I was saved at the United Artists box office by some puzzled salesman, who waved a sheet of failures in front of me and squinted: "Now, before we get to that let me see you. these first ". which basically means:" order these things, and we will give you a tired blow. "That's how and why so many cinemas were closed, forcing you to watch and annoy your diminishing audience with these setback failures with lame comedians and bored talent. Owners cinemas, tormented by disputes, simply closed, sold the filling station, and saw that the cinema was demolished. These days films of the same type (for example: "I NOW FEEL YOU A BELIEVE AND LARRI") are instead expelled into a 20-seat cinema 99 in mega-google-plex. Not so much oh changed. Freddie got fingers ... anyone?
