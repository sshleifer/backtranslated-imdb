This movie was terrible! Ashley Rose Orr, being a talented tap dancer and singer (actually a little better than Temple in terms of the latter), is a terrible actress. She plays the role of Shirley, which we saw on the screen in her films, whether she plays her on screen or offscreen. Thus, we get too cute and completely unreal (not to mention uninteresting) portrait. If someone wants to see this side of her, you can simply make one of her films. The only bright light here is the image of the Connie Britton Gertrude Temple. I don't think it was terribly realistic, but at least it worked well. Save yourself the trouble and rent a poor little rich girl.
