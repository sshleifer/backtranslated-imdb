I swear I did not want to! I chose this only because it looked good on the back! This film was not at all scary and in fact was very confusing. The demonic wind was actually only used a couple of times, and people were killed quite merrily. The only bright spot was how Sherry Bendorf from Slaterhouse played in it. Seeing what happened to her, I decided this little turkey from the movie. A 3 out of 10. NEXT!
