I watched this film with a group of Nazis, a French archaeologist and my ex-girlfriend on a small island in the Mediterranean. <br /> <br /> When the movie was launched, my girlfriend and I were tied to a wooden stake. at the far end of this cave-like area. I told her to close her eyes and no matter what happened, do not open them. The Nazis and the archaeologist did not close their eyes and after a few seconds began to scream. The Nazi faces melted, and the archaeologistâ€™s head exploded. <br /> <br /> After a few seconds, the camcorder jumped out of the VCR and landed back into the box, and the upper part closed. My friend and I remained unharmed. <br /> <br /> As a result of this experience, the videotape was placed in a wooden box and placed in a huge warehouse of identical wooden boxes so that they were never seen again.
