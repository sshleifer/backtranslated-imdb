I keep waiting for Peter Fonda to take action. For someone who comes from such a talented family, it’s a mystery to me why Peter Fonda can only play Peter Fonda trying to play someone else. And this is good news for this disappointing Dog from the Storm adaptation. A string of loosely connected ideas that only imply a relationship with the great game of Bard - this is what they gave us. The settlement is a civil war, and Prospero’s evil brother (here, Ginedona) looks like the villain of a melodrama of the 1890s, complete with Sneadley's mustache. I kept waiting for him to say, “Ha ha ha!” Which would be the culmination of this grim presentation. None of the actors was memorable, and the lack of self-expression and movement of the wooden body of Peter Fonda forced me to idle history. <br /> <br /> A storm is a statement by Bard about the anger of an unjust attitude of a person towards a person. The only plausible character was the Gator man, a colleague from Caliban. The transfer to the swamp had opportunities, but the situation of the Civil War simply failed. In general, a very disappointing production. I saw it on video and advised that if you want to fix Willie Shakespeare, save your money on this. Hire something else, for example, Bran Much or Much of Nothing, or Kevin Kline in Night Midsummer Night.
