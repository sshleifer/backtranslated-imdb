One Chinese gang attacks and destroys another gang at the beginning of the film. Unfortunately, the patriarch of the victorious family perishes. Oddly enough, and for no apparent reason, the gang asks the volunteer to blame the massacre, and he leaves until the police decide to stop the investigation. Now that ONE PERSON is responsible for 50 deaths is beyond me, so sending this one guy just seemed silly, but this is a conspiracy. Later, when this man came home, betrayals and intrigues occurred, leading to almost one hour and fifteen minutes of non-stop murder. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a martial arts film in China, the plot, then you should probably skip this film, since it is almost non-stop and has almost no plot or character development - even compared to other films about martial arts. I would appreciate that 80-90% of the film - the battle scenes - are endless and fairly well-made battle scenes using knives. Again, again and again, fight for the scenes! If you want a film with a number of victims, which can number in hundreds of people, when they are beaten, kicked and cut, then this film is for you. The problem was that by the end of the film there were literally no people left to kill, and the film really lost my interest !! Deeply it is not, but if you want to see ONLY excitement and action, then this film is for you! <br /> <br /> By the way, this film is set in the modern era, and no one thinks about shooting the hero until the end comes. And, when they FINALLY do logical things, it is already too late, and the efforts are really, very, very inappropriate! Logical errors like this, and the suicide of a woman (why ???) make this film like “turn off your brain”.
