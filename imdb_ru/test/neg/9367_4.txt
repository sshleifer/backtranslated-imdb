I gave this presentation 4 stars. They are all for the script, which was scored beyond recognition in some places. What can I say? They took one of the best plays written in the last century, and methodically robbed her heart, humor and humanity. I don't really blame the actors, who are probably trying their best with a crappy direction and unfinished characters (because the very finished characters on the stage version have their insides - and the ideas - are torn out) I blame the director very much trying to find ways to subvert the script. In this television film there are so many awkward pauses, awkwardly reassigned moments and awkwardly overestimated readings of lines that sometimes I forget that I love this play. I am not one of those people who think that brilliant plays are automatically inferior in the film (just the opposite), but this particular brilliant piece was extremely underestimated by this output. Now I hope they make * a real * movie from this play. The world deserves it.
