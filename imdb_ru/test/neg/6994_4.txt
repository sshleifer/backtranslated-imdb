This short Harold Lloyd was not very; not one of his ridiculous efforts. Of course, I never see stupid children as anything fun. This is the main part of this story, Harold and his wife, Mildred Davis, looking after their relatives with two young children. One is a child who constantly cries, and the other is a four-year horror that does everything except the destruction of the house. To allow the child to create chaos again and again, I was not interested. <br /> <br /> The best part - the last four or five minutes, when the couple thinks that this big jerk (Noah Young) is robbing their house. Half the time is a domestic cat, a frightening couple, but in general, this segment is fun with some good sights, reminding me of another short film Lloyd, "Ghostly Ghosts." <br /> <br /> However, a good ending does not save the whole picture, which I probably would not have looked anymore. Lloyd did too many good things to spend another 25 minutes. It's just not funny.
