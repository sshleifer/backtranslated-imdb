Leonard Rossiter and Francis de la Tour carry this film, not without a fight, as the script was apparently hastily forged from old episodes. When it came out, it must have been quite a disappointment, as it was also done on the budget for the bus ticket. Attempts to take him out of the house - which is completely unrecognizable, bad work everywhere - with a picnic, fantasy episodes, rugby and a boxing match at the local gym simply do not work. Most of them are just setting a character for a lonely and not particularly good gag. However, the interaction of Rossiter and de la Tour (and any other with him) is mostly ridiculous; they even manage to get the carbonated siphon gag to work, but you can see the fight against recycling the literally boring script that changes the plot halfway through. Don Warrington has little to do except to be black, and because of the accidental hacking of the script, Christopher Stroly changes the character at least twice. And in the end, as he often did in TV shows (although you may not remember - read the scripts), Eric Chappell brings you to the end of “time is up”. Were they so cynical or just desperate to be in the movie business? Rossiter and de la Tour are always funny, but, like a movie, this is a terrible postscript to your favorite series. REST IN PEACE.
