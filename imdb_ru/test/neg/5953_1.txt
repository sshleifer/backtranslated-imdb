Awful, Awful, Awful show. The problems of the "real world" concerned outrageous lack of originality. Stereotypes are abundant. What the hell is going on with the brows of African-American (black!) Guys? The power of Tyrone! Awful, Awful, Awful, Awful, Awful show. The fact that it lasted three seasons, I can not believe. This show is truly indifferent for those who died in the brain. <br /> <br /> Compared to this, the preserved Bell seemed ridiculous to me. Well, if you look back, no. It is just as trite, and therefore equally devoid of intelligence. The only thing that is still missing is the message of Jesus GOD. The mentality and liberation are the same, but still somehow feel evil and callousness. You can almost hear the television executives say each other fashionable words. In fact, I was so furious with this show of the existence of excrement that I was forced to comment. <br /> <br /> Awful, Awful, Awful show.
