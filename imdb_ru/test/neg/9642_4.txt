Too many actions, strong hands, a lot of speeches, preaching on the nose and excessive styling in such a way that only MTV can be guilty, Stop-Loss - this is propaganda garbage. I expected much more from talented young actors such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Phillip, but the screenwriter / director Kimberly Pierce does an excellent job of portraying the disastrous consequences of the war for American youth. I am sure that she has done some work exploring the war in Iraq and the young people fighting in it, but you will never guess about it by watching the Stop-Loss. In many ways, this mess reminded me of Dogtown Lords Catherine Hardwicke, an equally inept, overly stylized, television-like waste of solid things. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
