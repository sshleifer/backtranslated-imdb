First of all, I think the actors and actors were excellent. The problem is in history. There is practically no story to tell, and therefore there is no film. Larry McMurtry made Lone Pigeon, and I can't blame the original for this, although he probably didn't need to continue. He made a hud with Paul Newman, which is one of my favorite films. Mellencamp must be a country singer, but the only song I hear as he sings is the old song by Buck Owens. The film is of great importance for the poultry industry. The character of Mellencamp has a good wife, and from his side it is completely silly to deviate from her. The sliding-cell skating incident is completely stupid. Maybe people do it for fun in some parts of the country, but I have never heard of it.
