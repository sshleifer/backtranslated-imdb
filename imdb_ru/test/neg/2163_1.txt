The Cyber ​​Zone, since this DVD was sold to Oz, is the worst B-Grade trash I've ever seen. In addition to the restrained, imperturbable act of Singer, indicating that he knew how bad the film would be, other actors extolled genuine attempts at delivering the film (Swanson and Career) or absurd imitations of scenes from classic films. Matius Hughes portrays the most dying fist since the days of Jim Carrey Mask. All this, without any real idea of ​​proposing a fake attempt by genre, period, or any common vein is simply annoying. Don't even try to connect the dots with the plot. This is Blade Runner, thinly disguised without content, actors or scenery due to a very limited budget. “You get what you pay for” is never more obvious. The repeated use of limited sets, without regard to the scenery and a number of special effects that could hit the floor of the cutting room for Dr. Who in 1976, is annoying. The helicopter blast is worth rewinding to demonstrate my point. Of course, there are masochists who will stop this deception, but if you watch this movie for a bet, make sure you get more than your bet. For 2 dollars this DVD will make a cheap and interesting stand for beer.
