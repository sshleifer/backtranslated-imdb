The gates to hell opened near Moscow. The priest, played by Vincent Gallo, goes to the city to find a friend who disappeared in the tunnels under the city in an attempt to find the gate. Wandering around the dungeon, he and his colleagues have to deal with the inhabitants of the tunnels, both human and demonic. A good idea with a good cast of second-tier actors is nowhere similar to the tunnels in which it is located. I have already watched it twice, and still do not understand why it should be scary when nothing happens, except what people say about evil and we see shadows. Nothing is clear and, to be honest, I do not see the point in this, except to provide a receipt for payment for those involved who are exposed as in the film.) The idea is really good, the performances are in order, the script goes nowhere. Use the advice of several characters in the film and do not cross the river to see it.
