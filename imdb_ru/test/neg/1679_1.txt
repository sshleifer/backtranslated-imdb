I still have to watch the first entry in this series, however, fortunately, I was still able to trace the complex and confusing plot with all its unexpected twists, and I applaud them for the originality of the concepts presented here. In case there is confusion, let me not doubt that everything I have just said is covered with pure, carefully carried sarcasm that thrives and grows exponentially when such nonsense is exposed. A clear sign that this is not impressive is that it was directed by the creator of visual effects, whose only credit in this area is the Henry Rucker film, which was not well received. Acting is, at best, average, and I challenge someone not to find ... Russian Scottish computer geek (well, seriously, what's with this last name?) Russian accent is ridiculous and / or annoying. This is an attempt or two attempts to stylize, and they are reasonable. The action is not terrible. Cinematography and editing is fine. The music is pretty cool. Language infrequent, even if it is. The violence is pretty bloody. I recommend it exclusively to fans of B-films, and I will say that you can make it worse than that. 1/10
