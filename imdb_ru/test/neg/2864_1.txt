Approximately one step above the movie about the Olsen twins, there is nothing surprising, except for how disgusting the bloated, hunchy Depardieu, walking along the beach without a shirt, looks disgusting. Was this guy supposed to be a kind of heartthrob? Quasimodo Hubb Hubb? Well, whatever it is. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is a great actress, whose career over the past few years has shown great potential as a comedy and drama actress, but this film certainly did not help to offer her a breakthrough role. Her helpless character has no trace of individuality or self-esteem, spending all her holidays trying to fall in love with a cute boy, whom she considers the greatest guy in the world (mainly because he is a cute boy), but she cannot be honest with him for two seconds. Ladies, let me tell you something; if a guy is really in love with you, he is not going to trample, because you tried to pass off your father as your boyfriend. He may be a little embarrassed about why you are doing something so stupid, contrived and ... cold-blooded, but in the end it will be something you will laugh about together. <br /> <br /> The plot and dialogue amazes every cliché right on the cue. No originality and no wit ... but it’s elegant, sophisticated, SWEET and amazing, amazingly sweet from Ben, so viewers who consider Titanic to be the greatest movie ever made will say that this movie is great because they will not notice that he does not. there is a brain in his head. One star
