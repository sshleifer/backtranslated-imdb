Fred Williamson, one of two or three main stars of black exploitation. Cynthia Rothrock, one of two or three of the best American female gunmen. Imagine a movie with these two together for the first time! Now imagine the worst movie that can be made with these two together for the first time. Welcome to Night Vision. Of course, this film was made in 1997, and both of them survived their best times, but this does not mean that they no longer had what they needed - they just needed good writing and directing. They got neither here. Rothrock can really throw a couple of punches near the end, but this film is so awful that you probably wonâ€™t wake up to see them. (*)
