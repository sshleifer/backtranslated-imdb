Well, let's start with the fact that if a Dutch film is bad, then it is REALLY BAD. Rarely, something with little quality is found (Lek, Character) here in Holland, but not often. Costa! About 4 girls go to Spain to go on vacation, to a party, get drunk, meet (you know the training). This is also about the world of Clubbers or Proppers. Pros who are trying to lure the crowd into their club. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how long it took to write the script, but I suspect that it's somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes, because you watch a bunch of random scenes of 90 minutes. Nothing, and I mean that in this film there is nothing believable. For words, it's almost too funny what happens to the plot. Suddenly the film turns into something like karate. With the help of a one-on-one battle with the “bad guy in black” and a cliche where you can see scenes of a chase through a car with a water tank (maybe it's more stupid). In addition, the words "character development" and "casting" are unfamiliar to the creators. <br /> <br /> After a three-day preview of “Road Traffic,” I fell from pure brilliance, from the work of art to this. This is filmmaking at its most sad. And do not start with a low budget. Because even with a small budget you could write a better script. It seems that the filmmakers were too busy throwing parties to make a decent movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, the chickens made up a little in the water, but otherwise, don’t waste your money on such garbage.
