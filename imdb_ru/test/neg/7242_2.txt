The Salen incident occurred in Arizona, where six prisoners sentenced to death are transferred from the state prison for unknown reasons, and the passage on a heavily armed prison bus gets an apartment, and the driver is forced to leave the road. Then two blonde-haired birds appear, and after the seduction of incompetent prison guards manages to defeat them, six prisoners are released, but as a result of the shootout of their escape, the car is damaged, leaving them all in the center of the Arizona desert. They decide to go to the closest city, Salenu, a few miles away, and take the policemen hostage. When they reach Salena, they find it strange that this place is completely deserted, and no other person is in sight. Soon they discover that the whole city was killed by flesh-eating aliens, and they are firmly on the menu ... <br /> <br /> On DVD, also known as "Alien Invasion in Arizona" in the US, and obviously having the working title “City of Horrors” is this junk low-cost sci-fi horror film, created in conjunction with the director and director Dustin Rickert, and having no real possibilities for its redemption. The film can be divided into two parts: the first forty or more than fifty minutes focus on prisoners in a drop-down thriller, on guard and on escape, although these are rather poorly written and staged things. The dialogue between the two blond birds and the prison guards is so bad that it is unintentionally amusing, since two suitable birds are discussing two not very suitable prison guards. Funny, in fact, unfortunately, The Salena Incident is a science fiction horror film, not a comedy. Then, when escaped opponents and their hostages from the prison guards arrive at Salena, he enters a science fiction horror mode, when aliens appear and start killing our cliches, which is good because they are annoying. Look, the whole movie sucks because it is poorly written, thought out and made. In fact, I can not understand why, but believe me, the Salena Incident is terrible at all levels. <br /> <br /> Besides being just a bad, boring and stupid film, the Salen incident is also poorly made, the scenes are terrible, the aliens look terrible and never appear on the screen at the same time as the human character, and therefore it is sometimes difficult to say what is happening. The special effects are also bad, the aliens look like garbage, and the computer effects of CGI are absolutely terrible. Editing leaves much to be desired, cinematography leaves much to be desired, sets are cheap, and everything is really just an eyesore. There is some blood here, there are gunshot wounds, someone has ripped in half and the severed arm is visible. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the shot is due to the small budget. The incident in Salena has low production figures and looks cheap from the very beginning to the End. Photographed in Superior in Arizona. The acting is terrible from anyone I've ever heard of, although the actress who plays the female doctor looks very good. <br /> <br /> “Salen's Incident” is a junk sci-fi horror film that is terrible just about every way, not worth 90 minutes of your, my or someone else's time.
