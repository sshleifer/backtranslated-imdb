Eh. I watch this movie in class because someone recorded it on tape and brought it. I expected an indecisive attempt to portray the myths about Hercules, and since the commercials looked serious to him, I expected something that would be half decent. <br /> After ten minutes of the movie, I realized that it was an honest crepe. The only things in the film that are half true to the myth are the bare (and I mean the bare) minimum. Parents, stepbrother and childbirth seemed to be named correctly. In addition, the rest of the film seemed like a giant inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> I would say that this is not much better than the Disney version of the film. The Disney version was made for small children, so it wasnâ€™t too serious. This film, with all the sex, violence and nudity, was clearly intended for an older audience, but the story presented in it was almost inaccurate, like a Disney movie.
