Now I like Johnny Vegas, which is a good start, I also enjoy the humor in the toilet. <br /> <br /> Such as Young Ones, Bottom, etc. However, this could not even cause a small smile on my face. The story tells about Johnny after his wife <br /> <br /> kicks him out (he doesn't get his good looking wife and child) <br /> <br /> when he tries to fuck everything what's moving. Crash is fine. I was looking forward to it, but I found that it was completely boring and a waste of my time. If you are not stuck on something that needs to be done within 90 minutes, except to wash the car, do not worry ..... <br /> <br />
