The couple broke up during the holidays. Early scenes lead us to believe that Barney, the character of Jeff Bridges, kidnapped the girl in an inexplicable, but deliberate abduction. The film is released a few years later, where, despite the new love interest, Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland) is determined to reveal his disappearance. <br /> <br /> The storyline is definitely intriguing, but during it really bad decisions were made. the creation of this film, the culmination of a rather meager piece of work. <br /> <br /> OK, here we go. The abduction scene - in addition to two major mistakes in continuity, there is a moment when Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland arrange a small ritual with a signature about love for animals, which drowned in excessive sentimentality, even nausea. We know that they are in love; “I solemnly swear that I will never leave you,” it was only a few minutes before that, thank you. Jeff Bridges' robot accent is another example. What is this for? Starman is back and it seems that after a decade on the planet he became nasty. The whole plot can then be solved by introducing an unnecessary character who, thanks to a rather fortunate twist of fate, has absolutely amazing observational abilities. The climatic sequence itself was made earlier, only much, much better. This is permeated with further irritations and another blind error of continuity. I could go on, but I need to say something positive. Kiefer Sutherland - one of the few who saved the face with a fairly decent performance. <br /> <br /> The original 1988 with the same name was recommended (for an English-speaking audience it was changed from the Dutch name Spoorloos). me, just for the online rental company to send me this later Hollywood version by mistake. I was surprised to find that both were directors George Sluizer, and I would be interested to learn his motives for the remake. I am reliably and fortunately informed that it is of much higher quality in all areas, including the site. The choir is for this, but it really doesn't take long.
