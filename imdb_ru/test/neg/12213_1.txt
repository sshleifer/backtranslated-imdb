I am an atheist, not very fond of certain aspects of Christian fundamentalism. <br /> <br /> However, this film is reprehensible, vile and transparent. It only works on the currently fashionable (and weary) motive of hatred for white American Christian fundamentalism. If this film were made about a fundamentalist Jewish or Muslim family, or even a black Christian family, this would be a tangible anger, and the film would be heavily criticized in all circles. However, in its current form, everything is “good” and “cunning”, because white Christian fundamentalists remain one of the last “acceptable” targets for garbage, such as this one. <br /> <br /> And this is true. If you want to watch a high-quality film with a similar bias, find and watch or view “Badlands”. Nothing good was done in The King, which was not better than decades ago in this masterful film. <br /> <br /> As noted by other reviewers, in the “King” characters are almost not fully developed, drowsiness, cinematography is dull. We have seen how the story of the sociopath has improved 100 times. This film is not suitable for thoughtful viewers.
