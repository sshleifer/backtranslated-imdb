If you were in Eastern Europe (or even in their armed forces), this film may seem interesting to you. I donâ€™t know why this is a comedy (of course, there are some funny moments), but this is not a very good movie if one of the officers is 15 minutes talking about the achievements of socialism at the Christmas dinner, and the officers generally behave like funny jerks , the soldiers run through the base to meet their girls at night, and, to surprise, surprise, one of the girls is the daughter of the commander. The East German Army was known for its insulting and demeaning service to its servicemen, and the comedy was mostly not filmed on objects or equipment to make a good film about the East German Army, and their time passed. Despite this, some actors and actresses tried to play well, but this manifested itself only in roles known to them on East German television and in some small films. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, it was mostly boring and very cheap.
