I can't remember the last time I was terribly disappointed with any movie. Probably, I expected too much (in a sense, you can expect action in movies in the style of dogma). But here, just nothing happens. Fortunately, I watched it at home and could switch channels whenever silence and stupid / dumb faces started killing me. And it was very often! In fact, it is not very pleasant to watch ugly people who do not speak or move slowly, stroke pigs and kiss French men, not to mention ugly bodies that have obvious sex. If only it made any sense ... the whole murder situation is ridiculous; It seems that it was created only to show another vagina, since zero characters can really solve the crime. Having only four pseudo-developed characters and a worthless film, it soon becomes apparent who the director chose to be the killer. And this also does not make sense. Despite all the boredom and suffering, I must admit that this somehow affected me in an inexplicable way. Maybe you should check it yourself, although I do not recommend it.
