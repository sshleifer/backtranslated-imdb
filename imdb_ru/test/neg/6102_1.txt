Obviously, the director, the writers and all the others do not know anything about their religion or the people who practice it. This film is infinitely flawed and in general is a complete monster. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a scene where a rabbi enters a woman’s ritual bath while a naked woman bathes, puts her hand on the woman’s head. there blesses her. This is a complete mockery of the laws, only in this scene some of the violated laws include: Modesty: a rabbi will never enter a ritual bath while she has a woman in her. <br /> <br /> Wrong contact, a rabbi would never put his hand on a woman’s head, not to mention that this is not how a blessing is given. <br /> <br /> A woman from a ritual bath is smearing a naked woman, pushing her head under the water. Ritual bathing laws require that the whole body have direct contact with the water in the bath; This means that no one should be in contact with the person who washes, and certainly not push it under him! <br /> <br /> In this scene alone there was something more, for example, a 13-fold immersion in water (where did this concept come from?) to mention that the rest of the film was a complete mistake. It is terrible that ignorance can come up!
