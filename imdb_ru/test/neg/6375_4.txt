Don't get me wrong, the guy is a Dynamo success, but he reached the top by selling plastic toys with inflated prices to impulsive kids. Therefore, I am a little annoyed when he looks at comic book fans as an expansion of the same market. <br /> <br /> You see, “The Invincible Iron Man” would not be bad if he went out on Saturday morning. and focused exclusively on illegible children. But it is not aimed solely at children. Peripheral characters are killed every five minutes, and bloodshed and half-naked bodies are enough to make network censors wriggle, so it is not quite suitable for children's television. <br /> <br /> So what kind of audience does this video target? then? This is an audience that enjoys almost understandable storylines about the revival of the tyrannical Chinese emperor with 5 secret rings, that's who. And I think that this audience is very small. <br /> <br /> Many great writers have been through skinny Yoni Marvel over the decades. Therefore, it is a shame that Marvel would risk its expensive investment in animation on so many dubious storytellers and scribes, who, like Mr. Arad, are better accustomed to trade in figures during Saturday morning cartoons. How many warm tricks should Marvel endure before coming up with a better strategy? <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> Animation: just passable cells, some segments are better than others, low-budget appearance in everything is not Bakshi (Ralph) and this is not Blut (Don)! CG animation is fine, but far from impressive. <br /> <br /> The plot: a lot of cliches, everywhere, intricate, invented and boring. <br /> <br /> Characters: so why is Rhodes even here, if all he does is add to Stark's sexual ambiguity? Hmmm ... her dad is in a wheelchair ... Tony misses her mom ... Asian chicks are hot and, apparently, some more; the main character is completely objectified by the end of the function. <br /> <br /> Performances: you can not blame the competent actors dubbing in a bad scenario. <br /> <br /> Art: very Western musculature, very clean lines, faces very derived from oriental art, very dull matte, very soft CG. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: not really, but worth a look for fans and those who love superhero myths. Mandatory purchase for collectors. Valuable course "What not to do" for younger animators.
