Hungary cannot make good films. Fact. This is a great example of this. <br /> <br /> First of all, the term “plot” does not exist in this film. This is seriously weak. Even many people will argue with me about it. Of course, it's about taboo, but that's all. There are endless possibilities that could be really good if they were used, but they almost all missed. I think the whole movie is just a reason to show pictures that are the only worthy things in this whole horror pile. <br /> <br /> Acting is just shitty. There are not so many lines here, so you might think that the actors have great facial expressions or imitating abilities, but no. In fact, 86% of the time they suck. And then they say nothing. If they say just one word, you will begin to bow your head, saying, "This is damn unreal." But, again, this is partly the fault of writing. Most conversations also have no emotions. <br /> <br /> Editing is sometimes good, but in most cases it is illogical and simply worsens the whole picture. This could give an emotional boost, but it seems that editing here is the imposition of cuts on each other. <br /> <br /> Someone please explain to me why critics say that this film is a masterpiece. Calling it "Art" will not do it better. Sorry, Mundrucho, but you could not. Live with it. Even if you probably will not care about my boyfriend or any other opinion that degrades your "child."
