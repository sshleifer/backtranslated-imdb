The only reason I give the second star is the first half of the film. It was a good performance story. I like to see a few fictional characters who add color to a famous story. But the second half was terrible !!! Yes, there were violent aspects of this story. But the authors of this film decided to turn on the violence and forget about the good that God did for the Israelites. At the end of the film, Scott looked as if he was receiving messages from a big giant head instead of speaking and hearing from God. In this version there were HUGE problems with deviation from the Scriptures. And a big surprise, there are no favorable deviations! Their image of Moses as that screaming naked madman who did all this against his will is completely false. This showed Moses, who had to shout to make God talk to him. WRONG The Scripture says that God spoke to Moses all the time, not just after hysteria. They understood correctly that people were complaining, but they could not show that God spoke to Moses in Sinai in an audible voice that followers could hear and believe (Chapter 19). They also forgot the pillar of fire and cloud, which they guided day and night. <br /> <br /> What was this Jesus? Righteous peace-loving Jew who will not fight until Moses threatens him? WRONG (He was known as a great warrior) How about the great speech that Moses gave in the army, telling them that God had helped them enough, and now they were left alone? WRONG (They won only thanks to God's help, as shown in their own scenes with Moses raising their staff). And what was that sad looking Ark of the Covenant? Instead of covering it with gold, this film was on a limited budget and attached small gold pieces to it! Oh yes, it was a “melted calf”, not a straw one, with small chips attached. Someone forgot that they came out of Egypt with a huge amount of golden tribute from the Egyptians. You will not know about this from this sad looking group. By the way, the part about how they kill Israelis after the incident with the golden calf says “men” and does not mention women and children, about whom the film is happy to show the audience. Oh yes - Manna was not the only thing sent from heaven - do not forget the birds for the meat. In addition, the Bible mentions that Jethro led Moses with his wife and children, and then said that Jethro returned to his land. It does not say that Moses abandoned his family. <br /> <br /> Well, if you don’t know anything about the real story, read Exodus for yourself. If you know the real story, you will hate this version.
