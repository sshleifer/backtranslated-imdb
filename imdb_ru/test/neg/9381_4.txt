Despite the fact that he is supposedly autobiographical, this film demonstrates very little understanding of both the psychology of the main character (leading to a flat, fragmentary characterization) and large-scale historical processes, and my hope is either to learn something new or to improve my understanding of modern Iran. remained unfulfilled. Instead, I found that my feelings were a little dull, as a series of bearded Islamic villains replaced each other with ridicule, torture, or murder of senselessly affected prototypes of middle-class Iranians, whose Western cultural sympathies were obvious (and whose release from responsibility the film is clearly looking for). Understanding what the film truly demonstrates seems to be an understanding of the media market, since it serves to support the prevailing Western folk ideologies (that is, “the crowd rejoicing”). <br /> <br /> The fact that the film has been bought from frankly boring was caused by its creative animation - truly minimalistic images, which, nevertheless, always kept the screen rich, expressive and unequivocal - a considerable celebration, for which I give it a few stars
