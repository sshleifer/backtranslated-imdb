I would have to agree with the previous reviewer: this film has amazing animations, but has problems in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Huge holes in the plot, the dialogue barely explains the concept of the plot-- THE MAIN POINTS OF PARTICIPATION are not even fully explained until the last five minutes of the film. The characters state the obvious, but cannot explain the more intricate moments of the film. There are characters that pop up and matter in the storyline, which are never explained - most of them have names that are mentioned only * once *, and this is extremely confusing to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Donâ€™t waste your time with this movie. Unless you want to laugh at it and do not like it.
