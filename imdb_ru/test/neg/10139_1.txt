Without a doubt, Reba is one of the worst comedy series. I wonder why people write good comments on the Rebbe ... You watch Friends, Married with Children, Fraser, if you laugh at this, you can never laugh at silly jokes and ridiculous accent of trying to get into the comedy and, obviously, has no chance at all. The actors / actresses around Reba are fine, so I feel bad because they are stuck in a so-called comedy show with the least funny people in the world (Reba). To summarize, I suggest this TV show to see how low comedy can be achieved and appreciate those who can make you laugh.
