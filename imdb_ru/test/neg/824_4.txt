If you compare the two films with Sasha Cohen, Borat and Ali Ji, then Ali Ji is immeasurably better. I'm not a masterpiece, but at least it's a movie. Borat is a complete rubbish, and I don’t understand how he rated better than Ali G. <br /> <br /> I cannot understand that there is something wrong with Ali G’s script: half the jokes seem to have been written for 15 years, not a screenwriter for adults. And a number of jokes, including Mr. Cohen's lower body, are pretty tasteless. <br /> <br /> But the film is actually a comedy, and there are some funny jokes, such as, for example, how Ali Ji becomes a member of the government for doing something scandalous and stupid in public in modern Western society: people get a career for doing stupid things in public), as well as Ali's advice on immigrant policies and some others. <br /> <br /> Ali G as a whole remains a sympathetic character, although he is a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age. But it's normal to watch, it's pretty funny. <br /> <br /> But never watch Borat, it's terrible and sick of every intelligent movie lover.
