Konrad Radzoff (Ferdi Maine), the iconic icon of Hammy, dies of a heart disease (not earlier than getting rid of the ungrateful assistant and director of television advertising, who both did not respect his insults). Some students of the film shoot his body from the mausoleum (they want to “invite him to dinner” ... they are quite big fans). What these children (including the young Jeffrey Combs) don’t expect is that Radzoff will be resurrected by the medium to harm those who have removed him from the resting place. <br /> <br /> The Violent List includes Radzoff, tearing out the language of one guy, setting a woman on fire, raising a coffin that crushes a woman’s face, decapitates one guy and cremates the other guy alive in a coffin. A really weird soundtrack and nasty fog envelop Radzoff's nasty actions. <br /> <br /> The stupid hokum from Troma is limited to a very, very low budget and a slow pace. The film feels much longer than it is. The film is actually not so scary, and we are unlikely to see much violence, because the film is often too damn dark. Sometimes Radzoff is an ominous presence, but sometimes he just looks silly.
