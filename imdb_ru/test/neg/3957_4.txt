A group of teenagers discovers the bootleg video game, but as soon as they start playing it, everyone starts dying just like in a video game. As they become addicted to the game, they need to find a way to defeat the main villain of the game, the Countess of Blood, before she kills them all. <br /> <br /> The premise seems a bit silly and familiar, but this film could still be a little interesting. However, this horror film is not at all terrible. Actually, it's more comedy than anything else. The film takes itself too seriously, and watching the film is not very fun. Of course, there is an occasional laugh, but for the most part the film is very boring. PG-13 horror films can still be good, like The Ring or Cry Wolf. “The Ring” and “Stay Alive” are not exactly the same horror movie. “Lost” is rather a slasher film, and since its PG-13 rating, the death scenes are very boring. This was supposed to be the main selling of the film, and since he had an interesting concept, the deaths could be really good. Unfortunately, the studio needed a large audience, and the film had to be redone. <br /> <br /> The acting game is a complete joke, and most of the actors give terrible performances. John Foster is not a very good lead man. He lacks the charisma to really attract the audience or take care of him. His character is not unpleasant, just very soft. Samaer Armstrong actually gives good results, although it is too soft to really stand out. Frankie Muniz probably gives the best performance at Stay Alive. It is an honor to be the best player in the Houston Texans. Sophia Bush is absolutely terrible, like October. Her performance seems so hurried and so false. The most annoying character in the film is Phineas, played by Jimmy Simpson. His character is so unpleasant that you will root for him to die. <br /> <br /> In fact, most of the characters are pretty unattractive, so it’s even harder to get interested in the movie. It's just a pity for some of these annoying children, and it’s much more interesting to watch if you want the characters to really survive. The only good thing about the movie is the atmosphere. He's a bit old, but he still works. The film is also very short, so it's not too hard to worry. I would not blame the actors because they worked with an inexperienced director and writer. The direction is not very good, and the script is not much better. “Lost” is actually not the worst horror movie of 2006. This honor would go to "When a stranger calls." Staying alive is still a missed opportunity though. In the end, this cheesy and sloppy horror film is best left on the shelf. Rating 4/10.
