To begin with, the script is imitative and meaningless. The characters are small and formal. The plot has arbitrary turns and not sequestrators. Baldwin's direction is terrible - these actors could do better on their own. Jokes and wise men are not successful. Shooting scenes are clumsy and incredible. Baldwin directs himself as a wise, courageous hero, but most of his time he spends in the struggle for power with women, especially with the caricatured repressed woman in their tunnel team, who always asks and denies confidence. The conductor suffers from absurd incompetence, being unable to effectively use the gun he found. Anomalies: a hooded man, spewed by a weapon, walks along a railway carriage, striking people. The next time we see them, they will go about their business, sitting in their seats, talking, eating, reading, knitting. In the New York subway, people sometimes come to the train to record some kind of musical or dramatic number - maybe this is what they thought it was.
