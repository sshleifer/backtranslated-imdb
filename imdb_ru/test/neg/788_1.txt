quite possibly, one of (if not the most) worst film ever conceived, played and played in the history of cinema. Who on God's green land would ever think of playing Cameron Diaz and James Mardsen in a pair? She was like his mother. God, forgive me, but I'm just being honest. And it was the smallest of many problems plaguing this terrible excuse for a film. It was a terrible statement against women, but at least if you are going to blame women for world problems, tell a decent story, not one with so many annoying hinges and pathetic excuses for anxiety and thrill. Everyone should get their money back, who went to watch them in cinemas or bought a DVD.
