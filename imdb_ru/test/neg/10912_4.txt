Kujё is a gigantic, sweet, affectionate and affectionate St. Bernard, belonging to the Camber family, during his debut sequence Kujё chases a rabbit through the fields and through the local forest somewhere in Castle Rock, Maine. The rabbit disappears into the burrow, and Kujоo shoves his head into the entrance hole. The rabbit disappears from Kujo's sight, an evil Kujo begins to bark and involuntarily wakes up and annoys a colony of bats, one of which bites his nose. Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace-Stone as Dee Wallace) has an affair with Steve Kemp (Christopher Stone, Dee Wallace's real husband), who was discovered by her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh Kelly), working in advertising. Obviously their relationship becomes strained. Happily ignoring all this, their little son Ted (Danny Pintauro). Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) repairs cars to live in his barn at his farmhouse. Joe plans to spend the weekend with one of his friends Gary Pervier (Mills Watson), when his wife Charity (Cayulani Lee) wins $ 5,000 in the lottery and decides to take with her little boy Brett (Billy Jane as Billy Jacobi) to see her parents. Arriving at Gary's house to pick him up, Joe finds him dead on the floor, he goes to the kitchen to call for help, and his dog Kujё, who is now madly attacking and killing him. Donna and Ted drive to Camber’s house to try to fix her car. This is a deserted place, with the exception of Kuj, who is now completely mad, foams in his mouth, his fur is covered with red blood and makes him sick with pain. Cujo attacks the car to try to get to Donna and Ted, fortunately for them, the windows remain solid, at least for a while. Donna is trying to start the car, but she broke down completely, they both were trapped only with the hope that someone would come and save them. Kuj лежит lies waiting, ready to attack and kill anyone who crosses his path. Directed by Lewis Tig, I thought the film was a bit slow for my tastes. The first half is moving forward, the second half is gaining momentum, but I still felt that it was a bit disappointing and uninteresting. With the acting, everything is in order, I have no complaints. Technically, everything is fine with the film, photography, music, special effects, editing and everything is fine. The big problem is the screenplay of Don Carlos Daneaway and Lauren Carrier, and in particular its first half, much of which seems to be filled to extend the lead time. The time under the 90 minutes mark seemed longer. This is also a bit predictable. Kuho, as a monster, never scared me, I just do not find St. Bernards frightening overweight, I think. I suppose there is nothing bad in this, but I do not think that I will rush to see it again. Average, not so bad if you can find a cheap copy or catch it on TV for free.
