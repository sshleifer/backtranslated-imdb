These rubber monsters could not be cool, scary, or even comedians, look like a movie about the imitators of Porkis or Animal House, but the episodes and the story are not always clear and can not attract your attention, all films look cheap and with surprisingly bad taste, the only thing makes you laugh - these are terrible rubber monsters, the cost of which should be one dollar each, because the work or they never look realistic, movements and expressions make the dolls look like a Pixar 3D movie when compared to this one. I hope that Marie Carlton is the only thing that supports this horrible film, and when she dies in a film, it gets worse than before. The film that you need to watch only in accelerated mode.
