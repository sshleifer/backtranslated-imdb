Some learned people somehow descend into a cave, and some creature kills them. <br /> <br /> I usually give a more detailed story, but I did not pay much attention to it. In general, it was boring, and the only moment you really pay attention to is during the fighting scenes in which the director did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> The cast is fine, but the characters are so boring and forgettable, they mix in your mind. You will forget who lived and who died for 2 reasons: 1. Murders are boring 2. Characters are boring. <br /> <br /> The ending could shock me more if I knew who is who. <Br /> <br /> So, are you looking for a movie about cave creatures? Check Descent instead.
