In addition to the fact that Skylar is a complete bag for a shower, and its disadvantages are unimaginable, its schemes require a lot of preparation to justify any fraud. Without giving away any spoilers (as if it matters with this piece of shit), its disadvantages are so deceptive, because it takes efforts of days and days of planning, as well as the use of several accomplices and the entire film crew, etc. Only for fraud to a service that will cost less than a hundred dollars ..... besides, if you read in credits, they overestimate some of the telephone calls, etc., because they do not work ... The whole concept of this show is a bunk, because all its minuses have a cost like in a team, t Ak and ten times higher than the actual cost of the service, which he tries to get for free ... what a fraud?
