Being? Yes, this is the film in which he is shooting. Hell would seem infinitely more frightening if the damned were forced to watch it forever. Six college students sit in a convicted hospital to save money and end up being the victims of an ancient monster who must demand five victims before he returns to the “dark world he came from!” Besides serious problems with logic and consistency (plus the fact that it seems to be incomplete), this disaster is terribly played out, written, edited (JR Bookwalter) and directed, and FX makeup almost does not exist. It is also significantly shorter than stated (only 80 minutes), but I'm not complaining. This is the worst film I've ever seen with producer Charles Bend in the movies "Full Moon", and the boy - "BAD"! <br /> <br /> We note that I hardly bothered about the review, but he received inexplicably good reviews here, and I decided that different opinions were in order. Act with caution!
