This movie made me laugh so hard. It was a bloody joke to tell you the truth. Such an incredible and worst story in the whole story. The game was also bad. I do not know how so many popular Bollywood actors and actresses took up this film. The script must have been a bit of a joke. The visual effects in this film were painfully painful to watch. I believe that a child from kindergarten could better cope with the visual effect, and a monkey could better prepare the plot. <br /> <br /> The plot has many attempts to copy major Hollywood movies. like the Terminator, but he fails. I laughed when I saw this movie. A complete disaster in the history of Indian cinema!
