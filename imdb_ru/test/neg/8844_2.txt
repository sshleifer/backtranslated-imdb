I watched this movie and thought it was asleep. Sometimes I can get into intelligent romantic movies. This film just did not touch me. I felt that it was about an hour too long. Camilla is portrayed as a very responsive sculptor who loses almost everything. I thought the whole movie was just sad and dejected. If you like tragedies, you CAN like this. I just thought it was too long, which means that there are a lot of unnecessary scenes in it, which eventually lead to one hour of boredom. I would not recommend this movie. If you want to see a good romantic tragedy, go watch “Titanic”.
