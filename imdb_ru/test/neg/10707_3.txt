... but had to see how bad it could be. The initial line was thin, but it got worse. A female genetic engineering student uses her accelerated mitosis research to artificially create a man, because biological weapons used in World War III killed 97% of the male population worldwide. The surviving men are either giants with high prices in the back streets of clubs or crazy lunatic at football stadiums planning to overthrow the Lesbian Conspiracy. The whole process was like a microwave jelly bowl. Click a few buttons and get the baby. Not only that, but it will age until the mid-20s in a month, and then it will begin to age normally (as far as is convenient). In the end, poor Adam gets bored in a secluded hut in the woods, where his creator raised him and hijacked her car to “see the city.” <br /> <br /> Begins 90 minutes of incredible chases, convenient plot twists and a few scenes that we never see solved. How Adam quickly finds out that men who survive are considered to be outcasts / criminals because they are dangerous animals that cannot help genetic predisposition to violence. Propaganda machines were in full swing, scaring women, forcing them to believe that all men are rapists and murderers. This led to the fact that lesbianism became the norm, the fall of Christianity, the reproduction of women only through cloning, and, yes, world peace, among other implied results. All this seems unlikely, considering that only ~ 30 years have passed since the war. Adam stumbles from one bad situation to another, all the while being genetically programmed to be non-violent and unable to really do much on his own behalf. On his way to the FBI, Madame in search of fresh meat and its creator, trying to catch him (it seems for himself), he learns that violence is not limited to the male species after all. <br /> <br /> All In All, I would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> However, I really liked the picture of Veronica Cartwrights with the “love to hate her” director of the FBI, and Julie Bowen didn’t handle the Hope so badly. Hetero wardrobe geneticist too.
