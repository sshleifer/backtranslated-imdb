Ten years ago I really wanted to watch this movie in a movie. But I missed it, and then I forgot about it. Oh, boy, I'm glad that this film didn't spoil my teen eyes. <br /> <br /> I saw him yesterday, and seriously, this must be among the 10 worst films ever made. And I'm talking about films that have received too much attention, such as these great trailers on TV, and too much money spent on actors and making a film. <br /> <br /> Script sucks and acting Sucks, even worse, do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> Please, Hollywood, NO MORE ARNOLD !!
