This is the worst work of Daniel Day Lewis in the entire history ..... I can't believe that in the same year he shot this horrible film and My left leg ..... Please stay away from this film ... this film only for Argentines as curiosity ... the plot is impossible to understand ...... The writer believes that in Argentines all people speak English ... Of course, Patagonia brings very good frames for shooting a film, but this is not a sufficient reason for see this movie .... I repeat only if you really like Daniel Day Lewis or if you want see the south of Argentina, part of Patagonia, and you do not have enough money for an independent trip .......
