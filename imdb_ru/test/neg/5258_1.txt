I haven't seen such a horrible movie for a long time. I hoped that at least Adam Sandler could be funny ... hopeless. It seems that some teenager wrote the script, and dad pushed him so far away that someone agreed to take it off. (Cinema) The world could have been better without it, whatever it was.
