During the first trip of Humphrey Bogart to Hollywood, he received his first role as the main character in this film “Love”. The first thing you need to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic love story later in the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunn or the two subsequent remakes. This is not twice as good as any of these films. <br /> <br /> In fact, Bodji the second is billed to Dorothy McKail as a spoiled heiress who finds out that she lives her extravagant life thanks to her late father’s best friend and financial advisor Hale Hamilton. For McKale, it's a shock. She considers a career in show business as a way to generate income. <br /> <br /> Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer, is developing the latest aviation engine and is looking for investors. McKale is ready to do this, and besides, she likes what she sees in "Bogey." <br /> <br /> Given the cynical roles that Bogart later made a specialty, it is a little embarrassing that he perceives him as this highly moral and self-satisfied hero. in a love affair. It does not look good on him. <br /> <br /> Love Affair is the second feature of your average program, there’s nothing wrong with that.
