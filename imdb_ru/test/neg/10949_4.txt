Concept: show 4 families of different nationalities in the Fairfax area of ​​Louisiana, preparing for a family meeting on Thanksgiving Day. I loved "Soul Food" and "How to make an American quilt" (I think there is a law that Alfre Woodard should have in all of these films), who also offered a party to family traditions and was prepared for fun. Instead, I felt deceived. They recruit about 40+ characters, and all but two are clichés with one note, without grace. Script writers and directors should spend another few years learning about life and finding out how loving people of different generations really are connected. Instead, you have a bunch of ** holes gathering together on Turkey Day to act as very unpleasant a ** holes. Now, to some extent, that's what thanksgiving is all about. But this is not a mistake. And why bother to have Julianne Margiles, then she had absolutely nothing to do. It was hard work, and Mercedes Ruehl is an outstanding player, but I give it 4/10.
