Well, you know ... Rutger Hauer and Robert Patrick are both really good actors. But WTF with this movie? The story was unsuccessful, and the script - just awful. Poor actors didn't have material to work with! <br /> <br /> DVD cover invited you to the set. You expect something like Top Gun ... Great disappointment! The flight action in this movie is so cheap that it makes you sick. Aerial scenes are clearly taken from documentaries and some other material shot for this film. And they did not even care about the brands or models of the fighters, taking for granted the public would not notice this. <br /> <br /> As I said, the story was unsuccessful. With a little effort from the author and the director, this could be very interesting. In short, it looks like a B-movie filmed in the 70s. <br /> <br /> I am very sorry for these actors who have posted their names here. They should be ashamed.
