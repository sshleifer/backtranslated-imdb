This is literally "Three Puppets" again, without charm. This show is nothing but the worst farce. I'm surprised they really have writers. The so-called jokes are completely random and "contradictory" for nothing else but the very (very) difficult to be controversial. And people think it is “spicy” ?? Get a hint: this show requires absolutely no thoughts, time, effort, money or creativity / originality. Any links available are for people aged 6-16 who periodically review People magazine. But I believe that this is just what all the children want, as they need today.
