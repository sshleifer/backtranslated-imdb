Before I saw this masterpiece, I never would have thought that a destructive and terribly infectious virus can be defeated with the help of Lutheran prayers ... and "erb". Ralph Möller’s spectacular performance; Realism glowing. I was so inspired that tomorrow I fly straight to Zambibwe to destroy pesto and gather my hands for prosperity in the third world. God bless this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I’ll have to watch Troll 2 and Anus Magillicutty to believe that you can come up with a more mediocre dialogue. It is so painful that it is better to take a cheese grader on knuckles than to sit through it. The only subtlety that he manages to achieve lies in her thinly disguised racism, because the poor islanders resort to an ineffective stupid collective prayer that does not achieve anything until übermenschlich, enveloped in flax, Teutonic hero Möller, with his straight line Yahweh, cannot provide a blood sample , through which scientists, Yankees, scientists can get a job and save the unfortunate Aborigines. This movie sucks.
