Skeletons In The Closet takes the genre of a teenage father to a new low level. This is a film that does not make sense. The plot is laid out in the first few minutes, there is no waiting, the characters are cliche, and, despite the plot twists that are trying to confuse and confuse, everything unfolds exactly as you think. In the middle of the movie, I could no longer withstand the snails and began to fast forward. The film ended exactly as I expected. Linda Hamilton, as always, is gorgeous, and the rest of the actors are above average, considering that there seems to be a complete lack of direction. If you really believe that you need to see this boring, dull imitator, look her in front.
