Despite all the hype around the movie, this film left me alone. I was expecting a much better film, given the inclusion of talents Murphy, De Niro and Rousseau, but I found that the film had broken out of my face. The comedy episodes were exaggerated, and the excellent performances of the stars, especially De Niro and Rousseau, could not save this film!
