iCarly talks about a teenage girl named Carly Shea (Miranda Cosgrove) who lives with her brother artist Spencer in the attic in Seattle. Carly has a web show that collects millions of views and makes a lot of money a year, so much money, that she "doesn't even know how much it really is." Her best friend is Sam (Janette McCrudy), who is as predictable as they are! She says “normal” things and beats up Carly's neighbor, Freddie, who is responsible for all the technical stuff for their web show. Carly screams every word and looks like she has no emotions. Sam pursues Freddie and Freddie screams. In one of the episodes, Carly and her friends shot Libert (the doorman) in an elevator, and he survived. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it, unless you like to scream teenagers, offend people and make fun of things.
