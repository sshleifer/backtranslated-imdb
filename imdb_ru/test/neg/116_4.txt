A date with a stranger (Columbia Pictures, 1934) was a good movie, but I have a few problems with this movie. First of all, I donâ€™t blame the actors in this film at all, but more or less I have a problem with the script. In addition, I understand that this film was shot in the 1930s, and people sought to escape reality, but the script made the character Anne Sauterne look weak. She kept going back and forth between the bridegrooms, and I felt that she had to stay with Paul Kelly's character at the end. He really cared for her and her family and would have done everything for her, and he did it, leaving her in the end to persuade Neil Hamilton, who, in my opinion, was only absent for a good time. The character of Paul Kelly, although the workaholic was a man of honesty and genuinely loved Kitty (Ann Stern), not Neil Hamilton, although she really liked him, I did not see the depth of the love he felt for her character. Production figures were great, but the script might require a bit of work.
