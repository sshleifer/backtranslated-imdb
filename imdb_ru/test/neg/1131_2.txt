It will be a really blue Christmas if you put your family under this. I liked the original film, and this one is not worthy of being a sequel. In fact, in essence, this is not its continuation. Only one character from the original cast returns. Of course, this character turned out to be Eddie's fun cousin, but he was just not cheerful, being the main character of the film. His niche is a stupid relative who performs crazy antics - along with Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase was needed in this film so that he would succeed, and he was definitely not there. As far as I understand, the film is not the film “Vacation,” unless the helm is good, good, Clark Griswold
