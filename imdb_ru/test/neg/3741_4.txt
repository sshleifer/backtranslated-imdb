Much praise has been given to Farscape, but I do not think it is that good. It certainly has a distinctive look, but it lacks almost everything else: history, purpose, direction, excitement; You name it. I'm a big fan of science fiction, and I find it necessary to watch all the sci-fi shows that I can. I’ve almost finished four seasons with Farscape, and at the moment I’m not very happy. The show does have some good things - especially Claudia Black (which, unfortunately, is missing in the first few episodes of the fourth season) - but there are very few of them and they are very far from that. In general, the show is overshadowed by a lot of very stupid things (such as elements of Fantasy, and not SF ditto), and many other episodes, especially. in season four, they are incredibly dirty and poorly structured. And you just feel that this is not going anywhere. Basically, these are simply non-directional adventures with thin, long storylines that painstakingly develop slowly. Well, sometimes it's a little tougher, but it only lasts a few episodes at a time. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of effects, there is something impressive, in some places (especially in space, from time to time), but the show seems stuck in the same style of effects, which, frankly, quickly gets old. The monstrous and unconvincing alien aliens spoil the show a lot, and I preferred (certainly) episodes in which the focus is on ordinary human-like characters. <br /> <br /> I think that peacekeepers are by far the most stylish and intriguing and interesting figures on the show; they manage to be a convincingly alien culture, despite their common human appearance. There are some really cool episodes with them, especially. in the first season (IIRC), where Crichton disguised as Captain Peacemaker, and invades and eventually destroys one of his secret bases. Such episodes can reach a rating of 8 out of 10, but I can not award the show as a whole more than the rating "4". <br /> <br /> Aside from the peacekeepers (who are too focused by themselves) totalitarian and militaristic to be truly nuanced, the show simply offers nothing important or significant that you need to know or want to see. OTOH, it contains some good ideas and is not a complete loss. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is only my opinion, but, as an experienced fan of fiction, I think it means something and can be useful to others. There aren't many good science fiction shows out there; but Star Trek (any series) and especially the new Battlestar Galactica are definitely better than Farscape. But if you're a big fan of mediocre science fiction shows, you might also like Farscape. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4 out of 10.
