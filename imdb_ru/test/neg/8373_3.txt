Maybe we Australians have a completely different sense of humor, and this is my lie — the only problem here. I have a database of all the DVDs I own (including received as gifts - what it was), and therefore when I enter a new one, I always turn to IMDb for such information as genre, lead time, director, leads and t D. At the entrance I noticed that it was a comedy, and decided to watch it at a time when I wanted something light and good laugh. Well, it was neither one nor the other! There was absolutely no laughter at all and an excessive amount of gratuitous profanity (are there REALLY radio broadcasters allowed to broadcast the dirt that Steve Jones gives out? What if a decent child accidentally tuned into his station?). > <br /> Instead of just laughing (or even laughing a little), I found it very depressing. I gave it 3 out of 10, but honestly, I don't know what these 3 are for! I suppose the basics of lighting and sound were not so bad! <br /> <br /> We have an alleged loser (Giovanni Ribisi) who seems to still drive a reasonable car (who pays for fuel?) and live in some nice apartment (who pays rent?) Given the possibility of forming some meaningful relationship with what turned out to be a good girl, he even cut it off! Perhaps it was she (Lynn Collins) who earned 3 points in this film! The fact that she works as a stripper and not as a hairdresser is one of the few aspects of this film that makes sense (“I do it in one night, doing as much as two weeks haircut”). <br /> <br /> If you do not want to get depressed and bored to the teeth, forget it!
