I really didn't care about that. If they got rid of the comedy / farce and focused on the dramatic / philosophical aspects of the script, it might be worth it. <br /> <br /> The more the film went on, the less I liked the main character / postman, He has interesting things, but he is also a hypocritical, insecure fool. <br /> <br /> 3/10
