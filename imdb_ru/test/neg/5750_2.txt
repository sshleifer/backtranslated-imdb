Well, now that all the friends and relatives of the director and producer have published their reviews, having seen it at various festivals, I think it’s time to show reviews written by people who actually paid 10 bucks to see it. <br /> <As in the film directed by Dear Jessie (the only one of his films I’ve seen), Battle for the Head suffers from a lack of attention and too many ideas crammed into the indie budget. I swear this guy might be more lucky doing the miniseries. I continued to wait until the various subject threads come together, but they are intercepted only at points that are clearly shaded in a way that is obvious to everyone except the densest viewer. It was like watching a season of films for life, made for television, squeezed into one long (I would say SEVERAL) sketch on the old Carol Burnett show. Perhaps an adventurous male fan might take his girlfriend to see it, and then exclaim, "Hey ... remember all the chicks we went to last year ... one about the adoptive mother ... one about the gay boyfriend ... one about a Christian housewife. Last year we went to THREE Chick Flix; so now we have to go to Terminator 4! “I think you need to do something to play a familiar actor in order to receive funding, but what about what Bonnie Hunt does in this film? She's not exactly known as a dramatic actress, and this attempt at the“ performance ”will not send Mr. Oscar to her door. I mean (speaking of “Phantom Original Films”), wasn't Valerie Bertinelli or Fara Fawcett available? Miss Hunt always seemed cold to me, maybe she should have played another mom? I wish I chose " Capote "to fill out your weekly indie allowance gay theme ... well, maybe next week. I think there is a good reason why Capote plays in tons of theaters all over the New York area, and this one plays only one thing; Let distributors believe in this film and make sure that it moves in the opposite direction if you do not trust this review!
