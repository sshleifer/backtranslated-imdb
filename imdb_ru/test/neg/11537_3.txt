“The Warrior Princess” is a sci-fi thriller with a rather subtle plot - essentially, about the death of their queen mother, two sisters, one evil and one good, in the struggle for control over the throne. A good sister is beaten, so she runs off to Earth, where she is naked in a strip club in the middle of a wet t-shirt contest. The rest of the film is basically one long chase scene, as the evil sister is trying to find and kill the younger good sister. But the younger sister is helped by Bob, a kind-hearted DJ, and everything is complicated by the involvement of the police and the ignorance of the good sister of Earth’s customs and culture. The older sister catches up with the younger brother several times, but the latter manages to escape and flee again. Throughout this action on the home planet, there is a cult of women who arrange a certain space age to bring the good sister back. Unfortunately, a good part of this film seems to be pretty boring car chase scenes as they drive around Los Angeles (and what was the sound effect when the police car crashed ???) The film ends with another physical struggle between the sisters with a predictable ending. . <br /> <br /> It seems that he borrows elements from Star Wars (light sabers and the appearance of the girls ’native planet in the first and subsequent scenes), Dr. Who (telephone booth as a means of transportation) and some costumes (from the cult on the home planet) could be taken from the Star Trek episodes. <br /> <br /> Ms. Dana Fredstie (the evil sister in the film) in another user comment mentioned the “endless (and boring) wet t-shirt contest. This is seriously the longest wet t-shirt competition in film history. And the only one where the contestants were wearing industrial-strength cotton-polyester shirts that challenged all attempts to make them moist and translucent. ” I could not say it better. The only thing I would like to add is that the music in this scene is simply annoying. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting is pretty cool, but it looks like it fits the entire style of the movie. The actors playing Winnie and Vito were too much for me - I just found them annoying. Miss Fredstey (Curetta) seemed to enjoy herself and not take it all too seriously, unlike Sharon Lee Jones, who acted decently, but seemed to take everything more seriously. All the policemen were portrayed as clumsy idiots, presumably to add comic relief, which is a bit unnecessary, given that the whole movie was rather comical. <br /> <br /> In terms of ratings, there was a lot of foul language in this film; some women are topless and others are poorly dressed in thongs, but not enough skin to satisfy those who seek nudity; one sexual scene that was depicted in a non-graphic, elaborate, fairytale manner; and slight violence — while there were threats of violence everywhere, the scenes of both sword fighting and fighting were exaggerated, and too lager to be “offensive”, although it seemed to the actors to be very fun. <br /> <br /> I wonder who came up with the names of the characters? Ovum (small egg), curette (surgical instrument used for scraping and cleaning), eczema (suspiciously similar to a disease characterized by skin scaling and itching), boulemia (eating disorder with overeating and blowing) and rickettsia (another disease)? <br /> <br /> In general, this is a bad, low-budget, obscene, sci-fi thriller, but it entertained me, although I might have needed a little drink before re-watching it.
