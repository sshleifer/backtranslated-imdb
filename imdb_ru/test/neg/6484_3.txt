Royal Rumble 1988 I am very bored. The rumble itself is pretty casual, filled with middle carders and a winner who really had no sense in winning, and why the main event The Young Stallions Vs The Islanders? half the crowd was gone. Jesse Ventura sounds boring, despite half, and you can tell when he mentions that he considers the development of Hogan Vs Andre more interesting. McMahon and Ventura don't know the chemistry of the Gorilla and Jesse. <br /> <br /> Ricky Steamboat against the delightful Rick Rude. A very disappointing match, with too many rest breaks and too slow a pace, will flood this one. When in the last 5 minutes he rises like crazy, it is too little, too late. Steamboat wins DQ. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Next Dino Bravo is trying to set a new bench press record, Ventura notices him. Horrible segment, without any entertainment value. Ventura is not enough to carry this segment, and even McMahon admitted that it was boring. Dispute or not, I spent enough time on this nonsense. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> Women's Team Championship WWF. <br /> <br /> 2 of 3 falls. <br /> <br /> The Glamor Girls | C | / W Jimmy Hart. Against the Angels Jumping Bombs. This is the best match of the night, no, I'm not joking! Very exciting things for female wrestling, and it will be difficult for you to find such good things, these are days. The Angels jumped the bomb far behind, and the crowd tried hard to win the title. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Signing a contract between Hulk Hogan and Andre Giant. Hogan gets decent popularity, but there are several notable bu for him, probably because it is in Canada. In my opinion, too stretched, but it was necessary for the plot. He had his own point of view, and there were some effective points, but in many cases I continued to say: “Keep up the good work.” Both sign, and Andre slams Hogan on the table with his head and pushes the table on it. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Royal Rumble Match. Very weak Royal Rumble, probably because of the awkward pace and the true lack of stellar power. I think Vince tested the waters with this, and it showed. Ventura seems disinterested, and I do not blame him. The crowd clearly wanted Roberts to win, shouting DDT almost every 5 minutes during which he was there, and although Duggan gained good popularity, I do not believe that he was the winner they wanted, and where did this lead him to his career? Nowhere. Bret is the first in the history of Royal Rumble, and he made an impressive showing. It was not terrible, but it was rather dim, and it was not enough to make the show, given that this was what the show was based on. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Hogan has an interview with Craig De George. Hulkster’s standard interview, but not with the same craziness and outrageous remarks that he usually draws. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Ted and Andre are interviewed. Andre claims that he will deliver the championship to Mr. Dibias. Short but effective. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> 2 of 3 waterfalls. <br /> <br /> Islanders against young stallions. The crowd is completely dead for this, and half of them have fled to the exit. It's pretty boring, and there was no business in the main event. Jesse and Vince seem bored and argue about other things during the match. The islanders win because they took advantage of Roma's injury. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Total. I believe it is historically important, but there really is nothing to see. This was just the starting point for great upcoming events for The Royal Rumble, and although you can see glimpses of potential here, there is nothing here, going out of your way to see. I usually recommend it all once for Die Hard Wrestling fans, and given that this is the 1st Royal Rumble tournament, I suppose that I, too, but prepare to miss most of the time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
