The first 20 minutes were a little funny, because I don’t think I saw such a bad movie before {game, script, effects (!), Etc.}}} It seemed that the remaining work time was delayed forever every cliche in the dialogue is being used to no avail. These people did not seem to like horror films very much or the way they were shot, or any other film. There is no language for adults, a little brief nudity and blood, except for false blood, spread over open wounds, etc. This would be appreciated by PG in the early eighties and PG-13 these days. I'm not sure how he got the R rating or whether he really got it. I saw a release of American International called the Hospital of Terror. I have seen 100 horror films in the past 12 months, and this is probably the worst film I've ever seen. Here is an example of how bad it is: there is one scene where something green penetrates the door. I'm not sure that it should be, but what’s on the screen is some kind of childish scribble of a green pencil (I’m not exaggerating) superimposed on the film, half moving inside the door, and then it has to do something to I believe nurse Sherry will take possession of her. I could not believe that they lacked pride to show this embarrassment.
