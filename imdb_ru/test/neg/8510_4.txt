Without a doubt, Rampling is gorgeous - a classic beauty, very young here. She manages to seem both sophisticated and sharp. Her two male foils behave well too. But seen in 2003, the film is all that tries to show itself skilful, not Hollywood, while shooting beautiful French. Riviera-and-three-beautiful-young-people-in-their-cute-old-ka I liked the look (both actors and nature), but the film is boring and pretentious, trying to be opposite.
