The Tender Hook, or, Who Killed the Australian Film Industry? Case number 278. This is an excuse to justify the historical drama, which takes the cast and the idea with the potential of Rose Byrne, Pia Miranda, Hugo Weaving in the gangster drama of the jazz era ?? and turns it into a casual pace and a sleepy one. Makhit (Weaving) - boxing promoter, gangster and functioning illiterate; for no apparent reason, he sang Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen songs before fights. Like postmodern. So silly. Anyway. There is a boxer Art (Matthew Le Nevez), who becomes the last protégé of Makhit because of his, unfortunately, the native groom Albi (Luke Carroll). <br /> <br /> Goldheaded Machith Iris (Byrne) looks at Gu-Gu in the eye. his. Sexual tension is pressing the surface. Miranda plays Daisy, girlfriend Iris (these flower girls stick together), which continues to appear in scenes without warning. They dance together and talk with guys about how to "communicate". In the 1920s. I stopped counting anachronisms after that. There is a story with the participation of Japanese beer and the background of fishermen from Broome. I do not know what this is all about. For some reason, which is not quite (generally) explained, Byrne puts cocaine in Arta lemonade. Makhit thinks he is drunk and dismisses him. Byrne plots and schemes to help him again. She is great for conspiracy and intrigue. Most of which causes problems. The two Huns of Makhit, the pompous Ronnie (John Batchelor) and the Russian Donnie (Tyler Coppin) argue, pushing Makhit when he realizes their role in one of the Iris schemes, but Ronnie faints when he sees Makhit crying. Many almost incoherent scenes are on the way to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Ogilvy spends a lot of time working with cinematographer Jeffrey Simpson, creating some pretty shots, but completely unable to create a sense of style that could compensate and beautify the pathetic, pitiful script; Unfortunately, the sense of Ogilvy's cinematic grammar, the lack of scene structuring and exposure, is strikingly incompetent. In the early scene, Daisy suddenly appears in a car with the main characters. The way she got there and who she really seems to have escaped Ogilvy’s thoughts. There are many more examples of this negligence. Where he pursues poetic rarity, he achieves only mild irritation. He gets clumsy performances from actors who are usually reliable, badly mistaken. Weaving and relying on Byrne's ability to design a kind of haunted mankind, while at the same time burdening her with an incomprehensible character. <br /> <br /> This may not matter. In many ways, if the story contained more significant characters and stronger plots, preferably not stolen from a dozen old films about noir and not decorated with meaninglessly scribbled quotes from popular culture. But it is not. It's boring.
