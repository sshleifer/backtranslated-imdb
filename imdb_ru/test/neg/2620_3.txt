Now I really do not like this movie. This is one of the most boring horror films of the 90s, mainly because it starts slowly and in the middle of a boring atmosphere. The settings are not even attractive to the eyes and do not correspond to the purpose of the film. <br /> <br /> Dolls look very funny, not quite as in the films of the Master of the 80s. What have they done with our favorite toys ?! <br /> <br /> The story is unconvincing, uninteresting and NEVER explains the ominous origin of the puppets. There are no scenes of death, as in previous films, and the railway is awful. <br /> <br /> When I first looked at it, I fell asleep, so I can recommend it for insomnia.
