At first glance, I should say already, see The Contractor, 2007. With Wesley Snipes too. The best action movie with a more dramatic plot. <br /> <br /> Detonator has a terrible story focusing on some kind of atomic bomb installed in Romania, and with horrible directing for an action movie - there are no exciting moments, and the fighter turns into boredom. <br /> <br /> Really, what do you expect from Wesley Snipes when he is offered terrible scenarios like this? Do not blame him, he needs money. <br /> <br /> This was the first impression when I watched a movie 3 years ago. But I will not see it again for nothing. Screw it. It sucks. There. I said it. <br /> <br /> PS: I don’t think I ever said “this movie sucks” in the IMDb review. Thank you, Detonator!
