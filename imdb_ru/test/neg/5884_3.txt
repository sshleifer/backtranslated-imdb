The name is not true: the film shows only one year of the so-called "divine Marquis". It was a difficult time for him because he was threatened with a guillotine: the quiet joys of the reign of terror. <br /> <br /> Historically, the background is rather sketchy: “The Feast of Love”, Robespierre's unsuccessful attempt to create a secular religion, his fall, heaven sent an opportunity to show Dr. Guillotin’s sinister car at work (full speed). <br /> <br /> As for Shade, this is a completely mediocre matter: he is waiting in the former convent with other noblemen for a gold cage, if we compare it with, say, Marie-Antoinette or a scientist. The fate of Lavoisier, and he exchanges useless conversations with the young virgin about death, love and other trifles. This is a mandatory “cheeky” scene, but you have to be patient, because it’s still a long time before it appears on the screen. By today's standards, can we call it risky? "De Sade" by Sai Enfield, who has one of the lowest IMDb ratings, is at least interesting, and Keir Dullea was more trustworthy marquis than the aging Auteuil. And John Houston participated in it.
