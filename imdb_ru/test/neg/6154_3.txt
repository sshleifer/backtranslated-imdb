Yeeee-haa! <br /> <br /> I have seen, it is claimed, that most American films are camouflaged cowboy films; that Hollywood is so in love with its truly original creation that it continues to reinvent the cowboy myth. I'm not sure that I fully agree with this argument, but Slipstream is evidence to support the theory; This is a cowboy movie with airplanes. <br /> <br /> In fact, everything goes for the better. This is Spagetti Western with airplanes! Replace the planes for horses, make the android a priest, and this film will be indistinguishable from any of the dozen of the Italian Spanish semi-arts of "shooting with claims" of the seventies. The film is not as bad as it seemed to me in some of the reviews that I read here, but it was definitely not good.
