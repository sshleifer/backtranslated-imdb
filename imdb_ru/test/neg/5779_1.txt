Saw it in the preview yesterday and have to say it was awful. After the credits, I thought, “Hi, with this cast it will probably be pretty good.” It did not work out. <br /> <br /> Lame predictable moans, terribly simply drawn characters (perhaps, with the exception of little Miss Lara) and the final, which can be foreseen in the film in 10 minutes. And worst of all, he incorrectly used the delicate topic (people with disabilities) for low-level and mostly tasteless jokes, without affecting anything but the surface of the question. The person with disabilities who is most sympathetic to the film is the one who just pretends. What is this message? And the film has no well thought-out ending at all, it basically comes down to: “I love you, no matter that you acted like an injection”. <br /> <br /> To sum up: The great cast, who must have missed so much, to subscribe to the horrible movie.
