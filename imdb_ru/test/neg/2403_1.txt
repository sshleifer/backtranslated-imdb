Russians have never thrown children's toys filled with explosives over Afghanistan, which has never happened !!! Who made it? Hollywood portrays the Russian army as terrible, terrible evil troops! It's disgusting! United States President Jimmy Carter agreed that “Soviet aggression” cannot be considered an isolated event of limited geographic significance, but should be viewed as a potential threat to the Gulf region. The uncertain scale of Moscow’s ultimate goal in its sudden fall to the south made the American share in independent Pakistan even more important. Landmines caused great damage to civilian children.
