I found this to be an extremely disappointing version of a charming story. I thought the acting was generally pretty good. Reginald Owen really chewed the scenery, as others have mentioned, but I found him in my short scenes quite amusing. TCM made me an Anne Harding fan, and I thought she was fine, as usual. Jesse Ralph had a field day as an old battle ax, which he ordered to everyone around, and Frank Morgan, as always, played Frank Morgan brilliantly. <br /> <br /> For me, the problem was the script and / or editing - the transitions were awkward, the motivation was muddy. The film was too damn short to convey the story correctly! I felt completely disappointed, especially because I had such pleasant memories of a later version.
