Now, I love bad old Scythian movies just like most people. And I understand that the budget is a budget. However, Planet Dinosaur is as bad as a bad movie can get. This thing has no actors, and there is only one attractive woman whom they kill two minutes after swimming on the beach. In this pile of lost celluloid there are literally no redemptive qualities. The only thing that was not wasted was paper ... the script should have been no more than four pages. Surely no one really wrote this dialogue is meaningless. I am constantly amazed that such films have ever been made, let alone released. I'm just glad I didn't pay to see this waste of time. This is 75 minutes of my life, I will never come back.
