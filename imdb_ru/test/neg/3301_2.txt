I have been living in Istanbul for 24 years, and I (39 years experience would have suggested) really know what Istanbul has been through all these years. <br /> <br /> Vera Akin is still quite young (born in 1973) and falling into the great mistake of being an orientalist when she looked at Turkey (as well as his other film “Gegen di Vand”) Distribution of Istanbul. <br /> <br /> Anyone who can speak Turkish can easily testify that many underground bands and groups depicted in the film (for example, Siyasiyabend) SO MIRACLE and their members cannot even speak the correct language, which they cannot be accepted as "representatives" of modern Turkish music. Much less shit, which many Turkish students do not even know. <br /> <br /> We, the Turks, have long been accustomed to the "superfluous" Western people who look at Turkey from some eastern point of view: trying to fit the actual Turkish image into their minds. New in this film is the fact that now the director from Turkey (Faith Akin) makes the same mistake: looking at Turkey in fake Western glasses and clambering to portray her as if he understands better All futile efforts. <br /> <br /> Just ask any of your Turkish friends: what is this musical documentary without mentioning names: Zeki Muren, Baris Manco, Ajda Pekkan, Teoman, Muslim Gurses, Ibrahim Tatlis, Ferdi Özbegen? .. and many others who still called the real MUSIC that we listen to today? <br /> <br /> Faith Akin has a long, long lesson to learn before babbling and mixing other people's minds with false images of modern Turkish music.
