the plot of this film revolves around this submarine builder, who is a real bastard, and he wants to launch his new submarine, which can travel to a depth of a thousand feet. unfortunately he cannot. oh yeah, and he was haunted by the memories of how his mom and dad ate the megalodon when he was a child. this guy meets a scientist who is pretty hot, and they and this team of about a hundred people go to the main character's submarine to kill the same megalodon that killed his parents. This is basically something like Shark Attack 3, only more depressing. if you do not understand what I mean, listen. The opening credits of the film show the “home movies” of the main character, when he was a child with his parents before they were killed, and in the background really sad and depressing piano music plays. you expect to see a shark or something, and you do. a short shadow of a CGI shark swims around every few seconds, but that is all. besides, I don’t remember any happy facial expressions during the whole time of the movie, most of the movie takes place in the dark depths of the abyss, where the story becomes even more boring, and all the characters (the shark too) die at the end. I thought that Sabato would kill the shark and save himself and the girl, but no, they would all die, and the film ends with a shark, everything is blown up, and the submarine (with Sabato's broken and burned body) sinking into the abyss. if you are a happy person and you don’t like to be depressed, then avoid this movie. if you're the other way around, congratulations, you found your movie.
