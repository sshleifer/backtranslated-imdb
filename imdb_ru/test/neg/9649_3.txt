First of all, let me say that I am not the one who usually is embarrassed by the fact that I have to think while watching movies, I like Tarkovsky’s films, for example, Bergman is also a favorite ..... but is it? The positive moments can be easily summarized: the photo is gorgeous, and the music is beautiful ... is this a good movie? I used to think so, but this is a great example of what (for me) does not work ... maybe because I am too stupid? perhaps, but I don’t think so .... Tarkvoski, for example, also used very long shots, but he never shot 5 minutes of exactly the same image of two people walking (and I mean only their heads, because in this the film has many such shots, but sometimes it is effective), the overall result is clearly dull, even with intelligent shades (which are made in such a way that, although intelligent, is, above all, very pedantic) <br /> <br /> always feel that the director takes a few long shots not for aesthetics or symbols olic effect, but just for the sake of saving .... <br /> <br /> I’m very disappointed in this movie because I really liked the first 30 minutes or so, but it just continued without even maintaining the same level as in the first scenes .... <br /> <br /> While reading the very commendable comments on this page, I also feel that some people just try to see much more in the film than they are ... when the film is slow and cunning , this is not necessary. I mean, it is very deep .... yes, it is an allegory of musical theory, placed in the context of a small city, which in itself is quite interesting, but it does NOT make a deep film .... except for people who absolutely want to make some kind of intellectual masturbation out of it, but then the point is not what you find in the film , but in what you find in yourself ... an exercise that, in my opinion, can be done much more efficiently while watching "Stalker" or "Solyaris" than Werckmeister Harmonies, who owes much to Tarkovsky, but never a taxi compare to its level ....
