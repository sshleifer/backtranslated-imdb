Perhaps this is the worst movie in which Al Pacino could play a major role. The film did not have a real plot. This is a career in 24 different directions. It seems that the target audience of this film are people from an anonymous player. Matt McConaughey’s character is not believable enough to become Pacino’s protégé. So he won a few bids for some degenerate clients as a side effect of the crappy job recording on service 900. Should that automatically convince the audience of his skills? It was just stupid to think. The trailer promised to show us how he makes his unmistakable picks, but after watching the entire movie I still have to see what skills he has ever had. If you want skills, try looking at Robert De Niro's character in the Casino now, this is a showmanship. At some point in the movie, the character Mata chooses his winning bets when he tosses a coin. Anyone could do this. Al Pacino seems to be talking a lot, and I mean chatter in the dialogue. I think that this style started with the smell of a woman and worked for him, because he finally won an Oscar, but now I think it is just annoying. It seems he always preaches. He really portrays a person with unstable angina pectoris (this is an impending heart attack), who, as a rule, resembles his acting game in Godather part 3, in which he plays an aging, diabetic mafia, but apart from this, Pacino’s talent is spent on this film. Rene Russo - just a pleasant sight for this movie. She is in shape and demonstrates it in tight clothing, which wears all over. This movie is just crap. Do not waste your money on this. It's a lot worse than Mats gambling in a movie.
