Do not be deceived by the “rewards” and comments below. This is just 1 bad movie. The way George Cutt played his character (soft gangster) is very annoying to watch. The conversation in the opening scene is a dramatic reflection of this. In the rest of the film, the character’s head seems to be somewhere else. His emotions do not coincide with what is happening in the film. What he says behind the scenes, adds nothing to the film. It just makes Zeus an even more characterless character headlong into the clouds. <br /> <br /> History and film were combined with a total lack of imagination. All parts of the film were poorly stolen from other modern directors. Let's hope that John Rosten will use his own style and ideas for his future films.
