***** Classic **** Excellent *** Good ** Satisfactory * Tragic <br /> <br /> Review: <br /> <br /> Oldboy is not for everyone. This is widespread violence, his octopus live food and an unimaginable story. <br /> <br /> The film tells about a man who was abducted and imprisoned for 15 years. Oops Dae Soo is released only to understand that he must find his captor in 5 days. Now the story may seem exciting to begin with, but one day, watching this bloated and unoriginal bloody feast, it turns into a mixture of bitter blood and a strong film. <br /> <br /> His directorial work is on an average level and is by no means the standard of what the South Korean thriller should be. The actor's scenes of Oldboy are parallel to the dull humor and poorly written script. <br /> <br /> Old strawberries are sometimes shown with subtle straw views, which can only be ashamed of. <br /> <br /> Verdict: <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, but its scale and vision is not clear enough to see further than the gray abyss of fog. <br /> <br /> * tragic
