The creative team of Evan Almighty really had to make a better film. Starring one of the favorite American funny characters under the direction of Ace Ventura Pet Detective director Tom Shadyak, a higher level of laughter is expected than in the picture. Hell, even Steve Odekerk, who wrote and managed a cruel barn in recent years, and gained a reputation here, did a better job. The fact of the matter is that Evan Almighty is not the worst picture of the summer season, but it may well be the most disappointing. The name and creative team of the author of the picture suggest that this is a continuation of Bruce Almighty 2003. Jim Carrey was the leader in this picture, and although Steve Carell and Kerry are both funny guys, the latter are better suited for this kind of material. I heard that Kerry offered this continuation before everyone else, but the actor refused, not seeing other places for his character. Thus, Shadyak passed on to Karell, who has since occupied a small role in the original of 2003, striving for fame. After the sleeping hits "40 Year Old Virgin" and "Little Miss Sunshine", this man became big business, and therefore it was Jim, not rubber, that faced Jim, who leads this production in cinemas. History shows that Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) was elected a congressman, and thus he and his squad moved to another state so that Evan could succeed with his work. His wife (Lauren Graham) and three children have doubts, but in general they support Evan, who himself looks to the future with optimism. Be that as it may, everything goes pretty fast, God (Morgan Freeman) seems to Evan to declare that a flood is coming and that the politician must build the Ark. Initially ignoring the clash, Evan is quickly given some robes to a beard, which refuses to remain shaved and animals begin to appear two in two. Then Evan begins to build a boat, but the neighborhood is not thrilled, and this is also not a politician (John Goodman). Anyone who expects the wacky laugh of some other Tom Shadyak films is likely to remain completely cold from this film. Ace Ventura, Liar, Liar and, damn it, even Bruce Almighty, where there are mostly funny pictures, but all these projects have one thing - the presence of Jim Carrey. Shadyac didn’t make a decent film without Kerry at the helm, he worked with Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy and now Steve Carell, but still only Kerry seems to have successfully connected with Shadyac. After a disappointing box office and critical preparation, Carell will not desperately try to work with the director again, and now that Kerry is making more serious projects, Shadyaku should quickly find a new comic muse. Carell himself is pretty boring here, and the one who felt that his episodic role in the first film (despite the fact that he is quite funny) deserves the full-length film should be shot and shot. I expect that after the Bruce Almighty draw, it was Universal Studios themselves, but you know that when a quality comedian can't do anything with a character, then scren persona is nonsense, and this is exactly the same as in the case of Evan Almighty. Lauren Graham is not as good as Evan's wife, and none of the children make the right note. Freeman allows all of this to be held, like God, in another funny and frozen play, but he seems to carry the piece from time to time. Indeed, the most constant source of laughter is Secretary Evan (Wanda Sykes) and a colleague in Creep (John Hill), both made me laugh twice as much as any other character in the project. Oederker's letter was worse (Animal Farm), but also better (Ace Ventura, When Nature Calls) than his work on this production. His script has really funny moments, but it’s also full of peaceful family moments, and humor is never weird or rather offensive. The film tells about religion, when it should break the concept to shreds, and indeed, the opening episode of the church in The Simpsons shocks religion more than all the 95-minute runs of Evan Almighty. With a little more bold and heartfelt, this could be a much better picture. I have no doubt that this family audience will be slightly entertained by this film, but if they are satisfied, this is a completely different question. There is a line between being watchable and standing, the line that Evan Almighty is always on the wrong side. Maybe when you're bored and you can afford to watch movies on cable, but I can figure out how to spend my time and, more importantly, my money, than tune in to this mediocre comedy.
