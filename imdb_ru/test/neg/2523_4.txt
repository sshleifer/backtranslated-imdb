When I was in college in the early 70s, it was an easier time. Except for a brief case in 1994, I have been completely free from the influence of illegal substances since then, and I have never regretted it ... until now. DB: TBTE, must be hand-to-hand, the best movie to watch when it was stoned. The strange, fantastic state that it creates is very strange when you do not smoke anything, but I am sure that it will be completely normal after the big stick. (Not that I recommend this, you understand.) The soothing narrative provided, as is usually the case in high-quality cinema, a victim of tuberculosis trapped in a picture would be ideal to help the stoned spectator watch what is going on. In addition, everything in the film is quite organic ... from old-fashioned natural breasts to a bucket of fried chicken. <br /> <br /> Now there is also no doubt that the young man with (ahem) hand problem "absolutely disappears in the film. At some point, you just KNOW that he will say:" Hey! When I move my hand, it leaves traces !! ‚ÄùBelieve me ... you will understand when you get to this point. <br /> <br /> The only thing we need to decide is how good a movie can be when it is spent at least half the budget. move a huge bed around for indoor and outdoor shots? <br /> <br /> definitely need to see horror fans, o suitable for a wide audience in the right conditions (if you understand what i mean and i think you do it). he only earns four stars, because i can't say that some talent was needed for that .
