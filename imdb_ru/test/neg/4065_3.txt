I have seen three other films that are worse than this: Plan 9 from Outer Space, Side Hackers and scary Blair Whitch Project. There are so many technical mistakes in this film that regardless of the decent plot, the film is simply implausible. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the AMTRAC train without skirts and handrails between the cars. The killer approaches his victim when she goes from car to car and simply pushes her away from the train. <br /> <br /> In one of the scenes, the killer sneaks into the woman’s apartment. He wants to sneak up on a woman to kill her, so what does he do? He turns her stereo! If I heard that my stereo system suddenly became louder, I would be concerned. He kills women by throwing electric curlers into the bath. I was amazed to see that an electric curler with a five-foot cord could be thrown ten feet away and left on. Plus, the apartment looked modern enough to have grounded sockets in the bathroom, and the victim was still in the electric chair. <br /> <br /> The Boeing 747 is one of the most famous commercial airliners on the planet, so this part struck me. First, the cabin was not even close to the present 747, and secondly, it was not on the upper deck of the aircraft. I watched in amazement as the pilot and co-pilot (where was the flight engineer?) Walked past the spiral staircase and headed forward to the nose of the plane. <br /> <br /> I was also amazed that the bullets would not penetrate the aluminum serving trolley (a good thing for our hero) or the bathroom door, but would penetrate the ceiling, causing fuel to leak through a small hole in the fuselage. BUT? Watching the three guys lengthen the runway 100 yards in less than a week was also pretty amazing. <br /> <br /> I didn’t check, was it a movie of the week or something? It was terrible.
