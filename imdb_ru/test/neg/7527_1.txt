The 2002 version of The Time Machine is only the last of a series of horribly disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall on the face, despite extravagant special effects. <br /> <br /> What a disgusting, boring and soulless story without fantasy. Why so completely rewrite such a wonderful fiction? Are today's cinema audiences too fashionable for GG Wells, writing pretty much the way he is? The 1960 version of George Pel told a much more enchanting story, even with awkward low-budget effects, overlooking Eloi's beach party and Morlock, who looked like smurfs on steroids. <br /> <br /> In the 2002 version there should be H.G. Wells turning into a grave: <br /> <br /> 1. The idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and fall into the trap of a temporary paradox is an old science fiction cliche. It completely distracts from the love affair with Mara (what happened to Uina?!), Which made the 1960 version so cute. This sets an unfortunate and distracting tone at an early stage, which makes the whole movie grim. If Guy Pierce's character was so brilliant, would he or his buddy Einstein realize the temporary paradox dilemma ?? not forerun him 800,000 years in the future ?? from morlok no less, doh !! What is wrong with time travel just for fun, adventure, and curiosity — as embodied in the 1960 version? <br /> <br /> 2. Only if you saw the first film, would you even understand what Pierce did with the time machine when you first saw it. George Pal's film thoroughly explains the whole strange idea of ​​“traveling” through the 4th dimension. <br /> <br /> 3. The director tries his best to make the character of Pierce look disgusting, exhausted by the old stereotype of scientists. In the 1960 version, Rod Taylor was also a bit boring (at least near Vina), but he managed to be assertive, playful and charming. <br /> <br /> 4. Among the key themes of the version of the 60s left in the remake is the idea that endless war leads to a split in humanity. Blowing up the moon to destroy humanity is pointless - and does little for scientific literacy. For more than 4 billion years, much more powerful asteroid strikes were made on the moon that made any nuclear device look like fireworks. Yes, science fiction needs an artistic license, but it's just stupid and pointless. <br /> <br /> 5. Destroying a time machine is also stupid. Apparently, our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to trigger this thing. The explosion of the machine to kill Morlock is a kind of machina ex machina excuse. Unfortunately, Pierce never returns to the 1800s to tell his story to his incredulous friends, a key part of the Wells story with irony, which goes into the distant future and back in a week of time travel. <br /> <br /> 6. Morlocks running in the daytime completely destroy the monstrously terrible, disgusting image of H.G. Wells, depicting them as dark creatures of the night. This cinematic opportunity is missed. In addition, Wells portrayed Eloy as frail and childish. These guys in the film looked as if they could take Morlokov if they weren't such big kids. <br /> <br /> 7. One smart morlock? some bleached Evil War of the Emperor of Evil Wars - had the potential, but did he suck and alienate that he ordered Pierce to take his car and go home ?! Boy, what a dramatic peak! In the book, Morlocks steal a car because they are fascinated by it, and they fight to save it. <br /> <br /> 8. A holographic hologram in the public library of New York is too much. This sheds light on the idea of ​​human cannibalism. the 1960 version simply had “talking rings” that delivered a frighteningly gloomy speech to humanity. Broken evolution is a serious thing. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the wonderful effects in this film will never be able to compensate for the weary invented script. Save on the cost of the ticket and popcorn and rent a DVD when it comes out (soon, no doubt), at least you can move forward, thinking about boring details, like our time traveler.
