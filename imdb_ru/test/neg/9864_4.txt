As long as you remember that the production of this film was a copyright trick and was not intended for serious release, it is actually amazing how awful it is. I even liked the themed music. <br /> <br /> And if there is ever a scream about the treatment by Joel (or Mike) and the MST3K bots, that's all! Look at it with a bunch of smart wise men, and you will have a good time. Take a brew, spread some big pretzels and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Of course, to get a copy you need to buy a bootleg or download it as a shareware program, but if you are here on IMDb, then youâ€™re most likely experienced enough to do it. Good luck. <br /> <br /> And look for my favorite part .... where Dr. Doom tells FF that they have 12 hours to fulfill his desires .... and he actually shows the number "12" with his finger. ... it's like "Wicked Sesame Street" .... xy boy. <br /> <br /> ... and, of course, Mrs. Storm declares: "Just look at yourself ... ..." The Fantastic Four "is so soulful ... you will laugh, you will cry ... <br /> <br /> So, if you like fantastic fiction, this is fantastic for you!
