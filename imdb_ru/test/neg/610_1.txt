This show uses a rather tired comedy formula of a fat idiot with blue collars, with a pretty (and sometimes cheeky) wife and crazy relatives. In this show, it's the fat unfunny comedian Kevin James as Doug Hefferman, who works as a parcel delivery service driver. He has a pretty wife, Carrie (Lea Remini), who works as a legal assistant, and the aged father-in-law, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in the basement of his daughter and son-in-law. Kevin James "Doug" - your typical beer lover, a lover of sports and television, watching a disabled husband who prefers to watch the phone rather than deal with their family problems. He also has a couple of idiots friends who give extra nonsense to the problems that a couple of this show faces. In addition to a few laughs, secured by the old character Jerry Stiller’s crazy character, this show was generally unfunny. Kevin James’s thoughtless behavior usually caused problems in a show that his wife usually resolved. This show continued the series of comedy performances with a fat stupid father / husband and their pretty wives, who for some reason seemed to be working for ABC.
