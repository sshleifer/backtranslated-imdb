Well, the film starts well, but after half an hour it gets boring and stupid when the whole plot about pregnancy is Karen (that was the name of the girl, right?). <br /> <br /> The end of the film is really trite, and the characters are really stupid. <br /> <br /> I don’t know who is more stupid if a girl because she came back with her old boyfriend, or a boy because of how he was used for her. <br /> <br /> In any case, my conclusion is this: definitely not the best comedy of the eighties, just another movie, like many others, which is nothing special, they could do it better, but they spoiled it if the plot were different, they keep this pregnancy, and they are definitely destroyed, so the final conclusion: I don’t like it.
