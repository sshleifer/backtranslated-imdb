PEP SQUAD is at a very low point with a tangled storyline and terrible game. <br /> <br /> First, let's deal with the characters. Cherry (Brooke Balderson) continues to hold outrageous, seething anger throughout the entire film, which is due to her irresistible passion to become prom queen. However, the audience becomes completely unknown why Cherry wants to become the prom queen. Even before the nominations were read, she fusses around the school with a constant uninteresting presence there and shows no interest in the place or its students from the very beginning. Why does she care so much to be their prom queen? Brooke Balderson appears to be a “welcome” performance, but in reality he spends all his time with an angry face, stomping around, killing people. Maybe it's just me, but I think that if you gave a scenario to any young actor / actress that requires him / her to act insanely angry, you don’t ask for much. You also do not allow the character to develop very well. <br /> <br /> Beth's character, played by Jennifer Dreyling, is even worse. Dreiling shows absolutely no emotion and no connection with her character at all. When her director is persecuted, she knocks him off his feet (after a few seconds) without feeling disgusted, shocked, or something similarly traumatic. Her lines are read as if she was reading trivia from a box of cereal. <br /> <br /> In the rest of the film, the students responsible for his kidnapping look more like they are planning kebabs than deciding what they will do with their director, who is tied in the basement. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Cherry kills several candidates for the prom, and no one even notices or cares. (Yes, I understand, I understand, the whole city is worried about graduation. Very realistic. At least you could add some funny scenes with the cops, but this may require too much.) For example, right after Cherry driving past school and knocking down a bunch of students, Beth is interviewed by local media. The reporter mentions the “shooter” in such a way that it seems that no one knows who killed these innocent students, but after a second he asks: “What do you think about weapons in the hands of minors?” Or something like that. Where did the journalist make such conclusions? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, after Cherry kills the winning prom queen, and the prom is considered over, and the media reappears, Beth simply adds that “she understands (Cherry) that she needs to be heard ”And leaves with his friends, smoking cigarettes in a calm, unchanging mood. No one was even confused by the fact that they had just witnessed the murder. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the students who are constantly standing in the yellow zone, and no one seems to care about the fact that in the city, Julie lives in a big house without the presence of parents, and a strange party at her house ( Maybe I left the stage a little bit, but the last time I knew that school parties did not involve naked women who were artistically dancing in a pool of water, while the men were swinging behind a marshmallow and everyone was warming themselves in their relationship. indie and mod "), the terrible act of parent Beth with her mother acting excessively and her father just nod t all that the mother has to say (and not in an entertaining way), along with silly scenes, such as the new black director, running for Cherry when she tries to shoot her with a pistol. Yes. Very realistic. <br /> <br /> The only compliment I can give this film is that the photo is beautiful. The corners are flattering, and the screen is very clear and crisp with every shot. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the acting and script are not.
