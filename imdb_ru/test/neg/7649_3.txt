I do not consider myself a conservative, so I was not personally offended by this film, but it was quite clear that the plot and the characteristic in this film were secondary to the message. And the message is that all conservatives are either evil or stupid (or both). Characters are one-dimensional - either good, freedom-loving Americans, or brainless, greedy, evil conservatives. There is nothing clever or creative, just anti-conservative. I really am not against the political bias, but this should not be the sole purpose of the film. And it is clear that this is so. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the cast is wonderful, and Chris Cooper's impression of W is funny the first two or three times, but after that the same old joke repeats again and again. <br /> <br /> So if you really hate conservatives, you will probably like this movie, but if you are looking for something with realistic characters and a less black-and-white story, then you better watch something else.
