We gave this movie one star for horror, however, it really depends on how you look at it. We are currently watching this on Channel 5 at 3:30 am, and we did not stop laughing, so perhaps we could give it 10, just for fun. From the very beginning, with “manic” thoughts that the stalkers were broadcast in a comical way, we laughed. Is this me or this chick from Camp Nott looking like one of the characters in the Dark Crystal? <br /> <br /> I'm not going to spoil him, however, you have to be pretty stupid, don't you see him, I don't think he's smart enough to double bluff. <br /> <br /> This must be the worst / best movie we’ve ever seen, if we played it in the place of “Drunk Game, then we’re wasted.
