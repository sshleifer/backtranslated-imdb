An expedition group consisting of constantly quarreling and unpleasant assholes, goes to the dangerous African jungle in search of riches in diamonds and a missing young lady named Diana (juicy brunette beauty Katya Byrnet, wearing only a scanty loincloth that demonstrates a lot of her hot slim body), which the goddess worships mortally primitive tribe, called Mabutos. Director / screenwriter Jess Franco is fundamentally unable to embed any style or energy into ordinary delusional and tortuous production, allowing slow paces to creep along the often painfully slow clip and putting infrequent action scenes with an exceptional lack of skills and intelligibility.

The beautiful scenery of the jungle is also very good. But in general, this picture looks barely noticeable and, therefore, instantly forgotten waviness.
