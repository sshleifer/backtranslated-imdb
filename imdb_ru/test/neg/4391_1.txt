This movie is actually painful to watch. Not only did I not laugh once, I ended up getting a serious headache. Sometimes I felt so sorry for the actors who were involved. The best way to summarize is to notice that among sex comedies, he is probably the least funny and least sexy of all time. I am sorry that I can not give him a voice less than one. Score one point is an insult for each film that received two or more points. <br /> <br /> Now I see that they are shooting a sequel. When I heard that someone was paying these people for making another film, I was convinced that there was too much money in Hollywood. PICK UP THEIR TAXES !!! The continuation of this film may well constitute a crime against humanity; perhaps an international tribunal should be convened, or US sanctions should be applied to the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a really bad movie. Really very.
