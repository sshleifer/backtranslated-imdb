This is really the worst movie I've ever seen. I've been used to watching lousy movies for a while, including Battlefield Earth, Delta Force Commando and Starship. All of these films are cinematic gems compared to Ironheart. <br /> <br /> It makes no sense to generalize this piece of garbage; I think it’s more useful to summarize my reaction to the film, which is this: I’m getting very angry and want to rip the tape from the VCR and record it after (approximately) 80 minutes of play. <br /> I rate this movie as 0, but IMDb does not allow one to rate a movie less than 1. I give it 0, knowing full well that I say that any movie that has any score above 0 is infinite ( indefinitely) many times better than this one - it is really that bad.
