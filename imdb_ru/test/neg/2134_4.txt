A giant 40-foot-long mutant squid with five tentacles, razor tusks and the ability to reproduce its own cells is terrorized by a small town in Florida. Various marine biologists, doctors and police are plotting to kill him. Meanwhile, a human monster named Miller kills people who discover that Devil Fish is an artificial creature used for the greedy benefits of some evil doctors! Miller attacks a female explorer, strangles her, drowns in a bath, throws her hair dryer, then tears off her panties from her dead body! <br /> <br /> When the false alarms of our heroes Peter, Stella Janet and Bob set off on a high-tech (in any case, in 1984, high-tech) Sea Aquarium boat to catch a creature that is often seen in a large or funny the apparent accelerated film to appear more threatening. And only fire can destroy it, which leads to an armed flamethrower against the finale of aquatic animals. <br /> <br /> This JAWS gain is quite modest (except for a legless corpse and decapitation), but watchable and benefits from Anthony Barrymore's excellent evaluation and decent (again, for 1984) monster design. Luigi Cozzi and Sergio Martino wrote the original story. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
