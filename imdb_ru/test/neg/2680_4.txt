The entire ambiguity regarding Michael Myers has disappeared thanks to the chronic habit of this series of dealing with its continuity and dragging relatives out of nowhere. This entry presents a small look at the fact that he is not just a psycho-killer, but is actually controlled by runes that appear as a star constellation every Halloween, and the cult uses it to ... well, this film is far from a coherent and I lost track of the plot after a while. The credibility of the film is so abundant that by the end there is not a drop. Why does Michael put one victim's clothes in the washing machine? Why is there a deadly spike sticking out of a wall in an empty corridor? Does an electric shock really make your head explode? And so on. Donald Plezsen in his penultimate film role left a few wonderful moments from a pile of terrible dialogues that he gave.
