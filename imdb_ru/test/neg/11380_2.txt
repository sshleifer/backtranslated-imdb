First of all, I personally adore “Demons and Demons 2”, I saw them, although it was hard to find good horrors without a good official film distributed here in Russia when I was a child, and this is a constant part of my childhood. Then I did not hear anything about Mr. Bava. Then I saw his Phantom Son. Well, that, of course, is a bad return! Why did the main character, whom we never knew, at least to love him, had an accident in the middle of an empty road? Why do African servants talk so foolishly and foolishly about the human soul? Why is the plot so primitive? Have we not seen enough ghosts in 100 years of filmmaking? It is clear that Lamberto Bave has nothing to show us. It's a shame.
