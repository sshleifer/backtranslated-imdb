JJ Jameson (from Spiderman 2) Quote ... Shit, Shit, ... <br /> <br /> Mega-Shit It looks like a homage (not intentional) to the Cohen Brothers ... done badly. <br /> There is nothing mysterious about this plot. <br /> <br /> Diaz’s performance is not at all inspiring. <br /> <br /> Freaky characters don't really work. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of “boring” moments. <br /> <br /> I love black comedy, but this film is not funny. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Not worth the electricity. <br /> <br /> There are many movies in this genre that are much more interesting. <br /> <br /> I hope you find this review useful.
