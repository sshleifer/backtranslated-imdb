I carefully checked if there is another film named like this one and no! But I really don’t think we all saw the same movie! No choice ! How can you vote more than 1 for this movie ?! The idea of ​​this film, for example, is acceptable. Oh, and the play of Dan Gordon (Chris) is pretty good. But these are the only two things that are acceptable in this project. Others ... terrible? This is a very delicate word for describing the actions of other actors, directing, (so to speak) "special effects", even the method of filming the crew! I don't even like the way camera operators moved to record scenes! This may be the most unfortunate film I've ever seen. I really do not remember the film below this ... Maybe there is, but ... I don’t think so ... Oh, what's done is done ... This is a film, and it's too late Someone to change something . I voted "1", but my realistic voice begins with a "-" (minus) before ....
