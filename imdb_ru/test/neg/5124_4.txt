This film was Jerry Bruckheimer's idea to sell some records. No, seriously it was. The point of this is that if you made a movie full of pop songs, you could put tracks on LP, sell it and make even more money for the studio. You can also release a few tracks as singles and add clips from the movie to the commercial, so that when MTV plays the track, you actually get free movie advertisements. This is a good business deal, but an artistic disaster, because many of us still have nightmares about Hollywood films from the 1980s, and I rate the mid-1980s as the worst artistic time for American filmmaking, and FLASHDANCE opened the door for this let's make a 90-minute pop video instead of the movie "<br /> <br /> Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens, a dancer who works as a welder to make ends meet, and the logic disappears immediately with this career choice. Welding is a rather complicated profession, it's not what you study and study in five minutes. There are other gaps in logic, such as ballet dancing and flash dancing, which are somewhat similar, that is, if you are applying for the role of a ballerina and performing some kind of hot, dirty dances, male judges may want to meet you after listening, but you don’t get a job. It's like saying that the script on the screen, the writing of the novel and the writing of the play are somewhat the same when they are not <br /> <br /> But I think it all didn’t matter to Jerry when he asked director Adrian Line to make a film, In fact, Line is almost completely removed in a very sexy film, and JenniferBeals looks very cute and innocent. Fortunately, I guessed why her face was brightly lit with close-ups, while her silhouette was darkly lit long shots, except when the camera cuts her sky-toned body close-ups. This is because the body twin is used most of the time, and often the body twin is a man! I bet there are some naughty guys who feel guilty, not to mention that I'm a little nasty
