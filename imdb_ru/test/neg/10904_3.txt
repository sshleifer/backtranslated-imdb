If only he had not bowed to clichés, Mr. Shiban could have made a good film from this story. It was just different in order to interest you, so for the same time, energy and money that was spent on this bitch, we could get something good, and not throw a look. <br /> <br /> Production- wisely, this is as good as you would expect from a hand-held camcorder, so he gets good grades there. This is really the scenario that is to blame, since the acting was also not so bad, considering what the actors had to work with. <br /> <br /> I thought that those days were gone when we saw someone, having found a radio transceiver that they desperately want to control, first turn each knob on the object from end to end, hit it from above 6 or 7 times and then expect it to work. This story is destroyed by a continuous series of stupid moves of all the characters, except for the bad guy. As if we are too small to grab all the plot devices, so they all feed us with a spoon so that we can get them. <br /> <br /> I don’t know about you, but it doesn’t work for me. My attention ends with the fact that I am occupied with holes in the plot and excessive dramatization, and not with history. <br /> <br /> Since I found it to be not so bad in a technical sense, I think Mr. Shiban should try again, only with the right script next time; then he could give us something worth seeing.
