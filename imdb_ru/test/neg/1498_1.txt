Grandma is definitely one of the worst horror movies ever made in film history. <br /> <br /> The script was devilish, so bad that I almost cried out laughing at some of the things they released, Acting was almost as bad, it would be better for them to play road cones to play roles (they would have done better). The killings were ridiculous, there was no suspense, camera work was ineffective, and the “main” plot twist at the end was disgustingly inappropriate, it got worse and worse. <br /> <br /> “Grandma” is perhaps one of the most innocuous “villains” captured on film, it looks as if she wears a cheap mask from a supermarket (nylon hair caused an infinite amount of laughter) and an elaborate nightdress. Would you be scared of that ??? I certainly wasn't. <br /> <br /> If you like to watch bad movies (see Movies “Manos”, “Troll 2 ″,“ Michael Bay ”), then this is a must see. Those who do not like bad movies and do not like to laugh at the shockingly bad dialogue, avoid the plague.
