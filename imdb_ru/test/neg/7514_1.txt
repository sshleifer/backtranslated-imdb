It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I'm still trying to figure out how bad everything was. The fact that the name Godard is tied to him does not make him great. Besides the fact that it makes absolutely no sense, we see one insanely long cork shot that is not stunning, incredible or something like that. As this long traffic jam continues, you are more likely to feel more like cooking a pastra sandwich than continuing to watch it. Parts of the alleged story, stupid, stupid characters. What message should we extract from this? He offers nothing and does not make sense. The arrogance of the director in the demonstration of these insignificant, dreary smokers of French people is that they sit and talk for hours and then pretend to be art that is truly amazing.
