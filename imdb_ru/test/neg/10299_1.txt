Without a doubt, the biggest waste of the film of the year. This film is poorly structured, sadistic, violent, and filled with unattractive characters. In addition, and perhaps the worst offense, it is uninteresting and largely predictable. As soon as the character of Bill Pullman drew in the photo, changing the word "evidence" to "violence", I understood the whole plot. There are no surprises and there are no compelling reasons to view this garbage. The only function for me is that I saw this thing for free on my HDNet cable and did not waste money. I would be really angry if I paid to see him in the theater. <br /> <br /> Anyone tagging this thing with a thriller really needs to get more. A terrible, terrible movie in every sense.
