Honestly, I did not think that there was something funny in this film. It was really bad and badly done without a conspiracy at all. Surprisingly, at first I heard a chuckle with the Malcolm X terminal, and thatâ€™s all. Seriously, Soul Plane made even the worst films, such as Gigli, look like an Emmy winner. This film is really not worth watching, unless, of course, you are not blind, like Johnny Witherspoon, who played a blind man in the film (another sad character). I suppressed most stereotypical jokes and ravaged Tom Arnold and DL Hewley, playing them in this movie. This film can be summarized in just one sentence. Nashon wins $ 100,000,000 and creates its own airline, sex, drugs, homosexuality, more sex, drugs, did I mention sex? If I could, I would rate this film in negative integers, but the start was funny, which brings this film to 1/10. Make "t bag" pfft!
