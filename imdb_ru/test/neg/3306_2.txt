Warning: this may contain SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> First of all, I watch a lot of life movies and I understand that they are just ... lifelong movies. Some are great (really), some are good, and some are bad. Unfortunately, this film belongs to the latter category. In fact, it all started with some potential ... lonely, divorced hard-working mom (who quits work at 2:00 in the morning), cutting off the guy as he drove home from work, and let's just say that he doesn't take it too, Tracking begins immediately after phone calls hang and grow into her home, being hacked and completely crushed. So she goes to her mother for the night, and the next morning her mother explodes. It seems that this is just a pain in the ass for our heroine, who is doing this, shopping for underwear and jewelry !!! So the police put her and her son in a local motel for safe keeping, and what does the mother do? She leaves for work, leaving the child alone at night in a strange room in a motel and tells him to order a pizza !!! I could not believe it! Then it really becomes stupid! And the finale just pissed me off because it was so funny and typical. It is a pity because it seemed to have opportunities.
