If you take Mad Max, Beyond Thunder and Steel Dawn with Patrick Swayze, you will have a pretty good idea of ​​what the film is about. The only problem is that there are no production figures in the film, and they are basically a cheap copy of the first two. True, in the movie a lot of action, but asks the viewer to suspend faith. No one can shoot a 50-gauge machine gun in his hand - and skip everything to load, and you cannot shoot a group of people with automatic weapons and miss a whole bunch. There is also a problem with poor editing, when the school bus turns over, it is easy enough to see the gun used for work. And a woman driving a truck through her is unnecessary, since she had more than enough time to stop the truck. If you are only interested in meaningless actions and violence, then just watch the film. But don't expect anything like Thunderdome or even a little cheap and tasteless Steel Dawn.
