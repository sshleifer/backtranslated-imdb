The first time I heard about the Paridizo Guest House was in the ... "lavatory" after I had just seen Fight Club. In each urinal there was a small round black circle. When the circle came into contact with moisture (to put it mildly), he formed a color picture with photos of two stars and the words “You will laugh”. When you’ve finished washing your hands, the circle has dried and turned black again, waiting for spring, which will come as a surprise to the next “victim”. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe the zest was not very difficult, but you have to admit that it was innovative. In fact, I think I can honestly say that I have never seen anything like this in my life before, and these days more than a century of cinema and marketing is a real feat. What a pity that the film that went with it did not fulfill the promise. <br /> <br /> I hate to pan Paridiso Guest House, and I am indebted to Rick Mayall (Richard Tvat) and Adrian Edmondson (Eddie Elizabeth Ndingombaba) for many years of laughter in their appealing television series, whether it’s the “Young” (1982–1984), plays “Bottom” (1991–1995) in the living room, or even solo work, such as “Rick in the“ New Statesman ”(1988–1993). In fact, it would make a fun 45-minute TV special. Unfortunately, this is a 89-minute film. <br /> <br /> There is definitely some merit, and I continuously laughed throughout the protracted finale, which deceived the Exorcist and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and involved ... well, you should see it a little for yourself. However, the pace is often lead, and the atmosphere is sterile everywhere. Two stars (Edmondson sits in his usual back seat, this time due to the fact that he is adequately controlled) never get into first gear, Mayall only occasionally shows an unclean mania that makes us love him on a small screen. Indeed, the presumption of the authors that we are already familiar with the characters leads to the fact that they are under-supplied to the audience. Light hints of depth, which can be seen in the series (for example, effeminate Richie, unsuccessful social climbing) are missing here, and instead we are left with parodies of parodies. <br /> <br /> The accusation of Fawlty Towers does not stand up to criticism. Complete with a drunken chef and an invisible, sought-after waiter, Paskele, who oddly rhymes with Manuel. Some of the ideas, such as a hotel near a nuclear reactor with swings for children hanging on a rock, are very, very funny, but ultimately a furious pace is stolen, both are constantly looking for a studio audience that is not there, and all areas of "dead laughter" patched with random comedic music that would be dated in the movie “Carry On” two decades ago. <br /> <br /> “Pardiso” is Puerian, sadistic, perverted humor. funny, and I'm sure it makes you laugh ... just not as often as it should.
