"As if this city is able to suck your brain right out of your head." -Patty <br /> <br /> Patti (Christina Ricci) is a sarcastic teenage girl, she is bored in her too small town. It’s boring until a woman is kidnapped, and she doesn’t find what she thinks is the key to the whereabouts of the poor lady. Now, with the help of her precious cat "DS" and the inept FBI agent (Doug E. Doug), who she must find her. <br /> <br /> This Damn Cat is a bad movie. It's pretty silly, and it has a sense of humor, which often falls rather flat. There are, however, several talents in it. Doug E. Doug was good at Cool Runnings. His performance in the role of 'Senga' was really funny. Here he is wasted as an awkward FBI agent. He has a really good scene when he imitates a cat. Michael Mackin plays father Patty. His character must be the most understanding parent to ever live. This poor guy broke his dear cigar, he was arrested for picking up his own cat, and he was offended by his naked wife, and STILL was not angry at his daughter for causing all his problems. I wish my old man was like that. The only really good performance is Christina Ricci. She entertains like Patty, who is always irritated, but her random very bad dialogue reduces her productivity. In this film, you can also find out Peter Boyle (“Young Frankenstein, everyone loves Raymond”), an old woman from “Wings” and “Cliff” from “Greetings”. This is a film that all these actors would probably like to forget. Even the cat is not very good ... I really can't recommend this 1997 damn cat. Some small children (up to 8 years old) may like this, but all others should look elsewhere. If you are looking for a good film about Christine Ricci, I suggest Addams Family Values, Opposite of Sex or Sleepy Hollow. If you need a fun family movie, try Snow Day. <br /> <br />
