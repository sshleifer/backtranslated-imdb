Before rejecting my post as “not receiving it,” let me say ... I am one of the biggest fans of Richard Kelly and the Twilight Zone there. Donnie Darko is one of my all-time favorites, and I even thought that Southland Tales has its moments. I'm a HUGE science fiction fan. I was very excited to see the "Box", I could not wait for its release. <br /> <br /> Saying that ... The "box" is terrible. Behind “Drag Me to Hell,” it was the worst movie I saw in 2009. And it just WILL NOT end! Whenever you think you have reached the end, there is another change in the plot, and you go on a new torture. I actually moaned in the theater by the end of the film ... I could hardly stand it anymore. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the Box, no matter how you cut it or try to justify it, is that it simply does not make any sense. Believe me, I "understood", I understood what was going on. But this does not mean that there is a lot of sense in looking around. Take at least the basics. The main pair ... Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, playing Norm and Arthur Lewis. Diaz loses his finances at work and then complains to her husband that they “live from paycheck to paycheck”. Well, sell this P-porsche your husband behind the wheel !!! They live in a beautiful 2-storey house in a good division. Marsden is working on what seems like a well-paid job at NASA, and Diaz is an experienced teacher. And yes, Marsden drives a very expensive car. But they somehow live from paycheck to paycheck?!? No need to press a button, just shorten your dear lifestyle a little! The film would work better if they showed a couple without work and with a serious debt. Instead, they seem to desperately need money ... all the while living in what I would call a luxurious lifestyle. As I said ... you can understand what is happening, but it still does not make much sense! This is a rare combination. <br /> <br /> The library had a terrible scene, which, in my opinion, will be one of the worst episodes in the history of cinema (by the way, it also acted terribly). It was idiotic, illogical and inappropriate. I can’t even begin to fully describe this in reality, so I’ll go on to the storyline, which includes nosebleeds and alien body possession. (Yes, I'm serious, unfortunately). A child learns in the class of Diaz with an evil smile on his face (an ominous smile that seems completely invisible to anyone who has authority in school). He begins to ask Diaz personal questions, literally confusing her in front of her class. No punishment is given to the child ... he was not even asked to stay after the lesson to talk! Then Diaz at the party ... and the same child - one of the hired helpers ... ironed shirt, apron and all! I don’t know many alien-obsessed children (who seem to be in high school) who also moon as boys on buses at parties sponsored by teachers and school officials ... but we found it here! (See what I mean ... you can understand it completely, but it still does not make sense ... a rare combo!) Like many things in the film, the child comes and goes ... no real explanation about it no ending his character. Moving on ... Then the woman comes to Diaz at the grocery store and tells her that the experiments are conducted in secret, and her family is one of the test subjects. Well ... hmmm ... if the aliens have the power to allow them to remotely capture the body ... and the aliens don't want to help Diaz ... then who captured the body of this lady and advised Diaz? ! Again ... The lady was trying to help Diaz ... and the aliens were not interested in helping Diaz ... so who the hell controlled her body ?! Never explained. Never spoke again. There is nothing!! It goes on and on and on, it seemed to me, 2 weeks. It will not end! I wonder if this film has gone through a massive re-release at some point. It was badly edited. Accent Diaz was there in one minute, and the next. The plots began, but never ended. The numerous responses to the release date obviously show the problems that manufacturers faced with the finished product. This is really a train wreck. <br /> <br /> Skip this ... there is no redemptive value in it. 3 out of 10, just because I like Diaz and Fiction! But it probably deserves 1 out of 10. Thanks for reading! <br /> <br /> JD
