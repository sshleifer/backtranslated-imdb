Let me start first with the obvious: anti-Semitism has been a serious problem throughout history, has been present in many societies and led to the death of millions of Jews. However, the problem with this film is that it views the United States - perhaps the most hospitable society among Jews outside of Israel - as a not very different place from Nazi Germany. The film takes place in 1943. He talks about a man (William H. Macy) who is confused with a Jew after he starts wearing glasses! After that, a number of very unpleasant things happen to him (he loses his job and cannot find a new one, his neighbors avoid him, everything ends in brutal confrontation). From one of the pitiful, patronizing novels of Arthur Miller, which have given Liberalism notoriety.
