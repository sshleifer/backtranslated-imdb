If I were still 5 years old, I would be scared. This is (I think) a low-budget film. The game is not good, but it can be worse - the shooting and the special effect are terrible. The storyline is thin and should not stop there. Too much time is spent on boring flashy scenes. Chases or battles with aliens remind me of children fighting in terrible masks. A bit of blood with blood and parts of the body - I think it will scare a 5-year-old child. Apparently scare the shit of some people in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is far from the case in the movie Tremor. <br /> <br /> It turns out that this is an “incident” and we see alien ships near the ground. It makes you wonder if someone makes a sequel ...
