Let me first say that I didnâ€™t expect much, and watching the prime time at the premiere should have helped. I believe that if there were more than 20 people in the theater. <br /> <br /> Suck so hard. the action was robotic at best, and nothing was explained until the last 30 minutes of the film. I guess it was their way of distorting the plot; Keep everyone in the dark about the important information to understand the direction of the film to the end, and THEN explain things and hope that it looks like a plot twist. <br /> <br /> Unknown until the end of the film: -What is the Eff a dark lin? CG was cool, but I want to understand! Why can't there be power? especially if the massacre is an ultimatum. -Why so much willing to part with the forces? you're just normal after, right? - who farted? <br /> <br /> At about 50% of the minutes, when only men were on the screen, they were taken off in wives for women, in sleeveless T-shirts, and then in a heartbreaking scene in all teenagers in a scanty low ride. speedometers knowing that were ever made. I swear you could see the beginning of one guy .... well, it was close to the soft core. And, of course, there was a scene in the shower, and I had to mix it with SENSITIVES. Abundant cracks were plentiful, a sausage festival was held. But there was one scene in the soul of the girl, in which nothing was visible, and she spent about 12 minutes in the most beautiful bathroom in the hostel. Then there was a party in the style of PJ. the other thing I could not overcome was the amount of driving that Caleb did in his SUPER COOL Ford Mustang GT. it was a ford commercial about 1/4 of the film. <br /> <br /> I do not see. or go see it with a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies. then it may be worth it. but don't expect anything exciting.
