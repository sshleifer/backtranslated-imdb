One can only sit in complete amazement at this clutter of the film and be surprised by some of the raves with which people gave it. The biggest problem seems to be the director’s inability to decide whether it will be a black comedy, a farce, or a combination of the two. He wanders around looking for directions and has some very awkward performances that might be better suited to a bad comedy. What a shame to see how the comedic talents of the talented Diane Wyth are wasted, and the ever annoying Jane Birkin is so excited that he becomes more annoying than usual. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a lot of positive criticism is caused by the “strange” French “nature of the film” —consequently, it is called “smart” or “ingenious.” It is neither one nor the other. Instead, it is a bad scar that leaves a rather rancid taste. The ivory merchant must stick to serious things, for they certainly do not have an understanding of comedy.
