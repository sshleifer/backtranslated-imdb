I have a lakeside vacation home near Plainfield, WI. Ten minutes from Gein property to be exact. I saw his land, the graveyard where he was buried and where he dug, and I went shopping at a hardware store that used to belong to the Warden family. While visiting relatives in California, we decided to rent this movie. It was disgusting. The true story of Ed Heine is so alarming and horrible that the creators of this piece of garbage decided to create their own history, I canâ€™t do it. The actor playing Ed is a very big man, Ed was a very small, meek and shy man. This is part of what makes his story so scary. He did not have a helper to dig graves, and anyone who owns land in the area knows that this is mostly sand with a little dirt. You will not break most of the sweat by digging a hole. They did not need to hire an actor with a fighter's physique, just do your research. And if the letter was not bad enough - there are NO mountains in Wisconsin, and I am sure that 911 was not available in 1957.
