The film has so much potential that has not been developed. Mark Hamill gives good results, like Bill Paxton. The landscape is beautiful, and ultralight aircraft are neat. The problem with this film is that the story is underdeveloped, and the plot is not going anywhere. The film at some point almost lulls. I give it 3 out of 10 stars for flying scenes.
