Well, finally the sight of this underrated film. But you cannot find a good copy of it, a terrible copy full of green drops, editing is not synchronized, the sound sometimes has such a terrible hiss, and sometimes you can even hear the recording from the camera. In general, it is too dark, you need to tell the time, but it is not. It's a little slow, in the first half of the film, everyone talks and makes love to each other. It is even strange that girls in movies of the 60s never wear bras. When they enter the bedroom, it's full of fame. Anyway, banned in the UK from 84 years and still in the list of video nasty things. The reason is simple, it is terrible for their time. He does have some kind of vile imposition, and it is somehow creepy due to the fact that it was shot in the handycam method. So every frame, image moves, what they do these days with a steady camera. Awful could be better if the quality of the film were better, but still better than other films of that time, such as Schoolgirls in Chains.
