I'm still trying to figure out what the purpose of this film is: 1) To show how stupid, disorganized, unprofessional and arrogant is the police (I, of course, could add various adjectives here, but I think my point of view is clear) 2) Show whether chaos can be a distorted crook who does not know what he wants from himself. 3) Show whether the insistent detective will solve the case simply by asking the same stupid question again and again until the offender answers? 4) Or was it just to show that any 90 minutes of footage can still be called a movie? <br /> <br /> It was one of those films that in a sense did not disappoint me. From the first 10 minutes, I somehow realized that this film would not be nominated for the best film award, and how surprising is that? it has been consistent throughout the time. Was it stupid enough to be worth the wait to see how stupid it would go on and on ?? and I, too, was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Was it a full time waistline? YES. Which raises your question ?? WHY I LOOKED AFTER THIS? Well, I tried to fall asleep, and I thought it was a great candidate for this, but unfortunately, did I have too much coffee before that ??
