Idiots go camping and behave like idiots before they finally die like idiots, yes, Blood Camp (or if you need a terrible, bad than bad pun that goes to worse than a bad movie, The bloody horror camp ”) is so bad that it’s actually pretty depressing to watch. And it has everything you need to make a completely bad movie ... <br /> <br /> A terrible acting test. Bad script check. Sticky effects - do not check originality - double check. <br /> <br /> He doesn’t even try to be different and is permeated with every predictable cliche imaginable. For example, a movie opens for a couple having sex in the forest, so of course they end up dying. <br /> <br /> One of the most disturbing things is that this film spawned two sequels, how and why it just confuses the mind. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from that.
