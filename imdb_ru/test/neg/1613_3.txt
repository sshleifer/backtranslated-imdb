This film tells about the science fiction film “The Double” (an astronaut from our Earth falls on the “counter-Earth” on the opposite side of the Sun and the totalitarian vibrations of the Cold War in this world) and tries to turn it into a pilot series. However, it all sank without a trace, and television is probably better for it. <br /> <br /> Everything here is perfectly adequate in terms of “made for television”. Cameron Mitchell turns into his usual solid performance. Just like Glenn Corbett (who seems to be similar to John Saxon of the poor), who plays a coarse individualist, whose very existence threatens the foundation of the “World Order” on the opposite Earth. <br /> <br /> But the low budget, low power consumption and inconsistent scenario, as well as the absence of any real imagination in the scenery and cinematography, keep this sci-fi adventure firmly tied to the launch pad. <br /> <br /> I will give one example: in the original template for this pilot (“Doppleganger”), astronauts lose control of their landing craft during a thunderstorm and smash their ship in a truly horrific sequence (it was obvious that their ship never will not fly again). Then the two astronauts helplessly stagger from the smoking remnants of their vehicle in the midst of howling rains and winds, but they are confused and faceless people screaming through loudspeakers. <br /> <br /> In Stranded in Space, the astronauts are sitting in their seats, when the beeps are heard, everything starts to tremble, and the camera becomes clouded (and, as a friend noticed, it was quite obvious that the actors simply swayed in their seats, the director doesn't even shake the camera or TV). I have seen episodes of the Twilight Zone and External Limits, which took more effort to set the mood and atmosphere than this mediocrity for television. <br /> <br /> And this is, in fact, what is wrong with "Stranded In Space". No budget, no time, no imagination ... just making gestures and hoping that the imagination and enthusiasm of science fiction fans will fill the rest. Sorry, guys, it didn't work. <br /> <br /> I’m sure everyone here has just finished their work on it and left, and never thought of it again, except on their C.V. list. And this is what you, the viewer, will do. If you hit, you will remember that you once watched a television movie called “Stranded In Space”, but it did not make an indelible impression on you, and you cannot remember too much about it.
