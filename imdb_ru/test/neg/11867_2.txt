Fur, sums it all up for me really. Boring story, soft dialogue, boring action scenes (HOW do you do something like a fight or a boring shootout? Do you really need to TRY to do it?), No real characters, etc. It's just boring. Snipes is a talented actor and physical performer, but none of this has surfaced in ANY of his DTV artwork, when it became possible to give viewers a much better product than they used to. Imagine a decent script with a few solid characters you care about and damn explosive actions, fights, shootouts, etc. How can it be so difficult to cope? My personal opinion is that the main players in the productions just do not care. There is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they do. Look at Snipes in the first 2 Blades, Passenger 57, the Rising Sun, New Jack City, the Destroyer, etc.? Stunning, intense performances, complemented by decent (if not always outstanding) scenarios, good supporting actors and evil actions. <br /> <br /> None of this is visible in any of these releases, which is a huge shame. Distributors slap Wesley in the face, knowing that the audience will spoil them, because they have not yet realized that they have not seen him in cinemas for almost 2 years. <br /> <br /> I would love to see how Snipes works with someone like Isaac Florentin, who really knows how to get the most out of DTV, and work with Alpha tricks that are some of the best action films. Together, they would create a great team and an action-sniper machine that we all could be proud of. <br /> <br /> Detonator sucks. It's not as bad as The Marksman, who chews, but still really sucks.
