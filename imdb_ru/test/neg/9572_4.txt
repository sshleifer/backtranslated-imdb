I had to downgrade this movie to 4 because of the terrible sound track. I'm pretty sure that this is not a problem with me or with the tape, because some of the actors and the soundtrack sound great. But the majority of the cast of the actors were distorted or distorted beyond recognition, especially for non-British. <br /> <br /> There are many nice little twists and turns that would make this movie enjoyable - being in Bosnia by mistake is great - but most of the humor was lost in the sound.
