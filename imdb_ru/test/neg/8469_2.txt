I found this film very interesting, but a little exhausted, it talks about violence and what is happening there, I still see no reason to become terrorists to stop the terrorists. We have similar people in the United States and other countries who justify the use of violence and the tactics of war, because they believe that they are right. Think of the Puritans and the Christian Crusades against the Islamic people during the Middle Ages. Lots of blood and deaths, far surpassing today's violence, the Western world has had a negative impact on religion. I do not condone their actions, but Western culture in the past has had a very negative impact on some. But still remember that the majority of Islamic people are peaceful! People of any nation feel a kind of patriotism, but in order to start a war with the fact that I am right and your wrong you need to rethink. I repeat once again, you cannot stop the terrorists by becoming the same as them.
