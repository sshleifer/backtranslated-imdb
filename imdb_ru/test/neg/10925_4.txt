I mean really, really, very high, and this film has a chance to have fun. I do not mean the usual high level, I mean the high level when reading the phone book takes you to the seams. otherwise, save time from your life and do something more constructive, for example, by hitting your head against a brick wall and insulting your own mind. In some cases - a complete waste of talent (Bernie Mac, John S. McGinley, Tom Kenny and master Hams Shatner), and that is the rubbish they deserve (countless rappers who insist on making films). Not without laughter (again, chemical help is crucial) and, of course, not without insulting politically hypersensitive (which I always support), but, ultimately, not worth the time in your life.
