Director Godfrey Reggio must be a very charming and persuasive person for this terribly disastrous project to see the light. Reggio's message, so powerful and resonant in his previous two films about Katsi, is hopelessly mixed here. Athletes, equations, oceans, keyboards, laughing heads, etc. Mix up without a goal. The parade of banal images is basically a common set from Getty Images, and others. And hard digital manipulations are amateurish in the worst way presented. Of course, one of the participants (Steven Soderberg, executive producer?) Could you indicate that the use of a solarization filter for almost every frame was a VERY bad idea? The rough looping, layering and distortion of images resembles the Photoshop novice class. Worse, computer animation sequences are more unsophisticated than Wall Street pie charts from the 1980s. This is not to say that only improved aesthetics would save this film, but some meager efforts in this direction may have made it tolerable as visual feed for accompanying music. I feel obliged to note that Philip Glass's assessment will certainly satisfy his fans. Not a radical departure, but rather a clarification of what Glass does best with the beautiful violin contributions Yo Yo Ma. If you decide to watch this movie, be sure to pay attention to the short introductory sequence. Although you may already be familiar with the once-majestic, but long-abandoned Detroit Michigan Central Railway Station, 89 minutes later you will find that you remember this image of the 20th century as a critical point when you had to go to the EXIT sign / press the STOP button. , etc. You have been warned.
