It's about jealousy, about racism, about manipulation, but the main meaning is love. Jeffrey Sachs tried to implement Shakespeare's Othello, bringing it to the modern context. However, the actors were not convincing enough to accomplish this. There were additional bodies that would help put things in perspective, but John Othello, played by Imon Walker, reacted too much in this film, which led to the fall of Keely Howes, Dessie Brabant, who ended up with Dessie's death. <br /> <br /> Ben Jago, played by Christopher Eccleston, is considered the main character of the film. He did not provide sufficient evidence that Dessie is cheating Othello with Michael Cass, played by Richard Coyle. Instead, he just made friends with everyone and gave one reason why she “deceived”. In the play, Iago took much more persuasiveness, so that Othello would even suspect something. This change made the film more about rage for the wrong reasons than what the book was based on. Nevertheless, the film really had a few positive points. This turned the army scene into a more racist group against blacks, where Othello is the chief police officer. These scenes are made believable raging crowds and burning lights. You can feel the amount of racism in the film, more than in the book. This book reproduces the modern scenes of the day, making it much easier to understand than the Shakespearean times in which it was written. In the play, Iago (Iago) is tortured at the end, but in the film he gets his satisfaction and gets Othello. position. He never gets what he deserves, and he is never caught for telling Othello's lies until it is too late. I saw it as a fall in the film, because I feel that the villain is given his treasure of promotion from a lie, and in the book he is discovered by Rodrigo. In general, the film could have done better, based on the play, than what he did. I feel that the film director missed some of the most important parts of the play that were mentioned either there to make the flow of the game, or to make it more tragic. I would say that you should first read the book in order to understand all the events that occurred in the film, otherwise you may be lost and confused.
