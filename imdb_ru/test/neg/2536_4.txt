Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon start in Switzerland, as the world's greatest detective Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) tricks the Nazis and managed to take out a brilliant scientist named Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Junior) from the country and in relative safety London But is it safe London, as Holmes thinks? Dr. Tobel developed a new revolutionary bomb that would permanently change the bombing from the air, and he agreed to hand it over to the British government, but these Nazis also want it so much, and Holmes's enemy, Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atville), plans to steal the Secret Bomb Sight and selling it the Nazis. Add the clumsy inspector Lestrade (Denis Howe) from Scotland Yard, the love interest of Dr. Tobel Charlotte Eberly (Kaaren Verne), the murderers, mysterious scientists and mysteriously coded messages, and Holmes cut out his work to support Dr. Tobel so that he can deliver his scope ... <br /> <br /> Director Roy William Neal Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon were the fourth in a series of fourteen Holmes films filmed between 1939 and 1946, featuring Ratbone and Bruce as Holmes and Watson . The screenplay by Edward T. Lowe, Scott Darling and Edmund L. Hartman is based on the short film Dancing People by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is not a secret Holmes assassination tradition, since this is more of a wartime adventure story. Neglecting what Holmes is, uncovering complex crimes and riddles is a big mistake, as I understand it, and the participation of the Nazis and the war, since the background of the story seems out of place, awkward and just doesn't sit well with me. The dialogue is not great, Professor Moriarty feels almost like an afterthought, as if they could not come up with a villain for this, and in general it is much less attractive than others in the series. However, at least it is short. <br /> <br /> Director Neill does his usual effective work, but you have to relax a little and keep in mind that this was done more than 60 years ago. He does not have a real style or imagination, and also lacks the atmosphere and intrigue. <br /> <br /> Technically, film is normal, if not impressive, black and white cinematography is good, although I understand that a version with a color computer image is available. The action is fine, Bruce and Howie make their usual embossed turns and Ratbone's hair looks ridiculous in this, and I am glad that he changed it for future releases. <br /> <br /> Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon were disappointing compared to some of the other excellent entries in the series, I can not recommend it very much, and everything that made another so good seems to be missing here. Leave it to the last and see first some of the best, only for fans.
