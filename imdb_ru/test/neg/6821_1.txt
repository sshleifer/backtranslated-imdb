I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I'm sorry. good, very good production, very good actors, also funny. But this type of movie with a dog (Rex German, Jerry-Jerry American) with private detectives, with a fairly rich woman. ??????? ??? Hi producer, how many films do we have with the same plot ?????????? What's on your mind when you shoot scenes like a dog with a doll. Or any king of this canine activity ????? Micro chips that can make you rich? Micro chips that spoil the state? Got three master chips, wow? And the chip maker can't do the same chips again? Hi, wake up. can give us something smarter than that? Best, D
