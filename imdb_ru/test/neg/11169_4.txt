Nowadays, Asian horror films are considered among the best in the world, known for their atmosphere and a reflection of modern society. This is not one of those movies! Instead, “The Record” is a mediocre slasher film, very derived from American films, such as “I know what you did last summer” and “Scream”. The plot is familiar - 5 teenagers accidentally commit a terrible crime, but cover it up with an oath of secrecy. A year later, they are being pursued by a maniac who wields a knife (with a clearly not terrible disguise of a hospital sterile mask and orange overalls). It does not help that teenagers are generally an unattractive band (this is one of those films where the killer motives seem quite reasonable), and there are a lot of silly stories to continue the story. The direction of the film is unconvincing, more influenced by MTV than modern Asian horror films (such as The Ring). The last third of the film is not so bad, providing some decent waiting scenes, although there is probably one “turn” too much at the end. 4/10
