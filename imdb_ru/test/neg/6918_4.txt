“The scientist has developed a serum that grotesquely distorts the hands and heads of the victim. The scientist decides to use his serum on a concert pianist to extort money from him for treatment, and also to take the man’s daughter for his wife, ”the DVD cover Abstract reports. J. Carol Naysh (as Dr. Igor Markoff) plays Monster Maker in the low-budget mode Bela Lugosi. <br /> <br /> Mr. Naisha serum causes a real disorder, "acromegaly", which the American heritage defines as "a chronic adult disease that is characterized by the expansion of the bones of the limbs, face and jaw caused by hyperactivity of the pituitary gland." Ralph Morgan (as Anthony Lawrence) plays a sick person with some dignity. Pretty blonde Wanda McKay (like Patricia "Pat" Lawrence) is the daughter that crazy scientist Nash wants to; in the early scenes, Ms. McKay and Naish are having fun. <br /> <br /> Watch Tala Birell (like Maxine) in an amazingly good performance; she plays somewhat like Garbo and long-suffering assistant Naish. Miss Birell definitely steals the film; and you must question Dr. Markoff's sanity by rejecting it. Glenn Strange (like Steve) and the crazy gorilla (Ray Corrigan) add to the fun. Monster makeup (Maurice Seiderman) is very good. <br /> <br /> **** The Monster Maker (1944) Sam Newfield ~ J. Carroll Nash, Ralph Morgan, Tala Birell
