Like other films of the worst director, Ed Wood, this film is very bad, but because of this it is also very funny. Maybe not for everyone, but I laughed a lot. Strange thing when you like a bad movie. How do you rate it? As the film is very low, since the entertainment is at least slightly higher. <br /> <br /> The film tries to explain what a transvestite is and does it with the help of a scientist (Bela Lugosi) and an inspector (Lyle Talbot) who talks to a doctor (Timothy Farrell) who knows about these things. The doctor tells the detective story two stories, and this is what we and, apparently, a scientist can see. The doctor tells these stories because a dead transvestite was found, suicide, and also because of the headline in the news paper about the sex change. The first and longest story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself), who is in love and is about to marry Barbara (Dolores Fuller), but he never told her that he likes to dress like a woman when his name is Glenda. The film tells the same thing over and over again, especially the fact that a transvestite is not necessarily a homosexual. The film almost says that being a transvestite is not bad, but being a homosexual is telling us that the transvestite is not a homosexual. The second story is about a transvestite who really wants a sex change, and not just wants to dress up as a woman, but he is much shorter and less interesting. <br /> <br /> A few things make this movie bad and funny. How the story is told is the first, how the same things are told again and again, and how the conclusion from all this is different. This is not where it ends. The game is very bad, especially, Dolores Fuller seems to be reading his lines right from a small screen somewhere. Everything she says is ridiculous. All the dialogue actually caused me quite a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> There is also a sequence when someone enters a room. The door remains half open, and we see something hanging on the wall, not entirely straight. Then the door, similar to the same shot, although we know that this is not so, becomes a little less open, and suddenly the thing on the wall hangs straight. Ed Wood did not mind leaving such mistakes in his film. Maybe this is good, because basically itâ€™s just another laugh for a modern audience. I think you understand that this is a bad film, and I think that there is a high probability that you will laugh at the ridiculous mistakes.
