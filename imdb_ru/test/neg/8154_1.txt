The only thing I expected from this movie was a smart talking motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This movie is just awful. I gave him 1 star, which of course means that I really enjoyed it. Bad game, bad writing, bad direction, bad combat choreography. The only real actor in this film is Martin Landau, who, of course, plays the villain well, although the character is your standard cardboard cut-out evil director / villain. Even the so-called “plot twist” at the end was not a shock. <br /> <br /> There were so many jokes in this movie that I really enjoyed it. And he had some impressive car stunts. <br /> <br /> How are bad movies? Check it out, oh. Want a good movie? Not here.
