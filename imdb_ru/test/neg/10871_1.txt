Larry Bishop directs, writes and leads this soft core porn, the plot is less a biker film about nothing to do with anything. To call it one of the worst films of 2008 is to be kind to the junk I spent money on in theaters. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I felt sorry for the girls mostly, who probably think they are in the process of making a feature film, when in reality they all do porn. They walk on the set for four days, make some kind of sexual remarks to disgusting old people - thirty years older than them - then take off their clothes and run naked for four days on the set. I can only assume that it was Larry Bishops, the only way to be mortgaged. You see shot after shot right on the girl's ass. Shot after shot when Bishop approached some random chick and grabbed her most intimate places, as if he was shaking her hand. I don’t understand how this nonsense was even funded. Why Tarantino has his name, I don’t know, but he has been slowly fading away since 1994, so I can’t say that I was surprised. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes you have such a terrible feeling that only a terrible (and I mean terrible) movies give you. When you see it in cinemas, the pain you feel increases. After 15 minutes, I wanted to cry for the fact that I was so stupid and was spending not only my time, but also my hard-earned ten dollars. In the film, there is not a single redemptive quality, not a single moment that would cause any reaction or demonstrate any kind of tendency for these people to have an idea of ​​what they are doing. If you do not often see naked women, then I think this film will be for you. If you are eleven, you will probably like it. You can't even laugh at it, because every jerk laughed at the shit they did. The game is terrible, the scripts are terrible, the production is terrible, the direction is terrible. Not even worth the time to rent to see a car accident. Stay away, stay very far. You should not even read these reviews. I didn't even have to write.
