This film is so bad that they won't buy it in my second-hand CD / DVD store. I only own it because it comes in the box I bought for the deadfall masterpiece. The store bought two other films that I was selling from a set of four discs, but they didn’t buy The Underworld, and these two other films reviewed their rank, so what does this film say about this film? So I tried to sell it back to another store, which even bought the budget DVDs that you could buy for a dollar at a local store, but they also wouldn't buy Underworld. This film is bad at all levels, and is one of those that came out due to the glut of clones after Tarantino in the mid-90s. The only thing that can be paid off a bit is Dennis Leary, who tells Joe Montagne that he is a “stinking friend” and calls him “Mr. Smelly Friend.” This line is so delightfully awful that I cannot fail to quote it at least once a week when describing a stinking friend. But now, when I enlightened you with this quote, you do not need to feel the pain of watching this movie.
