I should know better. I’ve seen too many of Rob Low’s early works to expect something good from this film, even if it’s about hockey. <br /> <br /> Here we have another weary sports theme. A child has the potential for greatness, he can go far if his cheeky attitude is not screwed up. And, boom, he comes out of it like that damn player, somehow a champion. Is that all you can say about sports films? Of course, there must be other feats that athletes undertake. <br /> <br /> However, this film should be one of the biggest cheeseballs. The interaction of each person is just silly, and not in a silly-funny manner. And I can’t think of any supporting qualities that could revive my position. Neither the actors (of course, not Swayze, who plays the reluctant mentor Lowe), neither the story nor the music, and quite a few of the commercials. <br /> <br /> I’m usually a fan of 80s films, even if they are usually a little fishy (like the North Shore, baby karate), but it’s not even suitable for good 80s litter For a good sports movie of the 80s, check elsewhere. There are many of them.
