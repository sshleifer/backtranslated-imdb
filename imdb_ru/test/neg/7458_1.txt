In this film, everything is bad. everything. Funny haircuts 80s. Funny mustache. Funny fighting and fighting scenes where you can see that the opponents do not even beat each other. Bad, bad, bad music of the 80s. Repeat scenes of people running through the woods. A bad guy with a silver plastic hand and silly hair. Dumb dialogue. The game does not exist. Everything looks very cheap. This film even surpasses Plan 9 from Space in its absolute viciousness. <br /> <br /> It's not “funny bad”, just bad
