The plot - in the future, when almost all men were killed by a virus aimed at the Y chromosome, the (hot) female genetic engineer "creates" a man in a chemical laboratory - it intrigues. Despite a somewhat promising premise, the film failed in almost all respects. The dialogue is ridiculous. Characters are paper thin. The study of the same-sex world is small. The worst part of the whole movie is the Asian detective who supplies the lines so stupid and invented that you want to tear. <br /> <br /> I cannot imagine how this garbage appeared on earth. Most of the film is a male beating. "All men are cruel." "All men rape women." "Men are only animals." It seems that all women - even "hidden heterosexuals" - show anger towards men, fear of them and hatred towards them. If you want to watch a sci-fi film that looks like the background of this film, you should look elsewhere for the best.
