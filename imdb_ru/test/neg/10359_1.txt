I read the positive comments on this film. I guess the people who were in this film probably came to this site to give him a good press, because it was one of the worst films I have ever seen. I always watch the whole movie, despite the quality or absence there, which explains why I watched this whole movie, but I do not think I laughed even once during the duration of this movie. The jokes were mostly very bad, but when the jokes were promised, the delivery stopped. If you like it, maybe you should put off your kidneys, because you need to save the 5 or 6 brain cells that you left. This film had a bad script, a bad game, bad direction, a weak plot ... nothing virtuous and not entertaining. If you have not seen this movie, do not.
