I, like many others, believe that the epic “Lonely Pigeon” of 1989 was one of the best westerns ever created, perhaps THE BEST. And, realizing that most of the sequels (in this case, the prequel) will certainly disappoint, my expectations were low. Comanche Moon justified this expectation with his marginal directing and acting, poor caste and, frankly, a lousy script. <br /> <br /> “The Lonely Pigeon” created the Western heroes “Captains McCray and Cal” thanks to the incredibly strong performances of Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones. Before we lived in the Lonely Pigeon, we believed that they bravely fought to rid Texas of bandits and wild Indians during their years. <br /> <br /> If I only saw the Comanche Luna, I would have thought that these losers were a couple of incompetent, cowardly idiots. In the Lonely Pigeon, Coll and McCre allegedly chased the Blue Duck throughout Texas, and he never managed to catch or kill him. In Comanche Moon, Colla’s heel shot convinced him to sit down and raise cattle. In the entire miniseries, there was no decent fist fight or skirmish. The best blow was that McCrea sucker hit Ines Scull, a funny scene, but unusual for McCray. <br /> <br /> Where was McCray's mind and charm? Clara's love for McCrae, drunk, unshaven slug and philander, was completely implausible. And Maggie's love for the Call, passionless and sullen lonely, defies logic. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was excellent, superior to the original. The loan goes not only to HD technology, but also to the filmmaker. The Luna Comanche mini-series was better than anything else on TV for three nights, but unfortunately it says little.
