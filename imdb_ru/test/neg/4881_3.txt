I saw Bogarde when he was released in the 70s. It was one of those pictures that got X points for violence. We snuck into our local shredder, and still saw. Pretty good picture. A lot of blood from street fights, although cheap sound effects for beats took something away from him. And a lot of sex. I remember one of the earliest scenes when Bogard meets this pretty brunette in the apartment she shows him. Without saying a word, he picks it up, puts it on the windowsill and nails it. From what I remember, the picture sailed from that moment. So when I found out that Bogart was also called Black Fist and was available on VHS, I ordered it online. I was very disappointed. Black Fist - Bogard, edited for television. So many scenes I remember were missing, I wondered if it was really the same picture.
