<br /> <br /> I was delighted to have read a number of opinions about the Circus from “amazing, breathtaking, brilliant” and most things, right up to Golden Turkey. I am in the last camp. <br /> <br /> The producers obviously thought that if they had mixed a lot of excessive violence with barricades of four-letter curses, they would have another “Castle, Stock and two”. Smoking barrels on hand. It is a pity that they forgot to include wit, style, charm and talent. And it was certainly a mistake to attend the classic “Lady of Shanghai” Wells, which reminds us how much better a movie can be. <br /> <br /> John Hanna takes off his shirt at every opportunity, Huge American drives around in a mini-minor, because the Circus is pathetically tense because of its cult status, and even the beautiful Amanda Donohue cannot add a single class to these hearings . <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good British film try the sublime `Wonderland '
