This little cheap movie is only remarkable because it is the worst movie Abbott and Costello have ever made. It's terrible in all respects: noisy music, terrible choreography (notice the awkward lead dancer), silly special effects and scenery, wooden actors (the presenters are barely at the high school level in their profession and were not heard later) . The best times for the comedy duet have come. Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd are much preferred, as was the television series that was sometimes inspired. But skip this.
