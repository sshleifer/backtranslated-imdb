Obviously, this is not Piranha, directed by Joe Dante and producer Roger Corman. It was not so obvious when I bought a DVD for just $ 2.95, because the DVD cover matched what was in the Piranha comedy / horror film, even the DVD menu (without features, of course) matched the cover. Halfway through watching this strange film, my friend and I began to think, where is PIRANHAА? As soon as the film reached its climax, we realized that we must have watched the wrong film, as we saw the trailer, which had completely different frames, the advertisements on the back of the DVD did not match the story we watched and the captions (actors, producer, director) were also completely different. Instead, we got a melodrama in the jungle about a girl and two guys who go in search of diamonds and face a cruel animal hunter. This tamed, exploitative thriller is boring and meaningless and only slightly amusing for the old school, the values ​​of the camp. It is strange that a DVD can be made with the wrong tactical film, but I believe that it is easy to make a mistake when seeing that they both are class B films with the same name, made in the 1970s. Reading other posts made on this film, I noticed that I am not the only one with the wrong DVD movie. How can this be an international error? Maybe there is some kind of DVD phenomenon when unsuccessful films try to get recognition by putting the wrong DVD? WHAT'S GOING ON HERE???
