As a kids movie, it's great. For a family, it just sucks. I sincerely hoped for something like “Guni”, this is a great movie for all ages. This film was too enthusiastic for children with a silly script and characters who called each other little names, like booze breath. ??? Alan Cummings was, however, admired. And why people compare Willie Wonka with this film ... simply because there is a thematic song that is very similar to the song of Willy Wonka, does not make this film something like Willy Wonka.
