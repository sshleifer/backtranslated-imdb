I was really looking forward to this movie. After reading a few reviews before the release, it sounded like a really good movie, one of which was beautifully shot, and the other with an interesting actor (Nicolas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hurt.) It could be all these things, BUT, it is it's boring that I challenge almost anyone to get through it completely and keep attention. In addition, Cage's attempt to speak with an Italian accent is terribly bad. He is such a good actor that I cringe every time he spoke in this film. <br /> <br /> “Disappointment” seems to be the reviewers most often used here to describe this film, and I completely agree. <br /> <br /> I think it didn't take long to talk about how bad this film is, because, like Cage's accent, it's not very good.
