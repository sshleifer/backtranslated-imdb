In the real world of art, Elizabeth Würzel is the sexy drama queen that every guy wants to do, but no guy wants to wake up nearby. Her image on the screen, Christina Ricci, is an ugly artsy girlfriend who desperately wants any and all boyfriend, but no boyfriend will touch her. That is why the Nation Prozac, the 2001 Würzel film of the 1990s with the same name of the bestseller, which was not released in 2001, poses immediate problems. Well, problems begin before Ricci fainted, which has an emotional thimble range. Is it not surprising that her best acting was in two films about the Addams family? First, she looks weird - with big eyes and a bulging forehead, which makes her look like the Starchild embryo from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Secondly, she always plays whining idiots. But, thirdly, this is how films try to create the impression that any guy will be attracted to her. In one scene of the film, her buddy Ruby (Michelle Williams) and Liz go to Harvard, and all the guys' languages ​​wag at Ricci, and not at the super-sweet and sexy Williams. Hey. Reality check time. This material was requested for the treatment of Andy Warhol. Here is his version of the film. Five minute shot of a hypodermic needle. Five-minute snapshot of Würtzel's hairy pudding A five-minute snapshot of her sleeping naked and stoned on the bed. She gets up, gives the middle finger to the audience. Cue loans. You see, less than twenty minutes to drive away Würtsel's whole life. And, oh yeah, the Warhol movie would not play Ricci. Even Michelle Williams would have been better, and if I saw Ricci's pale breasts, I would take everything that Williams or any other baby offered me in cinematic terms. Ricci - almost a kiss of death for the film, and how it continues to work, remains a mystery. Think about her performances from mediocre to bad films, such as Monster, Sleepy Hollow, and Else Else, Woody Allen, also starring Jason Biggs, and now introduce another actress in her role, and immediately may seem better if not excellent. She is the female equivalent of commonplace, wooden, dairy actors such as Tom Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio.
