Let's summarize how stupid this film is, with two details: Arnold Antichrist: “Let's see who is the most despicable,” said with a cool face. And you can say that they did not try to be funny. <br /> <br /> Do you think Arnold will fight the evil of all evil? <br /> <br /> Blessed water, crucifixion, priest. .nooo! with a bazooka, and even Satan did not expect them to be so smart. <br /> <br /> After a fascinating start (which reminds you of the devil's advocate), it does not go anywhere. Someone will give me back these two hours of my life. Never watch it, rent it, so as not to buy it. <br /> <br />
