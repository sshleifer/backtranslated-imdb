I thought the movie was secondary. The acting was good, but not great, the story was funny, but it didn't work out. The director threw the ball in this film. It was not James (Jim) or Tea. IMHO it was the music that killed him. There is a scene where things are going awfully, and Johnny Cash's music is playing - dude, that depression (not funny) killed my mood. After this, the film could not recover. The deportation scene had a potential funny situation, good acting, good tuning - I even grinned, but the music was again not suitable for the scene. Music kept me from participating in the film. <br /> <br /> I say that he had potential, but he was poorly executed, I would even say, I rushed into the final production. Reminds the prequel of the exorcist: the beginning. The release in the theater was good, although after watching the film I did it, but the exorcist released the film: dominion was damn better. Same story, just a different director. The same should be done here.
