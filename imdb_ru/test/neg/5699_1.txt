I rented this film because I love Kristanna Loken, and I watched her on many television shows, and since she has her 15 minutes of fame with her new film T3 today, I wanted to check out what other films she had. <Br /> <br /> She's just fine in terms of acting. Not good and not bad either. She makes up for everything, being extremely gorgeous. YUMMMMM <br /> <br /> Rodney Rowland was a real surprise as a hero. He provided the only solid good role in the film. He is a very good actor and probably should be a star of action films. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that Kristanna is fine, but Rodney is fine, everything else in this film is pure garbage. A computer hacker hacks the plane's system off the ground and, using a joystick, tries to crash the plane into a nuclear power plant ... or something like that. And, of course, there are heroes who stand in his way and spoil his game. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst scenarios I've ever seen, and no wonder it was a modest movie. <br /> <br /> What is shocking is that this film was shot in 2001, and it looks too much like the tragedy of September 11th. <br /> <br /> Why do they make such films in the first place? <br /> <br /> Panic * - one star (a waste of too good actors) (also a waste of time) (also known as “Air Panic”)
