One of the advantages of this film (except for the barely noticeable loincloth of Ator) is the funny role of the bad guy Zora. This surprisingly exaggerated villain has a certain ... oh Shakespearean presence that made this film tolerable (hence, 2). I just giggled every time he feasts, raising an incredulous eyebrow for a minion or a hero. A real example of not paying enough. (And this Beard!) <br /> <br /> Now really, what happened to the 12-minute hang-glider scene? Indeed, very, very bad. I can not emphasize this point. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you even want to watch this movie, watch the version of Mystery Science Theater 3000. With these expensive silhouettes, many horrible films have been allowed.
