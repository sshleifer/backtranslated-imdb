This film is a disaster disaster movie. It is full of great action films that only make sense when you drop all sense of reality. Let's see the word wise, lava burns you; steam burns you. You can not stand next to the lava. The deviation of a small lava flow is difficult, not to mention significant. It scares me to think that some may actually believe what they saw in this film. <br /> <br /> Even worse, there are a lot of talents in this film. I mean the acting is actually very good. The effects are above average. It's hard to believe that someone read the scripts for this and let them spend all this talent. I guess my suggestion would be this: if this film is about to start on TV ... turn away! It's like a train wreck: it's so terrible that when you know what's going on, you just have to look. Look away and spend your time on more meaningful content.
