I'm not a snob at the movies. I liked a lot of movies that critics hate, and I hated movies that critics love. However, here I must agree with the critics - “Galaksina” is simply of poor quality. Clearly intended to be a comedy, this has only a few scattered laughs. "Galaksina" has a bad photo; he has bad special effects; he has pretty bad behavior; and production values ​​... well, the kits may also have been made of cardboard. <br /> <br /> Galaxina tells the story of a spacecraft whose crew is searching for a magical object called the Blue Star. ". After a long journey (and some very unconvincing space battles) the team arrives at its destination, a kind of alien world of the wild west. There is a horribly unfunny cantina scene (obviously designed to fake the famous Star Wars scene), the pursuit of space bikers and the final exit. <br /> <br /> The actor tries, but cannot breathe life into this turkey. Stephen Mast and Avery Schreiber have done a better job in other films. James David Hinton is quite good as a member of a spacecraft crew. The late Dorothy Stratten plays the main role, and although she looks great, her role does not give her a chance to play. <br /> <br /> You may understand this film to see Dorothy Stratten. However, if you are looking for a good movie, you probably want to skip this one.
