Why should I go and buy (yes buy!) JACK FROST 2: Revenge of the mutant murderer Snow Snow ??? Maybe it was an explosion of temporary mental disorder? But I guess it’s because I kind of enjoyed the first jack frost. It was a silly but funny horror comedy that had some good effects from Screaming Mad George. This and the fact that on the back side of the sequel was this beautiful photo of this guy, pierced by this giant icicle (from the mouth he had a lot of blood and all that). So I thought: if he is as idiotic as the first, and has nice splashes / blood in him, that should be fun, right? Well, I was so wrong! <br /> <br /> Let me first say that the film deserves praise for the incredibly insane and backward story. I mean a mutant snowman killer on a tropical island that breeds mutant snowballs, mutants that can be killed or damaged only by bananas ??? As much as I liked the premise, I really hated the movie. First of all: while the first JACK FROST looked like a real movie (seemingly making a real movie and all that), this sequel looks like a third-degree series. It has a too-smooth "video shot" look. The lighting is terrible (bright white spots for daylight and silly colors like blue and green at night). The game ... well, don't even go there. Dialogues range from harsh to extremely senile (this Jamaican man was just a moron, saying “man” after each sentence). And when it came to the voice of a snowman killer, all I could think about was Chucky with the seventh rating from CHAY'S PLAY, spewing dumb and supposedly witty, until he killed someone. <br /> <br /> Best joke Was one guy asking, “Why are you talking to your watch?”. And the best scene was undoubtedly the one where this beautiful Asian chick jumped out of nowhere and bathed in the pool completely naked (thank God for that!). Oh yeah, and because of this little scene with the last captions of these two Japanese guys on a miniature ship that is badly duplicated, I also laughed. But the worst thing about this film was: where did everyone talk about bloodshed? There were many cases to show worthy killings. Many people were killed in original ways here, but all over the scenes. As I read in many other comments, there really were good settings for an explosion of the head, a crushed body, protruding eyes, a torn tongue ... but at crucial moments the editor breaks off blood from the floor or nothing. This frontal shot of the British guy who was pierced (from the back cover of the DVD) was not even in the film. I only saw this particular murder shot from the back (that is, I did not see sh! T!). I waited for this for the whole movie, and then I didn't see anything?!?! What a disappointment! Maybe I saw a cut-down version of the film? It would be a shame, because only a decent amount of pleasure could save this film if you ask me. Seeing a lot of snow-killers turned into bloody pulp just didn't cut it for me. Speaking of these snowballs: they were made very badly. They made MUNCHIES look like modern animatronics. But I think that's the point. At some point, the effects team even turned to some ridiculously bad computer graphics. Boy, you really have to see it in order to believe it. It’s best not to see him, in fact, because this film is too bad (well, I laughed at it, because it was getting worse and worse). Just stick to the first JACK FROST (1996), and everything will be fine (just having in mind that this is a rather stupid horror comedy, but funny in itself). <br /> <br /> It's funny, but writer / director Michael Cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after JACK FROST 2, and then focused on writing. It turns out that he then wrote two pretty good screenplays of the thriller for “I'm inside” (Ryan Phillip in the lead role) and “Identity” (John Cusack in the lead role). So it seems that this person has some talent. <br /> <br /> Now it would be too easy to give JACK FROST 2 the lowest rating possible. Therefore, I say one point for this nude Asian, which makes skinny dives, and one point for those who are completely retarded snowball. Way to go Mr. Cooney!
