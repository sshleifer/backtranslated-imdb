A moderately interesting start, some pretty scenes in sixteenth-century Japan and a promising idea. But execution? After about fifteen minutes, a comparison comes to mind: "Women cannibals in the jungle of the death of an avocado." Indeed. An expert on the "history of the East" who does not speak Japanese, goes to the tatami without taking off his shoes, and is generally stupid like celery? You are welcome. It looks like a student film: the sets are risky, the action (except, perhaps, for the title character) is close to the wooden one, the plot is completely arbitrary. At least the "Cannibal Women" were funny! It is best to watch with someone who knows something about Japan, just to watch how disbelief is constantly crawling on their face.
