Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) and his wife Joan love to sleep in bed, with their heads under the blanket and their feet on the pillows. They have two children with the same problems, Buster and Petunia. One day Mr. Silly notices that their rubbish has disappeared again. Someone must be stealing him from the curb. He goes to the rollers after the garbage truck. When he finally gets to the landfill, he is surprised to learn not only that “alien garbage” was also stolen, but also that a secret organization’s meeting is being held at the dump. He seems determined to defeat the worldly people. Meanwhile, Petunia and Baster are visiting the police station and the Chinese restaurant in search of their parents, because Joan is also missing. Will they overcome their problems? This is just a stupid, stupid film, the culprit of which is a terrible script. The books of Allard and Marshall are hysterical, and only a few situations from the books end in this film. In fact, Arnold is very good, because Mr. Stupid and other actors are trying very hard to make the film work. The performance is very high, and the dog and the cat belonging to the "Stupid" add a little shine to the film. But this is all for nothing, because the plot wanders and is weak. Maybe someday someone will make another attempt to transfer Allard's very funny books to the big screen. Therefore, if you like to laugh, rent something else while you are waiting for a new production, and, of course, go for the books. But stay away from stupidity, because anyone who watches this movie to the end can hardly be called smart.
