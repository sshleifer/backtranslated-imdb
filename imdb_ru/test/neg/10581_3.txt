Here is a parody that is guaranteed to entertain people in Homer Simpson's IQ range. This is a cheap shot at every great superhero, especially Spiderman and Batman. But it does not end there; The situation gets worse, until it falls apart into a miserable ensemble of a farce trolleybus on a truck. <br /> <br /> For those interested in the plot, you can only watch Spider-Man while under the influence of some hard drug. What you get is a dragonfly ?? an amazing boy who loves the neighbor girl, suddenly inheriting several colossal superpowers. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script is as predictable as waking up in the morning and brushing your teeth, but donâ€™t take it. Believe my word! For children, this is somewhat amusing; For adults, this is a great movie to throw children.
