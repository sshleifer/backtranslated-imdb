I just finished watching Dog Watch. I thought that parts of the film were deceptive with a few implausible ones. The game was not too bad, and the plot was not bad. BUT, as the saying goes, the devil was in the details. <br /> <br /> A few examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Strait on Charlie Falonâ€™s bandage (Sam Elliott) was shown to come from his palm while his knuckles are bleeding. <br /> <br /> 2) Can a detective get rid of a murder victim in a very well lit place? It seemed very stupid to me. <br /> <br /> I'm not too picky about the film, but in my humble opinion, this one is definitely NOT recommended by me.
