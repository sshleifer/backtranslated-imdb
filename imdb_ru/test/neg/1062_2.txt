Itâ€™s as if the Pudgy Marshmallow of Ghostbusters has reincarnated into the body of Rutger Hauer and takes revenge on her pregnant wife! If you see obese Hauer stalking a very pregnant Isabelle Glaser (imagine the tingling sensation in the spine in this competition) sounds good to you, watch this movie! Seriously, if Hauer is what an Iraqi prisoner of war looks like after six years in prison, then hungry people everywhere have to take the bee line to Baghdad prison. In general, the Tactical Attack scores 2 stars instead of 1, because Mike Mitchell is awesome as Hawke. Mitchell burns the screen as a NATO pilot until his plane burns himself (with an enemy rocket), after which the film loses the little inspiration with which he started.
