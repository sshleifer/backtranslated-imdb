Masters of Italian horror Dario Argento called bad fans. And absolutely no backlash deserves. In fact, every time I hear something bad about Argento, I think they really talk about Michele Soavi. He just doesn't get that much attention, because his films have never been so successful in theaters. In fact, his best film, The Graveyard Man 1994, was probably the least successful. Or just did not get attention, he felt that it was deserved, because after that he left the film and began directing television. He never returned. Thus, people really do not know how much worse his other films are, because by the time they saw them, they are already fans of Italian horror aesthetics. This means that you have to accept the fact that they have almost zero meaning and, as a rule, very unattractive films. This is where the church stands out from the flock. Because visually, it is so cheap and looks ancient, that you can smell the dust. But he also has his charms, although they are few. The film work is really exciting, and the musical score is extremely complex and daunting. <br /> <br /> Since Argento is the reason people saw the work of Soavi, I don’t know anyone who caught the Church before Suspiria Argento. and dark red. Soavi is a bit hacker. Kind of like Italian Mick Harris is the best example of a director who prefers style rather than content. The disadvantages of the Church are constant and numerous. The film begins with a rather interesting prologue in which the knights on white horses ride through a peasant village, akin to those you see in any adaptation of Robin Hood, in some old age. These scenes are quite intense, energetic and quickly reach the point. Then we go to the present, where the style of the film takes over. Yes, you can watch a movie. And for about 35 minutes in the present, 1980s, wherever Italy is, the film is interesting enough to introduce us to slowly revealing elements of horror. So now we know that the purpose of the film is to create its horror. And this is for the most part a decent build up. But when the film approaches the middle of the road, we understand that the film is moving, and ... nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple. I think. Two people working in the church, one as a cataloger of books, and the other as a restorer of the wall works of the building, discover the scroll / Holy Scripture, which, according to the person, will lead them to some kind of treasure or priceless artifact that he can sell and get rich. Therefore, he follows his "map" only in order to unleash the power under the church, which causes him to hallucinate, while he gradually becomes a demon that will force all others to hallucinate. Therefore, while he is doing his demonic work, someone to whom he has transferred power kills himself in such a way that he catches everyone in the church, while the demon “contagion” applies to everyone, leaving the black preacher and the little girl who sneaks from the church every night to go to clubs, as the only 2 people who can stop the spread of the plague beyond the walls of the church. This probably sounds rich, and Soavi’s style is much more sluggish than Argento. But never before have I seen such a surrealistically boring film about surrealists. I am not kidding. Absolutely nothing happens in the whole movie! I've already seen expressionist (or impressionistic, I'm not super-graduate film schools) films, but most of them actually show what is happening (for example, John Carpenter’s Halloween). <br /> <br /> This follows quite closely in the footsteps of the Demons of Lamberto Bava films (since Argento was the producer). We are shown the place where a group of people gathers, one turns into a demon, everyone else is isolated, this person infects all but a couple of survivors, then the demons either infect the world, or the survivors receive when the demons die. This film puts all the same elements in place. Except that, unlike the work of Argento, nothing happens. Well, something happens. But only one strange sequence has a range of much more funny films by The Demons of Lamberto. The neck of an accidental woman is pierced by a demon, using part of the fence that he pulls out of the floor. I wonder what's so weird about that? This happens in front of about two dozen people. What are they doing? Nothing. She dies, blood runs from her head in close-up. But all these people do not even notice, although it occurs in plain sight and at a distance of at least 8 feet from them. Maybe 4 people notice that the demon runs up to stab anyone he can when he runs towards her, so they dodge the path. She is killed, and in the frame after her death, everyone just sits idle while the boy plays the saxophone. I am not kidding. This is what happens. This is more than logically incoherent - it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> The scene assumes that the woman simply disappears and no one has seen her die. They all just forget about it. And this 15-second thing is absolutely the only event that happens in the film. I am not saying that this is the only violence, blood or murder that we see. Is not. This is the only thing that we can say that is happening. For example, in one scene a beautiful woman sees herself in a mirror looking old and ugly. She begins to scratch the skin on her face, but when she appears in a few minutes - no scratches. People are devoured by fish, and their faces are crushed by subway cars. But later they find themselves completely unscathed by members of a possessed cult in a scene that makes a terrible heresy — copying the famous scene from Roman Polanski's 1968 masterpiece, Rosemary's Baby, the greatest horror movie ever made, shot for filming. Even if Argento did it, I would be furious!
