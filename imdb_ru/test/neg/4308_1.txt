I knew it would be awful, but not so awesome !!, because this is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, it doesn't matter a damn thing! All characters are boring, and the story is stupid and incredibly boring! Plus End is especially lame! The only reason I rented this piece of shit is because I am a big fan of Michael Dudikoff, however he is wasted here, he looks extremely dull and does not show any emotion! Plus I cheered out loud when the movie ended! It looks like the film has no plot, and there was nothing in it, and Ice-T is terrible (although in some things it’s fine), plus Dudikov and Yvette Nipar didn’t have any chemistry at all. There is one scene that the director tried to make emotional, but he fails miserably, since Yvette Nipar didn’t really show so much emotion, however there is a decent car chase scene, but this is not enough to recommend this horrible movie! plus the dialogue is terrible. Avoid this movie as a plague, not a damn thing happens, please avoid and believe me in this, you can thank me after the words. The direction is terrible! Fred Olen Ray is doing a terrible job here with bad camera work, ridiculously cheap scenes, horrible angles, ridiculous use of footage and keeping the film at an incredibly boring pace. Acting is terrible! Michael Dudikoff is not at all close to his usual amazing “me”, he looks extremely bored and shows no emotions as ever, his character is also extremely boring, since I cannot believe that he subscribed to this piece of garbage, he also doesn’t It was chemistry with Yvette Nipar (Dudikov still rules !!!). Ice T does almost nothing, and also looks boring, and he never convinced me. Hannes Yenike is not very good here, he had some kind of stupid character, I didn’t like him. Yvette Nipar is good, but it was really terrible here, she did not show any special emotions and did not have any chemistry with Dudikoff, and as a result I did not give a damn about her character! Art Hindle (Owen Marsh), Katie Harren (Catherine Marsh) and the rest of the cast are also bad. In general, please avoid the plague! Fred Olena Ray and Steve Latshaw should be ashamed of themselves! BOMB of 5
