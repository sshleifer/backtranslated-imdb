Of all the Perry Mason films that have appeared since 1985, this one is my least favorite. <br /> <br /> I confess that I never liked Diana Muldaur as an actress. It seems that she only knows how to play one type of character - a tough professional woman with an indefinite chip on her shoulder, which for this reason is extremely difficult to sympathize. This is no exception - it works in its own way. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved this film, in my opinion, is Scott Baioâ€™s serious performance as a prosecutor - I really supported him to win, and the film is worth seeing for him alone.
