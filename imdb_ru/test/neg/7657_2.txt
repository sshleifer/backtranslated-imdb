There is more nonsense in this movie than in any other movie I have seen in my life. The special effects are damn awful. For example, closer to the end, when the Concorde falls after the cargo door opens, the thing turns like a toy. The special effects of the Airport (1970) are much better than this crap. In addition, the strength of Concorde, which opens at height and speed, would essentially turn the thing inside out. (This is if it ever opened) But the film has its advantages. Mostly when it ends. This is also stupid. For example. The substance lands on the bank of loose snow, and if it does, it will split into a million pieces. Only 2 out of 10. Instant flop. Great laugh.
