** SPOILERS ** The killer in the film does not wait a second when we see him sneak into the girls ’shower and cut her to death, taking her severed and bloody hand when he leaves. We then get this official prologue, as if we were looking at a true story, claiming that in the late fall of 1985, several horrific murders were committed in a small collage in the Midwest. <br /> <br /> Grandfather looks, and hearing impaired, Sheriff Ron Delboys is puzzled by this murder, and later, when the killings of local college students, all women, continue his race for the state senator, he is threatened with his clumsy investigation on every step. At least twice, Delboys say they will never be another murder if he does this thing, and within a few minutes another murder will occur. <br /> <br /> Finding a golden amulet at the site of each sheriff’s murder Daughter, a collage librarian, Tina finds in this craft reference book indicating that the amulet is a symbol of the witch cult that emerged in the early 1700 immediately after the Salem witch trials . This cult was intended to take revenge on 19 accused witches, hanged by local townspeople as early as 1692, and they went out at night, killing reputable men and women and removing body parts. When parts of the body form a whole person, they are burned in the occult ritual of the midnight fire. <br /> <br /> You can never understand what exactly is happening in the movie “The Cult of Blood”, not only because it is completely unrelated to the story, but it is an increasingly outrageous and current level of elementary school, especially by Charles Ellis playing the sheriff with butterflies Ron Delboys. If he gets into big trouble, even a killer could get him involved. Clumsy Sheriff Delboys eventually finds himself in hot coffee and almost burned alive after he was dismembered. The only reason he didn’t do this was because he seemed to be dreaming about it while under the influence of some strong and unnamed drug. <br /> <br /> There is a strange sequence of dreams in the film, suggesting that a number of respected members of the community are members of a witch cult who is responsible for the killings of accomplices. The film does not explain at all whether the dream that the drug addict Sheriff Delboys had was a dream or a real experience on his part, discarding it all as if it were cut from the film! <Br /> <br /> Coming out of the hospital and choosing a Colorative Collage House, chewing a bag full of MacDonald's cheeseburgers, Sheriff Delboys finally faces the killer face to face. Sheffiff Delboys, to his amazement and surprise, learns that he not only knows who he or she is, but is also ready to let the killer escape! <br /> <br /> The very first filming and video shows. Not only will none of their sane people be so crazy to pay the entrance fee, at least with a video that you can record on top of it. Thank God to see this disaster, but no movie theater owner would dare to reproduce it on his screen without the danger of outraged patrons in a justified demonstration of righteous indignation tearing this place apart!
