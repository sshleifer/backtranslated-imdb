MASTER PLAN: Win the death tournament. One of several martial arts martial paintings, in which an attempt was made to capture the scent of the famous "Enter the Dragon" of the 73rd year, is an attempt by South Africa. The fortress of the villain is slightly different, at a distance it seems like a white fortress in the middle of the desert. The villain himself, a baron or general, is a slightly more perverted version of the “Dr. Ho” or Han form of mastery of atrocities, with strange memories of the glorious days of Nazi Germany. He really wears the full Nazi uniform regalia in some points. His main goal in life is to hold an illegal competition / tournament in martial arts against his Japanese opponent, which is a continuation of their complicity in World War II (my army is better than your army). It sounds silly, and it is, although the suggestion of madness and madness almost works. The main character, Steve Chase (Ryan), resembles the white character of Bruce Lee, who has the same slim and flexible physique, although, obviously, not at the same level of martial arts. I thought he would be the government’s secret agent here, but apparently not. He and his girlfriend joined the Baron fighters team, but decided to leave (what did they think they were getting into?). Of course, it is not so simple. There is a strange sequence when they run away through the desert on a wrecked car with a false sail. It seems these desert winds can work wonders for traveling. <br /> <br /> In the second half of the story, the hero joins the rival villain’s team, and the girlfriend is held hostage in a cell under the threat of rape by the rival hero. The most interesting character turns out to be Chico, a dwarf who is an assistant to the villain; he is loyal to the baron, but sympathizes with the plight of the hero. Most of the battles use the hero's ballet-like abilities, with lots of jumps and slow movements. The sound of the FX is also amplified and exaggerated in an attempt to add more influence to the beats. There are some good fights during the tournament to a climax, but none really stand out. If someone had to choose, I believe that the best is a brutal muscular bartender, presented at the end of the story (he raises the back of the car). You wonder how the hero will kill him at the end, as the brute seems to be discounting most of the punches. The action is very mediocre, descending to camp to a friend who tends to laugh for no reason, as if she is high on the grass, although she is very cute. Some of the training scenes are also hiking, especially those guys who run or roll on the sands of the desert. And with such a name, surprisingly few real killings. Ryan, like Steve Chase, is back as the traditional agent in the sequel, "Kill and Kill Again."
