I remember seeing the very first Underdog trailer last March, I also remember smiling at myself a bit at the time. Of course, it was a stupid idea, but I sincerely thought that at that time the concept could work, damn it, it could not be worse than disappointing Cats and Dogs, could it? Then by December, and I suddenly remembered the film, which I realized how likely it was that the film was sucked, the fact that it was delayed in the UK made it seem inevitable that it would be awful, but horrible reviews just made me realize that it's almost impossible for a movie to be good. However, I swallowed my feelings and went to watch a movie with a friend today, when I entered my screen, I was distressed, it was the first time I saw a movie with a friend and there were only two on the screen! Little did I know that I was going to endure. Perplexity, to put it bluntly, is terrible, it really is. Imagine how bad you might think that this film, and then prepare yourself for the film even worse, is just a pathetic film. Although he aims to entertain children, he simply seems to be an embarrassing mess that seems to offend children rather than let them enjoy the film. The situation cannot be helped by the fact that the story is not too dim, the acting is usually bad, and the film just seems too long, tired and completely boring Saturday animation! After a short five minutes when I thought that the film could be bearable, the film seems to die suddenly and then limp to the already-signed final. I’m just amazed that the movie has actually ever been released, this is embarrassment for Disney, damn it, half their direct sequels are better than this one! What is even more scary is that the final leaves room to continue! <br /> <br /> So let's get down to action (snaps joints). Well, let me be honest, Jason Lee is decent, his voice suits the dogs, and if he was given a decent script, he could do the work of the play. However, with such a tricky scenario, he seems to hesitate. In many ways, this reminded me of Bill Murray in Garfield, Murray did what he could with what he had, but what he had was not enough to make him bearable. Then we fall on human actors, and most of them become violent. Alex Neuberger plays Underdog's friend Jack. What worries me the most is that someone will even take him seriously at the audition. The scene where he flies with the Underdog is perhaps the worst scene in the last few years just because his game is very bad. I have never believed that he was a real person, in fact, part of me is still convinced that he was a robot created specifically for the film! James Belushi seems half-dead in the film, he has nothing to work with, there are no decent lines, he just wanders around the set, waiting to become relevant for the plot that the writers are trying to make to the end, but doing so in a bad way is ridiculous. Fortunately, Peter Dinklag is one of the factors that helps him in this film, he is great in the role of Dr. Barsnister and seems to laugh at this role. He steals every scene he is in, although it is hardly difficult when he shares time on screen with the extremely annoying Patrick Warburton. The rest of the actors are even worse, especially Taylor Momsen, she just needs to finish her acting career right now! <br /> <br /> Underdog also fails in terms of creating something like a funny scene. When the funniest scene assumes that Underdog bites a tin can and makes dog food explode wherever you know something is radically wrong. This can be easily ignored if there was a decent action in the film or a good story, alas, the film is even worse in both these terms. The effects are so unexpected that any scene where the Underdog flies seems absurd, and the dog uses his powers for such a small effect that you often forget that he has superpowers. What is the point of making a movie about a super dog, if the damn dog never looks super? The final fight also borders on embarrassment only because its ten minutes of non-existence, the dog flies, something else happens, something scatters, it doesn’t matter, as it happens for the sake of something happening. The script is also dodgy at best, and just awful at worst. When someone says: “Look, this is a plane, no, this is a bird, no, this is a frog ...”, yes, you read that right, I just wanted to burst into tears right there. In fact, I wanted to leave, remaining forced to see if it could sink below this point, it happens towards the end, so, fortunately, it is not. <br /> <br /> Overall, Underdog becomes the worst movie of 2008 in this early period, and is actually just as bad as last year’s Epic Movie. Fortunately for Underdog, Meet the Spartans will be here soon, and I expect it to be even worse. Therefore, if you do not understand the meaning of my review, avoid the film at any cost, if you want to watch a movie with a dog, then watch “Cats and Dogs”, if necessary buy a real dog, just don’t watch it!
