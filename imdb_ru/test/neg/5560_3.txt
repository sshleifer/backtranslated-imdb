This is a stupid movie. Like many of these karate films, they are poorly written, clumsy, and sometimes just stupid. The action is really not all there, and the film as a whole leaves much to be desired. Everyone here says jive, does bad karate and does a really bad job. <br /> <br /> Watch Skatman Krothers in a small role, he is too good for this film as a whole. Jim Kelly is good at karate, but he's a terrible actor. Gloria Hendry is very bad. All of them, in this film are so many parts that have absolutely no meaning. Estimated love / getaway scene with Hendry and Kelly, what the hell was that? They destroyed this man's guitar, for no reason! <br /> <br /> And here appeared the obligatory girls on the trampolines !!! Now what was that? They were in the film for five seconds, then you never heard of them again !!! Then there is a whole racially charged film element that is cool and all that, but in this film it goes absolutely nowhere. As I said, it's good for a laugh, but don't watch it again.
