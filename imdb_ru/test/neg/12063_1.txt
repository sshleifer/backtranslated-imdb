Camp Blood looked great when I bought it, but when I watched it, man, I was wrong. It's tasteless, acting is outrageous, and the quality of the film is shocking. Being a movie fan, I usually find humor in tragic horror, but sometimes I could not even laugh. Perhaps Camp Blood 2 will be an improvement.
