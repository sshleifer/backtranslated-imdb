What could have been a great movie about hostages was completely destroyed by what seemed to be a bored director ... there were so many directions the film could go ... Vampire slash festival was not one of them !!! The last 45 minutes or as a result the film becomes absolutely ridiculous waste of time. ... and sex machine ?? ... you must be joking! The acting talents of people like Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel (not to mention George Clooney) are completely lost in this meaningless movie. <br /> <br /> Directed by ... Robert Rodriguez, famous for his other horrific films, including El Mariachi, Despair, once in Mexico, and more recently a sinful city ... well-executed the first half ... which makes you believe that you are at an interesting time ... but then, obviously, without a reason, and without any provocation, madness begins ... there are even weak attempts at parody and comedy. .. really annoying !!
