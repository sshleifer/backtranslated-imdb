This film should be included in the annals of the fiefdom as one of the worst of all time. I will not say that this is the worst film in the entire history, just because I have yet to watch every movie that has ever been made. I can not make such high demands until then. The story is outdated, acting is terrible, at best, "special effects" no more than a couple of pounds. dry ice and fan. Someone had to be connected with someone to make this film. Mr Busey sent it by mail! The dog is well trained and cute, which makes it the only redeeming quality in this film "should never have done it." Two hours and 3 dollars of my life I will never come back.
