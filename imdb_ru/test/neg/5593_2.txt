Why was this movie made? What are the creators of this thinking?!?! The first 8mm movie at least had a conspiracy that made sense and was potentially interesting. The first film was about the film industry. This is a sequel about ... hold on ... in the porn industry !! Yes, as if the film industry of snuff films, an industry in which people are supposedly killed on film for entertainment, was generally in the same league as the film industry for adults, an industry in which people shoot other people involved in non-standard sexual activities and situations for erotica. An idea alone should warn you about how badly the idea of ​​just this film is thought out. This does not help the lack of plot, character, action, direction, script, logic, themes, or even sound design. This is an amazingly boring movie that never attracted my attention. Literally nothing works. Why would a mystery thriller film about the porn industry involving murder and betrayal work anyway? I am not very interested in adult films, but I, of course, watched them before. Why would anyone make a film about his evil and that they shot it in the continuation of a film about snuff films? I don’t even know if there is an industry involved in making a snuff film, but I hope it’s not. The idea of ​​a snuff film alone is terrible, and only people who are really sick and bad will be a part of it. I do not think that the adult film industry revolves around murder and torture. I am sure that many people make pornographic films for good intentions, and not get sick and kill people. Never hurt another person. The adult film industry is not harming people. It's about making movies that distract attention for me and are a waste of time. What is this film trying to say? Does not work
