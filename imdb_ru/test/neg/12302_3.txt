There is only one thing that I am going to say about a cat in a hat ... like a KIDS film and a good comedy film, it sucks ... I lost track, how many horrible jokes in the film not only sucks, but T also suits the child. Oh, and, by the way, the way a cat with a hat was talking was annoying ... as for the plot, which I completely forgot. Who cares anyway. I'm not sure why Mike Myers joined him, but I think the authors tried to make him sound like he was in Austin's powers without chatter, and that was too successful - but so much that it annoyed. I do not see him - he is in the bottom 100 .............................. jokes are so sloppy, it's funny
