Not a good movie. Of course, it contains an action, but the effects are not so good for the film '08. The effect of the shot is absolutely terrible. Action is "me." <br /> <br /> This is nothing but Far Cry, except for the names and the very foundations of history (genetically improved super-soldiers go out of control). Super soldiers are very different, mercenaries are different, the situation is completely different (a tropical island in the Pacific Ocean in the game, an island in North America in the film). <br /> <br /> I loved to play Far Cry. I liked the story and the setting. I hated the movie.
