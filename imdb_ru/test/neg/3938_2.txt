Good idea .... shame about the movie itself. Would you like it to be a bit worse and explain more about the characters and exactly who the evil woman was? If she tortured those children, why did they help her kill, and not help others kill her? It's a bit like Malcolm in the middle! <br /> <br /> I think it would be better if he were a little longer and worked in more detail for the characters, although after about an hour I wondered when this would happen. will end !! <br /> <br /> It would be better if the actual characters who killed them were not actually computerized, which kind of made them look shitty. What happened to the character Frankie Mounitz? He fell into a bed of wild roses, so he had to be safe, but the computer game showed him that the game was over, that is, dead. The next thing he shows up with this annoying blonde is to save a guy who is afraid of fire, who, as I noticed, did not hesitate to click the lighter when the demon lady was chasing him !! <br /> <br /> There are too many discrepancies in this film, however, to really enjoy it, you might think twice about playing this new computer game !!
