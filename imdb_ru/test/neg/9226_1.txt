If the following sounds tempting, be sure to rush to the local blockbuster and urgently shoot this film: <br /> <br /> 1. Horrible 60s hairstyles, from a miserable curl to sly ducks. <br /> <br /> 2. The worst child actor in the world, who only cries and says his father in the most annoying voice. <br /> <br /> 3. Lots of stock video footage of alligators and monkeys that don't fit in the film. For everyone. <br /> <br /> 4. Indians stereotypes that use air tubes and talk to you. Yes, and needless to say, they scream around the fire. <br /> <br /> 5. A funny, fake mechanic in a plane crash in which the actors rush into the corners of the cardboard set. <br /> <br /> 6. External shots from 5 that look suspiciously like a toy jet on a string leading around a studio lit with blue light. <br /> <br /> 7. The terrible special effects that the ones used in the first Star Trek series make look the most modern in comparison. (Special mention: glowing blond hair of a little boy. Oh, dear ..) <br /> <br /> 8. Ludicrous editing and continuity, when the background elements move between scenes, the soundtrack changes completely without any warning, etc. . <br /> <br /> 9. Not enough money to hire a professional dancer? Get any lady off the street to talk like an idiot! No one will notice the difference! Eh .. <br /> <br /> 10. “Exciting” climax with quicksand, snakes (more archive materials) and tons of fake blood. Do not forget to also insert a silly song with a "tribal" sound! <br /> <br /> However, the more sensible of you will be waiting for its inevitable appearance on MST3K, when this classic TV show is resurrected, and then you can watch in the spirit that was conceived. Any other kind of pleasure that can be learned from this shit is unthinkable ... not to mention the impracticable. So don't even try. 0/10
