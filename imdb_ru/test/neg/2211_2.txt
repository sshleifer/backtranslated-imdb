Meltdown opens on the scene of scientists preparing for an important test of a rocket system designed to deflect asteroids in the event of a collision with the ground. Nathan (Vincent Gale) mentions some of his fears, but the test seems to be an unqualified success. Then the asteroid falls apart, and the largest piece is pushed onto a straight path of collision with the earth. Fortunately, a huge stone jumps out of the external atmosphere of the Earth and ricochets into space. Unfortunately, a sliding strike is enough to change the orbit of the Earth, and the planet begins to approach the Sun. <br /> <br /> While all this is happening over their heads, police from Los Angeles Tom (Casper Van) Dean) and Mick (Greg Anderson) are at stake. They are supposed to collect evidence against the suspected drug dealer, but the deal they are following quickly turns into a shootout. After this, Tom is given a few minutes to interview the local television reporter, who also turns out to be his girlfriend Carly (Stephanie von Pfeten). <br /> <br /> At a nearby hospital where Mika is being treated for a minor injury. Tom will have a little chat with his ex-girlfriend Bonnie (Venus Terzo), who is a nurse. He tells her that he is concerned about the fact that their 17-year-old daughter Kimberly (Amanda Crew) is dating a man named CJ (Ryan McDonell). As soon as Tom explains to Bonnie that he discovered that CJ has a criminal record, she herself is a little worried. <br /> <br /> However, soon everyone has something to worry about. Temperatures are rising rapidly around the world. Carly is one of the first non-scientists to find out what is really going on. Nathan, who is her brother, calls her to say that he may have a way to survive. Carly calls to Tom; He, of course, quickly contacts Bonnie. <br /> <br /> In a relatively short time, a mixed group is on the way. However, before they can reach their ultimate goal, they must make their way through groups of marauders, cope with a catastrophic water shortage and have time to travel at temperatures that are high enough to kill. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien is a nice guy and I really enjoyed him in Starship Troopers. This may be because he is good at action movies. Perhaps this is due to the fact that he spoke little in this film. In Meltdown, he unfortunately gives enough lines in situations that are dramatic enough to demonstrate his perfectly average acting ability. Amanda Crew is fine too, and Ryan McDonell is also good. Vincent Gale and Stephanie von Pfetten are also both pretty good, but Venus Terzho, unfortunately, is on a par with Van Dien. <br /> <br /> What really makes or breaks a film is the story and the script. Although the story here is normal and in fact has some real potential, the script is simply terrible. The scientific part of science fiction does not exist, starting with the fact that an asteroid pushes the Earth out of orbit, and is aggravated by the fact that the “gravitational balance of the Solar System” may eventually “return the Earth” to its usual orbit. ". When the temperature in Los Angeles reaches 120 degrees, the cars start to explode. <br /> <br /> Do you know what is even worse than bad science? Bad continuity Good, very hot. Why do people in the film wear not only long-sleeved shirts, but also jackets? Why do people rob each other for bottled water instead of turning on the faucets at home? Why are the streets completely empty, and the motorways fully filled? And why are freeways full of unexploded? Almost needless to say that sets, costumes and production values ​​were good, especially when it only makes me say that there was no edit. <br /> <br /> So you take a pretty good idea for the story and combine it with a mostly mediocre game, a terrible scenario, low quality special effects, completely irrational plot twists and bad edits, and what do you have? A film that is even smaller than the sum of its minor parts. I'm sorry to say that I can not recommend anyone Meltdown: Days of Destruction. <br /> <br /> POLITICAL REMARKS: there is a mention of the fact that Congress has finally weakened the wallets in order to finance the tests that will start film distribution. Although the tests here were completely irresponsible (targeting an asteroid with an atomic bomb and ignorance of the composition of a large rock are in fact far from irresponsible and approaching insane), the fact is that such scenarios represent a very real danger to the planet. Unfortunately, we did not track anywhere near all near-Earth asteroids that could ever cause disturbance in some orbit; and our ability to detect something on a collision course with us is limited at best. <br /> <br /> As soon as we discover that we have been hit, we literally have no system to handle it. We cannot launch space rockets with nuclear warheads; the space shuttle is completely incapable of reaching beyond the limits of the earth's orbit, and if this were so, we would not be able to launch them sufficiently or launch them quickly enough to make it matter. I am not too strong in the fact that the government is doing something besides its constitutional powers, but I, of course, think that protecting the planet from the devastation that befell us from space can be interpreted as protecting the country, isn't it? FAMILY FITNESS: Meltdown: Days of Destruction has an R rating for "some violence." Honestly, I haven’t found any violence here, except for a rather typical video game rated T. If your teenagers are looking to see Meltdown, and you can't dissuade them from this, the R rating should not discourage you from letting them see it. However, do not leave younger children in the room along with older brothers and sisters. Although mostly shooting is not too obvious, some of the corpses are there.
