Birth is undoubtedly someone's attempt at originality, but what we have here is art in its most painful, grotesque form, so for that I have my respect, but to be realistic, it doesn’t matter that It's an abomination about, but for the record ... <br /> <br /> In the end, in incoherent horror, we start at an unknown time, in an unknown place. Immediately, we plunge into a psychotic nightmare that begins, God seemingly depressed, cripples himself, I mean, really, like hell, it takes time to finish it all (why not this?) After this super-morbid introduction, something happens, something rises from a corpse, say hello to Mother Earth. What does she do? Well, she gives birth to a thing. This thing would probably prefer to stay in the womb, but this is life. The psychotic, nightmare world of Begotkov welcomes this thing only as it can. This thing, along with Mother Earth, is mutilated by unidentified attackers in hoods, with evil intentions being the only available clarity. From this point on, things stretch like never before. Interesting, gloomy images with a completely decent soundtrack are the main points of the rest. Not to give the impression that I do not recommend this evil, because I recommend, but only once, and only for people who value the dark side. <br /> <br /> From my description it may seem that I am not “getting” a born one. Believe me, I understand, and yes, “Born” is an art if I have ever seen it. Everything in this film, no matter how unrelated it may seem, is significant. This is perhaps the only thing that makes rudimentary art. With that said, most of us need some kind of entertainment value, and this comes from someone who liked The Chooper. Probably the most intriguing first five minutes I saw in the film, but let's be realistic, the next 7 hours and 55 minutes will lead a person to a coma, that is, unless he is intended for some psychedelic purposes, in this case, not put it in your head. But how to appreciate such a uniquely boring masterpiece? Depending on how long your attention may take, it must be either 1 or 10, any other number will simply not be asserted. It hurts to do it, but as far as entertainment value is concerned, Born is simply not the case. 1/1
