The limited landscapes were the only saving grace in the rest of the boring movie. The action was a borderline absurd, in which I blame the script and the script. Nicole Eggert did not look at the role, did not play the role, and was completely unconvincing as a mountain guide. After watching this, I had a feeling that some friends have some free time, and they decided to make a movie. This should be made on the budget of pocket changes. The plot was thin at best, and because of the low level of acting, from time to time it was necessary to ask the question: "Why are we doing this?" I managed to watch the entire movie, but I also asked myself: “Why?”.
