This film is really pathetic in every conceivable department. terrible, terrible, terrible It only takes about eighty minutes, but believe me, you will feel that you are watching the Andy Warhol movie (again, twenty hours in the life of the Empire State Building would surely be much more interesting). <br /> <br /> How to start ... a putrid script, disgusting cinema, so bad its bad play, amazingly gloomy effects, terrible music or just a thin waffle plot, which is essentially like a sieve. This film is an incoherent ruin. <br /> <br /> A particularly remarkable scene takes place outside the cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot the cat, for example, the waitress looks out the window of the cafe, who comments with the average English accent “Damn it.” To fix this woman. God damn it, this is a monstrous monster. <br /> <br /> Everyone should be ashamed of himself. Hopefully, the director will never find funding to work again.
