The network is a film that I have never seen since release, I remember that I gave him a pass to mediocre reviews, and since then, I may have noticed a fragment here and there when it was on TV. Seeing this now, fourteen years after its original release, I am a little overwhelmed by how time flies. Being in my mid-20s, it made my childhood feel ancient. I felt that I should probably exercise before my body began to accumulate fat in all the wrong places. Reduce fat and sugar. Too much coffee and cigarettes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, for me it was the best part of this movie. I would say that the first 30 minutes of this film really took me retro-paradise. Look at those big banks that they call computers. Look, they chat in chat rooms! I remember these shirts! They look ... stupid. And hey, it's even Sandra Bullock stars. The first account! Could you take a look at this. <br /> <br /> Like the film, “The Net” is just an unimaginable, simple and completely routine thriller with cat mice. There is nothing archaic about it, they made them the same as now. Bullock plays a disgusting computer nerd, whose job is to fix software for people who don’t understand "what the whole computer thing is." As it happens, she stumbles upon some delicate information and after her vacation trip ends with her nearly being killed by a sexy lay person who turns out to be a murderer (played by Jeremy Northam, and she should have been a suspicious fact that they are in an American film and this guy smokes and has a British accent!) she erases her "personality." Her house is empty for sale, and after checking it turns out that she now has a new face. Convicted prostitute and impostor, no less. <br /> <br /> Now you can tell it is unbelievable. How could they do this to her? Even in 1995 it is impossible! This is true, but back in 95, many people did not even know what the Internet was. I see that this is a plot that you could have taken then. What is much more disastrous is inconsistencies that have nothing to do with technology. This film is obviously largely due to Hitchcock's films (this is one of those thrillers with a carousel at night), but Hitchcock always made sure that his films were believable. The characters did not behave like bewildered maniacs when they tried to prove their innocence, and the plot did not fit comfortably into a structure in which one obstacle inevitably leads to another. The characters also tried a little before starting the pursuit of blush. Does Bullock's character really have no friends? Could some old school teacher confirm her identity? Or how ... her closest pizza boyfriend? Oh yeah, she orders pizza from the Internet. Nevermind. You figure out the movie pretty quickly. It seems the ex-boyfriend has hope. Do you really think so? You should always count on at least ONE surprise. The network does not offer anything. <br /> <br /> The Internet represents a great danger, it seems, this film predicts. But, if the film were made today, imagine what kind of trouble the villains will have to endure in order to erase the personality. Not only do they have to do all those boring literal things, she will still have her Facebook membership, at least about 100 friends or so, and image tags, not to mention that she can be on YouTube or Linked-In, and her video blog with about 150 daily hits, or a webcam in her house and recording her video on other people's mobile phones, webcams, web uploads ... her IMDb membership?
