I understand that the lines in my resume are not very polite. <br /> <br /> This movie, shot and starred by Scott Caan, Giovanni Ribisi, Don Cheadle and himself, takes 88 minutes. <br />> In this puppy from the movie there is a dog. He is pretty. <br /> <br /> The film opened in 2 US cinemas at the end of April 2007, for one week, and collected all 914 dollars. on DVD in early August 2007. <br /> <br /> It took us about 40 minutes before we turned off the DVD. <br /> <br /> This was a type of film that was played in the bottom half of double counting. You saw the main film and decided to see what it looks like. Perhaps you left before we turned it off. <br /> <br /> 3 actors and young girls in the film did everything and deserve better than this .. <br /> <br /> Ratings: ** (out of 4) 54 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (of ten_
