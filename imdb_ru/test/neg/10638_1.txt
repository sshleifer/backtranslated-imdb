this film is so bad, and HellRaisers from 1 to 3 are so wonderful. There is nothing good in the blood ... a lot of blood, but without meaning and most of the time without originality. film about the past, present (1996) and the future of the puzzle. The creator of the box and his descendants fight against some kind of demon, but nothing seriously binds these 3 stories. Pinhead in the movie ... but this is not Pinhead, he's just a boring bad guy who kidnaps children and kills a bird, and even worse ... he talks too much. What I really didn't understand is why the dog is from hell ????? He cannot be tsenobit, because he had nothing human. Why can a dog be killed by pressure, if another creature from hell can get bullets without problems? Pedigree is largely contrary to the films. For example, Pinhead and Angelica are old friends in this film, but it's impossible for Pinhead to meet Angelica, because Pinhead is just a soldier from World War I, and Angelica is an old demon, and she has lived in Paris since years old.
