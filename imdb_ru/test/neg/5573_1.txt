I see that most of the comments so far have been, if not too positive, then at least positive. I can not understand this. The only explanation I can find is that the people who commented were related to the film because it is one of the worst films I have ever seen. This makes Boggy Creek II and Mutant look like masterpieces of horror. Acting is shaky at best, and for the most part terrible. The whole movie is almost completely black, probably so they can shoot everything in one place. The monster looks like something from one of the worst films of Roger Corman. And the plot ... well, the less said about it, the better. <br /> <br /> One to avoid at all costs.
