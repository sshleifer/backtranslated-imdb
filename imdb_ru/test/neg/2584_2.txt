This is clearly a French film. This is a young group of idealists / revolutionists / anarchists. He moves very slowly. It takes a long time. Big plans. A minute or more dedicated to trying to light up the phone full of hash / opium. A long look at how the group overturns the car and burns it. This is a black and white film. The subtitles were white, so about a third of the time they were unreadable. (Why do they do this?) I came out in about an hour and three-quarters, when it became clear that this picture was going nowhere, slowly. I was not the first to leave. It was the first time I came out of a painting in my long life. (Well, maybe the second.)
