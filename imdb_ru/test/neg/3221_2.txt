My friend decided to rent this thing, fortunately, it was not my money. The story, which could be interesting, is completely lost due to the incredibly bad game and terrible editing / directing. Perhaps this could be a classic because of all the strange surge :) (Gary Busey character, for example) ) where the film itself failed miserably. In short, a waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> 2/10
