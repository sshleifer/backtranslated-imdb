I was really looking forward to this title. It sounded and looked like fun. The idea of ​​making a movie with a monstrous monster of the 50s would be a good laugh, but instead this title is just boring. First of all, there is almost no Froggg in the whole film, which is the biggest disappointment. I need to sit more than 75 minutes of insane drama and dialogue in order to take a look at Froggg, who is loading her naked chick. What for? In addition, there is no funny plot in the film. I mean, give me something more interesting than just a bunch of talking heads. I wanted some hot chicks to look for a creature in the swamp, I wanted some cuties to drag its lair into a desperate need for salvation (Creature from the Black Lagoon), I wanted to see some stupid Froggg fighters go for a kill or maybe avoid a silly trap . Something exciting! Damn, have fun with it, be creative! Who wants to watch endless and tedious dialogues in a movie? My advice to directors: Go on, your concepts are good, but your performance should be much more inspiring. Have fun with the creature, add humor to the action and most importantly ... add more creatures to the movie about creatures !!!
