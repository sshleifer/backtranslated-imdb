This proves how terrible the WB network was in the last few years of its existence. As a home school student, I, of course, regret this show because of its ridiculous, fantastic land, vague and unfunny stereotypes that the children are "strange hippies, so clever that they are alienated from super-cool students." Sorry, viewers, the world that is visible from inside your ass (obviously, contains your head when you wrote this show) is NOT the world that we, talented people, see with our eyes when we live in a small thing called reality. As for those who really liked this show ... please, dear dear Jesus, PLEASE rethink the statement that you really liked this nonsense during a very long walk. Acting is even more empty, false and wooden than the stereotypes on which the whole show was built. Thank you WB for doing the right thing and ridding this horse of all-consuming suffering. This show never, never should have had the privilege of being made, no less than eight horrible episodes. I really hope that these actors eventually got a hint and stopped playing roles on shows like this once the show was over.
