I was so excited to see the cast in this film that I was completely surprised at how completely WRONG was this film. I love John Voight, but I have no idea what made him be part of this parody. Biblical accuracy did not exist, and I, frankly, could not help but watch a movie with my children. My children were surprised, because even THEY know that they didnâ€™t even think about Lot when Noah built the ark. I think NBC should be ashamed of having allowed producers to mock the Word and cause even more confusion in a world that barely knows the truth as it is ... PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS FILM !!! I thought about burning my copy, but I have all the intentions to write to the producers and send them references to the scriptures, which they MUST read before making this film !!!
