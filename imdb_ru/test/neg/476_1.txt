Guys, what can I tell you? I am Bulgarian. I can't remember how many times I spoke with the Americans, not to mention the fact that they have no idea where Bulgaria is, but they say things like: “There is a war going on, right?” or “I never imagined that people in such a place as in Bulgaria have the Internet”, or watch Bruce Campbell’s film The Man with the Screaming Brain. I was interested to know about this film, because 1) I'm a fan of Bruce Campbell - the “Evil Dead” trilogy and “The Adventures of Brisco Jr.”. 2) The film was shot entirely on the spot in Bulgaria, the second after the "Alien Apocalypse", which is also almost not visible. 3) I like good bi-movies <br /> <br /> Well ... The film tells about our country as an endless Gypsy city, where they attack your car, wave their weapons, and can kill you at any moment, And Bruce's line "Bull-Hult-Bulgaria" is more than offensive. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Keach make a great team, Bruce does his job - beats himself and everything. There is nothing more to see here. <br /> <br /> People gives this film 10 only because of the cult status of Bruce, but he does not deserve more than 3. Loss of the film.
