Well, in my opinion, Hero and Terror are a bit below average. Yes, Chuck is a real martial artist and he kicks in this film, but he is rather slow and, in my opinion, acting is mostly not up to par, although I think Steve James is doing a decent job. Like my friend Ryan, I was embarrassed why the psychopath decided to go to the theater at the end of the film, and not to follow the girl of Norris. Before that, the killer killed only women. Oh, well, I think it was not as predictable as I thought. Definitely a movie you can transfer.
