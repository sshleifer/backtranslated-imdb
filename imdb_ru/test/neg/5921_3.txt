I'm just going to write more because it is required. However, the summary I placed at the top is too verbose for what this film was. You pretty much know who has been involved since the beginning. Despite his attempts to twist the plot - the current "talent", struggling to look shocking and disturbing when there is a turn - you never need to be surprised at the "who" in this "secret". <br /> The more I write, the more I feel bad that I have to write so much to get a comment, but the rules are the rules. I am very sorry to talk about it, but this is the lowest rate I have ever rated in the movie ... I think. It makes me think about what I save votes 1 and 2. Nevertheless, I thought that this film deserves 3, as I believe that there was some talent in the film. Joanna Watts (or this Watson) did a pretty good job. She cried and was confused in one part, and I thought that she conveyed this emotion well. The man who played the role of "drummer", also coped well with his short role. <br /> <br /> Many of the actors did a great job. But the main actor David - he forgot his last name (badly with the names) - was pretty bad. I think he must have thought that he was doing dramatic shows for Young and Restless or Days of Our Lives. If you try, you can simply portray him in a white lab coat playing a doctor with several personalities in the General Hospital. It does not help that the film is even filmed as day soap. Although Iâ€™m almost sure that I could make the same movie with a video camera; although without obvious and soapy sound editing. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I thought that the money for renting this movie was wasted. Although I would not watch it again if I had not been paid a large amount of money.
