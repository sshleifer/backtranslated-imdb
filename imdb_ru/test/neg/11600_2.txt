First: a warning. <br /> <br /> I recently saw this movie on DVD in the Hitchcock Collection series. The original print looks in immaculate condition, but the image is a bit soft, which means that it can be a copy of the second generation directly from the video. The frame is too hard, so all the songs are terrible. Even the title of the film is cropped. From other reviews of IMDb, I found out that there is a much better version. <br /> <br /> Mr and Mrs Smith are just a footnote to Hitchcock's career. <br /> <br /> In his long interviews with Francois Truffaut in the sixties, Hitchcock gave a comprehensive overview of all his work, but all he could say about this picture was that he did it as a favor of Carol Lombard and what he did not understand the characters, so he simply photographed the script of Norman Krasna. <br /> <br /> Truth be told, you don’t need to speak anymore. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy from the same form as one night, his girlfriend on Friday. and Philapdelphia Story. Carol Lombard is a typical courageous wife who finds out that her marriage is technically invalid, has quarreled with her husband on the most contrived excuses and considers most of the picture “delightfully” unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Robert Montgomery is doing quite well, as it should be for her husband, but it’s hard not to lose patience with him. Long before the end of the film, viewers say: "throw a stupid cow, it is not worth it." <br /> <br /> Gene Raymond plays the best friend with whom she is engaged. It is assumed that he was a polite southerner from the "old family", although this is not obvious from his accent and only becomes apparent in the drunken scene (which he usually plays very well). He is a noble, generous, sincere gentleman, so of course he is being bullied and patronized by Robert Montgomery and made a lot of jokes - although he’s not as badly treated as the similar character Ralph Bellamy in “His Friday Girl.” br /> <br /> It seems that this film was made by people who knew about comedies only by reputation, but in fact they were not seen. For example, a good comic comedy has a strong central idea with many current comic threads that constantly intertwine and overlap. Here, all the elements of comedy are simply strung like beads on a necklace. This is a worm comedy by numbers. <br /> <br /> The same with direction. As a rule, these comedies are racing at an ever faster pace, which is nearing the end of hysteria. Hitchcock does not understand this. His direction is somewhat sluggish, and the picture becomes a majestic sequence of scenes that seem slightly rewritten (but undernourished) and a little too long. He was never a particularly good director of actors, so he simply allowed the actors to continue. They are fine. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock had a good sense of humor, which he often used in his thrillers, but he did not feel the comedy as a genre. His later problem with Harry was also a misfire, for the same reasons as in this film, but at least he was involved in this picture. Here he just goes through the traffic. <br /> <br /> All the people associated with this film were good professionals, so this is not particularly bad. It just seems a bit derivative, familiar, too long and ultimately quite flat. <br /> <br /> Mr. and Mrs. Smith - one for Carol Lombard fans and only for Hitchcock.
