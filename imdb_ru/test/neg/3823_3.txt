Some of the reviewers of this film were extremely “generous” with praise. I personally was disappointed because I was optimistic about these reviews because the opening credits began to roll. <br /> <br /> Too familiar storyline looks like this: a deformed boy and his father live in a swamp in Louisiana. Local boys make fun and torture him. Local guys give birth to the Terrible, sorry, I mean the cabin of Victor Crowley, in which he caught fire. Dad tries to save his son, formerly known as Eddie Munster, meets an Elephant Man, but instead accidentally introduces an ax into the head of a child. Victor becomes a murderous ghost that tracks down the unfortunate ones that are in his possession. Ohhh ... scary. <br /> <br /> One thing that I appreciated at Hatchet was that he never took himself seriously, and some jokes even made me laugh. The fact is that I am tired of the slaps of horror polished in Hollywood. I like to laugh, and I enjoy a good scare, but this film also did not bring a solid dose. As for Crowley, who will be the next Michael, Jason or Freddie ... Pumpkinhead has more chances.
