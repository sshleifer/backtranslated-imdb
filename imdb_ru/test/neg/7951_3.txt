Have you ever watched a movie when, after its completion, your left thought about what it was all about? Well, say hello "Scream, baby, scream." It's not that the story is complicated or something like that, just in three completely different modes ... 1. A funny film about drugs of the 60s ... 2. A much replayed soap opera ... and 3. horror film (with very little to “Scream” o). Much to my surprise, I found out that it was written by one of my most beloved, Larry Cohen. Well, I believe that even the best need to learn by trial and error. <br /> <br /> Playing the same way as something from H. G. Lewis (only with less fx), this “bad” movie has its advantages. For most of the short time, a pretty cool jazz score sounds, and there are some unforgettable scenes ... one of those where a group of kids decide to experiment with acid and make a nice long motorcycle ride. to the zoo. Camera tricks that the director uses to show their hallucinatory state are simply backward, but funny. Believe me, when I tell you, there is no need to run away from home to catch this!
