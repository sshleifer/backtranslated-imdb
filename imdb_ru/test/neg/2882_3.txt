I will not fail to admit that Haneke has above average skill in cinema. For example, I appreciate the fact that he lingered on unobtrusive, natural daylight conditions as a powerful way to bring about a strong sense of realism. However, as regards the content of this film, I am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still a need to pathologize attitudes or feelings of domination-submission (and / or BDSM practices). The problem the main character has with her mother is incredibly relevant, as is the alienation and misunderstanding that Walter is experiencing (I don’t mean the lover’s disappointment, whom they don’t like as much as I understand; I mean that he looks at her as if she was crazy or like a monk, come on!). I mean, D / s is not new in the world, and I think it’s rather silly to treat this issue as something “fancy” or pathological; This is not so. In general, films devoted to this topic are really behind the times. <br /> <br /> For me, I feel that this film turns out to be quite a program film, concerned about very outdated psychoanalytic theories (isn't it) is it almost embarrassing?), and it has nothing to do with real life and those who is connected with the D / s relationship (personal experience, forums, chat rooms, even recent studies by scientists will show this).
