This is a tedious movie. The real villains are clumsy adaptations (embarrassingly easy to say that the source material was a novel) and a reckless scenario. <br /> <br /> In terms of credit, given that the budget was limited due to the austerity of wartime, the appearance of the film is not at all bad. And with the performances, in general, everything is in order, with the exception of Phyllis Calvert, which is amazing - a miracle, given the potential for victoriousness, the pit into which she absolutely does not fall. Ms. Calvert, who has far less work, is as successful as Olivia de Havilland in Gone With the Wind. <br /> <br /> The only absolutely unbearable aspect of "The Man in Gray" is a horribly conceived image of a black servant boy. It doesn't matter that he has to be a responsive character. Play bad with a white boy in black-faced makeup, it's impossible to get around this example of condescending racism. <br /> <br /> Darkly.
