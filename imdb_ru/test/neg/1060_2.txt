My Caddy Limo was destroyed !!! Well, I had one like him - for several years he drove khoi interloi and many elected on Manhattan. <br /> <br /> It was much more interesting than this film, which I can tell you. Lord, what a bomb - like in rpg go boom. I also drove a lot more stars in my white caddy than it seemed in this movie. <br /> <br /> Robert Patrick is a very serious actor and did a solid job with the nonsense he had to work with. Unfortunately, Rutger Hauer played his role as a red-haired circus clown. If he could not take it seriously, why his audience? The director was supposed to throw off the ass on the set in the first hour of filming. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was written by a 10-year-old and an 8-year-old. Surprised that on the set was not so much. Oh well, I'm a bigot movie fan - so you have to accept the bad to get the good.
