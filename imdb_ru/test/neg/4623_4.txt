Blimey! This James Purefoy looks just like Thomas Jane! <br /> <br /> This is the deepest thought I took with me after seeing the rather discouraging George and the dragon. For a fantasy comedy the story was very boring, and the effects are not impressive. <br /> <br /> The problem is not in acting. James Purefoy makes a good knight, and his various side strokes are not bad characters. I even thought that Patrick Swayze in this role is also a good idea. Piper Perabo with a flat chest also had good potential. I even liked the baby. <br /> <br /> But the story and everything that happens, and the way it happens, was just a. Not interested. Compared to another recent fantasy comedy Ella Enchanted, which was really funny, this film is terribly short. I apologize for the decent actors who were in this vicious struggle. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
