This third release in the Scarecrow series is the best of all. I know, I know ... but how good is it? Well, let's not be stupid. It's still pretty bad, but compared to the first two, it's a good movie. Again shot on digital, with decent lighting and good camera work. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> When the college's baseball team begins to mock new members, the person remains in a diabetic coma. Of course, it is left on a corn field tied to a stuffed animal. According to legend, the boy's soul is transferred to the body of a stuffed animal, which comes to life and is awfully revenging, well, almost everything. Employees travel to the beach, which is very close to the corn field. On the sunny beach, one after another whistling scarecrow kills them. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Brian Katkin does a credible job of bringing the much-needed drama to the film. Unfortunately, the drama jumps over good and lands in a common cheese. Most of the acting skills were fair, but there were really awful moments, including a horrible piece of poorly done word sync. Some conspiracy points were left largely unresolved, and most were used to get someone one so they could be killed. Again, better than in the previous parts, but still not enough.
