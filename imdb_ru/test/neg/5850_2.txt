If you are a slap fan with terrible writing, terrible play and clich√©s after cliches, then this one is for you. <br /> <br /> Too many to list the reasons why this film sucks. In a brief overview, people with a total iq of 100 travel to New Mexico for a $ 200 million race. And yes, they are all obviously superheroes, as they can do many things, such as jumping onto trains that travel at 80 miles an hour, survive numerous car accidents and endless instances of the frank cartoon Roadrunner and coyote antics. <br /> <br /> If you are a teenager or do not want to think about a film, this film is for you .. No actor other than Lovitz is credible. Lovitz saves the film from 1 with a bit of Hitler. <Br /> <br /> 2/10 (save 2 hours of pain and 4 dollars)
