There is no real story that a movie looks more like a drama documentary about a fly than a real movie, so this fragment may itself be a spoiler. Teen drama about three young Singaporean children (very similar to British chavs) who skip school, run around with gangs, arrange fights, insult people on the streets, do tattoos, indulge in inactivity, etc., etc. And be hard and all the while screaming into the camera complex rap songs. Filmed in MTV style, fast shots, crazy camera angles, tight close-ups and animated breaks. The dialogue may have been clearer in Mandarin and Hokkien’s original languages ​​than in subtitles, and I have no doubt that some of the modern Singapore references will affect western heads, as well as the cultural and political context, if you are not familiar with Singapore. This type of teen film may be the first for Singapore, but it was made earlier and better in other Western countries, for example, La Haine (1995).
