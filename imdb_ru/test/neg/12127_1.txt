This movie was terrible. The game was unconvincing, but it is difficult to say whether someone played well because the composition was so bad. This is one of the worst Johnny Depp films - I strongly recommend not watching it to anyone. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Cry-Baby, I recommend turning it off and just looking at Mr. Depp for an hour and a half.
