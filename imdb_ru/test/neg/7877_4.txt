This is not a good movie. Simply and easily. Take out scenes of hard sex, and you have a mediocre plot, an average game (at best), a foolish guide and a boring dialogue. Add to the grotto and you have a mediocre plot, medium acting, perseverance of direction, dim dialogue, with reproaches of Hard porn. The problem is nothing porn special either. So this is not a good movie, and this is also not good porn. It fails in both cases. They can say that women made this film, and they intended to do it with him, and that with him, etc. But the talk is cheap, the end result is what matters, and what we have here is a mediocre movie with some sex added for shocking value to try to fool you and spend time watching. One of those movies where you prefer to spend time watching.
