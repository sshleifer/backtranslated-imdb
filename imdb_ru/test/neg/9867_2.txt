This is really terrible, the weakest attempt to adapt comics to the film. All that could be bad in this movie is this. Music, acting, lighting, scenery, “special effects” ... the only positive things I can find are that Sue looks cute in her blue tights and that Thing's makeup is almost bearable (only the face). That's all. Zip Do not try to track this bootleg copy; it really is not worth your time. Even the interrupted film “Captain America” of the early 90s is much less painful than squirming in place while you are trying to endure this mess.
