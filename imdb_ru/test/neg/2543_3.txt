Because of the rather dubious plate tectonics, Japan begins to go under the sea. Initial predictions say it will take about 40 years before the country is under water, but the rogue scientist adds even more dubious science and decides that it will actually take less than 1 year! The government thinks he is crazy, but soon the evidence begins to confirm his theory. <br /> <br /> This film about a big budget for disaster follows a formula established by any number of Hollywood films of the late 90s (I suppose that no one has seen them), with the scale of disaster and tragedy showing the nobility of human , Japanese) spirit in the acts of heroism and sacrifice, and proving the power of love or something like that. that is, he is just as naive in his psychology as in geology ... we all know that half of the population will rape and rob the minute they think that the police have turned their backs, and the other half will just panic and be useless. /> <br /> The film has some very nice special effects, but it's not as attractive and expensive as in Hollywood movies. This is at least as nationalistic, without humor and lack of self-awareness as a Hollywood film, and, perhaps, even worse action. He does have an evil chick from the Royal Battle as one of the main roles ... but sheâ€™s not even slightly angry, and therefore much less hot. <br /> <br /> The film is too long, 132 minutes, and it gets worse and worse as it progresses to the conclusion, as a result of which I am threatened with nausea. I, of course, did not care if Japan sank halfway or not, and long before the end I tried to figure out how to speed up the process if I ever find myself in such a situation for real. <Br /> <br /> But he has good special effects, and Kou Shibasaki is still quite hot, so I generously give it ... 3/10.
