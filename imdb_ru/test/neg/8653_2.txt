I had some expectations from this film, because 1. It was a production by Yasha Raj 2. When the songs were first shown on TV, they seemed flashy 3. Star (??!) The cast was new. Well, I have to tell you that I just could not watch this movie. Uday, (with his red lips - what make-up artists thought ???!) Tries to look cool, but without success. I will not even begin with his game (if you can call it that). The "splitting queen" Tanisha with all her shouts and ranting just makes you want to pull her hair in despair. I think Uday was a little more tolerant than she! She seriously needs to take acting lessons from her sister. The story is pathetic ... it's the same old proven formula. Absolutely no originality. In this film, nothing to watch. I wonder why this was done in the first place!
