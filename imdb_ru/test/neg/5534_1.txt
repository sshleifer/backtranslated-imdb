I was very excited when I saw this film at a competition at the Montreal Film Festival. Together with Elephant and several others, I thought that the problem of American violence / culture would be solved sensibly and convincingly for the audience. The press release promised (not many words) “Red Fiddle” for a crowd of gun violence, something that would make us think about our NRA-sho-em-up mood in this country. <br /> <br /> After waiting until after 9:15 there was no place to show at 9:00 (what technical difficulties they would have encountered, outside of me), we were finally allowed into the hall to watch a movie on DV (where did the 35mm post go?), I think I just answered my first question. <br /> <br /> The result was a disgusting mess. We get a “gun” in a vignette with the most unrealistic “biker” I've ever seen (and I know more than a few). Then the film goes into an irrelevant "character development" just because the characters either. stereotypical, b) losers, c) stereotypical losers and / or d) racial cartoons. It will take another 30 minutes to get to the plot, and as soon as we get there, we want empty conversations between couples and / or bikers and pawnshops. <br /> <br /> The film finds its conclusion, but without ignoring any cliché. I didn’t care about the white trash characters that came in contact with the weapon, and the image of the minority characters should cry the NAACP immediately. All these people WILL hunt for a pistol, because they are at the bottom of the public garbage heap, and will look for an opportunity, wherever it is found. at the very least, would provide some kind of revaluation by the characters. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is the unfulfilled promise. The plot plan was great. In the hands of P.T. Anderson or Gus Van Zandt, this could be a powerful piece. But because of a bad script, directing, or because of both, this is a messy mess that needs to be ignored at all costs. <br /> <br /> My main question is: who in the MFF thought it was competition material. Better bury it on Showtime at 3am. <br /> <br /> Art Blose
