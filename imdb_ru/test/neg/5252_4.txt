The future of fantasy has never looked so dark! Christopher Lambert battles the evil demon Grendel in this grim, crappy looking fantasy epic. "Epic" I said? Uh ... there is only one place, so you can't call it an epic adventure, can you? It's a 5 inch tall medieval / futuristic castle, so how did they manage to squeeze all the actors? Oh, I get it, those are where the special effects are. Thumbnail Stupid me. <br /> <br /> Here are a few reasons why you may or may not want to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - Lambert does his sword tricks again and again, just like he does in Highlander. <br /> <br /> - The sets and costumes are amazingly cool (if you are 12 years old). <br /> <br /> - Rona Mitra has a voluptuous pair of hammers that she likes to show off the entire movie. <br /> <br /> - ... uh, Christopher Lambert has gray hair ... <br /> <br /> - Every time they start fighting, this amazing techno soundtrack begins. So why are these medieval killer guys fighting when they need to dance? <br /> <br /> - There is no electricity in this lock, but speakers are installed that seem to work fine. So where is the amplifier? I guess they borrowed it from the techno DJ who released the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> - Look at the climax at the end, which depicts the outrageous demonic creature CGI, coming straight out of any horror survival game on the Playstation 2. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in all this, then look at it (at your own peril and risk), but do not tell anyone what I told you. I strongly suspect that Pinhead visited the film set during filming because there is no soul in this film. In any case, if you want to see how beautiful Rona Mitra really shows some kind of skin, then look at Paul's Verhoeven's Fields of Man.
