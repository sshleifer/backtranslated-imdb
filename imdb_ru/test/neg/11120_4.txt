Apparently, in early 2005, the SciFi channel threatened to release incriminating photographs of John Rhys-Davies and said: "We need you to star in another original SciFi." The scary thing is that he is damn good in this movie. It really says something, as it is a stupid feature of SciFi; You have to put some feeling into it in order to be well-functioning. Unfortunately, no one does. This is your stereotypical film "spinning around" on a cruise ship. A cryptozoologist wants to keep the creature alive, fur seals think that they have everything under control, but they don’t know what they are dealing with, and they all end up dead, the girl jumps into the role of sex sweat in the role of Reese. The daughter of Davis and the creature harass about 100 or so ship mates. For this film it is VERY fast and lively; You never miss or wait for another murder. In addition, however, he doesn’t do anything to distinguish himself, and it’s stupid that this thing crawls across all ceilings and cannot be wounded by Navy SEAL machine guns, but karate can be knocked into submission by Rhys-Davis’s daughter, Kinda went back and forth. , giving this bad boy 5, but for the above stupidity, I give him 4.
