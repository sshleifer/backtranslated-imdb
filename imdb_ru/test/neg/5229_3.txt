This film is based on the novel by Stephen King, in which the mysterious new owner of the store Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) offers every inhabitant of Castle Rock the subject he or she most wants - but for these transactions you must pay a high price. Local sheriff Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) is soon forced to deal with various cruel deaths and suspicious circumstances. <br /> <br /> Below average for Stephen King's cinema: I understand why some people think it's boring. He stretches, not offering genuine fright, and makes the viewer spend time (once again) with a bunch of disgusting losers, whose hatred for each other is terrible. <br /> <br /> I really like the novel, and I do not believe that this dim film does it rightly. Too many unsuccessful changes from book to screen. <br /> <br /> Von Sydow makes Gaunt too charming. We should be scared by Gaunt at the right time, not surprised by him. I also hate that the first deputy sheriff (Ray McKinnon) is written and portrayed as such an annoying moron like Barney Fife. Star Ed Harris looks like he was forced to make this picture his agent, but the professional is that he really is, he really absorbs his teeth in the dialogue. Bonnie Bedelia (as Pangborn Polly's love interest) and Amanda Plummer (in one of her standard mentally unbalanced roles) are closest to creating pretty characters. <br /> <br /> However, it is also dirty and mean. <br /> <br /> Although I’ll be damned if I don’t feel a little strange, watching the bunch of unsightly film characters tear each other apart. The climax has some good blasts. <br /> <br /> I often rate films better than they probably deserve, but in this case I feel that I have to be honest and just say: 3/10.
