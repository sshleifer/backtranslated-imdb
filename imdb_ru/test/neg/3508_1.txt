The slogan of the film “You think you know who you are. You have no idea. ” I reject both the proposed idea that I have no idea who I am, and the alleged assumption that this film tells me who people really are. If people in real life are really like that, then dude, we screwed up. <br /> <br /> Yellow film, which I got late and left prematurely. A film that is so passionate about its goal of becoming the “Racing film of all times” that it overlooks the very tools that the film should use. <br /> <br /> The rules of Hollywood are: if you show something in the first half it should be used in the second half. Thus, the pistol that the daughter is worried about buying her father will somehow get into the story in the second half. Hollywood rules should make dialogue “real” - a concept that is changing with each decade. Is this “real dialogue” somehow less ridiculous than Kevin Smith’s “real dialogue” ten years ago? The Hollywood rules say that we set the stage, and as the action progresses, the camera approaches people - in this film, first of all, so that we can see the alleged shame, humiliation and transcendental realism of the characters. The strings increase, the frame rate slows down, and our heart must break. <br /> <br /> This film is as crudely manipulated as it is meaningless. I have my own prejudices against LA, which I freely admit, therefore, to combat this prejudice, I will not say that this is a natural situation arising from a place, rather, from the author and the director. The author, Paul Haggis, has already demonstrated a taste for controversy in relation to humanity in his film One Million Dollars, in which, at least, there was a director who understood how to make the vision of the film reveal the best ideas of the script. Now that Paul Haggis has his hands on the camera, it becomes obvious that not only does he not know how to write a real, natural human drama, but he also doesn’t know how to photograph or photograph it. Paul Haggis comes from the country of television, let's not forget: from a country of diminished expectations. <br /> <br /> Everything is as obvious as from a television film simply presented for simple minds - Haggis throws at us and again that, although on the surface people may seem terrible, they hide secret pains. This is a good idea, but presented in such a way that all comparison of bad / good has an amateurish feeling. Structurally, the film is divided according to the tradition of Magnolia and other earlier films. Editing is as typical and conditionally “cinematic” as possible - if there is a sharp movement, such as opening a door or a passing car between an object and a camera, editors use this extreme movement to give a cut that occurs there is a more kinetic quality. The problem is that in addition to reducing the desire for movement, there is very little intelligence and thought behind the cuts - everything is stored in books. With the dolls of this disgusting racial strike and the show, Judy not only ineptly copes, but even the curtains fall and rise with incompetence. <br /> <br /> The film is desperate to imagine reality, but there is simply no talent in it. Some of the actors are good, some of the actors are bad, and all the performances are mixed together, discounted by the low, low aesthetics of the film. We have cinematography, which is technically clear: we can see the scene, we have a clear understanding of what is happening. Nevertheless, cinematography is not only unremarkable, but it is thoughtless cinematography and framing, which they consider to be truly inspired. The result is small stylistic flourishes that are recognized, but in fact do not add anything to the drama or pathos. For example - and this is a spoiler - since the father is holding his dying child (perhaps the father was also shot, I take the time to find out), the camera sees his face and gives us the famous Vertigo track / zoom. Dizziness shot !!! It was at that moment that the film became hysterical, and I just had to leave. I had to leave because it was so bad. I left because I was in the center of a crowded theater, and I wanted to express to the audience that I was sick of Hollywood "art" with empty heads, which was full of sound and rage, but meant nothing (according to Bard himself). I hate spending such good Shakespeare mentions on something so surprisingly bad.
