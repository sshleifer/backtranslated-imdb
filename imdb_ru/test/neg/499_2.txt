You must recognize Cimino's contribution to the cinema. He gave us both the most overrated film in history (“The Deer Hunter”) and the worst film in history (“Heaven's Gate”). And before you start with “This is bad, but not the worst,” let me explain. <br /> <br /> For more than 20 years, I listened to critics and avoided “Heaven's Gate” - in fact, it was not difficult, because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to watch this movie. Then, a few days after watching the documentary “The Final Cut: Creating and Making a Sky Gate,” I came across a long version DVD for $ 9.99. My advice after 229 minutes is to find the most negative review ever written about this film (you will find a wide choice), and imagine that the reviewer is Jimino’s devoted mother and that she is doing her best to put a positive bias on her dear son’s film . Then you will understand how great the mess created by Cimino is. <br /> <br /> Although in this film almost everything is wrong, which ultimately outweighs the scale, making it even worse (and the classic "less" than the zero example) - this is his shameless distortion of the story. Although the pastoral association sent a group of regulators / armed men to Johnson County and had a list of targeted names, the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated. On the morning of April 9, 1892, Nick Ray and Neith Champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of about 50 pastoralists and Texas hired guns, who arrived in Johnson County to remove the "rustle". County citizens then laid siege to regulators, who were eventually arrested (or rescued) by the army. Women did not take an active part in the battles, and besides Ray and Champion there were minimal losses. In the end, it was a siege, not an attack - and there were no immigrant wagons who rode around the camp of rules (unlike earlier westerns, it was a device for making a film, not a real Indian tactic). And weeks before the regulatory authorities arrived, a number of Johnson County residents were hanged out without trial, including Jim Averell, the custodian of a modest road ranch, and his wife Ella Watson (whom Kimino resurrects as her two leaders, and even shows mature old age). <br /> <br /> There is no sin in the movie, which is more than an invention of history, if you are going to play quickly and freely with historical facts, then change the names and places to protect unsuspecting viewers who can escape from the film about what they saw actually happened. Fortunately, so few people have seen this film that the damage was minimal. Perhaps it is stern to accuse Cimino of his distortion of history. In any case, he could have avoided accusations with the help of insane protection - the film has a lot of support. If Cimino was insane during the production of the Gate of Heaven, this would explain a lot. But my voice comes down to a “lack of leadership talent,” and not to insanity. <br /> <br /> There is something good in the Heavenly Gate. You can really see on the screen where a huge budget went; expensive scenery, beautiful epic shots from the cameras, tricky dance episodes. Isabel Huppert (a strange choice of actors who actually worked) gives a pleasant and enjoyable performance, although most of her scenes are extremely boring (which happens when the director forgets to give the viewer a reason to take care of the characters). The dialogue is usually strong, if not ordinary. <br /> <br /> But don't fall for the crap this film is experimenting with storytelling by mixing carefully thought-out moments of character interaction with textured theatrical blasts of communal action. This implies that there was a method to the insanity of Cimino. “Experiments” is another word when the director is so lost in his project that a complete story is no longer possible. The simple fact is that there is no evidence that Kimino talked about one scene or tried to control or organize it. What it looks like is that he just released his DP to get the stage action and get an endless selection of colorful shots - 1.5 million feet of free-put scenes. Then he tried (unsuccessfully) to cut it and put it all together in post-production. <br /> <br /> The final battle scene is truly fun, as the townspeople in the grandmothers (perhaps borrowed from the Fiddler on the Roof travel agency) throw countless dynamite sticks at the regulators. Unfortunately, each explosive device does not reach the target and explodes harmlessly. After you see that it happens 50-60 times, you can talk to a woman (one that looks like something from “The Bunch of Wrath”), who puts a huge pistol into her mouth and pulls the trigger. This is probably what Mom Cimino did after writing this review. <br /> <br /> So believe what you've heard about this movie since 1980. This is a careless, detached, poorly changing and historically distorted mess. Valuable only as an example of “how not to make a film” for film historians and as a source of entertainment for those who are aware of the real history of the American West.
