This is so overwhelmingly promising that you want to turn it off after the first 45 minutes. The beginning is very interesting, fair, and someone is being killed. This movie would be better if it were tuned to this setting. <br /> <br /> So, Jill Johnson is a depressed sprinter with guy's problems. I see no point in adding that her break with her boyfriend occurred in none of the events of this story. <br /> <br /> As Jill came home late, her father sends her to nurse Mandrakis in a glamorous house in a desert lake. The children are sleeping, and the maid is cleaning, another empty house aside for their son, who is in college. OK. <br /> <br /> After half an hour, while she is walking around the house on her own, she gets a couple of freezes. Oh, scary. To which her friend comes to the rescue, to come up with a couple of lines about "love" and the like. A friend leaves and goes to his car. Then she throws her keys. Uh-uh ... then the music! DumDumDum ..! She fumbles to pick them up, and gets into her car. Which, of course, does not begin. How clich√© is it? .. So ... She disappears = D Jill, alone again. Uh (Most of this film is alone with her, so there is not much talk). So more trouble, she calls the police. Who said that she could not help her, but she would call back if she had any problems. <br /> <br /> Then she suspects that her boyfriend is calling or her friends and friends are calling. They were, but only once. How should it be very scary? Oh, and did I mention? Her friend just came to the caller ID, and there was a creepy male voice. She is in shock and fear. <br /> <br /> Yes, so skip this. She sees that the light in the house of his son Mandrakis is on. So she runs through the forest with music as her companion and enters. Bleheh. <br /> <br /> THIS IS SO, SPEED, I CAN'T CONTINUE !!!!!!!!!
