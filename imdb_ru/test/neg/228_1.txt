The first few minutes, showing the cold and crisp character of Willis, were quite enjoyable, especially with Jean Smart, but after that everything was in order. This is just a battered big man and a little annoying child from ancient times without any innovation. I know that the cast probably chose this child to show that Willis was just as annoying in his young self, but I found this child ESPECIALLY annoying and choppy.
