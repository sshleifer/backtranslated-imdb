This film is probably the worst film I have watched in a very long time. The game is so wooden that the door could do better. The plot is funny and shallow, and the shown “rugby” is far from reality. I still do not understand the hack, as depicted in this bad excuse for fun. I am not a kiwi, but I know that only someone from the Maori people can perform Haka, and not a completely American white boy. <br /> <br /> I assume that this was done for the American audience in this way, the pettiness and the “end of Disney” are forgivable, but there was hardly any attempt to indicate the basic rules of the game, except for the prison side, where the main character suddenly takes responsibility for the game of American football and makes everyone play rugby. The only thing that is good about this movie was the end credits. It would be less painful to spend ninety minutes inserting toothpicks into your eyeballs.
