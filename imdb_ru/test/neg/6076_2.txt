I made a big mistake seeing this movie. I think this is a lottery to watch movies. Five minutes later, you just realized that it would be a nuisance, and I struggled very hard to stay in my place - the old feeling of “losing two hours of my life.” <br /> <br /> The main problem is that, without even mentioning the entire chain of reviews on “historical authenticity,” the scenario is painful, painful and bad. <br /> <br /> The first thirty minutes could be stretched for an hour to give a believable, real, plot building. Instead, it has shifted from one non-dramatic "dramatic" event to another. It does not make sense to start crying at the beginning of the film, because viewers have no emotional attachment to anything at this moment. And that all this sun-leaving field through the long grass field at the end, what the hell was that? <br /> <br /> Even the excellent Ed Harris could not save it. You could almost feel his pain in some of the lines he had to utter. The most incredibly awful was, for no apparent reason, he looks at the girl when she copies his work in his apartment, she looks up, everything looks a little indistinct, romantic - the lighting (or I sleep), and he speaks with authority in voice, <br /> <br /> MY ME. <br /> <br /> And she gets up and washes it with a sponge. "Wash me" WTF? It's fun. <br /> <br /> And then there was music. A long, long session, when he simply conducted Beethoven, and the 9th symphony poured out from the surround sound in the cinema, and the choir waited, waited, silently standing there, which seems eternal. And then, finally, a huge sound begins. It was amazingly amazing, and, I dare say, it caused tears in my eyes. <br /> <br /> So, in this film two stars. The only part of the film where Beethoven could say exactly what he wanted to say. <br /> <br /> And I believed him.
