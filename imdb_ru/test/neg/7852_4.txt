Paul Muni and Bette Davis monstrously replay, while Archie Mayo's unsophisticated studio hack seems distracted and not paying attention to this racially provocative film, which gets its “bitter ending”, indulging in segregationist views. The dense and poorly designed film falls apart under its own weight for the first fifteen minutes with an uncontrollable scene in the courtroom, from which it never comes to life, as Mr. Muni begins to chew the landscape, screaming in the yard and yelling in an almost incoherent way. <br /> <br /> Johnny Ramirez is a Mexican American on the other side of the track who, thanks to his determination and skill, gets a law degree at a night school in the store. In his first major car accident affair, he only shows incompetence, and his quickly encouraging opponents and an eager judge who recommends dismissing him make him look like a fool. Annoyed by the failure, the evil Johnny gets a job at a gambling establishment where he makes friends with the owner Charlie Roark (Eugene Palitra), who likes his style. The owner stops him on the spot, but there are problems with Mrs. Roark (Davis), who also wants a piece of Johnny. She kills Charlie, engages Johnny and slowly goes crazy before he is acquitted and he can be free from a high society wasp, who coldly explains to him that they are from “different tribes, savage,” and this will never work. When she runs to avoid his rage, she is knocked down by a car. Ramirez sells casinos and returns to his poor neighborhood, explaining that it is better to stay with yourself. <br /> <br /> In addition to this horrific denouement, Bordertown has a number of bad performances that complement the overall ugliness of the story. No matter how unjust he is, Ramirez Muni is so abrasive and arrogant that it becomes difficult to show sympathy for such a fool with a bull's head. Davis is no better than a loyal wife who matches the same teenage emotions of Mooney. Her crazy scenes with Lady Macbeth give no indication that she was going to become the best movie actress of her era. Margaret Lindsay, like Mooney’s American dream, is cold, distant and flat. <br /> <br /> Bad, because Bordertown (and this very), remains an interesting indicator of time and acceptable settings. The rest is just a hodgepodge of bad behavior and boring directions.
