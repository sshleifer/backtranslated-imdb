Firstly, even IMDb is weakened by this film, as the cast list is VERY “gappy.” Even the main characters are missing, for example, Buddy. <br /> <br /> Now back to the film. I love to watch movies, but this tormented me for all 82 or even many minutes. It was terrible. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And the reason why it bothers me so much is that I was very excited to see it beforehand. <br /> <br /> The storyline itself is good. It could be a great movie if everything was done correctly and with a careful cast. Golden Brooks was a HUGE disappointment. Now I see that the only role in which she can be good is a loud, cheerful, energetic sexy chick, which she plays in “Friends”. Melodramatic roles are not for her at all. She basically killed her character, Rachel. <br /> <br /> I like some actors, such as Deborah Cox, Mel Jackson and Darrin Devitt Henson, but even they could not save this catastrophic film. Of course, this is only my personal opinion, that I cannot tolerate Hill Harper as a person, and he also did not help me to love him here more. <br /> <br /> Golden Brooks’s voice really bothered me that I really had to force myself to finish watching the movie. She seemed to be whispering all over her joint. The director, on whom I will not even waste space on the board, he did such a bad job. Editing, photography / camera focusing and almost everything in this film were SAD. Not to mention the dialogues! Absolutely unreal and many times it’s ridiculous (when it should have made you cry and search deep inside yourself). <br /> <br /> As I said, it could have been a very good movie, but it was seriously flawed. I would NOT recommend it to anyone, unless he is a major filmmaker and does not want to see an example of “What not to do” for his future work. <br /> <br /> Have a nice day everyone, Everyone !!!
