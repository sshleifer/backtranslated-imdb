This movie should be titled Guilty in the script. This middle-aged celluloid crisis is not so bad as director Stanley Donen from Singin 'of the Rain. There are several lush scenes of Rio de Janeiro and various meagerly dressed extras that jump together and make noise on the beach to the sultry sounds of samba, but there is something about how to watch Michael Michael Kane with a whiny teenager Michelle Johnson, it makes you feel ... well, sloppy. This storyline is also a complete stretch. Nobody, except the perverted and vain old studio directors in Hollywood, could not be puzzled by this embarrassment. Maybe they are so accustomed to the fact that young girls wear candy, and forget that it is their thick wallets that are the key to their attractiveness, and not their huge glasses of Larry King and yellow teeth stained with a cigar. It is clear that a young and healthy sex shop falls in love with an old man, and with his best friend's father, who turned out to be married? And then rush on him shamelessly? Ugh! This is nothing interesting. It is rather pathetic and grotesque. Pay attention to the budding talent of * young porridge * Demi Moore.
