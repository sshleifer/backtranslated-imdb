I'm a big fan of Thomas Harris, I read all his novels at least 5 times, and I really like the book of Hannibal the most. So the film was my biggest disappointment, and I really do not understand why some people here give it nine or even ten. Either their requirements are very low, or they have not read the book, or both. Even if I had not read the book, I would still consider the film an absolute average and give it 5. The eerie, mysterious atmosphere of the novel does not appear even once in the film, when I first saw it in the cinema, I even fell asleep. Why was Margot Vergere, a very important character, completely omitted? Why did Barney seem stupid ignorance, whose only desire is to make money? And, most importantly, why in the end did the psychological process that Starling went through, caused by Lecter's drug recession? Do not say that the ending was also omitted and completely changed? Well, the reasons Jody Foster again refused to play Starling are well known, and I accepted it, although, like many others, I am very disappointed because I identified her with Starling. For stories such as Red Dragon, The Silence of the Lambs, or Hannibal with such psychological depth, it is very important to identify with the character when they are adapted to the screen, but as the Germans say, this is “snow of yesterday”. Ridley Scott made some incredibly good films, but with this he doesn’t justify his name. Jonathan Demme had absolutely the right feeling for the plot, the characters and their relationship to each other in “The Silence of the Lambs”, he had to play and Hannibal. My only consolation is that I saw the film only twice, this is a long time ago, and thank God, for this reason I cannot see scenes from the film when I read a novel. I'm sorry, but I really can't recommend it to anyone.
