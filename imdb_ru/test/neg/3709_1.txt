ZERO stars from **** <br /> <br /> “Infinite Descent” has absolutely no redemptive values, be it a ridiculously bad game, terribly funny special effects, incompetent leadership, a blunt scenario or an annoyingly annoying Gol musical. This is such a pitiful production that makes me wonder how such a film could even have the slightest relation to being initially illuminated by the studio. <br /> <br /> I don’t think that I’m going to delve into the plot, not to mention the fact that this is a group of people who are trapped under water and have to kill a lot of fake creatures. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you more about what is so terrible about this movie. First, the acting is terrible. Jack Scalia is ten times worse than Sylvester Stallone, and this feat is difficult enough to accomplish. Supporting performances are really no better. And what about the actor Louis Lorenzo, the guy who plays the cook, Francisco. He has a high voice and accent, which is suitable for comedy, but not for a sci-fi horror film. <br /> <br /> The special effects are even worse. Creatures range from bizarre-looking eels to giant starfish and mostquitoes. The effects look as you would see in the Muppets film, and I do not think I need to go into this question. <br /> <br /> Director J.P. Simon has a small cult status due to all the horrible films he makes. made. I’m sure some will like Ed Wood’s “Endless Descent,” but I don’t even think it’s so good. Everything he does is crappy, especially camerawork. A person can not control the film, that's all that is needed. <br /> <br /> This was the last of the four films made underwater, and this really makes Leviathan and Deep Star Six (both bad films in their own right) start looking expert in comparison. In any case, just stick to the Abyss.
