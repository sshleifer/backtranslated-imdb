Famous Argentine horror director Emilio Vierja directs the script Jack Curtis and Antonio Ross. Cheesy and funny in a mix for a method to madness. The doctor's son is approaching his early death, until his desperate father transplants a monkey heart into his chest. As expected, everything will become strange; when this young man turns into a mask in a monster costume and wanders around the beaches, looking for pretty party girls to make him slaves. When heroin is introduced, its beauties become zombies. The monster calls its stunned minions with strange organ music. So bad ... well ... it's just bad. Cast: Jose E. Moreno, Alberto Cano, Mauricio De Ferraris, Gloria Prat and Gina Moret.
