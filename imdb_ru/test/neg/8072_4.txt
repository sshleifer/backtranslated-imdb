Cuore Sacro combines the effects of a glossy film with a story that leaves much to be desired. With the help of the script that the writers of The Touched by the Angel might be too careless, Ozpetek still sometimes interests us. Actually, I wanted to focus on the positive aspects, but I found the last act so strange and terrible that I think that the couple who jumped to their death at the very beginning could have been successful. <br /> <br /> This movie at heart (pun intended) is a story built on a big twist finale. Such a weak foundation can lead to tremendous success, like Tornatore's “Una Pur Formali”, or terrible garbage, like the films of M. Night Shyamalan. Cuore Sacro falls a little closer to the last. I found that cinematography is generally above average. Irina's amazing pictures, dutifully making her trivial knees in the pool, were very impressive, as was the atmosphere inspired by the interior of her mother's house. For me, the grotesque parody of the play by Michelangelo, when Giancarlo comes out of the rain and Irina poses with him, was something of a tension. One big problem that I used in this film was the Ozpetek method - just turn the camera straight into the face of my main character and record the emotions that are going on. It worked out with a fantastic effect in Faceing Windows, but when used here it seems that Bubolova is not Mezzogiorno. In fact, besides the ridiculous story, the main problem of this film is the dairy game of its main character. This made the final scene even more unscrupulous. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ozpetek continues his crusade against our corporate societies, urging us to be more spiritual (not necessarily religious) and more altruistic. And although I, of course, very sympathetic to this point of view, it seemed to me that the audience was beaten on the head with a blunt object. Could the characters be two-dimensional? It seemed to me that this film is very energetic and soulless. Was the “evil” Aunt Eleanor something more than a caricature? This also applies to people on the “right” side, such as “good” aunt Maria Clara and elderly doorman Aurelio. And just in case, if we missed Ozpetek's point of view, he decided to put his opposing forces in his liveries. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the interesting question about how a director uses color. He wears an introductory pair, which briefly flies away in all black, as well as Irene (when we first met her and after her transformation into life), wicked Aunt Eleanor and, of course, kind but bewildered Padre Carras. Black is a color that offers a certain course, the owner's mind is tuned and devoid of emotions. This is the color of choice for this indispensable item of modern day armor - a business suit. It is also the color of mourning, such as a funerary attire decorated with a suicidal duet. Finally, black is the color of piety, such as the simple clothes of priests and nuns, which Irina emulates in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> Another primary color and a very suitable choice for a film about the sacred heart is red. This is a color that has the ultimate emotional component. A character who wears red, bold, emotional, receptive to new ideas and condescending. Red is a risky color in our time; it challenges our perception of the owner and at the same time makes the owner vulnerable. However, red carries a huge weight of history and mysticism, since the earliest members of Cro-Magnon buried their dead in red ocher, and indeed the first person named in the Torah, Adam, is named after the Hebrew word red. Red also has an anachronistic taste, looking back at the past, where red (and therefore less independent attitude to life) was more acceptable. Therefore, when we encounter a room filled with red color (mysterious walls covered with a frieze, complete with a red accented menorah and a red painting “The Whirling Dervish!”) Mother Irina, “good” characters Maria Clara and Aurelio in gorgeous red dresses and finally a picture Irina's mother in an official red dress, and we see where Ozpetek's sympathies lie. <br /> <br /> A few words about the soundtrack, I found that the original musical themes are great for this story. The quasi-barbeque theme, which meant Irene, was gorgeous for her monotony and uneasy feeling of indisposition (the absolute best use of the constantly recurring baroque theme, such as it should be in Barry Lyndon Kubrick, with his masterful repetitions of the 8-stroke attributed to Sarah Gandel). One absolutely inspired choice is a couple of seconds of operatic aria that we hear when power shimmers, while Irene pursues Benny through the house. This is from the famous aria "Ebben? ... Ne andrò lontano" from the Catalan opera "La Wally". Aria is performed by a leading soprano who leaves the house forever. Since Irina's mother was a dramatic soprano, we can assume that this is a recording of her singing and that she rudely says goodbye to her daughter, because in the film Irina will soon soon be destined never to see Benny live again. I have only one small question about the soundtrack, why include the famous tango Yo Soy Maria? I love this song and I personally hear it all the time, but it’s not quite suitable here.
