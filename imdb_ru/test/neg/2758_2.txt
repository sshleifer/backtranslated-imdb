The grim story of morality about a high school student who is now pretty much a stereotypical nerd. He is smart, but he has no friends, no social skills and a lazy loser of his father, who borrows money from HIM. He is attacked by a pretty girl (he should have known that she wanted something — he must be smart, right?). She makes the poor desperate fool write her term paper on Shakespeare, which the teacher immediately knows that she could not write. He loses a girl (not that she ever really had her), his teacher’s confidence and his college scholarship, all in one: <br /> <br /> Marv is so stupid and desperate for love that he decides to rob some heroin dealers who manage things through the warehouse where he works. Then maybe this dirty little slut will be impressed and will want to marry him. Sad, very sad. Marv is such a pathetic fool (and rather brainless for a supposedly smart guy. I mean, trying to rob drug dealers? Did this child get screwed out?) <br /> <br /> The girl, of course, tells her boyfriend about the robbery, which Marv boasted, and persuades him and his minions to steal money from Marv and the company. They are trying to do this, and in the process they manage to shoot several people. At the same time there are policemen, and the idiot Marv is dragged off, a complete disgrace forever. I know that this thing was intended to make teenagers behave by showing them the consequences of bad behavior, but all she really illustrated is the consequences of stupid behavior. Which, of course, is the premature end of your film career. Goodbye, Marv, we never knew you. And thank God for that.
