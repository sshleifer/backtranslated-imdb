Now I saw it all. Just when I thought it could not be more pretentious and tender than the Woodchaper Massacre, just when I thought dialogue and acting could not be worse than Nail Massacre with a weapon, just when I thought “Don't Enter Woods” would retain your title as Lousiest Slasher Film Ever, along with it “LAST SLUMBER PARTY! “Somehow this cheap, wretched dung manages to avoid debauchery, but it remains awful! I could not believe my eyes - this time I cannot complain about excessive (or, in this case, any) nudity in the slasher film, but he still managed to make me crimson from embarrassment for shooting. Never before have I seen such a terrible game, dialect, direction, writing ... I could continue this list forever! Here is a brief summary: <br /> <br /> The mentally ill person somehow escapes from the mental hospital, dresses up as a surgeon, somehow finds out de lives his doctor, and rushes, until the doctor's daughter makes friends for the night. Then comes the stupid murderous spree (torn from the other films, such as "Massacre at the party with an overnight stay" and Halloween ") on this side of the universe. Characters have negative IQs, which means that they are not human. Again, I think they don’t, as they tend to bleed Kool-Aid when they are cut, because the slasher likes to show use when he brings his scalpel to the camera on the PATH for too many scenes. It's only 80 minutes ... how many times should we look at this script before it swallows the whole movie? ... that, I believe, would not be such a bad idea in this case! There is one moment when I thought maybe, maybe the director might just be making it interesting (a second killer was added), but alas! It should not have been! And then, to insult even further, there is a stupid super-otyagryny under-end and even more stupid final conclusion. it makes a lot of sense, but I wouldn’t want to give up the stupidest few scenes in the history of cinema Rea fools (like me) are stupid enough to rent this wastewater. <br /> <br /> I really hope that by writing this, I saved 80 minutes of someone’s life. I get up on my hands and knees to ask anyone who is still thinking about renting it: PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT PLEASE! This is a slasher fan; I know what's good for you! The only real victims in this nonsense, senseless nonsense, are the poor morons who have leaked through the entire toilet tank! Zanatos's score ... since there is no scale of negative points, I have to give her 1, but below the average. Avoid this at all costs .... please !!!!
