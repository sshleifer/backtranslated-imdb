I would give this movie 1, but I laughed so hard, so many times that I had to give it my due, because of the exceptional chance that the movie had to be funny. The film is so bad that you think it was written by a chimpanzee. You would like chimps to write this. The dialogue is so conservative that only he and the cockroaches will survive the coming nuclear holocaust. The film exaggerates its horror by inserting scenes from the original Carrie (a really good film) into scenes from this one. Like blots of scenes from “Taxi Driver” in “Baby Geniuses”. Do not rent it alone, as you will NOT enjoy the experience. You will need someone near you to confirm that you are viewing badly. Worst Millenium actress appeals to poor poor Amy Irving as a monotonous, horribly wooden, stone-faced school counselor. Worst film of the year (see also Arlington Road). --FRINK-3
