This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. No story, no point, it was not even funny, I do not know why people say that this film is funny because it sucked so much !! Felix Bean protagonist sucked. Suzanne sucks. This film was shot in 1996 and really was filmed in the 80s. What more, I will never allow my friend to choose films again. Hmm, the cover of the film said that it was the producers from the super-soldiers who kidnapped them and stole their identities. Wow, what a waste of time. The only thing that was funny was strange, Ricky, he was funny, especially when he and Emily were together. That was funny. Everything and everyone, it sucks, a waste of time and sleep. Wow, I never thought that such a film could be made, so stupid to watch, to watch it to the end.
