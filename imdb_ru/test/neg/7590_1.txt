It must be the worst movie I've ever seen. The part where they lost their daughter there? poltergeist rip off the overtone? just pushes him off the edge with stupidity. I watched it on SHOWTIME, so there was still a soft soft cheese porn scene in it. I have to say it made me laugh at my ass. The 80s 3D effects were very inappropriate. Included an invisible cat and a rotating whirlwind. Uh, I wonder if the people who did this actually feel perfect in life. The actress who plays the wife looks familiar, but she still sucks. Her screams can be used as a torture device in hell for more than Nazi retirees. Anyway, thanks for the show for the super crappy horror movie. I will always enjoy the time when I watched the biggest waist of time and money I have ever seen.
