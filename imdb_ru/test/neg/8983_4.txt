“Carolina Moon” is an adequate television film about a girl with extrasensory abilities that returns to the city where she grew up and where her best childhood friend was killed. It turns out that every year another young girl is killed the same day, and Tory, played by Claire Forlani, must solve the mystery before she dies. Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black, CSI, New York) is the lead woman who copes well with this task, skillfully supported by the rather adorable Oliver Huds and the still bright Jacqueline Bisset. The script, adapted from the novel by Nora Roberts, does not meet the standards, and the plot <br /> <br /> is tiresomely predictable. This, however, is again compensated, as I said, by the rather tasty Oliver Hudson.
