It's just awful. I turned on the spoiler warning here just because I included a couple of jokes from the movie - there’s nothing more to spoil, since it’s already rotten. This scale was made during what was supposed to be in one of the periods “A few dollars more” from the sellers, when he participated in any nonsense for a few bucks. I saw it as a 15-year-old high school student in 1972 and hated it then. No need to view it again; after 35 years, i remember him now as one of the top five worst films i had seen in my childhood. As far as I remember, Sellers had rather a permanent role in a cameo than in a leading role, but even his presence could not soften the stale jokes, the unconvincing plot and the infantile response. One current topic revolves around Sellers using his fingers: in one scene he raises an open hand to a group of medics and, with his fingers folded, lists the groups for which there is a hospital — interns, nurses, administrators, etc. — until he remains only the middle finger, after which he will say "... and patients!" Har Har. In another scene, in order to avoid costly lab tests, he dips a finger in a urine sample and puts it in his mouth to check for sugar, and then encourages trainees gathered around him to do the same thing they do. He then informs them that he has placed his middle finger in the urine, but has sucked his index finger, and convinces them to pay attention. Hee hee (The only reason I remember this and this film and writing this review is because my friend told me an even more stupid version of this "joke" today). If so, you will love me. If not, see “Hospital” with George S. Scott (released in the same year 1972) to find out about some genuine, wonderful black medical humor. Better yet, read Samuel Shem's House of God, and if you can, watch his version of the film, which has never been released (please make a copy and send it to me — I would like to finally see it).
