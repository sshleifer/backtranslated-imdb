This is not a new film. This is the 1994 "Emmanuel, Queen of the Galaxy" reissue, and it has been significantly truncated. A warning. Many characters appear in the credits cut from the film! <br /> <br /> If you want to see him in its original form, pick up the “Queen” - avoid it at all costs, as cuts make it even more stiff than it was originally.
