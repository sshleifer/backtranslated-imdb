Well, last night I saw the world premiere of Paul Schroeder's "The Exorcist: The Beginning" at the Brussels International Fantasy Film Festival. With all the confusion around the movie, this was very much expected. <br /> <br /> The director was there, like most stars (except for Skarsgard). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film sucked a lot of time. It was a real disappointment to me because I am a big fan of the original 1973 Schrader and Friedkin (RIP) film. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with him? Most of this is in fact. FX (you might think that the Matrix and LOTR digital revolution never happened: it was so badly drawn!), Editing (without a real tempo or rhythm), acting skills (from time to time only Skarsgard could convince). The script was, IMO, created to explain African scenes in the original film. Thus, the film had the feeling of a tuned scene, only it did nothing. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was Vittorio Storaro’s cinematography, although I had seen it better (Apocalypse Now). /> <br /> All the time I thought it was just a draft, a work in progress. And this, taking into account (well-known) circumstances, perhaps it is. But this does not change the obvious problems with the script. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to meet Schroeder (very briefly), but I didn’t have the courage to tell him what I thought about the film and I was so nervous (this is the guy who wrote “Taxi Driver for Christ!” ), I forgot to ask him to sign my copy of the script "Taxi Driver" ...
