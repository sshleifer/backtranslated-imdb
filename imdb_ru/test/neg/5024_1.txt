May or may not contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> Inuyasha is not a very good anime. This is actually very overrated. What for? There is absolutely no storyline, no plot, and the show just drags on ... and continues ... and continues ... This is because there are more side stories and fillers than episodes that promote the plot. And fillers are the same stories that are repeated over and over. The same episodes seem to come with the same plot: Kagome feels a fragment of a precious stone, a thing of a demon-worm / mucus / tentacle pops up, Inuyasha says “The Scar of the Wind”, “The Thief of the Soul of the Iron Protractor”, etc. and kills the demon, they get a gem shard, and then we just repeat this scene 160 or more times. <br /> <br /> In addition to the repetition of episodes, there is a repetition of comedy techniques, and they are no longer ridiculous. Wait, they never were. Sexual harassment is NOT funny. The visa rated the series “Older Teens”, 16+. I have no idea why they rated it that way. There is nothing wrong with this, with the exception of the so-called ridiculous sexual harassment, which is kind of suggestive, and which can arrest you these days. <br /> <br /> Now, as we know, Inuyasha is overvalued. Video games. They all suck. Especially the game Mask. I played it in my friend's house. It was nothing interesting. The game was slow, boring, and there was a Nintendo 64 in it, like graphics. In the magazine, he received a rating of 4/10, stating that "... this role-playing game is slower than a milkshake, raising a cocktail tube." Then there are all these stupid Inuyasha toys, figurines, trading cards, stickers and coloring books. COLOR BOOKS! We thought that Inuyasha was 16+! Maybe not ... But after a member of MS Inuyasha participated in MSN, about half of them were between 10 and 13 years old. I think Inuyasha is a little baby anime. (I think a small part of the editing done for this show can be shown on Toonami.) There are over 40 manga volumes. I can only help, but I wonder how many miles of wood have been cut down to make them. Sad ... <br /> <br /> Then there is music. The music is so annoying. We hear the same 5 songs each episode. After 10 episodes, the music becomes really annoying. In other animes, they have music to match the mood, and we don’t often hear some songs. There are about 15 different Inuyasha soundtracks. Do not waste your money on this garbage! <br /> <br /> And do you think I know all this? Because I was a fan of Inuyashi. I am ashamed of myself. I would prefer to see Kim Possible or Pokemon instead. Unfortunately, these two shows have more romance between the two main characters than Inuyasha ever ...
