All I could think while watching this movie was: "Will it ever end?!" It was unbearably boring to watch. I wanted me to just turn it off, but I wanted to make this review fair, so I fought for a good fight and endured the torture of watching this movie all over, so you, a good reader, should not bear this pain either. <br /> <br /> This film sounds like it has a great premise if you read the background on paper. However, this film is not suitable for this premise at all. <br /> <br /> On the first scene in the early 1900s, a shaft shaft was installed, where children are forced to carry dynamite into tunnels that are not large enough. for adults to fit in. It seems that this creates the prerequisites for an interesting film. But after 4 minutes it becomes clear that this is not the case. Adults who have committed these crimes are never punished; The film has no consequences for their actions. The opening scene is much better than the rest of the film, and has nothing to do with it. The last time the opening scene distorted the movie so sadly was the opening scene 28 days later, which was the only good scene in this movie. Wicked Little Things / Zombies (a movie so crappy that they changed the name, trying to hide their stupidity and sell it again), in this respect is absolutely the same. The opening scene is the only observed scene in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, the film flares up to today. A single mother and her two stupid, dirty children. It is here that it would be wise to press the STOP button and never again approach the film. <br /> <br /> In the first hour, children-zombies practically do not notice. They get maybe 3 minutes of screen time, everything. All they do is kill a pig, that's all. The rest of the hour is spent showing that the dumb mother and her stupid children are buying things from a local store, wandering through the woods and having empty conversations with each other. A silly teenage daughter walks around and hangs out with some other stupid teenagers and smokes weed along with them. <br /> <br /> There would be no cause for concern if the children of the zombies sent someone in this film. Each character is both dull and annoying, without any redemptive qualities. Not to mention the one-dimensional and cliché. <br /> <br /> This film would * be greatly improved * if the mother and her dumb children were sent to the new 10 minutes by the zombie children as they drove to their new home, then the end credits would roll. This would immediately change the score from 1/10 to 10/10. Fair! When a dumb mother looks away from the road and almost crashes into a pedestrian on the road, her daughter scolds her: “You almost killed us, mother!” Of course, any sensible person knows that if mother hit a pedestrian, it would be a dead pedestrian and not people who would be safely enclosed in a car. I believe that this line was inserted into the film in order to personally demonstrate that the complete nonsense of the main characters knows no boundaries and works in the family. <br /> <br /> Evil little things / zombies run 1 hour 34 minutes, but it definitely feels like 5 hours or more for me. Trying to stay awake was a huge challenge. Only an hour and 34 minutes later the zombie children worked to kill any person. Then the scene shows how stupid teenagers drink beer, understand the car and say: “If you ever want to sit in my pants again, you had better start the car and get my ass out right now.” Seriously, this is literally from the movie. Teenagers are so picky, one-dimensional, they act poorly, they are stupid and annoying that when the zombie children finally start hacking three of them 1 hour and 5 minutes before the movie starts, it becomes a reason for celebration. Of course, the "Princess", a mute, weed-smoking, drunk, drunken loser, the daughter of the protagonist, goes away with impunity. What a buzz it was! She was on the screen longer than the others, and therefore the most annoying of the four of them, and the most worthy pickaxe for the head. Moreover, the reason why it should have been sent within the first 10 minutes, as mentioned above. However, keeping it about 1 hour and 5 minutes is completely unforgivable. <br /> <br /> The reason for this, of course, is that full-length films must be supplemented with at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. So, leaving her alive for a long time when she should be, they have an extra 27 minutes to supplement the film when she and her mother run around the forest. By 1 o'clock and 22 minutes, this is the second time in the film, when the annoying daughter is trapped in a vehicle where the engine does not start while the zombie children are following her. <br /> <br /> Children-zombies are completely generic. Never say anything. No character development for any of them. <br /> <br /> In the end, all 3 annoying, idiotic main characters live. Which, in my opinion, is the way filmmakers give the final click a bird-like gesture to the audience. In my opinion, the filmmakers probably know that they deceived anyone who had the great misfortune to watch the entire movie. Why not rub their faces into them, not even giving them the pleasure of seeing one of the three main characters, who should have been sent within the first 10 minutes, to die. <br /> <br /> Avoid evil little things / zombies like the bubonic plague.
