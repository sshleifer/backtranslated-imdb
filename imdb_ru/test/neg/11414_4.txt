I am very surprised to see all these positive reviews for this film. Do not get me wrong, I do not like "similar films." <br /> <br /> Although I can very well enjoy a good mindless fighter from Hollywood, such as Die Hard 4.0, I like movies like dogma, or movies like real life as it is, as much as IF they are well made. <br /> <br /> A good example is Festen (1998): there is no music. There are no dramatic views, no special effects, no beautiful locations. Just a good story combined with great acting, and the result is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Are there really no impressive angles, special effects and unusual locations in Nine Lives? Yes. Is this a good movie? I'm glad you asked. <br /> <br /> Answer: Absolutely not. <br /> <br /> Firstly, everyone is delighted with the acting performances. I'm terribly sorry, but you can play whatever you want, but if the story and the dialogue are implausible, the action immediately lags behind. And this is exactly the same with the Nine Lives. <br /> <br /> While watching “Nine Lives,” I never had the feeling that I was watching real people leading a real conversation. I had a feeling that I was watching actors who try to look like “real characters” when they say something that a “real person” will never say under the circumstances. <br /> <br /> This can hardly be called SPOILER, but there are some excerpts from the dialogue below. If you think that reading ten lines of the (funny) dialogue will ruin your movie, stop reading here. If you want to laugh, keep reading. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was tragic. Do you want examples? Many in the Nine Lives. <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE 1: <br /> <br /> Imagine this. A couple visiting their dirty rich friends in a new mansion. A woman sees this castle at home and says to her husband: <br /> <br /> Woman: I can get used to this (meaning expensive house). Man: Don't. Woman: Why not? Maybe. Man: No They are who they are, and we are who we are. Woman: I like this sound - we are what we are. <br /> <br /> Does she like this sound? Her man behaves like a jerk, but she likes that sound. Then an elderly couple passes by, holding hands. This is what a woman comes up with: <br /> <br /> Woman: Look! They are like kids after school. They survived so much. Share everything. I love you. <br /> <br /> Are they like kids after school? And then the most frequently used cliches you've ever heard? Finishing with "I love you"? Is she saying this while her man is a jerk? Yes, very logical, very realistic, NOT. In any case, such a dialogue made me strangle some of the film’s heroes for these terrible, terrible things. <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE 2: <br /> <br /> Elderly mom, dad and youngest daughter at the funeral. Dad: I didn't know that Andrew was religious. Mom: This is for comfort. Daughter: this is for strength. Mom: Life is fleeting. Dad and daughter burst out laughing. <br /> <br /> Yes, this one-line advertising will infuriate me at any time, especially at a funeral! Sorry, I must have missed the joke here. <br /> <br /> And it goes on and on .... <br /> <br /> How about the camera work? Don't even go there. "Boring" will be a compliment. It should look like “realistic”; instead, you miss half the actor's facial expressions (the only thing left to watch in this movie), while half the time the camera is aimed at someone from behind or from the side, and not at the face. Well, do not say that I did not warn you! This is a good movie that can be rented if you want to sort out your date or something else during the movie, because you don’t even care whether the movie will play or not after the first five minutes. <br /> <br /> Overvalued and more boring than watching the grass grow, summing up.
