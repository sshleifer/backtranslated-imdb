So, it came to this. In the top rated film, someone says: "Niche is an honest person." Indeed? This is the guy who basically kills and cripples people in the film. He takes a short break to rob a bank. Honorable? How would you like your children to go to school with the children of someone who considers it noble? Wait, that's not all! The person also says: "We can say that he constantly thinks." How can we do this? Well, did you know the joke "How can you tell when a CEO / politician / lawyer is lying?" ... "His / her lips move." Well, Nishiâ€™s lips never move, so I think that means he thinks. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is existentialism to warm the hearts of the cult of persecution. Allegedly, existentialism emphasizes that a person is responsible for the consequences of his actions. Not Niche. Borrow money from the yakuza. What, they want to return it? Kill them. Cops will find out. Kill yourself and your wife. <br /> <br /> Honestly.
