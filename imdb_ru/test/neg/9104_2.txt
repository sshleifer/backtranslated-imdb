This film was bad on many levels. The script was terrible, so even the best actors could not make this movie watchable. It's a shame because there were good actors in this movie. I mean, if anyone saw any movies from the police academy, you would know that Steve Guttenberg was good. His character in this film was very serious, which greatly distinguished him from the characters I had seen before, so this was a plus. And I really thought that Steve Guttenberg was extremely hot in this film. With or without a shirt, one cannot deny that he has a GREAT body! Sexy face too. I liked the 5-hour view of the shadow, it made it look dangerous. In one part of the film he lies in a shirtless bed, and I must say that I would gladly jump in there and try to distract from my problems! So, to be honest, I would watch this movie again, just to fantasize!
