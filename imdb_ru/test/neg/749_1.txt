My mom, my cousins ​​and I are rather big fans of Jane Austen. We know all the words of the masterpiece "Pride and Prejudice" of 1995, and embarrassed Emma Gwyneth Paltrow several times. I read all the books and even sat a few times "Feeling, sensitivity and persuasion." Therefore, my mother and I thought that it would be nice to see Northanger Abbey on film. <br /> <br /> Bad idea! This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's even worse than the 1998 version of Alice Through the Looking-Glass or Nancy Drew's 1939 film, which I bought at Wal-Mart for $ 1 (my previous “worst films”). The first thing you noticed wrong in the initial scene is that the “heroine” Catherine has a terrible and strange imagination, inspired by trashy novels that the heroine Jane Austen never touches. Throughout the novel, she dreamed dreams (day and night), in which she was attracted by some disgusting man with a fat wig, dragging along a field heading for God knows that everything and suddenly a savvy guy is saved on a white horse. <br /> <br /> The second thing that any viewer of the film will immediately notice is the shrill crying and saxophone music, which should be the soundtrack. No elegant classical music or English country dances here! It is also obvious, almost at first glance, that the actress (due to the lack of a better word) chose the role of Catherine completely excluded. First, it is rather unattractive and even more aggravated by its non-Austenian behavior. Her looks and movements are stupid! In addition, they are completely affected and incredible. <br /> <br /> This sad lack of acting skills affects almost all the actors in the film. Even Mr. Tilney, the supposed “dashing young bridegroom,” is decent. <br /> <br /> As more and more characters appear, the weird taste in the costumes on the part of the filmmakers becomes apparent. Huge hats in the style of Marie Antoinette are faced with (for the most part) properly chosen imperial dresses. The Frenchwoman, apparently, the friend of General Tilney, is dressed in black, like some ancient nightmarish goth - she is strikingly similar to Michael Jackson in a black dress. Her appearance is even more stupid thanks to the HUGE beauty mark in the crescent on her cheek. I also had to think about the historical accuracy of the bright red lipstick that almost all women wore. <br /> <br /> Another anomaly that made my mother and I cry with laughter for about ten minutes was “bathing”. "The scene. The first thing we noticed was that men and women bathed together in a large bath - probably not very likely in the early 1800s. Then we saw that all the women seemed to be wearing big porcelain or plastic plates worn around the neck with threads. The plates floated horizontally above the water, they had some mysterious pieces ... something. We assumed that it was soap, then aromatic herbs, and then, finally, when the mysterious substance beginning to fade between shots, we concluded that it was food. But I still I’m not sure. <br /> <br /> And this is not even half of what’s wrong with Northanger Abbey. I’m warning everyone who is considering renting this film: keep your hands in your hands. And if anyone thinks about BUYING - well, I don’t even know what to say about this. <br /> <br /> You might think that when the actors and other people who made this film got about 1/4 When they pass, they will understand what kind of monster they created, and will stop. Unfortunately, they did not, and Northanger Abbey was released into the world.
