One of the worst Arnold films I've ever seen. The special effects were terrible. The script was terrible. I hope his next film will be much better than T2, Total Recall, True Lies and Eraser (not as good as the others). Look at the Stigmata if you want to watch an apocalyptic movie of the future. This is much better.
