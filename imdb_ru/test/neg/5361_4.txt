This show was hastily, and in many respects depended on unexpected cuts in advertising (when it came back from advertising, noise or “surprise” was something simple, like a mouse) outside of them and fail miserably. Besides, what's with the magazine directors thing? Is this Star Trek? It just destroys the novelty of this show, which quickly passed. The only reason they are being watched is that people want to laugh at the purely anti-climatic nature. They will never find anything and most likely never will. Oddly enough, they always point out that they “hunt”, and guess what ?! This is the light of the tower of a local radio station that blinks red!
