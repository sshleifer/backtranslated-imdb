This is really a big bummer that people can easily make movies because of cheap digital camcorders these days. Usually I would appreciate such an opportunity, but if you watch such films, it’s just a big shame. and it's also a big shame if people like h.p. Lovecraft receives insult from similar. I rented this “movie” because the drops are “H.P. Lovecraft” on it. and I'm a big fan of many of his adaptations, mostly made by Brian Yuzna and Stuart Gordon. This film has nothing to deliver! cheap landscape on the beach and in the old wine cellar. The red light effect of the digital camera throughout the entire film. no actors, just some stupid low-end models who don't know exactly what they are doing, hard as wood. and so must be the director. Obviously, he was trying to create some kind of atmosphere. but since everything is so funny, it just doesn't work. and no bloody effects, just a little blood in the river (you drink = you become a demon) and fall here and there. oh yes, history: Thousands of years ago, some kind of “big old” colonized the world and took people into slavery. then humanity gained its independence, so the "old" tried to destroy them. and now there are some survivors in the post-apocalyptic world. the only way to save humanity is to find a NECKRONIC, which is where it ends up in LOVECRAFT. therefore, these soldiers fight some undead and demons on their beach and in the wine cellar. incredible - all this! but since it is named (German name: “Armee des Jenseits”), and you can find it in most commercial video stores, it seems that you can make money with such things.
