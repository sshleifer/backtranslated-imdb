Tru The call was good, but it could be great. The concept was intriguing and took into account very strange and frightening storylines that could be explored in the future. Unfortunately, the script and the actor fail the show. <br /> <br /> The letter was not so bad, but there were holes. In the 13th episode of “Drop Dead Gorgeous”, an incredibly toxic poison was allegedly used to kill the victim. It was so poisonous and killed so quickly that the victim did not have time to run or even scream for help. However, there was no plausible explanation for how the killer received such a powerful poison. <br /> <br /> In episode 15 “Escape”, an off-duty policeman answered unrealistically. In the second scene of the diner, he (submissively) tells the robber to throw the gun, and when she does not fulfill the order, and actually turns the gun in his direction, does he allow him to turn into a standoff and then turn into a hostage situation ?? the situation itself that he was warned about. His answer was to (would) shoot at the robber when she did not fulfill his order and after she had aimed a gun at him. There are other drawbacks in the stories, but I will leave it with these two examples. Despite the spelling mistakes, I enjoyed the show. <br /> <br /> Another problem I encountered was that I simply could not accept Eliza Dushku in this video. In my opinion, she is too inexperienced and easy to carry this part. She never went anywhere, she walked. and too often she stopped abruptly on her way. <br /> <br /> She also lacked a truly emotional expression or intonation. She has either a thoughtful look or a sweet smile; rarely are other emotions apparent. When she tries to look dramatic, she begins her line, looking away, and “then” looks at her fellow actor. Or, alternatively, she starts her line, looking at her opposite, and then looks away. Both are annoying when they replace real emotions. An example of her lack of intonation is in episode 20 “Two Weddings and a Funeral”, during her second wedding speech she is devoid of emotions (for example, the heart in our hearts). <br /> <br /> I liked all the other actors in their respective parts, and they were all believable. With improved writing and leadership change, Tru Calling may have done so.
