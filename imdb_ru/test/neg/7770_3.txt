To be honest, I loved this show and watched it regularly, but now (thank God!) I don’t understand why I watched it. Sex and the City is one of the most senseless and abusive television shows I've ever seen. I really do not understand the meaning of this show, despite the attempts. People say that Sex and the city are ridiculous. In what sense? Cursing all the time, talking about vibrators and penis size? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the plot: we have four girls who are trying to find the perfect man, sleeping with every fool who comes to his senses. And this show is all about the four spoiled chicks that sleep with every man in the city, but in the end they recognize that the best pleasure comes from vibrators for the penis. And yes ... the show tries to tell us that sex is the most important thing in all respects. If you can have good sex, you are a good husband (or wife). It doesn't matter if you want to be loyal and have a good heart ... size does matter. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is bad behavior. The four main actresses (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattral, Cynthia Nixon and Christine Davis) are so bad and inconclusive that I feel sick from watching this show. Parker shouts and complains all the time, Cattral shows her old tits and all the time says the “damn word”, Davis smiles (and nothing else), and Nixon behaves as if she is bored all the time. And yes ... men are sex-hungry pigs on this show. But judging by this show, women are not much better. This show is insulting for men and women. Women are shown so primitive and insensitive, as if they have no heart, only a thirst for sex. It is insulting to all. <br /> <br /> Sex and the City is one of the worst TV shows, and I'm glad the show ended because he talks about a bad game and meaningless stories. The whole world is not only sex and vibrators.
