I remember when this show came out. It was originally advertised as a mini-series. At the end of the last episode, it said “To be continued” to the dismay of all the people who watched everything that was boring beyond words. It ended as expected, so yes, you can blame the show for having no end. The plan was to have one more, obviously, if the ratings were higher, but it was too boring a show for too long and annoyed people with the fact that they didn’t finish when they said it would be so, so they didn’t do it anymore. Many comments accuse viewers of being canceled and not ending. When the truth is that this is not the case for this show, it ended as planned, it is just a lousy ending.
