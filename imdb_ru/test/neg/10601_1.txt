** Possible spoilers ** Three young people who are on the wrong side of the law get a chance to change their lives and become useful members of society by becoming secret police officers in the Maude Detachment, a resurrection from a popular television series. 60s, directed by Scott Silver. Because of their non-stellar descent, and also because of who they are, and of those they know, Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) and Lincoln Hayes (Omar Epps) can go to places where other policemen cannot, therefore they Captain Adam Greer (Dennis Farina) knocked to sneak into an ominous night spot suspected of being a cover for prostitution. For starters, Julie gets a job as a waitress, and Pete and Link just hang out to find out what they can do. Julie quickly meets an old guy, Billy Waits (Josh Brolin), who turns out to be involved with drugs that are associated with dark matters going down to a bar. Before everything ends, the “squad” is in this neck, and also faces a bunch of wrong cops who are also associated with drugs, and, therefore, associated with their investigation. From the very beginning of the film there is a feeling that you are coming late; as if it is assumed that you know what is happening, as far as the origin and work of the squad. All you get here is a brief biography of three that only gives you an idea of ​​your past; There is nothing about how this all really happened. The idea probably lay in the fact that, in doing so in this way, it could lead to a story evolving faster. While this is to some extent true, some additional background would make the texture of the story a little more interesting; The way it was done here simply undermines the credibility of the whole process. The plot for the beginning is insignificant, and any time spent on character development would be worth it. What is delivered, and at the same time rather unimaginable, is a less than convincing story filled with one-dimensional characters. The performances are satisfactory, but the actors get no help either from the script or, apparently, from Silver; The Danes, Ribisi and Epps are close to helping Julie, Pete and Link, but given the time allotted to them, combined with the lack of support, they still do not give life to these people. Farina, a good actor who deserves more than what he gets here, looks like a caricature of a "good cop." There is a feeling that in this film everything turned out once; some details and nuances would have a significant effect on this stock. The cast includes Richard Jenkins (Detective Mased), Steve Harris (Briggs), Larry Brandenburg (Ekford), Lionel Mark Smith (Lanier) and Sam McMurray (Tricky). It's a shame to see that the acting talent involved here is wasted like this; much more thought and planning had to go on making this film. Like this, it seems ill-conceived and poorly executed. Danes, Ribisi and Epps are similar to the Majors of the Ligers, who are stuck playing for all the marble in the local sandy area; instead of shooting the title, they all hung out to dry. As Terry says in "On the Embankment," "You were my brother, Charlie, you had to look after me." Well, obviously, there was no Charlie here who would look after them, and after “The Mod Squad” they all might just hope that something better will come next time. I rate it 1/10.
