To describe this film is a difficult task. On the one hand, this is a stunning vampire feast with cobwebs, eerie music, hypnotic medallion and, of course, a coffin with a creaky lid. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is one of the most stupid scenarios on this side of Edward D. Wood, Jr., created by the same people who gave us “The Bloody Vampire”, “The Invasion of the Vampires” and the predecessor of this film , modestly called “Vampire,” The film is close to the lack of logic that is characteristic of other films. <br /> <br /> As I already mentioned, this film is a continuation of “Vampire”, which I have not seen. But never mind ... it's very easy to imagine what happened. Dr. Enrique, played by Abel "Brainiac" Salazar, is puzzled when well-meaning, but deceptive Dr. Marion returns the downtrodden body of his vampire enemy, Count Carol de Lovewood (I suppose there is a rule somewhere that all vampires should be that kind of). Dr. Marion complains that all outstanding doctors throughout history have had to resort to some serious robbery in order to advance their medical research, and he hopes to use the vampire’s corpse to study such things as the lack of a normal vampire’s reflection holding a mirror in front of the vampire, and instead of reflection we see the skeleton of a vampire. ???). <br /> <br /> Enrique is not happy and seems determined to give out the events of the first film as just fantasy and superstition. "This man was not a vampire ... I admit that he liked to drink a little blood, but that's all!" He asserts. The fragile Martha is also confusing, a part-time nurse and a part-time dancer (!) Who turns out to be an object of love to Enrique. Martha barely escaped de Lawud's vice in the first film, and, apparently, Enrique spent a lot of time “healing her mind” and making her think that everything she experienced was fake. <br /> <br /> Okay, so if you were the screenwriter of this movie, you would need a way to make someone stupid enough to get a share out of a vampire, right? Well, what about the greedy con man who helped Marion steal the coffin? Looking at deLavud's body, he looks at the expensive-looking brooch worn by the earl, and he conveniently returns to steal it when the doctors are not looking. But damn, he can't take off the brooch because of the stake, so ... you guessed it. De Lovewood is free again, this time with a dark scam, like his human minion. <br /> <br /> Well, of course, the vampire is chasing Martha again, and in the meantime, doctors are really confused about what they believe. At first, they are determined to prove that there is no such thing as a real vampire, and then by the end of the film they are trying to get the police to issue a bulletin on all the items for “a person who is dead but still alive”. ! ". <br /> <br /> You can probably imagine the rest of the plot from here, but the filmmakers really add a few nice turns. One of the sets for the film is a museum of creepy wax figures (are there any other kind of movies like this type?), Complete with a fully equipped torture chamber ... with REAL equipment for torture and execution. The film has a very keen sense of style, and not just on the walking web. In one of the really creepy sequences, de Lovewood stalks the victim along an endless series of streets and lanes following their progress along the vague buildings without doors, while at the same time illuminating the scene like the nightmare of a German expressionist (Dr. Caligari's Cabinet seems to be influential). <br /> <br /> But the rest of the film is minor, especially at the climax of the film. The special effects are pretty rough, even in the year in which it was done, the climatic struggle with de Lovewood in the form of a bat is quite ridiculous ... but the director feels the need to ask us to believe that Martha will faint and collapse right over the guillotine so that her head is in the perfect place to be cut off with a blade that can fall due to the fact that the restraining rope suddenly began to wear out. RIGHT TO IT VERY MINUTE! What a bad coincidence! To make matters worse, he breaks away from the wear rope to the scenes of Enrique, who is trying to dodge the attacking rubber bat, mostly standing still and waving his arms. This is definitely the Ed Wood moment, if ever there was, especially when Martha seems to come to life on her own and hesitates to her feet as soon as the blade falls. Phew! What a relief! As for strangeness, “The Vampire Coffin” does not have the insane factor “Bloody Vampire” or “Vampire Invasion”, but fans of these types of old horror films will appreciate the atmospheric photo and the fact that the Director manages to squeeze out some real chills from this material should “count "Something (ho ho).
