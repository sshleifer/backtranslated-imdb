As usual, another masterpiece in the Vice Academy series (HaHaHa). I don't know why they even bothered to make this garbage. Just another series of cops acting a whore. The defining moment was that the character Ginger Lynn Allen (Holly Wells) and the character Elizabeth Keitan (Candy) tried to seduce the scientist by wearing only their bra and underwear under laboratory gowns. Just a wonderful scene (Ha). The character I didn't like was the commissioner. He was very annoying and ignorant. They should have arrested him. Mrs. Devonshire was also quite annoying. They had to stop this show after this movie.
