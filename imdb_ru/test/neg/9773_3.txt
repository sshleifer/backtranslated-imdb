The name of this film and the clips that I saw made me believe that this film would have excitement and interesting moments. I was disappointed. The sands in the desert were interesting, but this film was slowly moving at a snail pace. It all started well with an underground cave and something coming out, but then tried to engage us in the lives of some very incredible people. When they found corpses or, I must say, skeletons with some kind of flesh, did they start looking for the cause? From time to time it became somewhat different, because something followed them in the desert. Some type of black mud or something that would start to have human flesh. When the flesh was covered, the bag of bones began to crawl after the remaining people. As we learned, the cause of this black mucus was rather bad, ants? Unbelieveable! Then the ending didn't make sense. I guess the motto of this film will be when you have an itch and you see an ant, quickly kill it before the friends of the ant feel your flesh.
