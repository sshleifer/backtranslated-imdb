Robert Montgomery-Mirna Loy is a farce about Loy (Irene) and her fiance, played by Reginald Owen, stuck in Labrador when their plane crashes. (This is really what should have happened to this very predictable film.) Montgomery lives there while he waits for his fianc√©. <br /> <br /> Surprise! Montgomery and Loy soon attract each other. The scene with the bear is so contrived. We knew that it was a tamed bear all the time. <br /> <br /> Complications arise when Clara appears. Loy wants Montgomery to tell Clara that they have to part, when he refuses, she wants to leave immediately. <br /> <br /> You do not need to be a scientist to understand how this will end. Down with all this snow, too cold for everyone!
