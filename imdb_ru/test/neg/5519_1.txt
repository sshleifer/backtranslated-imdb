The acting in this film is great, with some great actors. It was fun to see Fred McMurray as a young man. This is not a comedy. This drama, and clearly comedic cases are pitiful. This is not a comedy. This is drama, and obviously comedic cases are pitiful, and some of them seem forced and far-fetched.

Favorite Carol Lombard “My Godfrey”, because this is a comedy, and although the acting is great, the plotline and the script itself win the day. Carol Lombard is a beautiful and wonderful actress. I will try to see the features of Fred McMurray.
