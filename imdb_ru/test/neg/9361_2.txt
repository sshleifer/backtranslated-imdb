A woman is embroiled in an inexplicable amount of suicide. Again, is this really suicide? It seems like a ghost is free. Guess what? The ghost has long black hair that hides his face, and he moves with his head up or his hands, one way or another, creating a very strange look of a ghost. Repetitive themed music sounds from unexpected places to announce the arrival of the ghost, and bizarre sound effects - which resemble the sound of slamming small twigs - always accompany this ill-fated spirit. Does any of this sound familiar? Well, if you have seen several Asian horror films in the past 10 years, it should be. Busy in plenty and fearless from The Ring, Last Call and several other recent horrors, this film tries to bring an uninteresting and worn out plot to a climax, but we have seen it all before. Avoid this if you are not desperate or have not seen other Asian horror films in the past 10 years.
