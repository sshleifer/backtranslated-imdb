How did this movie go to the Berlin Film Festival? I understand that I got into the Panorama section, but still. <br /> <br /> Screening of this film: <br /> <br /> 1. No plot. 2. Awful game. 3. Brutal videography. 4. Some of the worst graffiti ever filmed. <br /> <br /> The only thing that explains most of his confessions at festivals is the presence of this old expectation: homosexuality. That's right, the only thing that happens in this film is that one graffiti artist looks at the other and tugs at it. Then he feels weird because of this, and they have a boring old talk about “parting” that you might expect to hear from your first hobby in high school (with lines like “First you kissed me, dude”). Yes, and, by the way, this is not “The Game of Tears” ... you see that in the first ten minutes of the film comes a cheerful perspective. In addition, these are mostly just bad labels, poorly dressed “undercover” policemen, a bit of skateboarding and train ride. <br /> <br /> If the subject is interesting to someone, I recommend searching the Internet for some underground graffiti videos made by real graffiti artists. There are a lot of things ... and they are damn more interesting than this crap.
