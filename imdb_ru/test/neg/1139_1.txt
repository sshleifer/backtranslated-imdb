Absolutely the worst experience I've ever experienced. I think my eyes began to bleed. I actually got sick at night after watching this. I don't even consider it a movie. Films should be useful and interesting. It fails terribly. I could not get through the whole film, so since the finale may be the greatest phenomenon in the history of cinema, it gets 1 for this small chance. Otherwise it would be flat 0. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t see how National Lampoon, or let alone any organization, sponsors this atrocity. Renting this DVD is currently one of the worst mistakes in my life. Just watch it if you want any other film that you will ever watch to look gorgeous. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, this is the worst movie I've ever seen.
