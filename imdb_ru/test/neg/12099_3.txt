In the horror genre, filmed in the horror films of the 80s, Ken Fori and Rosalind Cash, and Brenda Bakke are among the main characters in this story about a haunted health club. Wild dialogue and some unpleasant effects of blood make this film watchable. Not bad, but without much upheaval. <br /> <br /> Recommended for bad communication and acting. Only for movie fans. <br /> <br /> b
