This film is without a doubt the worst fighter I've ever seen. Sorry, but this is just a pity. In fact, the best part of the film (this film should be serious) is when the chicken is rushing across the road on foot at a speed of about 100 miles per hour. This pitiful editing mistake makes the movie absolutely fun for about 2 seconds, then it returns to “nonstop, on the edge of your seat when you try to find a comfortable sleeping position, action!”
