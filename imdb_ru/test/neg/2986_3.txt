It's a bit slow for a horror movie, but the quality is better than one would expect from the only director work on IMDb. The camera work and the lighting were amazingly good, and the acting? although variable ?? better than this can often be seen in indie films. <br /> <br /> Robert Field, as the main character, is quite cruel, which is especially regrettable, given that his character, Claude, is the narrator of the film and the center of his action. However, was it the entry of Christopher (Brandon de Spain) that I considered the turning point of this film ?? And not in a good way. The turn is awkwardly introduced, and slow movements become elongated and overly verbose. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Pete Barker is constantly having fun like Father William. It stands out easily from what is a fairly ordinary sentence. While the first half hour interested me, I felt disappointed with how things are going.
