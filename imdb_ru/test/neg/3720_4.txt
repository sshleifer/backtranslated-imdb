The meek and meek Edward J. Robinson (like Wilbert Winkle) decides to quit his job at the bank and do what he wants, open a repair shop behind his house. Mr. Robinson is married, but childless; he made friends with local shelter resident Ted Donaldson (like Barry). Young Donaldson is an energetic assistant in the studio, and sees the role of the father in Robinson. Robinson's grumpy wife Ruth Warwick (as Amy) is unhappy about the choice of Robinson’s work and conspires to return questions to her idea of ​​normality. Their lives are even more destroyed when Robinson is recruited. <br /> <br /> War also destroys what could be an interesting story, as Robinson’s character fights an imperious, unprincipled wife. Perhaps the filmmakers show how war can save marriages and positively change lives. Robinson and Donaldson are a nice team. Robert Mitchum has a nasty role. The ultimate "trick" played by Miss Warwick and Donaldson is predictably delivered.
