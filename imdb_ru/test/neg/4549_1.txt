It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. I tried to love this movie, but they managed to spoil almost every single aspect of this movie! Cheap dialogue, lack of character development, no tension, not enough history to attract you, no action other than REALLY cheap scenes. It seems they tried something on the set and said to each other “hey, it looks pretty cool, why not put it there,” after which the director probably said: “Yes ... YES, this is a genius!” went back to the sniffing cola or something. When it comes to acting, I think the only person who tried to make the film work is Daan Šurmans, but in the end, it's all for nothing. Because this movie sucks !! 2/10
