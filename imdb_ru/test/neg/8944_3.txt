An early walkie talkie based on a popular production. A murder was committed, and a group of people hired a medium to conduct a session to find out who the killer was. While the lights are off, there is an OTHER murder ... so this is someone in this room. <br /> <br /> This is followed by the obvious, boring and creaky mystery of murder. Most of the cast plays out to a ridiculous degree. They behave as if they are on stage (where you have to overdo it), and on the screen it looks silly. Most confusing Bela Lugosi (two years before the "Dracula"), who REALLY overdid as a police inspector. Tod Browning's static direction (which has always been overestimated) does not help. <br /> <br /> Only for Browning and Lugosi. I give it 3.
