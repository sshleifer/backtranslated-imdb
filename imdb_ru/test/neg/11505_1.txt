Naturally, Sadie is definitely the worst show I've ever seen, this is such a piece of shit ** and loaded with bullshit **. I did not find any of these jokes funny or somewhat clever, it was a terrible joke. <br /> <br /> Casting sucks, many heroes suck in acting skills, Charlotte Arnold (Sadie) is such a terrible actor, other characters also suck (Magaret, Rain, Hal). <br /> <br /> The plot is not at all unique and creative, and the show is very predictable. This is one of the worst shows ever made, it shouldn’t even have to be done, the idiots who are responsible for writing this garbage should be fired (if they haven’t already done so). The first season was really watchable, but the second season was just a disaster, it was too hard to watch this show, it was terrible.
