Maybe, although there are two or three more that I missed. This film creates an interesting night cityscape, reminiscent of many foggy scenes from Sherlock Holmes films, and fills it with sinister characters in the style of Kafka. Among them, the film omits Mia Farrow, who sounds like she is still playing Hannah, and Woody Allen, who seems to repeat her role in the movie “Listen, Sam.” Should we laugh at his stuttering and wringing hands? I believe that if the rest of the film was clearly a comedy, it’s not. At least I don't think so.
