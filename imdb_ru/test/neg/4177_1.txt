My friend Zach rented this film for free, as his mother works at the box office. I still feel disconnected because I can never regain these 100 minutes of my life. After seeing the first “Dark Harvest” the night before this viewing, I expected to at least see a crappy remake of the first movie. Wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no stuffed animal in the film (except for the fact that it is on the cover of the box), and there are no real death scenes. The film received a rating of "R" from an 8-year-old girl screaming "God d ** n" at her father. <br /> <br /> There aren't as many tequila that could make this film bearable. Believe me, we tried.
