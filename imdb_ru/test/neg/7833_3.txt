Brief summary: Almost non-existent, poorly chosen musical soundtrack, shooting with a constant camera, made without a permanent, but with a lot of coffee and a hyperactive cameraman, NO plot, and nothing really happens. The film moves from one dialogue to another, it sounds empty, never reaching depth, never creating the illusion that you really are in the web of a conspiracy, and everyone has something to do with everyone - just a boring excuse to show the main actress in beautiful underwear. (which, combined with her rusty voice, is of course nice, but there is nothing to base the film on) For me, the opening scene is a star moment, and the film simply degrades from there to such an extent that I just wanted to throw a film about 45 minutes into the story. I'm sorry about that.
