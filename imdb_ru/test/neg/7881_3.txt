Well, how to make the film as provocative as possible? This caricaturely direct shocker tries to have two low life Parisian women (one prostitute, one recently raped ex-porn actresses, no less) to pounce and go for national sex and kill spree- men in particular. <br /> <br /> A very short opening time tells you the experimental nature of this cruel hardcore “Thelma and Louise” - but this is done completely without irony or reflection for any possible feminist message ... And since we are not very close to to the heroes, the violence actually seems muffled and numb - and perhaps that is good. <br /> <br /> As a liberal proponent of freedom of expression, I always applaud when the "serious" film industry dares to contain full sex scenes. But the question is: does it work for the film as a whole? It's good? This is not very, although we have been given a new meaning to the phrase “shot in the ass”! <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 in Ozeppe
