This review is for a British three-disc DVD. The first disc is called “Caught in Action” and contains “Exemplary Behavior”, “Chasing Jamie”, “Quick and Curious”. The second disc is called “Fantasies in the Bedroom” and contains “Blue Plate”, “Lust Again” and “Love Potion” No. 10. The last disc is called “Anything” and contains “Chat”, “She is the boss” and “Your law". Why the other four episodes in the series are not included remains a mystery, because there is certainly enough space on the discs for much more material. <br /> <br /> Each episode begins with the head of the hotel Chloe (Lauren Hayes) reading a letter from a satisfied client. Then we see the story unfold when guests check in at the hotel. Blue Plate Special is an exception, because this story is from a waitress. Authors should be honored for the fact that they put forward a variety of different storylines. For example, Model Behavior about two models fighting for the attention of the crew; Falling in Lust Again is a man and a woman who broke up and rekindled their love when they met again at the hotel; She is the Boss, about the dressed secretary / dog man, who shows that he is more man than his boss, to her great pleasure. All episodes lead to a lot of nudity and sex. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, all the heroes of this hotel are beautiful women and beautiful underpants. Even disgusting secretaries are transformed when they take off their glasses and lower their hair. Sexual actions are numerous, but they seem to me too crazy and false. The filming work could also be done with a bit of moderation, spend too much time at close range and move around to capture everything, and, as usual, we get loud music during intercourse. Finally, the final credits mention the Palm Canopy Hotel, Singer Island, Florida, although there is no Singer Island on my Florida map. Some landscapes are definitely more like Florida than Utah or Las Vegas. This is a pretty good effort, and it’s a pity that the second series is still awaiting the release of the DVD in the UK 4 stars.
