All those familiar with the PC culture are stunned by the dogmatic Christian view of this film, claiming it contains racist ideas and / or religious intolerance. <br /> <br /> Those who do not care about it, but are focused on dexterous production values ​​and competent action are alarmed by the lack of such here. <br /> <br /> Those who condemn both of them are apoplectic, that this production was released to the general public, as proved in the comments here. <br /> An interesting premise, which is not original, but is a combination of GHOST and FROM BEYOND, is viewed in this film in a rather immature way, but with pleasure. The fact that the team and the actors lacked in terms of sensitivity, professional abilities and technical knowledge is somewhat offset by the intensity that they demonstrate. <br /> <br /> This is not as bad as many think here, and it would be good to be in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense, and this is mediocre enough to cause laughter and moans. Nevertheless, it unfolds with sufficient intensity to maintain interest throughout, and is close to the level of a recording by Corman of his earliest period of work, or the material of Arkoff or Sam Katsman. If you get it for $ 2 (or less), like me, you will not be disappointed, but you want it to be said how it was done.
