Sheba Shane (Pam Greer) receives a telegram telling her that her father may have problems. Sheba, a private investigator and a former policeman, goes to help his father. But someone will stop at nothing to get her father out of business. Attempting to show that their muscles failed, and Sheva’s father was shot dead in cold blood. These guys got the wrong woman wrong. <br /> <br /> If I had to describe Sheba Baby, the best I can think of is Pam Grier Light with a very bad game. For the movie Pam Grier, Sheba Baby is incredibly hand made. This is not nearly as strong as some of her earlier films. Excessive images of Pam have disappeared, putting a small revolver or razor blades on her afro. The pilot (D'Urville Martin) and his team cannot hold a candle in front of some of the real villains Pam had met in her previous films. It is strictly quantity and almost has a sensation for television. As for bad actions, the bad guys that Pam faces are as unnatural in their delivery as I have seen. As a result, characters like The Pilot do not look as threatening as they should or should be for the film to work. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that there are no moments or elements in “Sheba-baby” that I didn’t like (Pam in a diving suit and Pam swinging a spear), just compared to other Pam films, such as Koffi, Foxy Brown and even Friday Foster, the film falls through. <br /> <br /> One final observation - maybe I’m just more sensitive to these things after 9/11, but I don’t remember the time, even in the weak security of the 70s, when you could take a suitcase with weapons in an airplane . When Sheba flies to help her father, she has an arsenal in her baggage!
