This film is mainly trying to portray the heroism of firefighters, forcing the entire film to revolve around an American father with a kind heart, which puts others in front of him. Now I know that they are trying to show Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) a typical American father who is a fireman, but it looks like there is simply nothing interesting in him, therefore, when the film reaches its climax, there is practically nothing emotion. This film is basically trying to make the fireman's life exciting, but it seems as boring as any other job, except that you save lives or property by putting out the fire. John Travolta plays the captain of the fire department, but anyone could play his role, and he is a boring character, like the whole movie. A good movie would be that the firefighters became heroes, because they are firefighters and turn the whole script into an uninteresting melodrama. <br /> <br /> 4.9 / 10
