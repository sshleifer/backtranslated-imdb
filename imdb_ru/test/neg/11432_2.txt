The filmmakers did their best to ONLY find the following demographic characteristic: Palestinians, who look like peaceable, conscientious people who are looking for solutions, Palestinians (especially older women and families with children), who are especially concerned about the security fence, and Israelis who do not believe in security fence, strongly sympathize with its intended impact on the Palestinians and consider it an unnecessary argument and / or a waste of money. Oh, yes, they insert one member of the Israeli government who supports the fence, but they do everything possible to portray it inhuman and indifferent, and ask him very suggestive questions that really are statements (for example, “The Wall is Bad.” For the environment ... it destroys everything "). <br /> <br /> I have no problems with the fact that (well, most) of what is in the film. No matter how much I disagree with people with whom they are interviewing, their opinions are sufficiently substantiated for a documentary. AKO: there are at least two sides to the issue of the Israeli security fence, and despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of Israelis (and many others) support the construction of the fence and believe that this has a general positive impact, this “documentary” does not represents the opinion of even one such person. They even go so far as to interview an Israeli Jew who claims that “all Israelis support the fence,” and therefore he is insane, and then stubbornly refuses to interview even one such “crazy” Israeli. Oh, and to top it all, they set the tone for the film, interviewing a couple of young Israeli children (really an exception to the rule - I was there), who laugh at their Arab neighbors from around the world. fence. <br /> <br /> “Documentary” is a film that explores a problem and presents a full range of facts, opinions and perspectives. Unfortunately, this is not a documentary. This is a shameless Agitfilm, which very clearly, very meaningfully offers a battery of support on one side only, a highly controversial, emotionally and politically charged issue. This is no more a documentary than, say, Fahrenheit 9/11.
