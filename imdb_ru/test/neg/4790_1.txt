In addition to cop-rock and the show, where the child dies from eating the spoiled hamburger, which he found under the bed, it invariably was the worst and most stupid show to survive in prime time. If it were not for the unjustified success of Jason Lee in the movie, this show would never have come out of conception if its role was relatively unknown as the lead. <br /> <br /> The concept is terrible. The idiot jerk spends his lottery winnings to redeem himself with the white trash of his past. This is ridiculous? periodically, but not consistently. This is stupid? Every episode. <br /> <br /> I have seen many great shows that have come and gone ahead of time, but this error has survived longer than I could have imagined. The dialogue is incredibly unmixed, as are the themes of the episode. Each episode for a person with an IQ of more than 100 is an absolute struggle. And the icing on the cake? Jason Lee's annoying voice, telling about each episode. If it were not for the southern culture of the state and cattle in the south, this show would not have an audience. <br /> <br /> If you are a moron and you need a show that lacks humor, but is filled with bad taste, bad dialogue and stupid characters failing in life ... well, then you are probably an actor in this show.
