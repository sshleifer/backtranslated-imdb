I thought this series would be another exciting action movie with a few dynamic plots and great performances. I was wrong. Although I like Jamie Denton, this show is hardly worth watching at all, unless you like to watch some people being mistreated, and the actions of the agents are supposedly justified by the topic of “national security”. The show is an excellent propaganda for the current government and spews cheers patriotism, as if we say that every day. After a few episodes, I got damn boring, and instead I started watching House Invaders replays on BBCAmerica. Rather, watch CSI without a trace, no doubt.
