It must be the worst movie I have seen this year ... and I watch a lot of telegrams. The plot is just ridiculous, the scenes are just thrown at you without action, without the beginning or end of any scene ... they are just random makeup idiots who scream in some plane ... "special effects" (Spielberg would laugh ass) terrible, yellow contact lenses are pretty, though .. I have to say that I could not watch it to the end. The scene where the great scientist Bennett held on to his engine body for his life was too big for me ... Sorry for my poor English ... I'm from Romania (and this is my first post). I needed to register to comment on this film, because I just can't believe that this is a film released in 2007.
