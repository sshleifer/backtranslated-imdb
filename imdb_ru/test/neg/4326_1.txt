Look, some movie was the worst of them all. I suppose it could be the song of India. When I watched the film in 1976, it was shown at the Carnegie Hall Cinema, a place where people who often take a great care of the cinema often visited. About halfway through, people just left the theater. My girlfriend did not allow us to leave, but in the end the theater was practically empty. When I left, I kept telling people that "the good part is still to come." And it was. The good part was the screen at the end, which said fin. That was the only good part. I'm still annoyed by this movie 24 years later. It was pointless, stupid and derivative (Marienbad, part 2). See it only if you want to spend endless two hours learning to distinguish between just bad and just awful.
