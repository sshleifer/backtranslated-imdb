Well - the name "House of Frankenstein" was a reference to a line from the original film of Frankenstein. When they release a movie called “House of Dracula”, which makes no sense, you know that it is just starting to turn into a franchise. <br /> <br /> Without explanation, Dracula is back, and he calls himself Baron Latos. He enters the house of Dr. Edelman, claiming that he is looking for a cure for his vampirism. Edelman has a hunchbacked nurse who helps him (what about the hunchbacked assistants in these films?), But Dracula is really interested in his friend, the finer assistant. At this point, Larry "The Wolfman" Talbot returns (again, without explanation) and is simply looking for the same doctor to treat his lycanthropy. And then he just gets into a cave in which to grow plants to help him, which also contains the monster of Frankenstein. Dear God, when this is over ... of course, the other continuations of the Universal Monster were stupid, but this is just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Good things first. There are some great settings, and the effects of a vampire bat are slightly better than usual. Some other effects are also pretty neat. John Carradine is not as bad as Dracula, as soon as you got used to it, but still it wasn’t as brilliant as Lugosi. In my opinion, Onslow Stevens plays the much better vampire in this film, although he has a completely opposite problem with Carradine - all eerie and none of the class. None of the speeches is so great, but it is more connected with a cruel script than with anything else - women's games are written especially badly. But, no matter how stupid it is, for the most part it remains quite interesting. The best thing about this is the short length. <br /> <br /> Now the bad things ... it's not creepy, it’s poorly written and it’s not working. I was hoping that the three monsters will start some kind of supernatural power struggle, but this does not happen. Almost all attention is focused on Dracula, who is not very well portrayed. On the other hand, this is the only film in which Dracula infects another person, but this is done through blood transfusions rather than a bite, since Universal has always experienced inconvenience with possible homosexual overtones. Larry Talbot, as always, is decent, like the Wolfman, but plays a relatively small role. Once again, part of the Frankenstein monster comes down to anti-climatic closing moments. For God's sake, Glenn Strange was a fantastic creature! Why not give it more screen time? Unfortunately, the series was supposed to end on this note (not counting the classic comedy “Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein”). In the end, he just evaporated in the sun and died, just like Dracula himself.
