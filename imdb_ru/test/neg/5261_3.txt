My age: 13 years old <br /> <br /> Keats, played by Damon Wayans, and Archie Moses, played by Adam Sandler, are best friends for a year. Moses does not know that Kitts is actually Jack Carter, an undercover police officer who is waiting for the right time to destroy Moses and Frank Colton, a major criminal with whom Moses is associated. When Colton and Moses find out that Keats is a police officer, Colton wants to kill Moses, but leaves after he shot Carter in the head that he does not kill Carter. Moses was found by the police and taken to prove Colton's wrongdoing. But when the cops, including Carter, are going to accompany him across the country on the plane, all the other cops are killed, and Moses and Carter are left alone in the desert. Carter must stay alive and also accept Moses. <br /> <br /> A rather ordinary action movie, Bulletproof has a nice plot, but many films are just stupid. For comedy, I found most of the jokes completely unfunny. But as a thriller, he has some pretty good action films. Not being a good admirer of either Adam Sandler or Damon Wayans, I found the acting skills and, therefore, the characters are well below par. The climax is not very great, but the film is so unreal. This is not really bad, but not too good, and it is too short. Having run below 85 minutes, I thought that there was still 15 minutes left to its end, but this did not happen, and the film seemed too short. Overall, this is not a complete waste of time, but I still do not recommend Bulletproof. <br /> <br /> Australian Classification: MA 15+: Intermediate Abuse, Sexual Links, Rough Intermediate Language <br /> <br /> Rating: 56 out of 100
