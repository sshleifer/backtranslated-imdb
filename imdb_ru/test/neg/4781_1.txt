This film was really terrible. It was not at all scary and not even striking. I went to look at it with a bunch of friends, and by the end of the night we said: "The ruins destroyed my night." <br /> <br /> I would not recommend watching this movie at the cinema, rent it, or even watch it on TV by chance. It is an absolute waste of one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> The plot almost did not exist, the characters were terribly underdeveloped, and they did not tell anything about what was happening, and then left it completely open at the end, as if preparing for a sequel. ,
