Because of the RAT RACE ad, she looked too young for me to enjoy, but since my boyfriend loves this film (and the soundtrack), I finally gave up and watched it tonight. I force him to watch David Lynch’s films and all sorts of incomprehensible indie things (I recently imposed URBANIA on him), so I felt that I owed him a harmless Hollywood product. <br /> <br /> I didn’t want to hurt his feelings, so I saved my bitch for you. Yes, RAT RACE has its moments, but much annoyed me. Let's start from the beginning. RAT RACE was sold as a “family movie,” so I was a little surprised to find that the first scene around porn. (Now I hear it: “Mom, what does AFRO WHORES mean?”) This scene has no purpose in this film, except to squeeze some insolence into the movie PG-13. <br /> <br /> And while we are still in the casino segments, it’s very convenient that all the characters at the same time were playing slots in which there were gold coins. What would happen if they did not? Will these millionaires just sit and wait? And how did they even get these gold coins in slots? <br /> <br /> But I choose the plot point necessary for the existence of the film, so I will continue. About Whoopi and her long-lost daughter: they meet for the first time, but throughout their ordeal, they do not discuss anything about themselves with each other. Why make their relationship so complicated? Could they not be, say, a mother and daughter on vacation together? Why is it a matter of long-term adoption? And why depict her daughter as a hard-working career woman chained to a mobile phone that never needs contact with her business again? Script just forgot about this plot and character trait? <br /> <br /> This illustrates the main weakness of this film - the characters are inconsistent and interchangeable; it's tiring when everyone is equally crazy and without any signs. And one more thing - the events are not believable. Oh, of course, the characters can do some weird things, but the characters themselves must be believable. Take, for example, "The Naked Weapon" (another film about Jerry Zucker). Frank Drebin has some rather exaggerated moments, but everything he does is theoretically possible in his world. (Jane is also funny, but this is a completely different funny thing that makes all the difference.) A character in RAT RACE, defying natural laws, jumping onto a high-speed train, destroys any plausibility a film can have; these are clearly not real people, so why should I care about them? <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with RAT RACE is a moral issue. Characters get their modes of transport almost entirely through theft. I know, I know, this is just a stupid comedy, and the same actions did not bother me fifteen years ago when I saw MILLION DOLLARS OF MYSTERY, but there are many violations of the law in RAT RACE, and this worries me now. And I will not go into the whole sequence of sabotage at the airport, except to ask whether the writers did not consider the real consequences of such an action; Was this scene funny before September 11th? <br /> <br /> I’ll skip unpleasant pieces concerning the heart, the drug in the family and the Nazis (whose savings and payouts were better in the episode “Seinfeld”) and continue to complain about the actions. Rowan Atkinson began to annoy and end up intolerable ; I don’t know when I liked the comic character less. And the three Oscar winners needed new agents. Whoopi was best, but she had nothing to work with (although she liked the copper perm and purple lipstick); Kathy Bates’s piece was piercing, but mercifully short; Cuba was ... oh, dude. Cuba baby, please fire your agent! After INSTINCT and CHILL FACTOR is your third hit (glad I didn't see PEARL HARBOR or SNOW DOGS) - it's time to get your Oscar for Best Male Role back to its rightful owner (Edward Norton, for PRIMAL FEAR), Your growth actor has no right to run half-naked in the desert and be a proven transvestite imitator Lucille Ball. Do you even no longer read the scripts of your films or climb into the bag and drag your next project at random? <br /> <br /> There are other small moments that bother me (how did Grisham and the prostitute get to loot so quickly?), but, in fact, the RAT RACE is a little more than your main group of character types, made difficult by arbitrary obstacles to a rather discouraging and inexplicable end. Do they give money to charity? What is this end?!? Yes, this is a “noble” thing to do. Never mind the likelihood of cross-promotion / licensing whores Smash Mouth (do they ever say no at the sale?) Speakers at a charity concert in the middle of the New Mexico desert, but who would honestly do that? Yes, they say that travel, not a destination, makes a trip worthwhile, but without a destination there is no way. If there had ever been an example of the “wrong happy ending,” that would be so. What an offensive end of the movie, in which, despite my nagging, I enjoyed the part (I admit, I liked to talk a bit with the cow and some things of Lucy along with the character with the piercing of the tongue) - at first I thought that he would not understand it would make me climb the wall, but he became my favorite). <br /> <br /> But as far as my boyfriend knows, I found the RAT RACE quite funny and charming. <br /> <br />
