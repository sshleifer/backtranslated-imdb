I was disappointed in this documentary. I thought it would be the second chess match between GM Garry Kasporov and Deep Blue, a supercomputer developed by IBM computer experts, to beat any human chess player. Kasparov was and remains the greatest chess player of all time. the film brings us back to 1997, when Kasporov agreed to hold a rematch with Deep Blue after defeating him 1 year earlier. but instead of focusing on the game, it focuses more on what happens before and after. There are fragments of the game, but not very much. Most of the film is centered around Kasporov's paranoid obsession with the fact that the match was falsified as part of some conspiracy theory and that he lost the match unfairly. The film also has interviews with people who are not interested in anyway. They even chatted with the manager of the building where the match took place. Who cares? I also found it very dry and slow. In the end, this film was unsatisfactory. This, of course, is my opinion. If you like collusion If you dislike chess or plot theory, this film probably won't matter. I am a fan of chess, and because of this, I just stick it out. I give "The game is over: Kasparov and the Machine" 4/10
