This film has to be the biggest disappointment I've ever experienced with a movie. The game is terrible, the tension is growing, and the plot as a whole is ridiculous. I found myself cheering for the victim in order to just hurry and become a victim, because she obviously had to get rid of her sufferings. Anyone with basic knowledge of how the world works will immediately be disgusted with the jumps that we are asked to make in logic, and the so-called tense build-up will be lucky that a three-year-old child will be slightly concerned. I am alarmed that a sequel is planned because it means that they will ask us to swallow the plot line below par once more. If this is an example of how Raw Feed works, I think I will avoid any future films on them.
