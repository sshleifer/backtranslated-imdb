This documentary was boring and rather stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean ... the creator of the documentary obviously doesnâ€™t even know how Darwinian evolution works? This is a theory, and the name is just stupid. Reading a biology textbook in college could tell the creator of a documentary what Darwinism really is. Darwinism is a good theory, but evil if it is done by politics. <br /> <br /> Also in this documentary there was no real evidence, only interviews of some people ... no evidence from experts and shadow traces ... br / <br /> The documentary was also boring. I mean, it could be edited up to 35 minutes, and then it would be much better. <br /> <br /> There are much better documentaries than this ... it was not worth watching ... you can get better information from Wikipedia = do not waste your money and time!
