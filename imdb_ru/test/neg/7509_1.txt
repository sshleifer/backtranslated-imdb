Once a month, I invite several friends to the "Night Film Delayed." We look forward to films that are either so bad that they are funny, or films that know that they have no plot and just show a lot of chests. Last night we were unlucky enough to have “Zombie Planet” as one of our films. Cinematography is on par with what we are used to, but acting was a different story. The main role is played by Johnny Depp / Rob Zombie, who can not get a role in the school play, not to mention the horror movie LOW BUDGET. Our indecisive hero, who couldn’t say if he wanted to be a bad ass of this scene or a whimpering coward, was one of the reasons why it was the first 30s movie I ever had to stop early during the Backward Movie Night. He had the opportunity to get a great twist on the standard zombie infestation, but they took it in a completely different direction, based on Johnny Zombie. I personally would not recommend this to any of my friends. However, unfortunately, I already invited several people last night so that they could survive 80% of this film with me.
