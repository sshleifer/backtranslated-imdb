It is impossible to put into words how bad, shapeless, unsophisticated, and silent these films are "Vice Academy". You must experience one for yourself. For the third time in a row, writer-director Rick Sloan does not show a single gram of writing or directing talent. There is nothing here that a person older than 5 years could have believed or laughed at, but (very short) nude and other “plot” elements make films unsuitable for children. What makes me think that they are really aimed at adults with the mental abilities of 5-year-olds. Elizabeth Kathan makes more than a welcome replacement for Linnie Quigley — she is a sparkling and sweet, and her surprisingly broad smile is the only thing that can make the viewer smile. But looking at her and the other girls in this film is the same as looking at a bunch of flowers in a desert covered with dung. (*)
