When one day a friend of mine criticized me for my first film (a rather bad video), I claimed that I could grow; Orson Welles' first film really was even worse. He challenged me that this could not be, so I pulled out the Criterion laser disc (I think) CITIZEN KANE and played AGE OF THE AGE. My friend lasted only a few minutes before admitting it. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of humor in this short film, but itâ€™s basically as pretentious as (and perhaps a collegiate answer) THE POET'S BLOOD and other avant-garde Garden films of that time. This is what it is: a sequence of images with an uncertain topic, and if you really dislike frames with Wells (in heavy makeup, for download), it is not even worth tracking.
