Young woman Nicole Carrow (Jamie Alexander) and her boyfriend Jess (Joey Mendicino) are victims of an irresponsible serial killer after stopping at a “comfortable break” at a remote stop on the side of the road. <br /> What could be effectively frightening the chiller in more competent hands, turns out to be a tangled, ill-conceived mess under the careless guidance of John Shiban (who also wrote the script). There are a lot of juicy violence in the cast, short acquaintance with nudity and confident performances, but the stupid script leaves the viewer with so many unanswered questions that cannot but cause disappointment. <br /> <br /> On At first glance, the film sounds like the standard cliché “the killer is free”, but Shiban (the former author of The X-Files) adds some subtle supernatural elements that suggest that his goal was something one more thing: a ghost story in which the rest cease to be home to a vengeful ghost to punish sinners. <br /> <br /> Reading the film, checking out the theories of the audience here on IMDb, and watching Additional on DVD, some elements of the plot begin to make a little more sense (although, even with the advantage of additional information, many unanswered questions remain) . In my opinion, any film that requires so much research to understand itself (only partially) is not particularly good.
