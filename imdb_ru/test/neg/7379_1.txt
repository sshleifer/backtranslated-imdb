As Anthony Bourdain said: “I wanted to stick my head in a bucket of lye, pull out eyeballs and jump off a cliff.” This sums up my feelings about this pitiful waste of human effort. Madness, self-indulgence, thoughtless and just plain bad. Bad beyond understanding. What else can I say? If you are not lucky enough to be in the area where this idiotic trash is playing, please have mercy on your soul and avoid it at any cost.
