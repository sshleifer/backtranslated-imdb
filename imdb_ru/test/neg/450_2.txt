Every time I watch Larry King live, he rolls out the most softball questions for his guests. He rarely receives useful information because he does not ask complicated questions. It comes from its beginning on the radio. <br /> <br /> King has established himself on radio and, in fact, has not changed a single bit for television, except that his talking head was visible. He becomes like a puppy for his guests, and the only time he really gets useful information from them is where they volunteer her, or the show visitor asks a difficult question. <br /> <br /> Larry is a good, fatherly type of interviewer. This means that he should not show prime time on major news networks if you consider CNN. I'm not due to CNN history. <br /> <br /> Copying (i.e. Cable) The new network was launched by Ted Turner as an alternative to network news in that it could broadcast news 24/7. When it just started, the only television competition was NBC, ABC and CBS. Because of this, CNN copied the format of its competition and achieved respected ratings. <br /> <br /> This worked fine for CNN until they got competing networks that were innovative and provided better / more fresh news coverage. In response to the warming up of the competition, CNN abandoned its competitors, who ate their lunch and ratings, because CNN wanted to resist change. It did not work for a very long time, and their ratings began to fall sharply. <br /> <br /> Now the copy news network is trying to recreate itself, reinventing itself, copying the leading format of the news network. Unfortunately, this show is a big part of the problem. He is 21 years old and he feels very bad. <br /> <br /> Sorry, King must be expelled from Prime Time or fully written off.
