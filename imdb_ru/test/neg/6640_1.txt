So I turned on HBO, which I just thought he would have high-quality films, and I saw it. Carrot top is so unfunny that it makes you sick to watch. I’ve seen unfunny movies before, but I think it’s so impossible to watch, because Carrot Top seems to find it fun. Watching this movie is like watching a movie designed for 5-year-olds with insane, excessive reactions, full of ultra-silly jokes that only 4-year-olds will appreciate. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is that talented actors actually subscribed to this project, such as Larry Miller and M Emmett Walsh. If you’ve ever seen absolutely awful MCI Top Carrot commercials (or whatever they are), then it’s probably the same thing, but worse. It is a holiday farce, which is a waste of a large budget, which could do something, save homeless people ... anything but that. I'm not sure that he is in the top 50, but the $ 10 million spent is a shame.
