I wasn't old enough to really appreciate the original Mod Squad, but I knew everyone thought it was cool. I have several “books” that were written on the basis of a series in my collection “screen for printing”, and they are quite light, so I did not expect much from the film. This is good because this film was bad on a long leash. <br /> <br /> I admire the risk of making a film that fully matches the hit of the 1960s. The cinema audience, however, has acquired sophistication in 30 years. At least I think so. I certainly expect something more than an hour and a half of the original Mod Squad concept, with (now old) car chases (now considered bad) camera work, (hard sound) soundtrack and (bad) script and everything, on a big screen. In the 1960s, we didn’t care, because we had minimal expectations. It was enough for the joint police team of young people dressed in something besides suits. This was another exciting episode of “Ironsides” or “Password”. <br /> <br /> Evaluating this “episode” compared to the usual theatrical releases, the story was ... well, I'm not sure that I should even say that, because I'm not sure that I was alone. Drugs is bad? No difference. The script was stupid. When the characters exchange dialogues and promote a story with such lines as “I heard him talk about it on the phone” and “I think I have a plan”, we really have problems. No wonder the game was terrible: no one knew how to pronounce such idiotic lines. <br /> <br /> If I were Claire Danes, I would now pursue my agent with a flamethrower. (Actually, I think that everyone who watches the film has the right to seek retribution.) <br /> <br /> And where was Maud in this squad? I understand that these children just left the teenage hall, but no one had a velvet suit? "Mod" means only young and integrated? What happened to white go-go shoes? Perhaps the costume department was going pretty, but all they got was dirty and dirty. <br /> <br /> Since the film fully complied with the original series and demanded special behavior from actors, cameramen, stuntmen, etc., we should appreciate it more. Unfortunately, I still don't like it. If I wanted to watch the criminal drama of the 60s, I would buy a DVD. No thanks.
