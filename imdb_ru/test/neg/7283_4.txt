HANA-BI has a lot of quiet moments and a rather slow pace. Unfortunately, during many thoughtful interruptions, the viewer is left to think about the recent scenes that have just been watched, and many questions come up and annoy. <br /> <br /> For example, why did a disabled guy not drown in the ocean when he was stuck in the sand and a wave arose around him? Salvation was not visible or hinted. <br /> <br /> Could it be that the Japanese police are so clumsy and inexperienced in arrest procedures that at first it does not deprive the suspect of the possibility of reaching the weapon? These Japanese police detectives seem to have no experience with a suspect. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't the protagonistâ€™s right eye blink? Blinking with one eye was distracting, and it became inexplicable. <br /> <br /> What exactly did the protagonist spend all his money to borrow so much from the moneylenders? He was not seen in gambling. Being a non-public entry-level employee, his wife should have had full medical insurance. <br /> <br /> What did this lonely man do in the middle of nowhere in a nature park? What was his reason for being there? <br /> <br /> How in the world could gangsters find the main character and his wife in a remote reserve? It did not make sense. <br /> <br /> And again, as gangsters could later find the main character and his wife in the remote mountains. Fuji resort? These gangsters had absolutely no evidence to find out which country the main character and his wife were in, not to mention the right particular place at the right specific time! <br /> <br /> And the third question: how could junior detectives know which few feet of the Japanese coastline could find the main character and his wife? The coastline of Japan should be extensive. Should all these characters have extrasensory abilities? <br /> <br /> Two recent questions: a cute girl trying to fly a kite on the beach - where did she come from? She seemed to have no transportation or companions with her. And why in the world was she still trying to fly on what was left of her kite after it was torn to pieces? It was strange. Unintentionally Python-esque. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I liked the background music. It was dramatic and smooth and added a lot to this movie. Photography, images and art were pleasing to the eye. <br /> <br /> Finally, the wife was too pleasing to the eye. She never came close to looking like a dying, sick person. She looked very healthy. In any case, these people seemed depressed and mentally ill, and not physically ill. A husband treated his wife as perhaps a newly-born gay man would treat a respected wife ... a love of friendship, but not a close tenderness. <br /> <br /> Of course, a mixed film.
