This film has a pretty decent premise - one horribly shown over and over in science fiction films, most spectacularly in Alien - and some worthy "he-man" male performances. The obsessed cosmonaut's wife, for me, is a weak link in the ensemble - she seems to not know what to do with her face in many of her most prominent scenes in which I blame the director Korman. <br /> <br /> Given a decent budget for props and special effects and a more focused and consistent game on the screen, the Bloody Beast could be pretty decent. But the inherent low cost of production design and errors and continuity errors undermine the hearing. For example, every time I saw a comatose astronaut lying on an "inspection table" the width of an ironing board, I giggled, probably not because of the emotions that the team wanted to cause. And the monster costume needed serious work; parrots covered with ferns, just not scary and not convincing. <br /> <br /> However, the package was strong enough, and I kept to the end to see how the conspiracy was solved, and the alien motives were rather ambiguous. At first, I could think of it as a riddle. And the scene with a shot of the murdered scientist had little damage, along with the development of the plot, where the alien claimed that he had assimilated part of the personality of the deceased. <br /> <br /> This is Korman. It is cheap, quick and soft looking, if you do not think too much or do not expect too much. What else needs to be said?
