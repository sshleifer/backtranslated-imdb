“Murder by Numbers” is one of those films that you expect made for television, but it’s not. Given that Bullock is the only actor in any note (although Michael Pitt seems to be moving to bigger and better things), it is not surprising that this film quickly disappears from memory and is replaced by more important things. Like ... remembering to lock the front door when you exit. Or wear clothes when you get out of the shower. <br /> <br /> Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, a cop with personal problems (not all). Together with her new partner (wet-looking Ben Chaplin), she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman. There's nothing out of the ordinary, except that the criminals are a pair of teenage students who think they have planned and committed the murder. As the investigation goes on, a battle of wills arises between Cassie and the main suspect Richie Heywood (Ryan Gosling). <br /> <br /> The problem is that these two reasons are hopeless. Bullock, although it is very pleasant to look at her, is about as plausible as a seasoned cynical cop like Rodney Dangerfield (in fact, he would have been better!). Chaplin, for his sins, is not at all an entity, and I wish he had to put this film on his resume, trying to break through to Hollywood. At the very least, Gosling and Pitt, as devious mocking suspects, justify themselves adequately. As if the trick is not so bad, the story that puts someone to sleep, and a very predictable (but illogical) end, shoots this film before he gets a chance. <br /> <br /> "Murder by numbers" has nothing to do with it, even Bullock's meaningless nude scene will not buy it back. Well, only a little, but still not enough to save it. This is one film that is not going to promote the genre of a policeman. As Cassie probably says about her next business, there is nothing to see here. Move on, keep moving ...
