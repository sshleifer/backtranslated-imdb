This two-and-a-half-hour film was recently shown at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) at a show at 10 pm. After that, the performance was scheduled at 1:00, but he wondered if anyone was going to fall asleep to see it before 3:30. The first scene is a man walking across the field, and he lasts four minutes in a movie. This is an ominous sign of things to come: another 144 minutes more than the same. A man and a woman stand in the sun by the wall. This is repeated 15 times, with a very rare dialogue. Sometimes these very long, slow episodes are interrupted by shocking shots, such as a close-up of the female genitalia, shown for one minute of cinematic time (the audience laughed for the last 20 seconds to say: “What message?”). The story resembles Dostoevsky’s novel The Brothers Karamazov, in which a cretin falls in love with a woman with a touch of morality. In one of the rare moments when the crowd laughed (more in desperation to try to justify the fact that there were already two hours to see that nothing was happening) when a British tourist was told that he could not see things from the train Eurostar went at 180 miles per hour, the translator with automatic switching of units from the English system to the metric system translated the translation to “they could not see things clearly, as the train was traveling at a speed of 300 kilometers per hour”. What is surprising in this film is that the quality of cinematography shows that a lot of money was spent on it. It was not a film kitchen 8 mm experiment. He was carefully planned, structured, acted, mounted. However, I got so little from this. Some comments pointed to painful details, such as the small sounds of a hanging key chain on the door that had just opened. Well, that was noted, but what was the purpose? Some brave people in the audience left after the first hour. The rest is out of curiosity: there must be something happening at the end. There has never been. And maybe this is what the film is about. All films in the theater are filled with action. This one wants to be different. Nothing happens there.
