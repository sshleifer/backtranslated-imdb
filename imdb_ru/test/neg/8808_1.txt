There are bad films, and there are films that are even worse. Saw just that. <br /> <br /> The film is just bad on all counts. The plot, action, camera work, music and everything else is absolutely terrible, and I can not understand how such garbage got on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that the saw is mysterious with plot holes. The beginning is tempting and leaves a lot of expectations, but it does not stand up to criticism, and the plot becomes completely ridiculous and absurd. The film is not creative and will not leave you the slightest confidence. People who claim that this movie is horrible, cruel, sadistic and scary are girls who have nightmares after watching CSI, because this is not true. <br /> <br /> So I warn you, do not try to watch this if you have any form of intelligence, because you will be disappointed. This bore and mediocre film, as it can be.
