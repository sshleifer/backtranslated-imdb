My wife and I watched this abortion from the very beginning. I immediately hated him, but my wife caught him for a couple of years. For me, everything was getting worse and worse, and all the characters were no doubt dreary and sad without any redemptive traits. My wife was tired of this, and we stopped looking altogether. From time to time I catch this clip or watch it while watching channels. Someone always shouts or does something terrible. It seems there are never easy moments or any happiness. This has always been my main claim to this when we first saw it - without humor. The authors seem to have no idea about the drama - they seem to think that conflict is drama, and, of course, this is only one of its elements. Light and shadow are extremely necessary for actors who can contribute to it. I am sure that the actors in Istendera are competent, but they have nothing to work with. This must be the most dismal acting job in show business. I do not understand why the British public watches it and loves it. What does this say about our psyche? I heard that this suggests that it is “like a real life” - it is nothing but my life or someone’s life I know, otherwise we would have jumped out of tall buildings or public transport. The topics he touches are far from family viewing, but are still shown in front of the watershed. I love TV shows like Breaking Bad or The Wire, but I don’t expect to see them at 7.30 or 8.00 in the evening. The program is very large and should be avoided at all costs.
