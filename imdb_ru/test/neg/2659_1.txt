Only when I saw Sydney Pollack in the picture did I connect him with this film. This is his worst movie. Absolute trash. The dialogue is wooden and incredible, the plot is incredible. <br /> <br /> Kristen Scott Thomas wasted in this film. There is nothing in her character that would make you believe in this story. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford looks like Valium. There is no life in his eyes. <br /> <br /> I blame Sidney Pollack for the failure of this film. The script is terrible, and he is too smart not to see it. So it’s like some kind of return, whether it’s a studio commitment or something else, but it's just a ROUND COFF
