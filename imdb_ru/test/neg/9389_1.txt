This is the worst movie I've ever seen. At first, I thought it would be good, because the Bermuda Triangle is interesting to me, but instead it was terrible. All he did was offer a bunch of unsuccessful explanations that did not make sense (if time moves differently, why the woman did not grow old, and her son quickly grew old), and they have a terrible juicy end. Next time, the guys who went to Bermuda should bring all copies of this film with them. Please everyone will vote for this film so that it can get on the list of the worst films.
