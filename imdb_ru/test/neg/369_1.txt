I know that Trey Parker and Matt Stone really hate celebrities and cheat them in every episode of South Park (if they don’t show them, and then mention them), and they like to scoff, joke and laugh at themselves too, but I felt this mockery went too far. <br /> <br /> First, the most common theme in the “documentary” is that these episodes are meaningless things that they spend just for money. Obviously, this is completely untrue if you even want to watch an episode, but the constant “You know, I learned something today ...”, says the main characters at the end of almost every episode. The creators are also depicted as pompous, arrogant donkeys who care only about money, including the supposedly funny, but not the scene in which Isaac Hayes distributes lines for the chef (on the phone), and Trey Parker shouts and shouts. on him to suck and hang up. I guess it must be funny, but the pretense in it just made it ... cringe. <br /> <br /> The way they interview employees working for Trey and Matt shows the duet as tyrants who push their employees to the limit, all just for money, after all. Obviously, the whole joke is completely untrue, but this is simply not funny. It is disturbing, although it is just a joke.
