“Spiderman” was one of the first comics that initiated a change in the genre: despite the fact that this comic superhero was very well done, this is the first TV series in history that added characters to the main character, a complex moral problem, and also illuminated social and political issues. in other words: Spiderman was an adult of comics. This series is missing all these components. This is just a good buy / bad guy direct TV series that suffers from obvious budgetary constraints that make the action scene moderately exciting. Spider-Man's Nylon Web is about as convincing as Star Trek's cardboard stones. Nicholas Hammond is too old for this role at the time. I think he was in his thirty years when Spider, the man was really a teenager at the time. For some incomprehensible reason, the authors also changed the names and removed important characters from the comic, which again simply led to the disappearance of tension between the characters.
