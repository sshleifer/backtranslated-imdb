This film aims to show the attempt of the middle class family to find out what is happening in America in the late 1960s. Their trip to the rock festival is so far from their renovated old bus. Without exception, the characters are superficial stereotypes. <br /> <br /> If you want to know which famous Hollywood actors desperately needed a salary in those days, just look at the loans. Sal Mineo, I forgot how much his career hit the runners! Thank God, his career was restored to his untimely death. <br /> <br /> The authors of this television turkey were ignorant. Besides the fact that they were engaged in weed, their understanding of the "hippie movement" was ridiculous.
