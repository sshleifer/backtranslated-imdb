It could be a good television film, but the memories do not facilitate the understanding of the film. When they give viewers information about the path (whether the film will go on), I found myself wondering why she never said or mentioned it at the beginning. Then the whole track probably wouldn't have been needed. <br /> <br /> When the film ends, you understand why she was filmed, and, of course, she is not guilty. It is a pity that the producer / director used the memories in this way, but, on the other hand, the film would not be worth it at all. <br /> <br /> A good movie for a rainy day, a big pack of killing chips for the evening.
