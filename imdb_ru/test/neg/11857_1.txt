Roger Corman enjoyed a share of cinematic shame in his illustrious low-budget career spanning over 300 films. While few (if any) would have called him great, the vague connections of his films with the underground culture (through reference, tribute or influence) provided him with a twisted legacy of a kind. Throughout his career, he also developed the bad habit of remaking his own films (“Piranha”, “Humanoids from the depths”, “Black Scorpion”, etc.), without improving them in the least. “Predator”, “screenplay” and “director” Jay Andrews (Jim Vinorski, the man behind one of my favorite cinematic pleasures “Chopping Mall”) raises this practice to an alarming new minimum regarding the mid-90s Corman. Trilogy "Carnosaur". <br /> <br /> The authors of Wynorski are enclosed in quotes, because "Raptor" is not a tribute to the films "Carnosaur" and not even a remake. “Predator” are films of “Carnosaurs”, or at least death scenes caused by dinosaurs, randomly spliced ​​together with the trace elements of the original plot and some recently filmed scenes (many of which consist of Dino images). unsuccessful attempt to make the inserted scenes less visible). "New" material was written throughout the frame, and not vice versa, and completely unremarkable, with huge gaps in logic (for example, the military send two separate teams just like that, frames from parts 2 and 3, where the soldiers had different forms, be included), which is surprising considering how little logic plays in any of the Carnosaur films already. The lack of any feeling for their characters (though, to be honest, any dimension of character is presented only once, maybe twice), reminds of a terribly wooden acting game in bi films from the 1950s, and this, of course, does nothing between ripped off attack scenes worth seeing. Even more embarrassing for actors of new scenes, when there is an obvious discrepancy in the physical structure between the new actor and actor in the original scene. When the only scene causing any response in the film is the oldest horror trick in the book, the “spring-loaded animal,” something seriously wrong. <br /> <br /> In its current form, this vile practice in two b-class figures (who don’t have to worry about ruining their reputation because they don’t have them) rip off their own material for the cheapest and fastest dirty tricks, simply because they can (why else would someone feel obsessed with Breaking the series, designed to break the series "Jurassic Park"?). I can say nothing more than the fact that this film carries my highest recommendations against viewing; The only good thing about this (except that I look at Melissa Brazel's navel) is that now I don’t need to watch Carnosaur films.
