The film opens with a scene that simply could not be. The man wakes up, and while his wife stays in bed, he begins his morning prayers in his bedroom while his wife sleeps peacefully. Morning blessings are read, but only those that Guyta considers controversial. the rest are conveniently omitted. then while in philately and tallis he kisses his wife good morning! This is not an accurate description of Jewish prayer in any home, let alone a Hasidic home. Amos Gittai is not interested in an exact depiction of Hasidic life. He is interested in adding melodramatic and empty films to his ever-growing list. The scenes of Mikka (ritual bath) are far from accurate, and his Jewish wedding was funny because it did not even come close to the atmosphere of a Hasidic wedding. I have many problems with the Hassidic way of life, but I do not use Amos Gittaiâ€™s comments on these issues. He would like you to think that all Hasidim are dense comonists with serious bouts of depression. I may not agree with the Hasidic way of life, but I admit that Hasidic life has many layers. Amos Gitai is blinded by his own secularistic stubbornness and is therefore unable to portray an exact depiction of Hassidic life. In addition to his poor research and unbalanced portrayal of Hasidic life, Guyta fails in other aspects. The plot is full of holes, the dialogue is loaded with silence, the soundtrack is too repetitive and the action, while sometimes the powerful one was too loaded with melodrama. The film stretches and continues, and the end is not worth hanging around. look if necessary, but be careful. If you want to learn about Chassidic life, go to the community and talk to the Hassid. Do not rely on the film Gittay!
