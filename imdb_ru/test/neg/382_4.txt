It starts with the fact that Fulci plays his version, writing down some ideas about how people can die. Followed by a fake cat that supposedly eats the brain. The copy I watched was duplicated in English, which I always hate, but I was especially disappointed that I did not hear Fulci in my own voice. <br /> <br /> Fulci in some feverish state is working on his last horror film. His stomach turns when he sees things that resemble the effects of his film, and he begins to hallucinate that he is witnessing horror. He visits a psychiatrist who hypnotizes him, and, unfortunately, he does not think about his improved mental health. I was reminded of the psychiatrist played by David Cronenberg in the Clive Barker film Night Breed (1990). The compression in this is played by David L. Thompson, who is pretty bad. Probably Fulci's real friend, he has a big, toothy smile when he kills people, although this may be Fulci’s black humor at work, which, I thought, was also pretty bad. <br /> <br /> The film consists of many clips from Fulchi films, as if Fulci is on the set, directing them, watching the recordings on TV or watching the actions. I have never been a big fan of clips on TV shows, and I also think that things like Charles Band’s Full Moon Entertainment cut their old films and put together three such pieces together, since the new anthologies are pretty lame. I guess they need to make money? <br /> <br /> The abbreviation "Cats in the brain" refers to the theory that violence in the movies causes violence in real life. One of the employees of Fulci said that the documentary team followed Fulci to see what his life was like. Many such links. <br /> <br /> In the end, some characters float away in a boat called “Perversion”.
