Why should they try to make a sequel to one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time. The film is a train wreck on every level, and it never needed to be shot. Randy Quaid portrays cousin Eddie and is a caricature of his past walks as cousin Eddie. Moreover, the character Eddie is not interesting enough to carry the entire movie. Even "eye candy" Sun Hee Lee could not buy this piece of festive shit. Please do not waste your time on this move, just look at the original again.
