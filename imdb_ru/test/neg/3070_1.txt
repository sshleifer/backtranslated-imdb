Any film should have an idea; Simple or more complex, you need one ... The problem with Fragata ... again, when he decides to make a film, he so wants to do "anything" that he forgets this basic detail, and as a result we let the characters do something without justification, they behave without good reason ... they are simple puppets who follow the film to smell the wind. It is boring and sad to see them appear and disappear like cards being discarded in a game. Fragate seems to be always talented in advertising - this is his own work ... and this leads to what you see what he did ... but in the end there is always a big disappointment. It’s not enough to have a movie full of “hot Portuguese pink magazine stars” ... especially when half of them can't play ... they just pretend to be funny. Here, my only good point is the actor Helder Mendez ... one of the few non-stars. ” But this film is worth checking out as a “how not to make a film” guide ... and if Fragata's previous works were bad ... this one is a “masterpiece” in achieving the AWFUL title. In a few words .. Just check it out! It will make you good ... and if you make homemade family films, ... and you always feel bad at work ... so spend 30 minutes on this so-called professional work ... your homework stuff will look like powerful Hollywood movie compared to Sorte Nula.
