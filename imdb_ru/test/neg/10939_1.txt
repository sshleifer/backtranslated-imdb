You may not believe this, but when the credits for this film ended, I looked for the name of the director. When I saw this, I wrote it in my memory and never forgot about it. This movie is terrible. This makes Ed Wood's films look like Orsen Wells. At least B films are interesting, it was a heartbreaking experience. The quality was so bad that I began to wonder who allowed this to happen. <br /> <br /> I heard Uwe Boll runs fourteen miles a day. This is because wherever his films are watched, people must drive him out of the city with fire and pitchforks. The script was terrible, the lighting was similar to the coverage of a school football game, and the cinematography was slightly higher than the quality video of Roger Pattersonâ€™s Bigfoot. Acting was performed by people too embarrassed for the production to express their self-confidence. In the end, the film Alan Smith would not have called his name. That day I learned to avoid the films of this man, despite the circumstances. From what I hear, it's not so bad.
