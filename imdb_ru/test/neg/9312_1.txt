The most awesome casting I've ever seen. Clark Kent is like a crazy head, a very feminine woman in a trance role and so on ............. <br /> <br /> Foolish ass violence just for the sake of violence, No content, no meaning. This man has never been on the street. This is a joke! <br /> <br /> The only thing that is dumber than this film is that I finished watching it. I just kept thinking that it couldn't be worse, but that was until the very end. <br /> <br /> Try your best to remove the film from the hook. Trying to be fancy. So stupid! I really have nothing more to say, but I cannot leave a comment until I write more. <br /> <br /> Please accept this advice and DO NOT LOOK IN THIS MOVIE !!!!! HORRIBLE !!!
