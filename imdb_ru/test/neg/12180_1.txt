Charles Bronson gave the audience a lot of great moments on the screen. But in this film there is nothing that should be in a thriller / action movie. There are several action movies in the film, but they are really trashy. And when the action scene fails, does the story save the film? Not at all, my answer to that. The story is even worse than the fighting scenes. It's very simple and boring, and although I'm a big fan of the movie, I almost fell asleep several times. I do not know how they came to such a failure. Low budget maybe? Despite this, it seemed that all the actors were not interested in being in the film at all. When this happens, the result is really bad.
