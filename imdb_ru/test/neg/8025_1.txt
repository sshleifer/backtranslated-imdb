When I learned that some of those who are behind the low-budget films “Terror in rock and roll Önsjön” and “He came from space ... and so on”, I participated in the creation of this film, I decided to buy it invisible on DVD. I wish I didn't do that. Other films were funny, mocking and a bit silly. While the Kraftverk 3714 is devoid of any humor at all. And it's so terrible that I'm angry just thinking about it. The worst actors, the worst scenarios, the worst special effects. And the most unsexual sex scene. Uhhh. And all this goes on for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Please never make another movie.
