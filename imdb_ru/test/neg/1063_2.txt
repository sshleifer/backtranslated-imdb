... the announcer said the continuity of how TACTICAL ASSAULT was going to be transferred. After seeing the first two minutes, I began to think that Rutger might want to get a new agent. After watching the next ten minutes, I began to think that Rutger could resign, thereby saving a potential audience from any of his other speeches. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a really awful movie. I did not expect much, and why should I, if the name Rutget Hauer appeared in the credits, but a few seconds after the title titles, which depicted NATO military aircraft bombed by the USSR in Bosnia, I realized that after three months they were force-fed an inedible turkey after Christmas <br /> <br /> Attention to detail is missing. NATO aircraft were marked on the USSR aircraft, after which they were informed that Hauer's character spent six years in an Iraqi prison, which was to be held in 1997. What NATO bombed the Serbs in 1997! I think the producers did not think that the audience would have noticed this ridiculous inaccuracy, but I know what I did. The producers also probably hoped that viewers would not notice a lack of continuity, such as air battles with Iraqi planes, which suddenly turned from MiG into F-4 Phantoms, and then again, but I did. Even unfamiliar characters soar into the F-16, then when they return to the base, the jet will turn into a Soviet MiG. <br /> <br /> Yes, and if you expect a stupid action film, you are only half. That's right, because he is stupid, but most of the plot is centered around the main plot of revenge. I pay tribute to the producers (maybe the word is too convincing), because after watching the plots depicting the nannies from hell, the police from hell, the neighbors in the apartment from hell, we now have a fighter pilot from hell, which means every lesson The 20th Century featured in a plot from a hellish plot, perhaps “TATIC ASSULT” - the worst film of all
