It is currently the worst of the tox series. Acting in Tokyo is terrible, and you can understand them about half the time. The main problem with this film is all the sudden changes from the original. It's like thereâ€™s another Toxie friend in this movie, or it could be the same character with a different name played by another girl After about fifteen minutes, he begins to get better with blood and all that. There are 2 terrific murders, and then the film goes straight to shit. After 20 minutes of the film, the film is bearish entertainment. H * LL IT'S BEARLE SAFE. Well, unless you're drunk, don't watch this movie. You have been warned.
