This is a film that revolves around two riddles (which I have now demystified). <br /> <br /> First, did the filmmakers understand the concept of “parody” before using it for carpet bombing the audience throughout the film? A parody is when a reproduction tries to scoff, comment or pay homage through the self-deprecating humor of the original work. In other words, there must be reasons for parodying such work, and they certainly must be smart. I have not seen any of those in the film. I did see a few terrible 10 second jokes that failed within 2 seconds after delivery. Brian Stoller probably went to Eric Roberts and said, “Hey, I was drunk last night, watched Survivors, and I had to fart that brain to go straight to the DVD. this film without one! <br /> <br /> And here lies the second mystery: the career of Eric Robert. I used to think that Eric Roberts had a career because he was not lucky. Now I understand that it is because he is stupid (and therefore deserves the career that he had). After watching this film, it becomes obvious that he would be better off if he went to regular films for adults who have higher budgets, more ... intense ... scenes and roles, better play and direction, more thoughtful and convincing plot line, and a much wider audience than this B-film reject (C-film?).
