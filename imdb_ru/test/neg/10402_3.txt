Fear and Desire are of interest mainly to those obsessed with Kubrick, who can divert this pretentious cotton trap to signs of its still-coming greatness. Kubrick was right in trying to ensure that the film was not shown or available in a legitimate video. He considered this embarrassing and amateurish, and he was right in his assessment. This is a weak and tedious film - it still seems longer by 68 minutes than Barry Lyndon! - it, nevertheless, is of historical interest and has its original exciting moments. This film is difficult to find (only “unofficial” copies are in circulation), although this may change if the Kubrick estate gives way and releases it on video. Recommended only for Kubrick enthusiasts.
