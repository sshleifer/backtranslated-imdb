This is a low-profile propaganda film of the Cold War, crossed with soap. This may have some long-term significance as a snapshot of the US thinking of the 1950s, but it deserves praise in the Maucist storyline, in the style of wooden action and lattice. There are several interesting photographs of a long gone aircraft, but this was not enough even for an amateur of this plane to leave it on the screen at full length.
