This film is an example of a small budget, an ineffective cast, a weak storyline, and poor entertainment. This kind of film is made for commercial breaks, not for the entertainment of Bollywood movie fans. I went to this movie because I thought the previous gangster was tolerant, so this too. I appreciate only how the new actress very boldly showed herself in the film, she is very similar to Bollywood actress Nandita das. she is nice, sexy and well behaved. she will definitely go in her career. Our mifunda has always been good in his work. At least he has something good in the movies. I didnâ€™t like Imran, because his role was to advise him to cultivate himself, as he starred in many films as a new actor, and is perceived as an acting actor. In this film, there is nothing but a bold scene shot by a new actress. Never try this movie.
