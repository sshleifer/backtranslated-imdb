If Pulp and Shorty didn't exist, it could be a good movie. When I say this, I mean that nothing of this film is his own, if it is not just another terrible dialogue or a complete cliché scene. I don’t say more than I need, if it’s from the movie Get Shorty, it seems to appear in this continuation of the rubbish, all cameos like Stephen Tyler act terribly and are not needed, and as for Christina Milian, the guy doesn’t turn me on. It seems that some of the coolest actors and actresses, like John Travolta and Uma Thurman, look like they are trying to be with children and hips and almost ruined their reputation because of this film, and, frankly, I think the best acting game from Roca, who plays alongside one of my least favorite actors, Insom Vaughn. The man is trying to have fun with him, taking mickey about how rappers seem to be talking. Cedric with the artist and Andre 3000 play another terrible double act {personally it seems to me, the secondary actors were better than Cedric nd Andre} and Cedric’s only funny part of acting skills, Andre and the rest of the gang members is how the pants go down to the knees, so that you can see boxers clearly there, and the only reason I find it funny is because a lot of people actually do it. So in the end, this film is trying to be funny and fails, there is no new material, comedy or cool, because it copies every other film and finally, the only reason you should see it is if you want to compare how bad it is with his brilliant predecessor. Get the little one. Oh, yes, I forgot to mention that at the end there is a BIG cliché.
