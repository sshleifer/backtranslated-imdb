Savage Steve Holland wrote and filmed his second film, “One Mad Summer” with John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong again in a supporting role. Cusack and Bobcat Goldtveit are recent graduates heading to Cape Cod to stay with Grandmother Goldtveit for the summer. Along the way, they encounter Demi Moore, pursued by John Matushak and a gang of motorcyclists. Soon, all three joined together, trying to save the house from turning it into another restaurant for lobsters, an indulgent, spoiled family that considers "work" a dirty word. There are some funny vignettes in the film, such as jokes on a million dollar radio contest and a parody of Godzilla. <br /> <br /> As in the first Dutch movie Better Off Dead, John Cusack immensely adds to the film. Otherwise, this is a low-quality film, filled with contrived situations and idiotic characters (as opposed to fancy). Moore even sings a few bars in a nightclub with terrible synthesizers. The Goldtveit jokes are depleted over time, and Armstrong has never been an actor of any caliber appearing in anything other than material of class Z. The towing twins are extremely annoying and disgusting instead of the cute outsiders they must be. It’s rather a comedy about a kitchen sink that could use the best scenario and direction. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
