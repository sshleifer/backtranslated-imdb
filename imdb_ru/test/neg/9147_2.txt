This version of The Magic Flute is not only the worst production of the great Mozart opera I have ever seen, but also the worst video I have seen in any opera. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of opera, and I have more opera on DVDs than films. The sets are cheap and cheesy. Papageno doesn't even have a bird costume. He's just dressed like some guy. Sound in mono. The color is really bad. It is saturated with orange. Most DVDs from this period are digital in color, but they were not worried about it. In addition, the language was changed to Swedish instead of the original German. <br /> <br /> This is not the version of the movie "The Magic Flute". This is a filmed performance, and it is not very good, and it was not filmed very well. You can choose any other available DVD of this opera, and I guarantee that it will be better than this one. I prefer the conductor version of James Levin with the sets of David Hockney.
