It's not fair. I really expected it to be a fun, interesting movie. I mean, I like Drake Bell from Drake and Josh, and Leslie Nilson has nothing to sneeze, starting with his early classics, “Airplane” and “Naked Gun”. However, after watching the movie "Superhero", I am glad that I did not even have to pay for it. It simply would not be somewhere around $ 9 per ticket. More like a dollar and a few kopecks. Because it will summarize for an hour and a few minutes. And no matter how disappointed this film is, I am glad that the time of the show was so short, if not shorter. I just can not believe how incredibly vulgar, unnecessary and, above all, stupid, some scenes were! And besides, I saw how best to play with a wooden dummy (without a ventriloquist). It was as if Craig Mazin purposely wanted to make a film that deserves 3.7, if not lower, and even try to be worse than “Meet the Spartans.” Really very disappointing.
