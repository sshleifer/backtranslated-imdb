“Love Letter” is one of those films that could be really smart, but they have wasted them. Focusing on the letter that causes chaos in a small town, there is an cast in the film that has nothing to do. Tom Selleck and Alice Drummond recently starred in the super-fun "In & Out" (also about a frustrated little town), in which they both were great, but here they look like they get drugs everywhere. I can't say that people behind the camera are trying to do here (if anything), but they have definitely not achieved anything. How tragic that a potential riot of laughter is so sadly gone.
