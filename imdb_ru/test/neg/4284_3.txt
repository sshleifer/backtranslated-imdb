Man kills a bear. Man becomes a bear. A man / bear meets a bear. The man / bear remains a man / bear after meeting the bear. The end. Seriously, that's the whole plot for this movie. Yes, I simplified it to the extreme, but you get the picture. I just wish I could have seen it. <br /> <br /> The “male / bear” mentioned is an Indian Indian who kills the mother of a young. And while it may be touching, he certainly doesn’t have enough opportunity to involve a potential conflict between the two parties. Plus, there was a certain abuse of two moose in the film. But it does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Overall, in par. Of course, you needed a lot more to have fun. Maybe more laughter from minor characters and more drama between the two main bears. That's what distinguishes bad movies from good ones. "D"
