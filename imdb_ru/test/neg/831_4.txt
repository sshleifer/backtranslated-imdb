First of all, let me say that I wasted a Halloween movie night watching this trash. Secondly, let me tell you that the current DVD, available at Shriek Show, is not uncut, so that you, the hounds of dogs, will be very upset. Thirdly, this scene is the highlight of the film, and since it was shot, well, you see where I'm going. <br /> <br /> I know that many horror fans are digging this film. It is atmospheric, shot in a forest with very beautiful landscapes, waterfalls and the like. But after the first murder, in which a very cruel shot of a machete is clamped across the hunter's crotch, after that you will not get any real atrocious murders. And with a slasher film, you like that. At least I do. Director and co. Do not do anything new with the killer in the idea of ​​the forest, several films of this type were made at about the same time at the very beginning of the eighties. The only thing connected with this is that you don’t hate actors as much as in other films. They are kind of nice. Children have a reason to be there: one of them has ownership of some property on a mountain. But what is not explained is why his family has property there. There are no huts or houses here, so why buy property in East Jesus, especially if you are not a hunter or anything else? Well, I'm sure some people buy land for camping, but this seems unusual. Be that as it may, two screaming inbreds appear in the wilderness and begin to pursue the rest and select them one by one. And, as I said, you get almost nothing on the way to a decent death after killing a machete in the beginning. The end has Connie's kind of murder behind the wall, but even this is not enough to save him from being almost equal to the completely forgotten film “The Forest”, which is stunning. <br /> <br /> If Shriek Show was able to get a real uncut print, this review might have been a little more benign, but this is the day and the era of uncut / unpublished DVDs of old obscure films for moviegoers like me. When you notice us, you will get a rude review. Unfortunately, the presence of the great fatherly George Kennedy - the only highlight of this film, which distinguishes it from other garbage varieties of garden plants, which was released that day.
