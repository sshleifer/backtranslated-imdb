I would give it a zero if they had this rating. The fun wasn't fun. I was tired of the movie in about ten minutes, but I was patient until the end, thinking that it should have become better - this is not true. Others with whom I watched this film also agreed. The game was annoying. I'm tired of Jim Cary playing with Ham. The cast was no better. While this film was a statement about the corporate greed and plight of an employee who is attacked when a large company fails, the means for doing so would be better served differently. I really disliked the main characters (Dick and Jane) so much that their antics were never funny, but pitiful. I try to remember one scene where I or someone I laughed with cannot. A worthless movie and a waste of time.
