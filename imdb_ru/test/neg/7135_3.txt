I would not deny that I really enjoyed watching any Japanese horror films, but everyone should be fed up with it after you saw the same thing over and over again. <br /> <br /> The film follows the history of Grudge. Audrey, at the request of her mother, is going to return her sister. But when she arrives, something strange happens to her sister, and then she is killed. She wants to know the truth behind the curse, and later the photographer (Eason) joins her. On the other hand, something happens to the family and the three girls, but they seem to realize it too late ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I see no reason for the three girls from the International School to appear in films because they are (not at all) related to the story. The reason why a woman holding a grudge continues to kill people is still not very clear (I think they just say the same thing that I saw in grudge). And Audrey's sudden appearance in front of the boy is undoubtedly strange that, I believe, is an attempt to relate the story of the family. The scenes of the murder are absolutely the same mixture as in the Ring and Shibuya-Kaidan. The game would be another bad moment. As a Hong Konger, I would very much like to support Edison Chenâ€™s first efforts in Hollywood, but, as a movie buff, I really can't find a point in supporting a bad game. Other actors, such as the father, although he only appears in several scenes, also had to do more. What is well preserved is the atmosphere of the film, especially when I watch it only at night. <br /> <br /> If you have time, really enjoy horror movies and watch all possible horror movies. Other than that, like me, you can go for it to kill some time. But if you really like Japanese horror movies of this kind, you should spend some time watching the Japanese version of the Ring.
