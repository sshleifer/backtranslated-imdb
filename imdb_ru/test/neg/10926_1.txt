One commentator on Lil 'Pimp (dbborroughs of Glen Cove) got it right when he said that the film was really bad, but I object when he commented on the animation. <br /> The animation was not bad due to Macromedia Flash. It was a bad animation, because it was sent wrong. Flash is just a tool. In the right hands, the artist can create an animation that is full and smooth, like any Disney film, and in other people's hands, it can look just as bad as the material on the Internet, where Lil 'Pimp was born, and he should have stayed there. . <br /> <br /> Studios such as Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney and Warner Bros. create great animations using Flash (i.e. Puffy Ami Yumi, Foster's House for imaginary friends, Ray Mucha, etc. .). <br /> Lil 'Pimp was a badly thought-out hoax that was made because Revolution Studios bought Media Tripp, and Lil' Pimp was one of the included properties. Mouth and company thought they would make money fast using a Lil 'Pimp piece of shit, and deception was immortalized by its producer Amy Pell. The reason for this abortion in the third trimester of the animated film is that none of the leaders of Revolution Studios had a pragmatic brain to overshadow Mark Brooks and Peter Gilstrap (they really tried their best, but they were above their heads) and hire real ones writers. , director and at least a semi-competent producer. Although they did one thing right, they hired some of the best storytellers, designers and animators in Los Angeles, but as Lil 'Pimp demonstrates, you can buy the best sports car on the floor, but if you are a jerk, you destroy it for sure.
