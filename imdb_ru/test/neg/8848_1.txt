I do not see this movie. In most cases, such as Ju-On and The Grudge, the Japanese film is infinitely better than the American remake. However, this film was terrible. Ghosts, very similar to a ploy or a prankster, dressed like a moan of a ghostly ghost and wheeze in an attempt to get scared due to the lack of good makeup or special effects, and the action is just awful. The story itself is inconsistent and confusing, not everything is explained, and the film is getting worse and worse. Do not waste your time on this film, it’s not worth it, and I’m sure there is something interesting — for example, to watch the paint dry.
