This movie is terrible. At first I thought that the children might like it because of the pleasant Ewoks, the ardent little people from Star Wars. Having seen this monster from the film, I am sure that even the 4-year-old will not find this film interesting. Special effects are the best in this film and compare well with other 80s television films. The script is bad, the actors, especially Aubrey Miller, are incredibly bad and the film is so predictable that I still cannot believe that I could not touch the “forward” button on my VCR. However, I was close to turning off this mess more than once.
