Absolutely boring mystical thriller, which can sound quite theoretically, but loses very badly. The ridiculous scenario is full (LESS SPOILER) of people who die and then come back to life when the plot demands them, and the director seems unable to increase energy and tension. The blind sequence, which “explains” the name of the film, is the only half remembered in this tiresome film. (* 1/2)
