This film is one of the worst adaptations of Pride and Prejudice ever made, and if Jane Austen were alive, she would have demanded that her name be removed from the film. Austin’s novel is just a superficial story of the development of true love between Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy. This is also a commentary on Regency Britain’s class structure. This film focuses only on the love story, thus disappointing viewers who hoped that it would be fair to the novel. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with the historical accuracy of the film. In the film, the dance in which Darcy insults Elizabeth is not the refined gentry dance to which the Bennett, Lucas, Bingley and Darcy families belong, but the dance of the lower classes. Gentry would not dance as if they were dancing in a peasant shed. There are also problems with costume and hair. The custom of that time required married women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair, and women to wear hats. Women of the Regency era were not so emancipated as to publicly abandon hood requirements. The worst historical inaccuracy is the early morning meeting of Elizabeth (in her nightgown and coat) and Mr. Darcy (without a tie and vest), in which they confess their love for each other. This is unforgivable freedom with a novel. No respectable young woman or gentleman would go out in this state to undress or try to meet someone of the opposite sex at such an early hour. <br /> <br /> But the worst of this whole film is the distortion of Austin’s dialogue and the cruel modern communication. Austin's dialogue does not need the help of an author who thinks that he / she can write like Austin. The author of the non-Osten dialogue is not only lacking the talent of Austin, but does not feel the style of Austin. The juxtaposition of these two styles is surprising. <br /> <br /> As for acting, this is best done by Judi Dench, who clearly understands the aristocracy’s authority. Brenda Bletin takes courage to make Mrs. Bennet less horrible than the image of Austin. Her image is interesting and seems to work. Donald Sutherland is mistaken. His startled British accent is terrible, and he portrays Mr. Bennett too much, like the father of the 20th century, not the father of the end of the 18th century. Matthew MacFadein portrays Darcy flat. I can't imagine anyone falling in love with his Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightley is a pretty Elizabeth, but her image of Elizabeth Bennet is too modern. The knight focuses on the directness of Elizabeth, but her image is completely lacking in an understanding of the social mores and customs of the time. She would have read the novel well before attempting to portray Elizabeth and conduct a study on the behavior of women of that period. <br /> <br /> If someone shoots a historical film, it must be a truthful period. This film needed a historical advisor who really knows something about the Regency period. It also needed a writer who has a better understanding and understanding of the text of Austin. I can only hope that Emma Thompson in the near future will decide to shoot the film “Pride and Prejudice” in order to erase this filth from the head. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film is that there are many beautiful scenes in the English countryside. Chatsworth is well used as Pemberley (as it was in the BBC 1995 adaptation). But the beautiful scenery and beautiful actors cannot save this film. True Austin fans will rush home to watch their DVDs with the much more excellent 1995 BBC producing along with Jennifer Ela and Colin Firth or read the Austin text to erase this version of the mind.
