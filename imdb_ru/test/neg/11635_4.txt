1st Review July 29, 2001 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mark Dindal): Ted Turner's fast-moving, violent animated animation project of the group resembles television cartoons in many ways and leaves much to be desired in the area of ​​pleasant characters, but definitely has extremely incredible villains. I'm not even sure why children will like this film, because there are so many references to old movie stars, about which children know very little or know nothing at all. Mediocre effort at best despite the rave on the box, comparing it with Disney's efforts like Aladdin and the Lion King. Do not let this fool you - there is no comparison in history or in quality.
