Worst movie ever, without exception. Pat yourself on the back if you can sit through every painfully painful moment of it. Except for the case when a loser who became insane as a psychopath because of compulsory medical experiments, pours his pea soup on the doctor's head and laughs like any good delusion is crazy ... that's all.
