How do stories that do it badly. It's not a question. This statement. <br /> <br /> Here are my problems with the film. <br /> <br /> 1) Most of the development of the story was predictable and boring. My emotions were almost equal. In fact, it was not so much to attract the viewer to the film. <br /> <br /> 2) The characters were clearly charismatic. One was crazy, the other was confusing, and the third was damn boring. These people had absolutely zero reason. Despite the fact that I knew that this would not happen, I continued to hope that they would run into someone else, someone more interesting. <br /> <br /> 3) The physical environment was uncomfortable for me. Trailer ??? In desert??? The desert is a place that most people would prefer not to visit. How is it that these three people are in the desert ??? <br /> <br /> 4) And in the same desert. Did the author really expect me to believe that the last three people on Earth could find each other for several weeks in this desert? <br /> <br /> 5) Was it really necessary for Ms.? Ryan to be in two scenes that required a swimsuit? Hey, she looks great, but it was pretty useless. <br /> <br /> Okay, so if I thought it was so bad, why did I give him 3? I try to be as objective as possible. Despite the fact that I find Alan annoying, I must say that David Arnott did a very trustworthy job of portraying a neurotic nerd (the character reminded me of some more annoying roles of Albert Brooks). Jeri Ryan tried to do something with Sarah, but it was not very well written. So she had to be confused, dysfunctional woman. But why? What does this add to the story? From her mood swings, I had a feeling that they were jerking me (hard!) One way, then the other, then the other. <br /> <br /> I don't often go to the movies, but this one made me think a few times. Tough, predictable, boring. Act at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My 2 cents.
