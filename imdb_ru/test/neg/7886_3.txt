I first saw a poster advertising this film on a street in Helsinki, Finland, in June 2000. What attracted my attention was the proud announcement telling all readers that the film, although French, was “banned in France.” Returning home to New York, I found that one of the Art House cinemas in the City was showing a film, and therefore (with my Finnish bride) decided to see what was going on. Boy, have we ever been. <br /> <br /> From the comments read here and the reviews I knew, the film was brutal and sexually explicit. Not necessarily offended by either of these two conditions, I looked with an open mind, which excited the feelings of our Gallic cousins. Supposedly, like anyone who reads this, will know the story involves two women who start a crime and have fun murder in France (the film has English subtitles). The similarity with "Thelma and Louise", however, ends with this; the sex is extraordinarily vivid (and abundant), as is the violence (a lot of stomping to death, a lot of blood and other organic substances splashed after a bullet hit). <br /> <br /> At the intellectual level one could prove that the very essence of the film is the relationship between sex and violence (which is manifested only in the fact that these women know only one sex: one is a small prostitute, and another time from earns money by acting in pornographic films.When they, during their descent into crime and murder, took over their sexual situations, they react only with the same violence and cruelty that they themselves know and understand. that the victims of their frenzy called Not only creepy men interested in eerie sex (and there are several), but also innocent bystanders, for example, a woman at an ATM. <br /> <br /> I don’t really understand why the repeated “porno-movie” shots were all what is needed (except to portray physical contact as cruel, passionless and humiliated), and ruthless blood became quite tiresome after the first few violent spasms. <br /> <br /> This is a rough and rude movie, but, frankly, it deals with rude and rude people and equally unpleasant circumstances. From one point of view, the life of the French lower classes has been studied, and it is rather gloomy; For France, this is definitely not a ticket - perhaps that is why the French have banned it. <br /> <br />
