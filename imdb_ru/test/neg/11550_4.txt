"Eskanaba in the moonlight" - the first demonstration of how Jeff Daniels wrote and directed talents. <br /> <br /> I have seen the worst debuts, but this one is not so good. <br /> <br /> “Escanaba in da Moonlight” begins as a decent parody of this part of American culture. When we follow Rebuan Soady (Jeff Daniels) on the eve of the reindeer hunting season of 1989. He approaches the record of the oldest Conedi, who never throws a dollar. <br /> <br /> The film unfolds in the upper regions of Michigan and has all the normal cliché characters, but there is a warmth that tells you that this is not a vicious spirit. <br /> <br /> Well, Reuben heads off to the Soy Deer Camp, and his wife (Kimberly Norris Guerrero) gives him a native. a necklace, his happy hat and two forms of liquid that you probably don’t want to know about. <br /> <br /> In any case, she’s really the only one who believes in him. Finally, he gets to the camp where his dad is , Elbury Soady (Harvey Presnell) is waiting, and his brother Remnar (Joey Albright) will show soon. <br /> <br /> OK, let's fast forward. There are a few laughs, a few moments when I laughed out loud. But most of the jokes here are used several, many times. <br /> <br /> But the biggest drawback is spiritual / Native American events. Just when you agree with the characters, these strange things happen. But the special effects are so cheap that it is a big flash of light, and then the head quickly bounces back. <br /> <br /> And the final, well, it doesn't cost anything. <br /> <br /> The move itself was not bad, the bizarre character and the fun parody were good. But it should have stayed on that. Instead of stupid spiritual awakenings that look like rejected scenes from some kind of movie about demon possession. <br /> <br /> I give Eskanabe in the moonlight 4.5 out of 10.
