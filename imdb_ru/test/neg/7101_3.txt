"Tank Girl", I believe, was supposed to be the "Buckaroo Banzai" of the 90s and was sold as such. The comparison is admittedly appropriate; in both films there is so much of everything that happens in each particular frame of the film that, no matter how impossible it is to understand the plot, it is certainly not boring. <br /> <br /> “Dancer” is a fun enough ride if you turn off your brain before the movie starts. Otherwise, you will have such a dizzying pain, like me.
