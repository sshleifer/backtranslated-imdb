The problem with this kind of lyrical filmmaking is that you either make a masterpiece or a lemon: there is little average. To put it mildly, this is not "Berlin - a symphony of the city" or "Man with a movie camera." Unfortunately, this is also nothing to look at. <br /> <br /> The problem with this is that it is gloomy and unfinished, as if Michael Moore had boarded. He has nothing to say, or rather show us the pictures and sounds. Koyanisqatsi uses images together to put forward a thesis. This is just a patchwork in search of a point. (Although, quite by chance, the film tells us more about Uncle Sam's mind than he intends. There is something deeply paradoxical in the film against technology, against civilization, against the media, which is so deeply supported by technology. ”Do as I say and not like me. ”You just need to love the Yankees, eh.) Tonally, in this episode there is something sour and misanthropic. Both previous episodes had moments of lyricism and delight; this time the tone is constantly gloomy. It just doesn’t work during this time, as Gustav Mahler tells you. <br /> <br /> Stylistically, Nakoykatsi is a mess. Amazing digital things are especially erroneous. This gives the whole thing a completely fussy, redesigned look, and also undermines the “realistic” nature of the analogue “frames found”. (I mean, I'm sorry, guys. Partly the joy of Koyanisqaatsi was that it was a tribute to using optical film. But now optical film has become a historical artifact, they have to take the digital domain on board; but I don’t think digital materials often look like links to videos from CNN or BBC World.) And with the “frames found”, well, digital manipulations are often ugly, usually just silly, and false color and solarization made me think about. .. <br /> <br /> ... hmm ... <br /> <br /> sequence and the names of James Bond. <br /> <br /> Hmm. Oddly enough, there is a possibility that the film was simply stolen during the performance of Yo Yo Ma; he is as unobtrusive as Lawrence Olivier’s. Images must be very attractive to withstand all this charisma. <br /> <br /> Philip Glass himself is in a strange shape; never expected him to shoot down Verdi's requiem! (Made me laugh, which, of course, is not the desired answer to any part of this film). There is even one piece of music that sounds like Brahms. (?) Maybe they changed his pills. <br /> <br /> From our “empty questions” department: is Jeffrey Reggio an Indian Hopi in general? Or did he just make a comb in the Hollywood Hills? Oh, and are the various fragments of the videos from the earlier "episodes" of the trilogy a commentary on how these films are also part of the slushy world media?
