This movie sucks. It's horrible. If someone liked it, these people should look around their heads. The character Jackie Mason sounds like a retarded one. That guy who is trying to kill a gopher, a loser, and he sucks. Although Chevy Chase was in this film, he was not funny. In this film there were rude and unfunny jokes that did not include Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight and Bill Murray. Despite the fact that Jackie Mason's character was Rodney Dangerfield's character, Mason's character sucks. Rodney Dangerfield was funny! He should have come back! I don't care about Ted Knight, but Bill Murray should have come back too. Caddyshack was originally Murrayâ€™s career execution. If he was funny in the first, he could be funny in the second. <br /> <br /> Last comment: I recommend this movie ... NO ONE !!!!!!!! THIS FILM SEND !!!! THIS WILL GIVE, THIS WILL BE NOW, AND WILL ALWAYS FUCK !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> 2/10
