This film is a great movie, ONLY if you need to sit back and laugh at the stupidity of it. As a geologist, this film misunderstands most of the important facts and uses actors who are too young to even be seen in the top of their fields. I wonder how it shows lava bursts in massive caves below the surface of the earth. It is also funny that seismically active areas are shown to have a huge destruction from an earthquake measuring 6.5 points. They seem to forget that construction standards in these areas will be higher if a stronger earthquake is needed to cause so much damage. It is also funny that they make the coastline of Washington State, as well as Oregon State, to look as if they are good beaches of Southern California. The analogy with jelly donuts is very interesting, even if its use is incorrect. The director does a good job of adding more comic relief with two "adjacent" doctors of science.
