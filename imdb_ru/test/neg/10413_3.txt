Lonely Jim is like a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family, two boys of which are complete losers. Both boys of 30, live at home, absolutely nothing for them is not going to. I live in the Midwest and cannot name such a family. I took it because I like Bushemi's acting humor. Now I understand that I need a counteracting agent to make it work. Actor and camera work and installation were in order. The first 15 minutes helped you prepare, and the last 15 minutes helped you prevent the film from completely depressing Jerry Springerâ€™s plot. The women members of my family begged me to turn it off, but I prevailed, assuming that there was a turning point at the end, and we watched the entire movie. As expected, the male family members just left after the first 30 minutes.
