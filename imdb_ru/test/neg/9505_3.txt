This film is very difficult to understand why a couple wants a divorce? No reason is given, we know nothing about their life in Lisbon, and even nothing about the work of Marie. We can only understand that in this life a certain bore appeared. We do not even know who took the initiative to ask for a divorce. <br /> <br /> The way of filming is special: I didnâ€™t know the name of the director until the end of the film, when I read it on the screen, I understood why it was so slow, only 42 frames in a hundred minutes (I counted them)! It reminded me of some Japanese films that I saw in the 90s, in fact, we have to admit that this is an expression of a different culture, even if the set is random. I do not know if this story will suit the Japanese couple. <br /> <br /> You can see the logic of the scenes, but the result is boring, anyway, I decided to watch it to the end, because I wanted to get the spirit and meaning of all this. Actually, I only understood that the history of these two creatures is not over yet, as the train leaves the station without Marie. It is not enough for such a long time! I can not recommend this work.
