Seeing the names of the main actors (Statham, Snipes and Philip), I thought that the film should be at least decently funny or interesting. Instead, all I got from it was not just a boring 92 minutes, but a disappointment from knowing everything that was going to happen, and hearing tons of lame and battered phrases of a “bad cop.” <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the film does not have a good story to begin with. And when you have it, no one can help you, neither Statham nor Wesley Snipes ... even John McClain can save this film :-) It can be cool for children if they are under 12 years old because they don't care much about the story, and there are several big explosions in the film.
