Looking at the DVD release of The Blues Brothers and mentioning “Wired” in Belushi’s biography, my boyfriend and I were eager to get more information about John Belushi. I heard about Wired, but I didn't know too much about it and found it in the back of the local rental. I understand that Dan Aroyd was really excited about this film, and I thought it was because he did not portray them in a good light. But it has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The film begins normally, until they roll the body of John to the morgue. When he wakes up on the autopsy table and decides to run after him, then the full bad taste of this film begins. John undergoes an inspection of his life and all the confusion that he created with the “Angel”, the driver of a Puerto Rican taxi with an evil sense of humor, criticizing him and trying to force him to cross the road. <Br /> <br /> The two actors who portray John and Dana do not even look closely at the real actors (not to mention someone who is involved with this issue, for example, Lorne Michaels), which makes it difficult to really try to concentrate on them and how they were in real life ... but this is the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> I suppose it must be an "artsy" film - John is constantly tormented by drugs (that is, powdered soap in the bathroom, which is cocaine;) in such a way that it was also difficult to follow. Memories are changeable, which also complicates understanding. <br /> <br /> Probably the most tasteless scene occurred when John (literally) had to undergo an autopsy and was in pain while they took his heart off to weigh him. saying that he was unusually large because of drug use, obesity, yes, we understand this without a grotesque image. <br /> <br /> There are very few other actors in the film we know (where is Carrie Fisher for example? They were incredibly close. And Jim Belushi would be a great person to show) it looks VERY cheap, (we felt that looked as if the graphics were in the early 80s or late 70s, it felt as if it was shot in about a week, and, in general, did not show John’s side at all. I felt I had learned a little more about him from watching the episodes of “Saturday Night Live”. <br /> <br /> In the last note, Bob Woodward is confronted with narcissism, becoming a cinema, arguing with John about writing his life story. For someone who was supposed to be very loud, regarding the bust on Nixon, his caliber of personality could fit any writer in the National Enquirer, and therefore loses my interest in any of his work from now on. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie. If you want to see more about John, watch his films, watch Dan Aroyd's clips telling about him, or hope that someone has a taste for making another John film that will repeat “Man on the Moon” that in the end the result we expected. I think it was a “moral” type of film - you know, do not use drugs, but I think the creators of this film did not understand that his death caused many people (such as Carrie Fisher) to stop making drugs in general for this reason .
