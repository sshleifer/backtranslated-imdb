Peter Crawford discovers a comet in the path of a collision with the moon. But when the government does not believe him (stupid fact number 1). He builds shelter deep underground and collects a lot to see who will go. Plus, ready to kill to save humanity (stupid fact number 2). With millions of dollars of technology, how could a civilian see what NASA could not? Plus, the goal justifies the moral of this story is simply WRONG !!! This film is incredible and absolutely incredible. What ran through these people's minds, why the hell did such nonsense get this green light? Sometimes I wonder who someone needs **** to make a movie in this **** city.
