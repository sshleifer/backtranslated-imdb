I looked like a child, but not being a big fan of Jerry Lewis, I completely forgot it (not that I remember it anyway). The film revolves around impersonation (which seems to be in the program of every comic star!) - in this case, a German officer - and, although not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims (giving him a BOMB rating), these are not exactly classic things either , the leagues behind HUMAN Chaplin (1940), even if he is relatively narcissist! Ironically, the scenes before the appearance of a potential foolish general offer more fun than the rather forced humor at the Nazi account! <br /> <br /> The film was really the last breath of Lewis during his heyday; in fact, it turned out to be his last car, released in 10 years (here itâ€™s painfully clear that his particular stupidity did not pass through the age of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen)!
