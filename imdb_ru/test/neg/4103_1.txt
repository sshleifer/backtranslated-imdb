A friend of mine recommended this film to me. I should have known that I didn’t watch it, because my friend is a kind of nerd from a video game. But the title and cover made it good for some reason. I was so wrong. I mean, first of all, what happened to their costumes? And acting! Looks like they pulled people out of Barney. Except for Ben Kingsley. And why is he even in this film? He thought it was a comedy! But I have to say that the special effects were pretty good. But it was like the only good thing about it. I mean seriously, the film is worse than Pearl Harbor. And this is actually an understatement. Everybody must have thought, “Oh, I get paid, so it doesn't matter if this is the worst film in the world.” I would understand why someone could make such a film if he directed, shot, produced, wrote and forced his hopeless best friend to shoot and edit. Probably one of the worst science fiction films ever. One really tortured movie.
