This movie was so terrible ... I want him to go to hell with the one who ever made this movie ... I was a fan of all films with ghouls ... but when I saw this, I just cried, I could not cope with this .. There are not even ghouls in it ... like real creative monsters ... it's so cheap ... I did come to the witch ... that's bull bull no one wants to see a witch ... they wanted see what the film is about ... “GOALS” I'm right, am I right or what? That's why we watched the others ... now we have to put up with this horrible storyline ... It makes me want to eat my porridge after Spaghetti on Monday !!!
