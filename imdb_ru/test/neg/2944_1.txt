To identify this film as a vampire film would be technically correct. Just because it will suck the life out of you. <br /> <br /> The vampire effect is an insult to movie lovers all over the world. The plot is almost absent. Makeup is just awful. And the acting is just not there. <br /> <br /> I’m wondering if Jackie Chan should do a huge service to someone to make sure she’s going to appear in this film. <br /> <br /> My wife picked up the movie at the box office because it had a picture of Jackie Chan (as if he had played the main role) and thought that a good JC movie would be fun to watch. This movie was interesting to watch just as you can’t help but watch a car accident as you drive past. You very quickly realize that the film will not get better, but you continue to wonder how bad it will become.
