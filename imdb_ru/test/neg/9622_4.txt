I'm trying to understand what people liked about MirrorMask. I am an avid viewer and movie lover. As I told friends during my lunch break, MirrorMask could well be my biggest disappointment for the film of the year. Just like the short moon girl, the film missed the mark. Several times during the film he made attempts at humor. It makes you laugh. Instead of making you laugh, you feel empty. The jokes resembled one of the recent Star Wars films. They were not funny if you were not five years old. And the acting was just as awful. I have seen actors play in front of a blue screen. And I believed it. But not in this film. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> This film takes the formula and tries to apply it with beautiful artwork ?? And although the script is fully functional, and the special effects are pretty beautiful, he does not have a heart for him and he fails. I left the film, shaking his head, and thought to leave the theater. I felt sanctified and unhappy and still did not get the sour taste from my mouth. I love an independent film. I encourage people to watch independent films to support them. But not this movie. This film should not have been made. At least not the case. Why is the director so clearly overshot? They were clearly tuned ?? Not only humor. But emotions. Drama. Even the lines were poorly calculated and delivered. As if the film was going on three legs instead of four. His steps are clumsy and miss time. And it may fall with the slightest push ?? I do not see this movie. I don't care who you are. It is not worth your time.
