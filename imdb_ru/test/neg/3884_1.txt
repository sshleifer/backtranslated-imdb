After three hours in the cinema, the strongest impression was that something was wrong with them. What was clear was that the directors had forgotten to direct, the actors to act, and most importantly the screenwriter to write. Evervbody shouted for no reason and made one cringe. The script continued and continued with many twists and turns, which can be avoided by ending now, too familiar to Priyadarshan's theory of converging actors at one point. This theory has proven itself in Gera-Feri and Hungam, but somehow it was able to cause irritation this time, so that the habit of each actorâ€™s inability to answer the question was asked directly. The simplest questions, such as "what is your name, will be repeated N times." <br /> <br /> Finally, it was a mistake that the director forgot that his audience has something called intelligence.
