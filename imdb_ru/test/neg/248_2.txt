I saw it on Mystery Science Theater 3000, and even this show could not make this film bearable. I could make a better movie with a broken video camera and action figures. Of course, you expect terrible special effects with such an old film, but I saw silence that was better. The storyline has huge gaps that make you try to understand why they are even on certain scenes. The operator obviously does not know what a tripod is, and he had too much coffee, or maybe something more complicated, because the camera is ALWAYS shaking. I couldn't even follow the plot, but suffice it to say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. UPDATE: I saw “Epic Film” a while ago and decided to give this movie 2. This is NOT the worst movie I've ever seen!
