I was thrilled that my favorite comic book character was on television ... and very disappointed with the end result. <br /> <br /> The only “amazing” thing was crawling along the wall (despite the visibility of the cable). I did not think that Nick Hammond was Peter Parker ... and he clearly had a different physique than the guy who performed the tricks in a spider costume. You could say they were two different actors. <br /> <br /> Of course, I can also see in modern Spider-Man films when I look at Toby McGuire and when I look at CGI. But this is from an experienced look and experience with CGI. However, the 70s version could be better, despite the lack of Special FX. <br /> <br /> Cobwebs were hockey and looked like ropes, which seemed to be wrapped around objects rather than sticking to them. And what happened to give him a mobile phone with a spider so that he could go. Hello? He is a man who sells online. <br /> <br /> Sorry ... I didn’t want to worry so much, but our favorite slider deserved better.
