I think that Hollywood should seriously think about NEVER making another “biblical” film if Noah’s Ark becomes the norm. In addition to the terrible, completely uninspired acting skills of the entire cast (Voit and Steenbergen no doubt regretted the day they agreed to make this film), the timeline was completely rearranged. I also missed the role in the book of Genesis about the pirate battle on the deck of the ark or about the traveling salesman going on his kayak. Hello? ALL but the Holy Scriptures were dead except for Noah and his family. God folded the lumber and added plans to build an ark when Noah asked how ?? I also do not remember reading anything about Noah's wife, who constantly tormented him for 40 days, or how Noah wandered around with glass eyes and was constantly stunned. The author of the script obviously knew very little about the book of Genesis, or simply did not care that his abomination of history mocked her completely.
