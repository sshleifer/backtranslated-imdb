It is good that an American divorced with more money than brains buys a worn out villa in Tuscany. (Much more money; although she has to deal with the price, she subsequently manages to prepare luxury buffets for her workers and roam Italy endlessly, without work or visible means of support.) Endless boredom and the inevitable Italian lover will follow; it is a click of a chick in the most derogatory sense of the word. Lane behaves like an unskilled reckless teenager throughout her life - who dynamically conflicts with her seriously fading appearance - along the way, crashing into various (mostly Italian) cardboard stereotypes, dikes, divas, seniors prizes and gigolo among them. Swollen with unnecessary scenes, the most ridiculous of which is the awkward inset and meaningless re-creation of the fountain scene in La Dolce Vita. (Such vanity was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in “Only You”, significantly exceeding the ode of Norman Judison in Italy and the novel). The Tuscan Sun is perhaps the most vacant cinema of the last decade, despite its admittedly well-lit panoramas of Italy. A negative point bonus for a stranger lover who parachuted at the last minute to provide the necessary Hollywood ending for the target audience of housewives with brainwashed Oprah. Avoid at all costs, unless, of course, you consider Oprah and Dr. Phil as the pinnacle of intellectual discourse.
