Firstly, this film is so confused that it is almost impossible to let it down, since I myself did not understand this horrible story. In addition, an unknown cast under the leadership of an actress named Laura Mennell is just awful. The expressions and cries of Sarah Tobias’s character are funny and ridiculous, mixing grimaces with acting. Last but not least, IMDb has a lot of positive feedback about this film: <br /> <br /> - top quality - can’t wait to see more directors working ?? On September 24, 2004, the author has only one review in IMDb; <br /> <br /> - Incredibly shot, surprisingly intense ?? The author has only one review in IMDb on August 12, 2004; <br /> <br /> - Not your typical blood and blood is actually better. 7/10 ?? On February 13, 2005, the author has only one review in IMDb; <br /> <br /> - as strong as an Asian horror !! - The author has only one review in IMDb on November 14, 2004. <br /> <br /> Coincidence? Or are they parents, relatives, friends or people hired by the industry to promote this shit? My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “11.11 - New Profession” (“11.11 - New Prophecy”)
