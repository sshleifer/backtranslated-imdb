This show lasted through most of the 1980s and had its moments, but the stories were usually thin and often painfully unfunny. <br /> <br /> Terry Scott and June Whitfield were wasted in this sitcom, they both deserved better, but it provides some pleasant memories, and I found myself smiling at some repetitive scenes. June Whitfield's talent in comedy can shine through from time to time (when she doesn't interfere with Terry), and she is really smart. <br /> <br /> The 1980s is the last decade when you find this kind of middle class, middle-aged comedy, and many people remember it with love, but I prefer to remember the decade of alternative comedy and the biting satire Spitting Image.
