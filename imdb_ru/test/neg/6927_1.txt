I really wanted to love this movie. I read the book to my daughters, and we all enjoyed it. The book is amazing. This film is very far from the book. The book is great - this film is a terrible adaptation. <br /> <br /> In the book, Sarah is noble, good, strong, and NEVER does anything evil to take revenge on anyone. This is the POINT of the book! She behaves like a "prince" regardless of the circumstances. An important part of behavior like a princess is to not return evil. It means behaving with dignity, no matter how they treat you. <br /> <br /> In the book she brings a lot and touches the lives of others. Other people change their behavior after witnessing her kindness and ability to endure, not plunging into anger and vindictiveness. Sarah is doing what is right, just BECAUSE IT IS CORRECT. <br /> <br /> Outside the bakery, she runs into a beggar girl who is poorer and hungrier than she is. She has half a dozen hot buns. She is very hungry. She gives one bun to this wild-looking little girl huddled on the threshold of the bakery. When she sees how insatiable the girl is, and looks like she devours a muffin, she gives her another one. She continues to do this until she gives 3 or 4, I think - I do not remember how much. <br /> <br /> Baker looks out the window. She is so excited about what she saw, she takes a beggar girl and raises her as her own daughter. Sarah is also influenced by other people. <br /> <br /> In this book, her father died. The man next door is her father's partner - he was looking for her. In the end, her father did not lose his money - the man is very happy to find Sarah; he takes her and Becky to his home and raises them as his daughters. And Sarah, of course, has a complete legacy. <br /> <br /> Miss Minchin is not a chimney sweep. In fact, she remains in the same post at the school. But she is humiliated because Sarah told her new guardian about the abuse she received. And Sarah, after all, speaks with Miss Minchin — Miss Minchin tries to minimize her attitude towards Sarah and Sarah with calm and persistent behavior, instructs Miss Minchin that she was cruel. for miss minchin. She continues her miserable existence. No matter - what matters is that Sarah has a home with a guardian who loves her - and her dearest friend in the world, Becky, now for all intents and purposes, her sister. <br /> <br /> The book is about love and noble behavior in the worst circumstances. It is about self-control and humility. This is a great book. This film ANYTHING does not capture the true story and messages of the book. My wife was so disgusted that she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to post it. We were not rewarded. <br /> <br /> I can't think of a reason why a film should change this beautiful book in such a bad direction. Perhaps it was the influence of the horrible script from the book that featured Shirley Temple. I don’t know - but this film is so far from the book in character and values ​​that I don’t recognize it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time - buy a book. It's unforgettable ... even for dad!
