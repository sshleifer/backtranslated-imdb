Spend your time in any other way, even homework is better than this movie. The jokes are not funny, the funny rhymes that Dr. Seus makes are not there. A very lousy way to spend the evening. My children, aged 4-16, laughed a little at first, the youngest got bored with it, and they left to play Barbie, and the older ones - to play PS2 and surf the net. My wife left and did the dishes. So I finished this one. It was the worst kids movie I've ever seen. If you want to watch a funny children's movie, watch the movie “Shrek 2 ″, this film will be interesting for children and their parents. AVOID THIS FILM. It's not funny, not cute, cat cosmetics is the only good thing about it, and you can see it on the disc label.
