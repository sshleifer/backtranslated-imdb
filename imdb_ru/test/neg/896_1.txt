Sometimes it's funny to watch movies exploding from your couch, but sometimes it just hurts your eyes and your mind. Home party 4: until the last minute - one of those rare examples when your eyes and mind beg you to turn off a movie. This last part of the Home Party series is the worst, not only a sequel, but also a film released by Hollywood. From the very beginning of this “trait,” it becomes very obvious that director Chris Stokes was passionately in love with Ferris Bueller’s day off. I say this because it becomes quite clear that Stokes had no problems in order to remove the originality of “Bueller” from the hands of John Hughes and choose a film completely devoid of humor. You might think that by “stealing” the themes and images from a funny movie, your own movie can at least bring a laugh or two. With House Party 4, Stokes has proven that he doesn’t have what he needs to stage a sequel, let alone a Hollywood movie. From his confusing and changeable story, his inability to comprehend his characters and recycled old / weary clichés, all that Stokes does is to drive a bigger nail into the coffin that stores movies from a house party. It reminds me of this student, who forgets about his project, which should have been done in an hour, and quickly collects super glue, macaroni, cat wool, chewing gum and straw and presents it as “Hannibal crossing the Alps”. It just looks terrible, and you feel embarrassed by the creator. <br /> <br /> So, where was this film for the first time plunged into the realm of comic nonsense? Honestly, I don’t think most places will allow me to speak for so long, so instead I would like to touch on some of the larger topics that affected me the most. To begin, I still can't get rid of Ferris Buller's plagiarism. As if the director Stokes was ashamed of having to send another sequel to the "Party in the House," and he decided to introduce a completely random formula (from a more funny movie) and see if he could cut and paste elements of this series into formula. It was a huge mistake. When the director tries to do this, there is eventually a confusion in the audience. We think we are moving in one direction, but instead we are moving in another. This is exactly what you can see at House Party 4. In one case, we have John-John trying to arrange the “biggest party of the decade” while trying to win a record deal (well, it’s kind of reminds me of the original House Party ".), But then we go to this random island, where Uncle Charles is afraid to fly, Grandma gets drunk, and some idiotic tedious moments with the alleged killer. Again we start somewhat strongly and we end chaotically. This is the confusion in which I speak. Director Stokes did not have the opportunity to keep abreast of humor or tell a consistent story. He would prefer to cut corners, keep jokes cheap and think that viewers are idiots, rather than trying to revive a TV series tempered with stones. Someone might think that when the director was instructed to make another film from “House Parties”, he would come to him, thinking that it was he or she who would revive him or bring him back to life, instead, Stokes just wanted a salary. br /> <br /> I understand that with age I gradually grow old, but I believe that I still hold my hand on the culture of the younger generation. I listened to rap and R & B as a child, but the group “Immature” never got into my cassette deck or my CD player. What for? I don’t think they ever had enough followers, but apparently, director Chris Stokes would be useful to play them in the main roles in his new film House Party. Didn’t anyone in any studio understood that it would be in the red pretty quickly? Or how about the fact that Stokes himself played a comedic repairman, not like a director without a sense of comic timing, who considered himself the only source of possible humor. It was one of those few times when I actually missed Robin Harris, and I never thought I would go and say that in any movie. Besides the starring group, I also thought that the rest of the cast just kept sucking the life out of this film. Uncle Charles was annoyed when he tried to humor. Was Kim Whiteley completely wasted for her scenes (both literally and figuratively) while ?? Well ?? all others largely fall into this category. <br /> <br /> Where did Chris Stokes spend most of his budget on this film? Not for special guest stars, because, although this film could boast some, there was definitely no one at the “unforgettable” House Party, nor was it possible that, perhaps, Kid or Play would do one final episode. House Party 4 did not follow a predetermined design, which ultimately destroyed this feature from its very foundation. Can someone explain to me why, for humor, there was a need to use the “runaway killer who turned out to be a licensed taxi driver”? Stokes reached the bottom of the barrel and produced more dirt than substances. This time I can admit that there is no redemptive value in this film. Home party 4 buried the show, and although I heard that there might be something else in the process, I only hope that Hollywood realizes that this show has died. Hollywood should let this series end, forget about the past and move forward in the future. I think the sequel Who is this person? make them start in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Rating: * of *****
