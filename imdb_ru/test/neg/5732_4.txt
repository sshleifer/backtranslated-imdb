Sometimes deliberately polite, sometimes unintentionally stupid (for example, on the opening scene, where a woman is “informed” that she was raped and her family was killed just for the sake of demonstration), this film is not funny enough or sufficiently competent enough story) to be really enjoyable. I will leave you to decide what might be the main point, but the lowest point is probably the fight against a silly metal dragon. Bridget Nielsen was a good choice for Sonya, with her fresh face and firm, slightly muscular body (and I think her auburn hair is perfect for her), but Schwarzenegger gives one of her few discolored appearances as Kalidor.
