There was a time when everything was possible on film in the USA, so cartoons, horror films and explicit scenes came. The most famous are forced entry and hydropower, but, of course, they were made with a small budget. All shown on the 42nd in New York, but, hey, there were other houses where there was no budget fuss. Wet wilderness is an example of this. After a while, he walked around the underground scene, so copies were available, but, as can be seen from other reviews, some copies were sharply cut at the end. But the version I watched was complete. Well, I would call it still porn and then rude, there is a serial killer around, but he likes to watch others have sex rather than kill them when he kills, this is done off-screen. Acting is the worst thing I've ever seen. And I guessed that the so-called actors did not like what they were doing, for example, at the beginning, when we on the lesbian scene watch how one girl stops performing, pulls pubic hair from her mouth, then continues to do what happens when mom rolls on a black man, the daughter sits in the grass, irritated by ants! But it was the storyline that made this film famous, incest and racism - that was what made it famous. When the blood is monitored by two girls who are sitting there waiting for a signal to action, God, this is worse, but still there, if you are in a dirty and dirty house. Be sure that you have the full version.
