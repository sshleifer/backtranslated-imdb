..that's some good, catchy movies from movies like this. It is not entertaining, touching, funny, interesting and sometimes seems a bit subhuman. Principles act as if they were otherworldly, at worst when they should be connected with each other and the audience. <br /> <br /> Begins quite conditionally. A rich child receives a new car for graduation, but the dean says that he will not be able to take the car until the end of the ceremony. However, he goes for a walk and stops at a snack bar on the wrong side of the tracks to compete with local igokami. Wise waitresses / girlfriends from joke's head. Shockingly, they play chicken until they accidentally burn a diner they left three minutes earlier (aren't all the snack bars five feet from the gas station?). <br /> <br /> They said they had to pay a price in court So the only reason to get this “fish out of the water” to stay in the city is to come up with a script that both boys should help in the restoration of the diner. Worse, a rich child lives in the family of a poor child in a room above the attic. This “room above the attic” saved many people in need of a bed. <br /> <br /> A teenager inexplicably treats her friend, who never mentions that she almost killed her. Of course, this does not bode well with her boyfriend, and is never fully explained. You don't know why Sam (Lily Sobieski) falls in love with Kelly (Chris Klein), or why Jasper (Josh Hartnett) allows it. <br /> <br /> Chris Klein is tolerant, Lily is absolutely unbearable, and Josh does not make much of an impression. The character with the most life is the judge who sentences Kelly and Jasper to help rebuild the diner. She gets at least one funny remark, which is more than anyone else. Everything is so gloomy and without humor that you will feel a small threshold, even if you think about a smile, while the movie is on. <br /> <br /> The ending is one of the ways to finish the play, not the most original one, but at least it was all over. I don’t like to throw out a movie that can really please some little girl in the world, but since I'm not alone, I have to do it. The most pleasant thing I can say about this film is that it is not mean, and, although it does not force it, its innocence and homely, banal communication comes from a good place. 4/10.
