First, the IFC controls the city and the village, and now this. The difference between this smelly and pink Panther plagiarism is that the City and Country were watchable. This is not true. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the actors have signed up for this so that they can go crazy in Europe for someone else's day. Belushi is especially annoying. His scene with Candy (as Z-Grade Domi Luz) was torture. Speaking of torture, five minutes of a talentless Shepherd, and I bet that the prisoners in the Gitmo will break like walnuts! <br /> <br /> The real “Crime” (besides the fact that this is green lighting) is Shepard's character: a mouse wife, who takes Monte Carlo casino for half a million dollars! If you buy it, I have an ocean property in Arizona that might interest you!
