Although it must be the nadir of the sixth season, this episode of the devil is not badly written or acted. Most of us simply turned to the X-Files for tough, exciting horror / thrillers, ending without simple answers and moving to dark but incomprehensible conspiracies. The sixth season gave us a stream of comic comedies that undermined the continuity of the series and, frankly, made The Simpsons' Special Events for Halloween look like a great thriller. <br /> <br /> Victoria Jackson from SNL Fame plays in this episode. the long-suffering girlfriend of a man who arranges himself as the creator of rain. However, her boss meteorologist is the one who truly loves her, and Mulder is forced to give him tips on dates to get out of the city. <br /> <br /> Between the agents and some funny fun funny game but not too complicated characteristic of the Midwest Hicks. This is nothing you would like to see more than once! <br /> <br /> Season 6 is hard to understand. X-Files creator Chris Carter seems to miss the whole plot of the “Syndicate Conspiracy” and disclaims responsibility to black comedic writers.
