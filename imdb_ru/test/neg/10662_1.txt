(HR is what Himesh called in the film, I think he likes it too.) It's amazing how smart people, talented, even fall into the same trap. <br /> <br /> I really like Reshamia. It's amazing what he did. No one in recent years has returned from the desert and left no trace for himself. <br /> <br /> And I was really looking forward to a good movie (What about a budget of 50 Cr and a nice actress). I thought that, despite all his determination, he would succeed in a sentimental and emotional role. Ironically, he is depicted the same way, but what to take care of? Pure incompetence, carelessness, terrible play of actors, banal background music, insensible guidance make him a real pain. <br /> <br /> Rule of gross errors. (For example, how can the German police publish public instructions on the loudspeaker in English? They communicate in English!) Unfortunately, this incompetence has become the standard in the main line of Bollywood. There are great directors, but there are bad ones. Worst of all, most don't care. <br /> <br /> The songs are the only saving grace ... <br /> <br /> Please do not repeat this HR and find yourself a good director (low-budget. No problem). <br /> <br /> The villain had to really shave his head instead of the wig you know ... after all, this is a 50Cr movie.
