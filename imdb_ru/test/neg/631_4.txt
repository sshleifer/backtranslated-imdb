Not a horrible movie ... But there are monster scenes where you’ll roll on the floor laughing — not a good thing for an action / thriller. Acting on the whole is pretty decent for a SciFi film. Barry Corbin plays a reliable US senator, and Lou Diamond Phillips again gives us a decent figure of military / police / sheriffs / agents / marshals. The special effects are good, “special” - for example, shots from an external train are very obviously a model train. <br /> <br /> Fools: a meteor crashes into a standing car in the starting scene. The car lights up, but does not move an inch. After the impact, the meteor was stuck in the upper part of the hood of the car - this is impossible because of the low angle at which the meteor fell. <br /> <br /> Spoilers ... <br /> <br /> A good part of the film’s events are predictable from a helicopter crash (“Get up, get up!”) to the fact that annoying people get it at the end, to the classic to the blown up bridge across the 1000-foot gorge waiting for the train, at the end of the sequel. <br /> <br /> Scenes showing alien attack, funny. They are evil cute puppets and move at lightning speed - do you remember the rabbit Monty Python? Dummy spoiler: in one scene, four people shooting a clip for a clip, can not hit a single creature, because they move at lightning speed. Later in the film, Todd Bridges sets up a mini flamethrower, which he uses to send many creatures at close range. On several occasions, Lou Diamond Phillips can easily grab creatures with bare hands.
