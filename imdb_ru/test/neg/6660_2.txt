Words can hardly describe this movie. In this film, filled with ridiculous stereotypes, stupid plot and bad music, almost every category is missing. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by IMDB loans. This is not a Michael Dorn film. He is a minor character in a grand scheme. <br /> <br /> In the list of “Credits” there is also an actor named “Prince”, which makes me wonder if this is not the artist, previously known as…. Again, I'm not sure that this film is worth watching just for this. <br /> <br /> To summarize ... a bunch of teams ... one has kidneys ... one has $ 35,000 ... one has "Illegally" Substance ".... and one has 350 $ 000. Add some confusion and confusion about who needs to meet, who needs revenge for what you got, and the like, and you will end up with this mess of the movie. I had a choice, I would have missed a movie.
