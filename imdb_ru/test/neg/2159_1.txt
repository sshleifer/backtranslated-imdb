Yes, my resume tells almost everything. <br /> <br /> If you haven't watched it yet, try it. But not for pleasure. To study one of the worst examples of trying to be politically correct, family oriented and “cool” at the same time. <br /> <br /> Men always think they know everything, they are stupid and finally gorgeous women lose. And so on. This is especially offensive when all the characters are just as horrible and stereotypical. I mean, well, “Cody” was funny from time to time, but unlike other “stupid characters” such as Woody in Cheers or Joey in Friends, he doesn't get good lines. His stupidity is expressed in the "dude", which after a while becomes quite annoying. <br /> <br /> Family morality is terrible. All for the family. Mother and father are supreme dictators who, between severe punishment and old-fashioned upbringing, constantly say that they "love" their children, and, of course, in the end, children love them back * barf *. <br /> <br /> AND: there is always a “soft spot” similar to this, squeezed into an “action” where American (s) (tm) morality lessons are imposed on the audience about sex (in adulthood, you cannot sex before you 18 (!!), like) or drugs. Even church habits are described in detail here. The whole concept is downright disgusting, everything is done hesitantly to make money. If there are people like Karen and Frank, please lock them and unpack the key. <br /> <br /> So, with themes ranging to abominable religious propaganda, I think it would be fair to conclude, as I did in my subject ...
