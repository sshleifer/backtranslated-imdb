The setting for “Nature of the Beast” is ingeniously simple and has unlimited potential for waiting: the exhausted salesman Jack (very domesticated Lance Henriksen) raises the problem in the form of a hitchhiker Adrian (Eric Roberts), who seems to be in possession of compromising information against Jack. Oh, and more than a million dollars were stolen from the casino, and someone called the "Hatchet" dismembers people in the desert. Sounds great, right? It seems like a "fellow traveler" meets "Psycho." One or both of these people have a secret, and nothing is as it seems! Well, unfortunately, the screenwriter-director Viktor Salva (from the films “Jeepers Creepers” and “The Powder”) does not have enough ideas to continue the film, the script does not cause tension or uncertainty (poison for what is supposedly a “thriller”)), and the inclusion of the main homoerotic tone seems out of place. Henriksen causes an unusual, not quite down-to-earth Dweller (even with abundant intestines), but Roberts is about as threatening and frightening as the extra in Deadly Desire 3; we never get to the point where we actually care about what is happening and the withdrawal slides over incredible territory (I always thought it would be Fight Club again, but I was wrong). Very bad. The "nature of the beast" could be something else ... and not something else.
