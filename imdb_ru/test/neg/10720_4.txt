Unfortunately, this is not as good as any other film that Jim Carrey (producer and starring) and Brian Grazer worked on together, but some of this is definitely worth a look at laughter. Mostly Dick Harper (Kerry) believes that he is promoted to a better job. This is until Dynocorpe drowns and closes. Now Dick and his wife Jane (Thea Leoni) and their son, of course, have money problems. No matter what they try, they cannot collect the money they really need. Therefore, they begin to rob several places. And then they decided to rob the guy who framed Dick, his former boss Jack McAllister (Alec Baldwin). I think the funniest beats are when Kerry in the elevator sings “I believe I can fly” and when he binds someone in a robbery and talks to a voice changer (it sounds like a crap robot). Good!
