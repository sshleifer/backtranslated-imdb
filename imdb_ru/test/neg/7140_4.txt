Meanwhile, in Tokyo, three school friends Allison (Ariel Kebbel), Vanessa (Teresa Palmer) and Miyuki (Misako Uno) visit the famous haunted house and are also cursed and haunted. In Chicago, Trish (Jennifer Beals) moves to her boyfriend’s apartment, Bill (Christopher Cousins), who lives with his children, Lacy's teenager (Sarah Römer) and boy Jake (Matthew Knight). In the neighborhood, strange things happen to their neighbor. <br /> <br /> "The Grudge 2" has scary sound and visual effects, with a creepy woman and a boy, and I was surprised a couple of times while watching this movie. However, the complex three-story scenario is completely confused, which makes the interlaced plot a complete mess. Too many characters and situations, and at some point I was completely lost with a fragmented and fragmented narrative. In the end, I was completely disappointed with this confusing, but also creepy movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "O Grito 2" ("Scream 2")
