I saw this film with very low expectations. I knew little about it, so I wasn't sure if it was worth it. <br /> <br /> History has done an excellent job to get you interested in these ruins, to which they are sent. The wait continues when the Mayas appear and force them to remain on the ruins. <br /> <br /> Then the film turns from somewhat stressful to meaningless. The amount of blood found in this film is unbalanced compared to whether it was really necessary or used more for shock value. <br /> <br /> The fact that they made no attempt to fight the vines from hell, they had a fire, and he did not try to burn it, and also did not try to cut it with a knife, to see if they could destroy or not. They quickly jumped onto the victim role, and their helpless attitude was not real. It reminded me of old horror movies, where people just scream and scream, and they donâ€™t have half a shadow to try to fight back.
