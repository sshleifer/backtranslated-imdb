Five years after the US Civil War, Westerners are more concerned about the age-old war between the owners of the herdsmen and the herders. Herders graze their goods from Texas to the city of Abilene, Kansas. There the cowboys find not only big money, but also a great confrontation with the servants. High in the saddle Marshal Randolph Scott (as Dana Mitchell) is trying to preserve peace in the city. Mr. Scott has the experience of mediating between the hands of the track and the visitors of the salon. He also manipulates the most beautiful women in the city: the sexy singer in the salon Anne Dvorak (like Rita) and the cute church lady Rhonda Fleming (like Sherry). Buzi County Sheriff Edgar Buchanan (like Bramble Trimble) offers more comic relief than help in heavy shooting. <br /> <br /> Abilene City begins with promising symbolism and contrast: Scott and Miss Fleming interrupt shots, sing a hymn in the church; then the camera switches to Ms. Dvorak, sexually singing her cabin number, with the result that the man with pleasure shoots a pistol. After that, it really becomes a fairly standard western; it is somehow more boring than it should be, but not exactly awful. Young Lloyd Bridges appears as one of the hosts. Dvorak's long-legged costume is the greatest value of the film; in this it is a real driving force. <br /> <br /> **** Abilene Town (1/11/46) Edwin L. Marin ~ Randolph Scott, Ann Dvorak, Edgar Buchanan
