Yes, that's right, guys, this is undoubtedly the worst show in the history of television. If you want to look at a sad, lonely and unfunny hacker-comedian who is trying to entertain the masses of half an hour of pale and tired conversations in society that your cousin with weak backwardness at the dinner table commented on Thanksgiving, then this could be a show for you. My friends call it a sharp comedy, but, frankly, it makes Tim Allen look like Richard Pryor. Avoid at all costs. If you are not a masochist.
