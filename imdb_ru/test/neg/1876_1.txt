This may be for those who were in summer camps, but this is definitely not an entertainment camp. I went to one before, but it did not make me scream with joy. Instead, my head ached. <br /> <br /> The first thing you noticed was that Bill Murray had hair in the 70s. Yes, and he also did not mind to control some. But in order for him to run a lot, you need to give him a pursuit of a woman. <br /> <br /> Not that some of the stunts could not be funny. For example, a running joke with one of the advisers, who always wakes up somewhere else due to the movement of his bed. Instead, his jokes and stunts were poorly tuned and executed. Just funny did not work. <br /> <br /> For someone who loves comedy, it's a pain. Others are glued to it for life. I wish it was more like Leonard Part 6, but it is not close. "F"
