Rutger Houer's fans WILL NOT BE MISSED - he only plays a cameo in this film, and this is IT. This movie loses an extra point for this scam. I think Rutger Hauer has a total of about 2 very short scenes and 2 very short offscreen comments. <br /> <br /> The female role in this film is far superior to this meager material in views and talents - she’s great, this film is a dog, and she’s wasted on it. The story of a lawyer who once hopes for this partnership in a firm that is forced to transport Boss's niece throughout the country. They have several encounters on the road with different eccentrics, and this is a car for different parodies, and the dude who played Napoleon’s Dynamite is added to the mix as a side character for good measure. <br /> <br /> This is a trip in which extreme circumstances put our repressed hero to the test, and by the end of the film he gradually weakens, and this is not love, grand, poisonous poison. <br /> <br /> View this the film is only if you want a hot chick for an hour and a half to annoy a jerk in a truck.
