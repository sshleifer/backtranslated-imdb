Telly Savalas calls it a Mexican revolutionary (although Chuck Connors and the military martinette compares him) in this joke, although he rather dullly tells about the life and time of the famous historical figure. An earlier attempt, VILLA RIDING! (1968) with Yul Brynner in the role and co-author of Robert Mitchkum, considered these events more soberly and on a wider scale. Thus, PANCHO VILLA is too typical a European enterprise, which, despite its authority, is unremarkable; the end result is often more stupid than funny - although a few moments, in particular, the fighting scenery and the scene of the fight inside the church, bring easy pleasure. Oh, and Savalas can even sing in the final games!
