I can appreciate films with subtitles from other countries, especially those in which the subtitles are weak and do not seem to follow the story or have no meaning, but this film had too many parts that really did not make sense. <In general, I can admit to a few scary and bizarre parts, but they are repeated, I felt that I was watching a loop trailer; Looks like it was a short film made by different actors. <br /> <br /> In the spirit of RINGU and GRUDGE, but not even close to deception ... excessive length killed the thrill. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of these types of films (which I thought I was), do not waste your time on this.
