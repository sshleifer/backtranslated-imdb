I like to think that I saw it all. SS DOOMTROOPER. About the family of saber-toothed tigers. About the Pteranodon family. PIECE EDIT. DEMON CHILD (a rubber doll of an inanimate child with horns pasted on his head. A few clicks of SASQUATCH, none of them are good. A pair of giant spider / insect clicks. Endless HELLRAISER sequels. Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels. Endless JASON sequels. Pugokalo sequels. Enduro LEPRAUCHAN endless sequels. JASON endless sequels. Pugokalo endless prequels which is actually about a city street parade recorded on someone's video camera for $ 199. And so on. D. One evening I was watching a part of a TV program about people abandoned on kickboxing on an uninhabited island with a group of poorly animated totems. I even sat in DREAMCATCHER, Recently, just like last night, â€œWell, I must say that I sat in some of its parts, seeing it in all its terrible glory many years ago. But nothing compares with the island PREDATOR, about a group of young men trapped on the island during a storm, forced to fight with aliens who arrived in a meteorite. The meteorite looks as if it came from a supersensible cartoon of the 1940s. Like aliens, for that matter. Photography, acting and directing as well as writing are all equally bad. I turned it off halfway. Good luck.
