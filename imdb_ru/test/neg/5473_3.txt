Donald Pleasant and Peter Cushing teamed up in one horror movie; it always sounds like a terrific plan. Two of the most universal cult actor of his generation, who had previously starred together in stunning genre series such as “Flesh and Fiends” and “From the Underworld”, united in a film about satanic exploitation in the mid-70s. How can this go wrong? Well, unfortunately, it is possible. To my deepest regret, “The Land of the Minotaur” can hardly be called mediocre, and this is despite the cast, the exotic setting, the attractive title and the potentially great sounding premise. In a remote small area of ​​Greece, in particular, near archaeological excavations, numerous tourists disappear, because Baron Peter Cushing and his obedient followers continue to feed them with a fire-breathing statue of the Minotaur. Kushin, who never looked more bored and disinterested in any role he had played before, owns a gigantic medieval castle, and obviously, in Greek, this means that you also have additional archaeological ruins and an underground network of caves. This, of course, is very convenient if your hobby is kidnapping of random tourists and amateur archaeologists. When his three young friends disappear mysteriously in the same area, Father Roch, a priest from several cities before), decides to investigate. The Land of the Minotaur is a boring and extremely slow horror attempt that never makes any serious attempt to create a satanic atmosphere and does not bother to work out all the potentially exciting elements and details of pagan trifles. The titular Minotaur, for example, is an intriguing creature of Greek mythology with the head of a bull and a human body, but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens the meaning. Instead, the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative strings and loud inappropriate music, modified with experimental noises. The only reason to even think about giving this major film frustration a chance because of Donald Pleasure. His image of a rude, powerful and old-fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is as strong and reliable as ever.
