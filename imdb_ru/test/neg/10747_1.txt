The last sentence of this review is the main spoiler. <br /> <br /> I liked Joe Dante's work from the time of Piranha. He made many different genre parodies that were funny and honest. <br /> <br /> But this is just nonsense. This is a kind of satire - in accordance with “Thank you for smoking” - it is so literal and straightforward that it leaves nothing a) to be laughed at and b) to leave the audience to think. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the plot and material is so rich, timely and ripe for intelligent comments. <br /> <br /> By the way, the main character has absolutely no reason to shoot the character Ann Coulter at the end of the film. This is ridiculous.
