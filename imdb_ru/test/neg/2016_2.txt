A spacecraft traveling through the galaxy meets a mysterious cargo ship, apparently sailing in space. The crew is investigating, hoping to claim its cargo and purchase a ship. However, having boarded an ominous vessel, their own ship mysteriously shuts off, leaving them to fight and fight with none other than Count Dracula or Orlov, as this creature calls itself. <br /> <br /> Not a bad start. I mean, it follows any number of typical sci-fi / horror. The genres were enough for even the most original story to inevitably cause a comparison with any other film. But when you start with a rather typical convention of horror, the legend of Dracula and the vampires in general, and combine it with quite typical science fiction, the team runs into something and gets out of control, battling with what they have to face. . filmmakers better take care to capture their imprint on familiar genre scenes. <br /> <br /> Directed by Darrell Rudt, who also wrote “Dracula 3000” together with Ivan Milborrow, bears the main responsibility for this complete failure. So no, Rudt and Milborrow have nothing but their hands. <br /> <br /> This film begins quite ominously, with a very poorly pronounced voice of Caspar Van Dien, in fact, providing enough explanation to explain who the crew is on his ship. I should also point out that the hero Van Dien is named Van Helsing. And, oh, very clever, this character Orlova from the planet Transylvania in the Carpathian system. No kidding. Come on guys, we got it. And, again, do not be stupid and use such names if you do not have something special in the store. <br /> <br /> So, after Van Helsing introduced the team, we essentially got a movie about this team trapped in a spacecraft with a vampire lurking around. <br /> <br /> I am a very forgiving viewer when it comes to low budget films. Sometimes they can be brilliant, see the first two films of Raimi The Evil Dead. Dracula 3000 had a decent budget, sufficient for some decent special effects and for the salaries of 3 stringers, such as Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio, etc. However, unlike the EVIL DEAD movie, there is no talent behind the camera. The talent in front of the camera is insignificant, but I'm going to give the actors some benefit from the doubts. Looks like they don't know what to do. The best actress of the group, Alexander Kamp-Groenveld, quickly dies, and the ever-fascinating Udo Kjer turns into an exhibition car for the viewer as the late captain, whom we hear and see in a video magazine. Grant Svendbi is also good, as with a professor, but in the 3000th year it is difficult to take seriously a scientist who wears glasses and rides a wheelchair. And yes, it is a WHEEL chair, because there is nothing futuristic about it. As for the rest of the actors, well ????. I'm sure that Kulio really tried to be scary after becoming a vampire, but, well, I don't think irritation qualifies as scary in most people’s books. Tiny Lister and Erika Eleniak also give little. Lister is never more than a big muscular black stereotype. In fact, Eleniak seems miserable throughout the entire film and never tries her best. Eleniak is a beautiful girl, even in her mid-thirties, but she looks a bit exhausted and disinterested throughout the film. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Count Dracula / Orlov, played by Langley Kirkwood. To be honest, I can't remember who exactly the vampire should be. He presents himself as an Orlov, but at some point he also recognizes himself as Count Dracula. Go figure it out. In any case, you will be completely amazed at how lame this vampire is. Have you ever put a scene on which these tricky horror hosts would show local networks at their time intervals? Yes, this is so bad. Langley Kirkwood, the actor playing Orlok, must have found it almost impossible to concentrate in such a ridiculous outfit. I'm sure his friends still bother him. <br /> <br /> There is nothing special in the story. The vampire is the last of its kind, and for some reason he wants to go to Earth, and there are some words about the desire to defeat the character Caspar Van Dien, Van Helsing. Most of the team is turned into vampires, including Van Helsing, and the team uses regular machine guns and pistols to try to beat them before they understand the old count in the heart routine. Yes, that's right, bullets, and yes, the year is 3000. In this incomprehensible way, there remains one of the main areas in which the crew is hiding, fighting vampires or vampires, since there is never more than one that threatens them, filled old soviet posters and insignia and the like. What the? There are also references to the fact that God / religion are outdated systems. But these links only embarrassed me. Is the Soviet Union back? Is there any point that Rudt and Milborrow want to do with this? He never goes anywhere, he seems stupid, and posters, etc. Just cheap. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the film is correctly shot and edited. There is nothing spectacular in the cinema, but this is clearly done by professionals, and I had no problems with special effects. Ships are like ships in space. Although, when I write this, I remember how terrible the body of a captain looks like when a team finds it. What were they thinking about? Why didn't someone say something? See how hard it is to say something positive about this film without being distracted by the negative? I think, ultimately, this thing. Whatever positive side you take in this sci-fi disaster, you are overwhelmed by the lack of quality. <br /> <br /> Poor Udo Kir.
