Sometimes there is such a bad movie that you just watch in awe. This is one of those movies. Of course, I can not help that I am biased. I'm from Chicago, so I watched the scenes closely, and Billy Crystal is anything but funny. And I can not stand all this photograph in the English style (Tony Scott, etc.) With a smoke machine working overtime and with all the bright, soft lighting. I guess we have to believe that Billy Crystal is really from Chicago because he is wearing Cub's jersey. Oh, and the plot. If you really think about it, these guys should be locked, not the bad guys, because they are more dangerous. And, of course, the clich√© of policemen on the verge of retirement. But the funniest scene is the climax, when the Thompson Center (the death penalty) kills both the good and the bad guys from a machine gun. Of course, this is a cool building, but this is tantamount to concluding a huge drug deal in the White House.
