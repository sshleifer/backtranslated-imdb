I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever, until I saw this monster. My friends and I went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie. We could not find it, because we saw almost every movie created. We decided to look at the horror section with a low budget. We were looking for the most attractive cover with the image of poorly dressed women. We finally decided on the Last Pajama Party. Sorry, we made a mistake. It seems that this film was shot with the cheapest camera that could be found in K-Mart. Actors were selected in the Salvation Army, as well as Steven Tyler. We just leave it to the imagination. The plot of this film was ridiculous. SPOILER WARNING There is absolutely no closure while watching a movie. Then come to find out that all events were just a dream. This film was also supposed to be about 30 minutes. If all cameras were enlarging photographs and taking pictures of walls, it would be much shorter. All that I can say, I am glad that there was no continuation.
