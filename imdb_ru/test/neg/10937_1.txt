Has Uwe Boll seriously disrupted the main idea and dialogue with Se7en ?! Why is it so hard for this moron to be original ?! He even mentioned in an interview with Gametrailers that he chooses such things as games to turn them into films, because the characters, the plots, the prehistory, etc. are already there and are ready to spoil him. <br /> <br /> I think it is not. For him, not too much strength to completely tear off another movie ... <br /> <br /> I mean, seriously, what the hell ...? This is what I did in honor of Uwe ... <br /> <br /> http://zuucka.deviantart.com/art/Uwe-Boll-is-a-Douchebag-70369862
