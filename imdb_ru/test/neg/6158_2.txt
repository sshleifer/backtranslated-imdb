This film fails on many levels. The script is the first failure, and as far as I understand, if the script stinks, there is nothing that could fix it. The plot is boring, after the first 45 minutes, I look at the counter on the DVD and say to myself: “How many more?” The cinematography is pretty awful. I'm not sure how bad the transfer was to DVD, but it looked like a copy of VHS. In addition, the sound was bad. I understand that it will not be possible to make a remix of 5.1, but it seems that it did not even sound like in Dolby Stereo, which existed for almost ten years when they were making this film. <br /> <br /> Slipstream was too much like Mad Max and Blade Runner for comfort. Due to the lack of decent special effects and the high quality of the dialogue, this is extremely disappointing. If I remember, the scene of the pointer occurred in the last 20 minutes, usually it should happen in the first 20 minutes. Most people will be completely confused by what is happening until the last 20 minutes. <br /> The film's music was excellent piecemeal, and then completely out of place in others. Elmer Bernstien did a test, but it looks like someone else had a hand in inserting “other” things elsewhere, as this does not correspond to an overall good orchestral score (with some synthesizer music.) <br /> <br / > There were great actors, Bob Peck, Mark Hamill, Ben Kingsley, Bill Paxton. And they did a great job, breathing in their heroes little accessible life. (Well, Paxton's character was pretty stupid, and the whole film was focused on him. I'm not sure that the heroic puppet is a good choice for the main character who wears the film.) Again, the main drawback of the script. <br /> Thank God, I watched this in the mail on DVD and not in the theater. In general, a big disappointment for science fiction fans, or fans of Paxton or Hamill. 90 minutes of your life, you will never return.
