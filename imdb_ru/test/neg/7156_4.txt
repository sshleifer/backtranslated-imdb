I really hoped for the best with this, but it just didn’t happen. Funded very non-Dutch and still looks great with style and pace that is very similar to Hollywood. What I don’t understand is how, with all these enormous advantages, the director, the writer, the producer still managed to make this film an absolutely horrible movie to watch. Filled with bad jokes, cheap nudity and actors who simply can't speak English. Kudo for doing it, but what was this guy thinking about!
