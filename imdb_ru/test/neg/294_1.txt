I'm not going to mention any plot — this is strictly film B on the road to obscurity. Shock for me, however, to see what happened to some of the actors in this film. Erika Eleniak, who would never have been what you would call a fake, seems to have turned into Anna Nicole Smith (in her Big Period). Daniel Bernhardt - I almost cried. He has always been my favorite because of his mastery of martial arts, as seen on the Bloodsport series (also B movies, but if you like martial arts, it’s highly watchable) Here he is the shell of his former self-confident, he is older, but he does a hired job and does not even look interested ... I just don’t understand. Do not these people invest? William Forsyth is another “heavy” that I always liked, but his last few roles are what you would call “mailing”. I'm not even going to mention Mr. Reynolds - his concert is unequivocal, nothing more. The only winner is Andrew Divoff, as usual, a creepy, angry, cracked villain with a sandpaper voice who can roll milk - the best look! This is a movie that you watch for a laugh. This is nothing else.
