This film really made me think ... but not about the plot, direction, characters, main message or smart script. Not at all. I was wondering what went wrong for Sam Hill. It is clear that from the very beginning something was wrong. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by the positive comments on the film and the performance of Jodie Foster. From the very beginning it was clear that Foster had called about this. One of the previous comments even mentioned her facial expression. I must have watched another movie because Miss Foster (usually a personal favorite) seemed completely disinterested. <br /> <br /> In one of his first scenes with Foster, Fred Ward looks like he, too, is distracted by her lack of energy, and he struggles to put his own lines with any enthusiasm. By the time he is being urged to take part in the allegedly desperate search for an escaped Foster, Ward seems to have been embarrassed about the project. one-sided performer, so I did not expect much from him ... and he did it. <br /> <br /> Yes, it made me think long after it was over. The fact that Joe Sands and Charlie Sheen refused to include their names in the draft suggests that this has become a smelly business for all participants. But then find out that the director preferred to hide behind a pseudonym, says a lot. <br /> <br /> But why listen to me? I always think that Foster looks ridiculous in a dress, but she is sensational in lace underwear.
