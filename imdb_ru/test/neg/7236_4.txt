This is a continuation of the Octopus. <br /> <br /> Pff ... OK. Lots of videos, but pretty good. I'm surprised they really had a giant octopus robot that didn't really look so bad! I was actually very surprised by this. <br /> <br /> In general, the film was just fun. He never explained how the octopus became so big and is not related to the first one. But it was still fun. <br /> <br /> The end of me and my friend laughed. In fact, after the octopus explosion, one of the two main characters launches a bomb, and five explosions appear on the screen, most of the video materials! We joked that they went to the dollar store and bought a toy “five missiles in one”! Believe me, it needs to be seen to be believed! In general, just stupidly fun. It is worth giving a chance by buying if it is cheap.
