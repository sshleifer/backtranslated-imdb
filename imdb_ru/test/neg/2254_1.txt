Seriously disappointing performance of Brad Pitt and QT, the plot is very superficial and lame, and, if not implied by indirect intent, this film actually glorifies the Nazis and portrays them as people of honor, and shows that the Jewish people are deceiving, cannot keep promises and bloody vicious. ((NEXT CONTAINS SPOILER)) Hitler, along with the most notorious Nazis, visit a stupid story without a movie about the murder of 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema in Paris, which is incredibly funny. the Nazis laugh and scream about every murder in the film, as if watching a basketball game Stupid, the deal at the end is lame. What is really terrible is that the film received excellent reviews and in the 40s is among the 250 best films. I would not be surprised if he collected many awards, including the Oscars. the film is just a kissing ass for the Jewish people, but, think, he can't even do this job. it really overshadowed the entire Nazi-Jewish conflict and pure insult of all who fought and suffered from the tyranny of the Nazis.
