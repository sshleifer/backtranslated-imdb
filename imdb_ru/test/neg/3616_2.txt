I really do not think that I need to write a review of a film with the same funny name as “Snake Island”, but even in the abstract boundaries of its genre, it reached a new minimum, so my anger should be known, the only reason I even bothering to watch this incredibly bad movie, is that I knew that it would be bad, it was very late at night, I could not sleep, and in the past really bad films drained energy and I would make me crave sleep. Very soon and very early it became clear that this film would be terrible, but it fell even below these expectations. <br /> <br /> The film’s director and screenwriter is Wayne Crawford, who also stars in the film as a tour guide for the African River, which ultimately has to land his team on a remote island called Snake until it comes down. another boat to pick them up. They hang out, get drunk, and then fall under the onslaught of venomous snakes, which must cleanse their island of people. <br /> <br /> If your jaw dropped in the last sentence of my second paragraph Do not re-read, you got it right the first time. Honestly, I prefer the features of my creatures when creatures (s) simply attack stupidly stupid people because of hunger, and not because they have some kind of mission. These are not mutant snakes. They are not such giants as what you see in Anaconda. They are ordinary, ordinary African snakes, such as the mamba and the viper - only they have the brains to create armies, do business, work together to trap people, understand our language and even dance! Did your draw fall again? Well, it will fall further. Halfway through this terrible B-film about the part where I have already surrendered, human characters begin to drink around the fire, and then suddenly turn into some sort of orgy. And while they dance naked and all that, the snakes that hunt them suddenly stop and begin to jam them. The combination of this scene and the scene where we discover that snakes, some of the most fraudulent creatures on the planet, formed an alliance against humans for some strange reason, was too big for my poor brain. And only when I thought that the filmmakers could not raise it to an even lower level, the snakes began to sing. <br /> <br /> People in the movie? Well, let's just say that I never before rooted for creatures to kill everyone so quickly. I just couldn't take it anymore. <br /> <br /> I really don’t think I need to keep going; You get the picture. If there is something that distinguishes the "Snake Island" from its other competitors, it is that he dares to try to be even dumber, and this is not an additional achievement. Why, just why, I continue to expose myself to these really bad films, I guess I will never know. But "Snake Island" is striking a completely new minimum. This is a cheap, trashy excuse for a film, because of which Anaconda, a film of brainless snakes, looks just as brilliant, subtle and exciting as Steven Spielberg's Jaws. You have been warned.
