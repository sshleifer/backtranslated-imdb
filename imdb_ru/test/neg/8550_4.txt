You Belong To Me was the final team of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stenwick as a screen team, and it was a film for Fonda, provided by Columbia Pictures. Fonda signed a contract with 20th Century Fox to get the role of Tom Joad in Grapes of Wrath. But after that, as a rule, he made films that were good while he was shooting mediocre things in Fox. <br /> <br /> But the rule was violated. Although the character he plays has some external resemblance to Charles Pike from Lady Eva, this film is not that funny. In fact, feminists would probably be stunned by this. <br /> <br /> In fact, Barbara Stanvik herself didn’t like it at all. She liked working with Henry Fonda well enough, but she thought this movie was funny. As expected. <br /> <br /> The Foundation is another millionaire playboy whom we would call a child from a trust fund that does little with his life. He is a kind of cute idiot who meets Stanvik on the ski slope and literally falls in love with her, trying to show off. It turns out that she is a doctor, and they whirl and marry in a whirlwind. <br /> <br /> But it turns out that Funds has a jealous streak, especially when it comes to Roger Clarke, another millionaire patient Stanfield. And he does not understand his professional duties. <br /> <br /> Stanbike, like Bette Davis and Katherine Hepburn, was and still is a feminist. When she tells the Foundation that he must go out into the working world and live on his salary and see if he can do it, the Foundation goes out and gets a job as a salesman in a department store. She is so proud of him that she is actually going to give up her medical practice and live with him on the salary of his seller. <br /> <br /> Today NOW will picket the film. Stanvik did not have too much conviction in her work, probably because she did not believe in any of this. I certainly could not. <br /> <br /> I don’t think that even then the viewers believed in it. But the two stars and the rest of the actors tried their best, but this one was special for Thanksgiving.
