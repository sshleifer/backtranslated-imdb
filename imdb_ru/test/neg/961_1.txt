Great story and great main actors (Quaid and Ryan), but the film suffers from bad direction, bad script and bad script. Leading actors play their part, but cannot save the film at all. Too bad, because it could be the good 80s Hitchcock suspense / mystery / thriller. Ryan looked so young and fresh in this, though. Well, look for the big fans of Ryan .....
