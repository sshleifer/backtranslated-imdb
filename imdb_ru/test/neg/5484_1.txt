Remember when Rick Mercer was funny? 22 minutes was a great show when Rick Mercer was on it, and Made In Canada was also a great show. The conversation with the Americans was also so funny. But, as my friend said: “Rick Mercer woke up once and was no longer funny,” I think Rick Mercer’s report was released that day. What is the point of this show? Rick Mercer reads stupid fake headlines, shows photos of bad barns people write to, and then spends about 20 minutes on a 30-minute show, going somewhere, and just talking to people looking to say something witty or smart enough to get on television and maybe even make someone laugh somewhere. We should be interested in Rick Mercer visiting the gymnastic team, and then trying to do some of their movements, and then sucking them on purpose, desperately trying to be "fun." Rick Mercer has grown old or just lost interest or is no longer funny. Even his classic pompous bits lost all their bite and humor. Can you say this about a CBC comedy in general, because how many years have they put in the Air Farce on television to deliver the same useless jokes?
