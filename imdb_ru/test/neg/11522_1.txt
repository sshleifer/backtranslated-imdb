Rented this drown in my local video store. It was called the "Black Horizon". I think someone felt that this was enough for the 2004 reissue ... <br /> <br /> Michel Dudikoff, unfortunately, is not a ninja in this film, one of the main shortcomings of this film. Another serious flaw would be that Ice-t's battle scenes were stolen from other films, in particular, from the first scene of his rescue, which is straight from the Wesley Snipes film “The Art of War” with Ice-T edited in. paid for these frames. <br /> <br /> The plot is terrible, special effects put little effort on them (I love these wires that hold them in space), the game is wooden (I also love New York / Russian accents). Finding Ice-T in the film is pointless. These guys also forgot that there is no gravity in space, but I think it did not bother them. <br /> <br /> Michel Dudikoff must return to the fact that he is “good” and make an American ninja. 6
