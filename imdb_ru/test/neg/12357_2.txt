I saw it on a boring Sunday morning just this morning. Well, I was drawn to the fact that it was an open-air film ... I was hoping to find some good landscapes, but his views were just limited ... They just go back and forth in the same place again and again ... I hate it when they use so-called high-tech things like Motorola's blue-tooth headset, which they use to avoid using the radio, it was so funny ... they look like amateurs. And they like to advertise these poorly designed aliens laptops that can connect with a satellite to find people ... I can't say more about this television movie. use of rescue helicopters, etc. * / **********
