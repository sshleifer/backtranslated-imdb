The best thing about Shrieker is the dialogue. Like Scream and I Know What You Made Last Summer, this film is familiar with the conventions of this horror film, and he manages to come up with some good lines and scenes that play on these conventions. Unfortunately, Shrieker is just boring. The plot is your main ten little Indians who combine with a monster controlled by one of the suspects / victims. From the very beginning, you know that each of the characters will fight until there is only a hero left (not) to defeat evil. And this is exactly what is happening. Absolutely no surprises and no stress. Production values ​​and acting were fine, but I was not motivated to watch until the end (although I did), because I already knew how the final scene would end. The ending surprised me a little, because it literally ran out of steam, instead of throwing away a bucket of special effects. Perhaps the special effects budget was spent to the end.
