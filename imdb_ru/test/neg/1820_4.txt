It's not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS (it's not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this rather obscure film to my collection of Alan Rickman films. <br /> <br /> I can't understand how talented Mr. Rickman gets into these mediocre movies? Judas Kiss boasts several great actors, an interesting plot and intriguing turns, but its weird visual travels and chopping editing ruined what could be a great crime drama. It seems that in many scenes there is no vital information explaining the character's actions: why did our hero immediately suspect his bosses? Why doesn't he trust the detective he replaced? There were times when, frankly speaking, I could not say whether the director meant that Judas Kiss was a legitimate crime drama or an insidious parody. Otherwise, why would he throw in the topless / alien / lesbian porn scene for the first two minutes (this little surprise, of course, made me scramble on the remote control, since my children were playing nearby!)? Did he deliberately instruct his two prominent English actors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use these terrible accents of New Orleans? Like Alan Freak, I confess that I still thought Mr. Rickman was sexy: crumpled, tired, like “take him home and tuck him in”. <br /> <br /> Judas Kiss is not a very good movie, but there are a few intriguing moments in it, but I don’t recommend it unless you try to immerse yourself in Alan Rickman.
