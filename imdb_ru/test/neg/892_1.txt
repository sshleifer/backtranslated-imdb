I saw House Party 1-3, and I loved them, but this one was not at all funny. Firstly, it canâ€™t be House Party movie without Kid n'Play, right? That sucks, and he looked more like the black version of Ferris Bueller's Weekend than the movie "Party at Home." Secondly, who the hell is John-John? This new character can not even compare with those of the three other films. I know why they put it right in the video. He has terrible music, a weak plot, mediocre actors, and generally no funny jokes. My advice, watch this movie at night only if you can't fall asleep. The series after House Party 3 since Kid'n'Play broke up after that. I hate this one, I'm glad that my local video store does not have this film, and I never want to buy it or see it on Comedy Central. Just because Chris Strox has a talent to lead a promising R & B group, but that doesn't mean that he has the talent to direct and produce films, am I right or not? Finally, all the female characters were dressed like cheap $ 2 prostitutes for most of the film. IMX separated a year after this film was released, probably due to the failure of this film and almost forgotten these days. Simply put, this movie is just old sucks !!!!
