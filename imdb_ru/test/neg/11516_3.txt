“Be with me” is an almost perfect movie of wallpaper. Just leave it running in the background. communicate with each other and return to it whenever you want, and at some point it will end. <br /> <br /> Alas, when I watched it alone, I felt like I’ve almost watched the worst, longest, and most sentimental commercial in the world by the time I almost always managed to keep my eyes open. loans collapsed; and then I managed (just) a few more moments of wakefulness to witness “Thank you” to the film sponsors, including the breweries of the Asia-Pacific region. Aha Methought: How amazing is * this * - given all the shots of Tiger beer interspersed in this most forgotten episode of the film? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, dialogue breaks out between people with occasional deep shots, but too often nothing is said about any particular progress towards the general story of the film. It’s as if you could disconnect at any time and return at any later time, and you wouldn’t really miss anything, which would be an unpredictable contingency or part of its plot, as far as the overall development of the film was concerned. Thus, the best "movie wallpaper"! <br /> <br /> Well, I’m wondering ... What movie was watched by those who appreciated this movie? I am surprised and continue to be surprised ... This, of course, could not be so adept to the extent of the ingenuous Singapore excuse for the camera. Presumably, "Being with me" should be woven around the theme of "love, tragedy and redemption." But all that I witnessed was boredom, a half-baked script with a small number of text messages without a single word, and the only atonement was what happened when this completely useless film ended. What a dreary waste of time! It was also said that the characters of this film were fictional, with the exception of Theresa Chan, who is “a wonderful woman who defeated adversity ...” Well, there is no disrespect for Miss Chan, but considering that she was so amazing and amazing Why did the script have to include the stories of other characters without the most courageous attempt to tie their lives together? Yet it still turned out to be an almost unbearably boring film, the highlights of which included rotating captions. Instead of linking the fate of all the characters, I really felt that the film ended in an attempt at the almost impossible, and obviously fell between the stools, as far as this can be connected with the involvement of any viewer. <br /> <br /> In general, I am an art lover of cinema and usually do not object to slow stimulation (which is not lacking here, believe me !!). I hate films such as "300", "Transformers", "Fight Club", but I consider, for example, Eric Rohmer a great director. So I hope that this will give my criticism some perspective. However, in the entire concept and film, there was no redeemable feature that could prevent the eyelids from slowly dropping down as “Be With Me” dripped every minute. Watch this movie if you need to waste time. Otherwise, your life will not become richer because you missed it. 3/10
