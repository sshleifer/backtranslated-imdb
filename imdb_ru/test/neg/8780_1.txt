I remember very well the bad press that the film received because of the ruling of the producer against Clayton Moore, who used the name Lone Ranger or put his black mask on personal appearances. Quite apart from any consideration of the quality of the film, this was the absolute height of myopic arrogance and stupidity on the part of producers and their lawyers. And I suspect that the lesson was well learned after this film was shot, which was widely perceived as a kind of karma for the idiots responsible for the court ruling against Moore. <br /> <br /> Lately it has become a custom, reviving a legendary film or TV project, inviting an original star or stars for a cameo, and rightly so. Show respect, idiots! And even if they turn their heads at the prospect that has occurred, at least the offer has been made. This is proof that producers, filmmakers and entertainment lawyers are not too stupid and arrogant to teach them by example.
