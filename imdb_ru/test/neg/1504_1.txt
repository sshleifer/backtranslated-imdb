A clear lesson about how to make a bad film that disguises as Horror. Without getting too close, I would imagine that these are the results of a group of film school students who all add pieces to the story and then actually ACT in it! This is something like a film studio, and this is a film that really needs an editor, in which case it would have lasted 10 minutes! The director of this bullshit probably had more money than sense. Think about the number of submitted scenarios or even unreleased films that would benefit from this. The so-called grandmother, who killed people in rather stupid ways, was like Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future, or maybe Johnny Winter / Edgar Winter musicians. It starts with 20 minutes of coarse boring nonsense, erupted by students - something about paranoia. Giving this trash 1, because he can not get less. He has no sign of redemption â€” and when one of the girls thinks that the body on the floor is covered with blood is the guy fooling around, she should actually try red before she finds out that this is not tomato ketchup! It's an insult to the idiot's intelligence.
