This film is in fact so poor in its desperate attempts to “feel good” and seem random, which really made me embarrassed while watching. I can't imagine how I felt the inner circle of the Norwegian celebrities and the press, trying to pretend to love it at the star premiere. His excellent media coverage is a shocking example of how ridiculously small and inbred the Norwegian media scene is. If a foreign film of this quality reached the silver screen, it would get the rain of rotten tomatoes that it truly deserves. <br /> <br /> The combination of literally amateur actors, visual effects in the style of home design, awkward dialogue, painfully useless attempts at the humor of the working class and an overly cozy and meaningless plot really make this film incredibly high-quality. Stay away.
