This is really a horrible movie. Lou Diamond Phillips just calls it. Using miniature train models is ridiculous. The plot seems to be developing on the run (there is an alien on board; oh, and an eco-terrorist on board too; oh, and the conductor is dead, and the train is out of control; oh, and the train goes to collide with another train an hour ahead, and this train has nuclear waste ...). I mean, come on really! Alien monsters are not terrible (although there are many), and the action is terrible. Look at the guy playing the “next president” - do you really think he can be president? For God's sake, he spent his entire acting career playing the bad guys!
