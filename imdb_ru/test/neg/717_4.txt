Despite the fact that the plot follows the well-known recipe for "who did it", which has so far characterized all the films about Perry Mason, the characters of this film are not so well developed, and the chosen cast doesn't give them flesh and blood. Of course, in general, Perry Mason films are not important, but even because of their low standards, this film is weak.
