Once I got sick, I was watching the channels and came across this horrible movie. The plot and even subplots (if you can find one) were made before disappearing. BUT, no matter how bad it is, I leave a special comment for Liza Minelli. Her character was absolutely one of the most annoying characters I've ever had the misfortune to see in a movie. Her only competitors in this category are John Legusiamo in Pest and Julia Stiles in everything she did (or half). Maybe she did exactly what the script suggested, or maybe (moan!) This is the limit she has for her range of action. In any case, they had to rewrite and kill her in the first 30 seconds of the film (for example, as a girl who fell from the balcony in Deadly Weapon (I) (but at least she had beautiful breasts)) /> <br /> Humbler of all ...
