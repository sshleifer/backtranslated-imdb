What can I say? It was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life (and believe me, some of my favorite films are admittedly awful). The action was amateur, the sets were boring, and the camera work was crappy and second-year. This entire film seemed like the final college project. I had to convince myself that the teenager did it so that it looked somewhat good. The most disturbing factor of the “film” is that it is not even a film - it is filmed on video. It was extremely distracting. On top of that, the dialogue is simply catastrophic, and the storyline is so simple that it makes my eyes water. Not to mention that in the first 20 minutes or so, they stole at least four other horror films. If there was such a thing as zero stars, this film would have received it. <br /> <br /> The only thing that scares this film is how bad it is
