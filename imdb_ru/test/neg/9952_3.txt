George Zucco was a wonderful actor, often playing evil villains with lustful power. However, even he could not save this boring and flat-footed B.V. <br /> <br /> Zucco plays an ordinary mad scientist, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron, who believes that the blood of a wolf introduced into a person can be created by an invincible Army of Wolf People who can win the second world war (go on a figure!) Experiments with master Pedro (Glenn Strange) Zucco creates a werewolf, similar to those that Dave Allen used in his comedy sketches! Pedro is obviously based on Lenny from Of Mice And Men, and you almost expect him to say, “Oh, okay, George!” There is one striking moment when a werewolf kills a child by extending his hand through the window and grabbing it, but most of them are ordinary and pedestrian - very pedestrian - 77 minute walk through all the old clichés that are much better in others. We also get a revenge motive from the “Devilish Bat”, which itself is borrowed from the “Son of Frankenstein”! <br /> <br /> Zucco is wasted, and you only need to see it in films like The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Hand of Mom and The Secret of Dr. Renault to find out how wasted. A few atmospheric swamp scenes are all that he has to offer. And the scene in which Zucco demonstrates his wolf technique, those who doubted him (again in the shades of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), is unintentionally funny. <br /> <br /> Not one of the best films of the 40s.
