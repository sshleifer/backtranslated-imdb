You know, I’m sure the boys sat in the office once and said, "How can we make more money?" They made all the possible options for toys that could be made with their current characters. So they decided: let's steal the idea of ​​Star Wars, STOP, and we can come up with all the new characters and sell them as toys. By the way, they did something in Puppet Master 3, but who cares? In any case, they choose the point in time before the first film, when Toulon is still alive, he and the dolls are sitting idle, and the wooden head rolls on the floor, and the dolls want to know if it’s a family member or something like that. . it does not matter. Thus begins the story of the origin of the puppet master. It is long, boring, without any worries about the body. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that they tell about the origin of these new characters in the film, but do not give any clues about their fate. THUS SAYS THAT, when the income from the new toys pays off, they can get a new (and 4th rotten) sequel, called "PUPPET MASTER 8, TRACE TO THE PICKEL OF THE DESTINATION OF DEAD RETRO!"
