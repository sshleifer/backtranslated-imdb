I'm really not going to waste my time on in-depth analysis, I’ll just say that I am very disappointed that Catherine Zeta-Jones made the mistake of playing the main role in this absurdity, nonsense, in this complete cliché of boring to death thoughtless, pitiful attempts in filmmaking! There is no point in trying to find the positive aspects of this film, because in general it is poor in all respects, and the saddest thing is that Zeta-Jones was so uncompromisingly dragged into a cliché that she had absolutely no chance to show even 1% of her talent! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie even if you can spend the night at home starring against the wall !!!
