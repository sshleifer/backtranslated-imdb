I enjoyed the “Masters of Horror” series until I came across this infantile pile of dung. <br /> <br /> This propaganda play against Bush, disguised as a horror film, is cut off like an episode of the original “Batman”, shot by Michael Moore. The political satire must be smart, however, it pulls the top ten on the simpleton scale with all the style and believability of the L. Ron Hubbard film. <br /> <br /> In her obscene, nonsensical manner, she accuses Republicans of stealing at the elections, unreasonable entry into the war and treating servicemen and women as cannon fodder. It even hit hard on the Second Amendment and religion. All that was missing was Caesar Romero, when the president happily shouted about how he organized September 11th. <br /> <br /> I think the final should have been a moment of “we support our troops”, but I think that they would be more offended than pleased with all this work. <br /> <br /> I’m sure that the Hollywood elites are sitting in their mansions in Malbu, patting each other on the back for this “meaningful” work, while the misguided anti-war Drones greet him like a genius. <br /> <br /> It's time to put on new children's foil hats.
