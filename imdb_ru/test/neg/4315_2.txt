This is a complete slop. If you take Devil Deviations and suck all the good things out of it, and add many distorted, perverted parts of slavery, several scenes of rape, and, like one or two sincerely horrifying scenes, you will get this film. People call it the Heath 86 robbery, but I donâ€™t see it at all. Even the worst Hitcher robberies are still better than that. The main problem demonstrated here is that there is nothing here except for a few director fetishes shown as circus artifacts. Is that all you need from movies about how girls are insulted and tied up, shrinking from fear? Well, then rent this movie! <br /> <br /> However, I would prefer to just watch a good movie, but this is clearly not the case. The sad thing is, there are some really good thrills waiting to be revealed here, but only some. For example, waiting at the beginning, before the ravings of slavery began ... damn well if you ask me. And the scene when a hitchhiker kills a nympho girl (I can't remember the names) is frightening, very cruel, challenging even Devil Deviations for unbridled rage. Why can't the rest of the movie be so good? BUT? I really need to stop renting silly crap like this. Closing the message: just let this trash die and forget about it forever. Not recommended.
