I'm not quite sure what to say / think about this movie. This is definitely not the worst in the series (there is also Halloween 3). The style is simply very different, and it focuses on elements other than its predecessor. It tries to explain why Michael Myers goes crazy on Halloween and starts cutting around. Well, all this stuff is that Michael Myers is cursed and the cult of evil was a pretty good effort, but I did not buy it. None of the other episodes of this series tried to come up with any bizarre explanations. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of blood in the film. In fact, this is an ordinary massacre. If you haven't seen other Halloween movies yet, you will surely enjoy this movie. But for a real Halloween freak, this sequel may be too different to be good. The suspension turned into horror and slaughter (exploding heads ... you understand). <br /> <br /> The ending (theatrical cut) is simply terrible. Michael is struck with a needle, then he is beaten with a pipe, then again he is struck, this time with needles, and then he is beaten a little more, until he gets slime from his head (where did this green come from?) In fact, this is nothing but garbage worth $ 5 million. <br /> <br /> There was one good thing: Michael's mask! <br /> <br /> Dedicated to Donald Plesans, it's just a shame. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
