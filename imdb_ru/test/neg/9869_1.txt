I have always loved bad creations, rhetorical criticism, and my film professor confirmed this to me in college. This is not as bad as in Star Wars, there is nothing in the Lunchbox except for this error. This film "Fantastic Four", supplemented by "Doctor Rum", in which I have no idea "why he hee hee hee hee hee hee hee fingers"), is one of the first places in the list of colossal mistakes. Dialogue Doom "Kill him! ... Let him go!" This is a classic, as it amazes with its gaiety. Editing is good, and the director of photography is not so bad ... these are positive aspects. I cannot, however, force all my friends to watch completely, but if I get a chance, I will show them “can Johnny and Sue go out into space with us!” The scene I am doing. I also include the scene of the final scene, where Redd Richards in her FF outfit for some reason, along with her bride Sue in her wedding dress, gets into a limousine ... the retractable hands that are forgiven when they leave are. Most people absolutely do not believe that something like this exists.
