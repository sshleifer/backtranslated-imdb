From awkward-sounding lasers to a primary school-style shuttle crash, Night Beast is best categorized as a farcical blend of fake blood and bare breasts. The almost pornographic style of the film seems to be a failed attempt to recover due to the lack of a coherent or effective story. Acting, however, is far from being so terrible, many young, novice actors perfectly demonstrate hidden talent. Especially Don Leifert and Jamie Zemare, who shed a much-needed fragment of light on this terrible film. The night beast would never have appeared on the set if he knew the terrible talent for making films in this small town of Maryland.
