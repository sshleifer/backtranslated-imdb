I expected much more than what I received from watching this movie. The point is not that I object to a literary license (if that is how it should be called), especially when there is no obvious attempt to say "based on real history." But this film is about Beethoven - a real historical figure, which is so widely known and so deeply rooted in our musical experience, and I expected the film to be true to the story, at least in the basic elements. This film took such a big exception from the historical report that it could only disappoint. <br /> <br /> My guess (because I didn’t explore the film at all) was that it was true. Halfway through I stopped the movie to watch it on IMDb. The rest of the film was a surprisingly different experience. I was glad that this was not entirely true of the story, because it’s so hard to believe in the main part of the story. To enjoy this film, I had to recognize it as a fantasy, a “what if that’s so” story. The film lacked this honest disclaimer. <br /> <br /> The fictional performance of the 9th symphony disappointed me the most. The very concept depicted in the film stretched my imagination to incredibility. In the end, I doubted that there was something plausible in the story besides Ludwig van Beethoven and his relationship with Carl van Beethoven. <br /> <br /> I really liked the performance of Ed Harris - an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and stay away from it, and that was about it, and for that I give him 3/10. <br /> <br /> Those who foretell that this film is as good or better than Amadeus do not have the slightest idea about the life of composers and they are only looking for what this film really is, because that in the end it was a cheap novel of history — fantastic.
