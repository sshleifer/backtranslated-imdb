First let me say that I am a supporter of ghosts, and I really know that they exist. I had enough experience with them to know that they are there. <br /> <br /> I hate the people who bring the Bible and religion to it. People forget that there is more than one “Bible”, thousands of religions and beliefs and different ways of interpreting what the Bible says. Not everyone believes in God, and not everyone believes in stereotyped religion. <br /> <br /> Religion does not make it all a fact. One of the things that I have to mention in the Bible, which many do not know about, is that even the most rampant biblical punch violates the rules themselves written inside .... you are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at a time slavery is fine and you can kill your neighbor under certain circumstances. None of this: "Oh, that was the Old Testament, and now we have the New Testament." If the Bible is the word of God and cannot be changed ... there should be no changes or versions. Religion is full of misinterpretations, mixed facts and people who follow it so blindly that there is "There is no other way." These excuses, which these blind followers are talking about, are either pitiful or cannot themselves properly explain the discrepancies, but instead use excuses given to them from their pastor or teacher. <br /> <br /> But still, for review. I'm a good fan of Ghostbusters, and when I heard that this show was coming soon, I was very excited and thought that he had some potential. I like to watch “Ghost Hunters”, I don’t like some of their participants, and I don’t like how they can brush off the place where they are pursued, but cannot explain what is happening. The fact that your research equipment did not pick it up does not mean that the camera shooting the series did not do this. I am glad that they are skeptical, but they do not seem to understand that just because you did not get anything on your tape recorder, and the film does not make the place frequented or not. If ghosts were so easy to catch, it would be known as fact, not as faith. It’s more like the “right place at the right time”, and also, if there is something, what makes you think that it will “fulfill” for you? This show is pretty stupid. It's usually boring, a lot of talk, a lot of psychics, but it's unlikely that something will happen. The filtered story of the main guy is usually either boring to listen or not needed at all. <br /> <br /> In addition, the dependence on psychics is too high, as I believe that very few of them are really gifted. Sylvia Brown is the one I definitely believe in, but most of them are sometimes hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this show, but of the few who I saw, I was terribly impressed.
