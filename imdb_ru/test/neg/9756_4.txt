Going into the movie with the right expectations, I somewhat liked this movie. Like most reviewers who have seen this film, I completely agree that the plot was thin, like a cliche, and I could predict every turn of the plot from the very beginning of the film. But the dance episodes were VERY well-made, and I really enjoyed the combination of classical and hip-hop dance (both of which I like to watch). The music / soundtrack for the film was also very good, which made the drama scenes more tolerant. The hosts (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were good actors, but their dances throughout the film were impressive and mesmerizing. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is worth seeing if you want to watch good dance episodes and this film is MUCH much better than "You Got" in terms of plot and drama. Again, it does not say much, does it? = P
