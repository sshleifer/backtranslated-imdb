This version is very painful to watch. All actions are very unnatural, but this is especially true of Norma Shearer, who still behaves as if she was acting in a silent film, and not in a phrase book. Check out the 1937 version with Joan Crawford, Robert Montgomery and William Powell, which is much more interesting.
