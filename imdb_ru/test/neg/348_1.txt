Well, when you read this, I may have stopped crying. This film was so terrible that it was rather unpleasant. The creatures were pretty cute, but the only really good thing about the film was the growing affection among the prisoners and their guards after they remained on this fluffy island. Even seeing Barbara Bach with her hair down, it didn't pay off by buying this tentacle. She goes with a whisper, which I never used my voice, before she gasps, which simply does not wash when someone screams a bloody murder. (Hey, the lead man was nice too, but I still haven't calmed down.) This is plagiarism on your beer on the good island Ole Dr. Moreau. Poor Richard Johnson, who was undoubtedly born for better things, is just as bad as a bad guy. I mean, how bad can a bad guy be? (Ask Richard Johnson). Joseph Cotten struggles not to look embarrassed while he staggers into his cameo appearance. For God's sake, do not take this damned bomb.
