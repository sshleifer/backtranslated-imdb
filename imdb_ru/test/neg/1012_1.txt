Well, I just switched channels and caught DW3. I watched it, knowing that it would be rubbish ... BUT ... as a person who saw tons of films, this one stands there as one of the worst films I have ever seen ... I am not joking. It is so bad that you have to look at it as an accident from which you cannot turn away. Sometimes such movies work, for example, IE, movies about Troma ... but watching Martin Balsam and Charles Bronson hurt slums, as if it hurts ... What's even funnier, I raised IMDb to see what other people said and in fact it is a rating of 4.1 / 10 ??? I can not believe that it made it past 1.5! It’s just as funny that it’s not even the top of this series ... is this garbage somehow justified in Parts 4 and 5? And on top of that, the comments of some dudes here call it the best of the series and his favorite movie of all time ??? Such statements scare me about this world!
