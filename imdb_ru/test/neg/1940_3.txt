Bam Margera with fame Jackass returned with his own reality show, and he is not only not as funny as Jackass, but also surprisingly sillier! It must be one of the most stupid shows ever planned. Of course, there are worse reality shows, but none of them is so vile or stupid. <br /> <br /> Bam Margera achieved success, and his parents decided to recoup his glory. Bam and his parents, his uncle, his team of idiotic friends all live together, and while Bam and his buddies break things and fall into a prank, usually his parents are stupid at home. When Bam's parents are not at home, being lazy, they are tormented by Bam, especially his father. To add to the humor, we appeal to his fat uncle Don Vitto, who is constantly outside of him and never pays attention. <br /> <br /> This show really looks like a softer version of Jackass ... down there, in that there are no tricks, instead Bam and his buddies just break things and do lame tricks, and meanwhile loud music plays to make it even cooler. This is not funny at all. I can’t imagine a dumber show than this, because there’s not a drop of intelligence here. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of Bam Margera and want to see one of many continue / continue box office for the Jackass series. <br /> <br /> My rating: * out ****. 30 minutes TV14
