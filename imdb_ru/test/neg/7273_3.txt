I decided to watch this ultra-low-budget film from the Po Need Studio because an actor Lionel Atville acted in it, and I really liked the title. Despite the fact that Atville often played in these cheap films, his superb playing style always made the films seem much better, since his on-screen persona was gorgeous (his real life was also quite interesting - like a strange soap opera). The reason why I use the term “Poverty Line” is that this nickname was given to the cheapest and worst production companies of that era. Many of them were not even real studios, but production companies that rented space and film sets at the main studios at night! Yes, there is a high probability that it was filmed after a normal working day - a common thing for such studios. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Lionel Atville telling his friends a story about what he has been doing for years. ago. The doctor falls in love with a woman, but is afraid to tell her about herself. This is because his job is to execute people on Death Row, and not on glamorous work! Doc asks his friend (Atwill) how she can break it, but, nevertheless, she will not have this person. You realize later that this is because her own parents were criminals. <br /> <br /> Later, the man was killed and the woman was implicated - although for anyone who has brains, it is obvious that her sister was involved (and is a bit of a nut) and the evidence against the lady was bad. But, apparently, the jury was filled with brainless people, and she was convicted and sent to a number of suicide bombers. Even more reckless is that her old boyfriend was the man who was responsible for her execution. Don't you think that someone else can handle this business ?! Prior to this fateful hour, her friend (Attville) spends most of the film, trying to prove her innocence and prove that the flowable sister knows much more about the case than she admits. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is just a bit interesting and a bit silly. While it is watchable and Atwill is good (as usual), the rest of the film never rises above the ordinariness, and some actions are rather battered. This is not true of what you expect from such a low-budget film, and nothing more, despite the steep headline.
