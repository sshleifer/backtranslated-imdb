Hypothetical situations abound, once directed by Harry Ralston gives us the ultimate post-apocalyptic view of the dead world left in the streets, in the shops and throughout the landscape, without in the middle of a forgotten desert. One survivor, trying to revive his sanity, takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert. Alone, he hopes for more, but when there is no one around, he remains in white underwear and passion for the local Indian tribe ?? before the opening of the chamber, which opens new doors and destroys the barriers of human existence. Alan, the man of the book, remained on Earth after an unknown disaster. Thinking that he is alone, he begins to live his life ?? until Jeri Ryan appears (as in any dream) from the forest, disheveled and unhappy, to find the last living man who will ... well ... like Alan. In any case, they try to coexist, fail, get drunk, and, before creating a final dystopia, they encounter Redneck Raphael (played by newcomer Dan Montgomery Jr.). Bonds are broken, confusion arises, the couple becomes the third wheel, and the battle between the physically inept nerd and the brainless joker. Even if no one remains on the planet, it will become true that even the darkest of human nature will arise. <br /> <br /> Using the variable technique of the film, Ralston gives us a mediocre story based on another film called Silent Earth (which I will look further), oddly enough, to which he never attaches any importance. With a borrowed story, I think he does a decent job rethinking it. It seems his punch is not enough at first, while Rolston is trying to find his step, again borrowing from the director’s other moves to try to find his own. He opens the film interestingly enough, but does not respond to any direct answers. Of course, the last days have come, but there could be a brief answer as to how, or, better yet, why these few survived. An eerie start would lead us stronger into a comic film. The comparison would be similar to Shawn of the Dead, but instead left us feeling that we were watching the program, Made for Television. Listening to the audio commentary, I respect Ralston, because he worked hard to create this film, and his passion almost sells the film, but from his interaction with the actors one could say that he was not so pleased with his general ending. product. There were mistakes: those to which he pointed, and others to which he was ashamed to point. Although it does make for decent independent filmmaking, it sometimes seems cheap, and in the case of Roulston this was the last. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the image of Alan David Arnott caught me. He played this weak, school and adult role very well. He was funny to watch and listen, and therefore he began to sympathize with the viewer. He was a key player in saving the film together, alas, I can not say the same for the rest. This was Dan Montgomery's first film, and it was obvious ?? I mean ?? really very obvious. There were scenes in which I thought the cue card should have come out and read the lines for it, perhaps even giving us a more realistic idea, but alas, this was not the case. Then there was Jeri Ryan. She pulled herself to her character near the end of the film, which for me was the culmination of the entire work of art. By the end, she turns from an unknown into a desperate bitter insane girl. Embarrassed? Again, she was completely immersed in her character, giving us an idea of ​​what she probably could have done by growing up. Even as the comments evolved, all she contributed was a moment of laughter, giggling or “oooh, look at this color.” Although her beauty can sell tickets, you might think that knowledge is just as beautiful. Was it her first movie, so can I be too harsh? <br /> <br /> Overall, this film felt like something was missing. I thought the idea was strong ?? the premise is that even though there are only many people left on Earth, the evil of human nature still exists. Jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs (perhaps because it is consumed by zinc?), And we, as a race, will always want what we cannot have. Ralston is not an amazing director, his methods are imperfect and previously used, but he knows how to make a low-budget comedy. I think our idea of ​​the "funny" is different, so I could not laugh at the many pieces that he found "hysterical." His actors provided the level of acting required for this film, which was below average. His film was free, which meant that there were elements that were never fully explained or resolved (that is, did anything with wings survive?!?), Which in general damaged the intensity of the film. It was a comedy, but it could have been much darker and much funnier. For those who think that Roger Avery was a huge element of this film, as we learn from their comments, was all the money for what was there ?? in fact, the bank for the "Last Man." Do not rely on the classic moments of Avery. <br /> <br /> Don't expect more from Ralston? and so i will finish. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** of *****
