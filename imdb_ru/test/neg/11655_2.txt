I'm not surprised that this film excelled at the Hampton Film Festival. This is a shallow film that is well suited for small people. Two actors pretending to be actors in a relationship who fight and search for a lost dog. The film allegedly explores the dynamics of relationships, however, the relationship is too small to deserve any such research. This couple has one dimension: they fight, they tease, then they make love and fight some more. There, a brief moment of tenderness shows no possible reason why the two would be related to each other, given their toxic and volatile relationships. Beautifully shot, excellent rating, but without any merit in the script or characters, this short one is just that.
