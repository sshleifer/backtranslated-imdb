As for Asian horror, I saw my share of disappointments along with some of the most horrendous damnable imaginable ... "Acacia" is not suitable for any of these categories. There were several moments of tension, and it was interesting to watch, but I could not help but think that there was to be a little more in this story. The film tells about a childless couple who decides to adopt a child who seems to be passionate about trees. He develops a connection with an acacia tree in their yard and seems to communicate with it. Then, during a fight with his mother, in which their newborn child participates, he leaves, threatening to find his dead mother, who is now a tree. When he does not return, the parents send a report and wait until the neighbor girl thinks that he somehow lives on the Acacia tree. The pace is rather slow, and the finale gets a little weird, but I have to recommend it as a bit of a pleasant effort, although the story seems a bit flat. Damn, I can't decide on this ...
