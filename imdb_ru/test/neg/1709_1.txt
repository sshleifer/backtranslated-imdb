Holy sweet murder, this is probably the funniest film I've ever seen. You can believe my word as the truth, because now he plays on TV. it is truly one of the most miserable productions I have ever seen. There is no redeemable aspect in this film. he just lacks humor. the only good thing it possibly has for this is that it is so unfunny that it is completely unmemorable. in fact, I just looked at some ridiculous story and I can not say what happened. The only reason I might even remember that I watched this film is because it is so tasteless that it will forever remain in my memory, based solely on this. if your friend wants to show it to you, shoot him and save yourself from boredom.
