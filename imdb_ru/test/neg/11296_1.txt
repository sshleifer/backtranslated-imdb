One of the worst theatrical films of the year, if not all the time. Anthony Hopkins downplays himself, even appearing in this joke. I can't believe the names of David Mamet and Ridley Scott are featured in this parody. The best career move Jodie Foster ever made was to abandon it. Julianne Moore was as passionless as the woman Keanu Reeves. Gary Oldman was, of course, his brilliant man. He is the crippled victim of Hannibal, and the makeup is so good that I did not know that it was Gary until they had earned the last points. but have eaten trained boars ??? Give me a break! Rumor has it that he did not want his name even mentioned in the credits. And I fried and fed my brain to Ray Liotta ... I laughed at the absurd, do not give this nonsense this click at this moment. Since “Who is this girl,” I have not seen so many people leave the film. <br /> <br /> Pay someone else to follow you if you need to, but skip this AT ALL COST !!!
