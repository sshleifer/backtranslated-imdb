I am shocked to see that some people gave this film more than two stars. They must be either joking or completely blind because of the art of acting, directing and other shortcomings of the film. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I simply could not bring myself to sit down the whole film very badly. <br /> <br /> The first three characters, not counting the “digger,” were just terrible actors, and I mean HORRIBLE! Maybe the director didn't care, or maybe he was worse than the director. It was like watching a bad school play. The film, of course, was filmed on a video camera (a low-budget rather than a real film), and the lighting settings were not very good. In addition, the sound engineer (if they had one) should have been either a newcomer or drunk since the sound was amateur. Even in one of the first scenes from the kitchen (a terrible game by the way) the sound from the dialogue was rather bad. For example, when a woman moved her head during a conversation, you could hear her voice disappear and return. Looks like they were trying to fix it in post-production, slightly increasing the volume when she turns her head. In addition, you have heard the constantly annoying buzzing sound from the camera equipment or other sources in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> All these tweeters in the first 5 minutes or so. Should I say more? <br /> <br /> A good school project or a fun project for friends to watch, but it should never have gone out for a real audience, especially for a paying audience. THIS WAS DISCONTINUED if you do not have a very low standard for films or simply bad taste. You are warned! SB.
