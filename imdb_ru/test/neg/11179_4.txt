Matt Tsvetik is a loyal communist at the Pittsburgh Iron and Steel Works who is working on recruiting workers to the party, although this isolates him from his son, family and neighbors. What makes this even more difficult is the fact that Tsvetik is actually an FBI agent, posing as a communist, for obtaining information about the activities of the party. The party is trying to organize a strike at the mill, with the result that the strike movement will lead the workers to a wave of propaganda. Cvetic must also argue with the beautiful Eva Merrick, a party member and teacher in his sonâ€™s school, who finds that Cvetic is a double agent. When Eve finds out the terrible truth about the real motives of the party, the Reds decide that she should be eliminated, and Cvetic should help her without endangering herself. There should be a lot of ambiguity and double intersection in the film, but in this film there is very little, but (by today's standards) very foolish propaganda and little action or thrill. Lovejoy is very good in the title role, but even he and the rest of the actors seem sluggish. A few surprises here, and how did this film win an Oscar for best documentary? Rating 4.
