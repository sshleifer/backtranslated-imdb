The Grudge 2 is one of the films that makes me want to have more synonyms for "horrible" in English. With a plot full of more holes than a network of trawlers, this film is not able to make an intrusive viewing for an admirer of even the most stupid films that I am. I felt obliged to stay in the cinema until I gained entertainment in the amount of 5.70 pounds sterling, although I was afraid that I would be there for several years. The best film could have been made from the outcomes of the first part of The Grudge, although I’m not quite sure that this is not the result of such an exercise. As expected, what comes down to the plot in this terrible example of wasted celluloid ends without any permission, thereby leaving manufacturers with the opportunity to deliver “The Grudge 3’ to the public when the time comes hatred of civilization.
