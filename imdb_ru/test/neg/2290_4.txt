Not as bad as some people say ... This is an unofficial Bond movie and a remake of the movie "Thunderball" written by Kevin McClory (co-producer of the movie "Thunderball"). Well, the cast is very, very interesting, Maria Brandauer is an excellent Bond-villain, Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera are exactly the same as the “original” Bond girls, plus Rowan Atkinson and the really great Edward Fox, who looks really refreshing. "Role. In fact, the whole film is refreshing and gives new impulses. Sean Connery makes it more confident and charming again, except that he looks too old. But well, he is the original Bond, and it was great to see him in that role again. Places are also typical: the Bahamas, France, etc. The only thing that really fails is the musical accompaniment, the song “Never Say Never” is OK, but the song is simply not the topic. All in one, a good attempt to distinguish from Roger Moore's comic and silly films, such as Moon Racer. Only if there was another story, “The Stormy Ball” was a great movie and really didn’t need a remake.
