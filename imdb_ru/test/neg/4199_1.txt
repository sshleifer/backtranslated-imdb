No, just not. That's all you need to say. <br /> <br /> Summary: A random guy in a cornfield. For some reason, I'm not sure, but its duty is to run inside. The next great thriller? <br /> <br /> A five-year-old child could make a better film simply by shooting an anthill or even just growing grass. Seriously ..... <br /> <br /> Can't say that he has a bad game, because there is NO acting. You cannot say that he has a bad letter, because he has NO letters. You cannot say that he has bad cinematography because there is no cinematography. You can't say this is a bad movie, because there is no movie! If you don't believe me, go take a look. Just do not say that I never warned you .....
