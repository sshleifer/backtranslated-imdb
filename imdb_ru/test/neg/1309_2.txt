Mistake, badly directed and viciously written, it is watchable if you have an hour or two to kill or suffer from insomnia, but only fair. Robert Carlyle is fully aware of his potential as an actor of the highest mediocrity, having only one expression in his repertoire (chronically constipated football hooligan caring for an inferiority complex), which he sometimes manages to change slightly, swelling his nostrils and exposing a row of crooked yellow teeth (this indicates anger, tenderness, sadness, surprise, horror, fun, compassion, etc.) In the role of "the best marine engineer in the UK" and the son of a university professor, he is about as convincing as my neighbor's cat. Tom Courtney, equally mistaken, scattering and distorting every line, seems constantly chained to the eyeballs and seems to be no longer able to distinguish the flow from the puddle of his own urine if he stood in it. In general, another stupid attempt on the part of the British to imitate Hollywood pulp in its most trash form. Dialogue is a series of poorly defined clich√©s; action is divided; the plot is meaningless and amputated; and the characters, if you can call them that, do not even turn into the main two-dimensional sphere of their American counterparts.
