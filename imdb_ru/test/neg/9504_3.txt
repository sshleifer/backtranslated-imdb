I usually prefer French films to American ones, with explosions and car chases, but this film was very disappointing. There is no way to write a spoiler, because in fact nothing happens. This French couple lives in Lisbon for years, and they return to Paris for a friend's wedding. They announce to another friend that they are having dinner with what they are going to share. Then nothing much happens, they do not seem to know whether they want to separate or not. I do not necessarily think that their fluctuations lead to a bad film, very human to doubt before making this decision forever, but this could be treated in an interesting way, giving some meaning to their desires and their relationships, but this does not happen. A person leaves the theater, not knowing why these two have gathered together or want to leave. The only thing I liked was a conversation with a drunk. It was true for life.
