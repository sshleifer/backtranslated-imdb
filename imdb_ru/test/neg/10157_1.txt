There are a lot of movies, mostly from the 80s, that are so terrible that you can't help but love them. The Last Dream Party is one of those. I really hate this film, but it still remains one of the most popular films in my collection. I watched it countless times and each time got a huge laugh from it. This is a prime example of how ANY film could be released in the 80s. <br /> <br /> Our killer is called Maniac Randles. (Scary, huh?) Randles is a psychopathic killer who escapes, running in a doctor's scrubs and a doctor's jacket, which cuts people with a scalpel while he goes ahead. He ends up coming across a girls' house that makes a hen-party. One of the girls is the daughter of a doctor who tried to operate on Randle, and Randle eventually pulled him into some kind of sexual pose. (lol, just watch the movie to understand what I'm talking about.) Now I know what you must be thinking at this moment: it must be another low-end low-budget hack and a slash slot, like a slaughter on party overnight or massacre on Valentine's Day, right? NOT! This movie is terrible! First, the quality of the film changes from time to time. Sometimes it will look as if it was shot this year, but sometimes it is so grainy and fuzzy that you can't even see it. The funny thing is that some specific camera angles will be blurry and grainy, while other concrete camera angles will be clear and perfect, which is absolutely ridiculous and proves that they didn’t care. <br /> <br /> The director played a killer (as if it wasn’t funny enough), but because he wasn’t talented enough to act and direct at the same time, he just took one picture of how he was going to the camera with your scalpel, and then just repeat this clip over and over every time someone gets killed. <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are completely ridiculous and unattractive, and these people, who are supposedly between 16 and 18 years old, look like they are 25-45. I know that in slasher films, adults usually use in adolescence, but I have never seen a single film in which this is PRESENT. I guess the reason why none of them are still busy in the film industry is that they all died of old age ... Or maybe it was just because this movie was so terrible that they never wanted to show their faces again, which is good, because I very much doubt that they could get into other films even if they tried. All I can do is hope that someday Tyler will make the last party for sleep 2: the final conflict and return all the original actors. I'm sure everyone will like it. <br /> <br /> The film’s director is Steven Tyler (no, not a singer), who never became a director again, and was released by B & S (which I am). be sure to stand behind the bull and ****) Products. Bull & S just released another film, “Forever Evil,” which was pretty awful, but not as bad as Last Slumber Party. <br /> <br /> A horrible, terrible, terrible movie ... Highly recommended.
