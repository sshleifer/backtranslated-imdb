When I was younger (about 2), I looked at Barney for the first time, and I liked it. BUT, then I definitely didn't have a brain either. And now I look back and see that the really awful Barney show: First, EVERYTHING on this show is creepy. Barney, the main character, is a terrible talking 9-foot tall, purple dinosaur who teaches 13-year-olds about “imagination ....” (* shudders *) BJ (I know what you think of his name.) Is smaller but a creepy yellow dinosaur that must be “supposedly” cool. But in fact he is the exact opposite. After seeing several episodes in which B.J. stupidly dragged in his slightly turned cap, and made some not very funny jokes, I wanted to scream. Baby Bop-o-oh! (* Vomit *) oh-oh-oh, oh, baby Bop is the worst character idea ever. She is a green triceratops (this is a dinosaur) with a yellow blanket. Because of her comments on “hee-hee-hee” and Barney's “super-fool-fool” praise, it is difficult to watch each episode, as seventh graders learn about forms and manners. <br /> <br /> And this, my friend, makes this show really awful.
