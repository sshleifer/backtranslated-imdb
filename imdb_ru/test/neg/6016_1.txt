I would like all the scammers and horror parodies to disappear. If you are going to explore Loch Ness .. do it for real. Enough bull ****. The same with horror and science fiction ... if you're going to make a movie, and it must be scary ... make it scary ... not funny. I hate it when I watch a horror movie, and the character is fighting for his life (or running, or something else ... their lives are at stake), and they are joking. That will never happen .. Where have all the good directors gone? I think that horror and science fiction have really gone down the chimney from the 70s. I miss the days when the horror movie was scary ... all this scary creepy crap is meant for birds. This film is also for birds. If you really want to see a good investigation or a serious conversation ... do not expect this in this video.
