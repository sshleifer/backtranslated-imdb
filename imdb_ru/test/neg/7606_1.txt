I made the mistake of watching The Dark Star (1974) late in the evening many years ago. It was one of the most stupid films I've ever watched: <br /> <br /> 1. Bad behavior. <br /> <br /> 2. A bad letter. <br /> <br /> 3. Scientific stupid plot. (Destruction of the entire planet, because its orbit is unstable or interferes, will only aggravate the situation: instead of one large object, which is easily avoided, you will have thousands of smaller, but equally deadly and more complex objects to track.) 4. Completely unrealistic characters. Painted beach ball as a space alien? Script writers must have taken too many drugs. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, most of the actors who starred in The Dark Star have never done anything else. Of those who did something else, most never acted again after the Dark Star. Therefore, the presence of the Dark Star on the acting resume was the death star for an acting career!
