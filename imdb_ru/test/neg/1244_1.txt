What in the world! This piece of fiction film is suitable for Lifetime Network. Michael Imperoli is a good actor, but I think that his role in the role of Stu has not paid off. Montages were unbearable and too much. Cast, where are you? Whoever does the casting, he must be partially guilty. Cinematography was useless. Gambling story with a feeling after school. Such stories should be left for Oliver Stone of the world. It will still suck ass, but at least it would be interesting to see. It was an attempt to lose their wheels before the race. Mario Andretti in 1982 Indy 500 came to mind.
