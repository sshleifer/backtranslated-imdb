The big problem I encountered in this film was that the Lombard character, as another user said, is “too cruel.” Lombard plays the role of Ann Krausheimer Smith, who believes that she is married to David Smith, well played sharply dressed and at the same time clumsy Robert Montgomery. There are some funny moments in the film, especially when the character Montgomery goes to great lengths to try to get his “wife” back. It is clear that she is upset, because the marriage is technically not legal, but she only finds out about it after three years. <br /> <br /> Lombard’s character seems rather cold for her husband’s sincere attempts to get her back. Despite the fact that Montgomery is not very well versed in these efforts, he, nevertheless, is clearly loving, and yet the Lombard is as cool as an ice pillar. There is almost no evidence suggesting any reconciliation between the warring couple throughout most of the film, and it’s hard to see any comedy — even a dark comedy — in this aspect. To some extent, the film almost suggests a sadistic tinge, with the Lombard character getting "hit" from her husband's weak efforts. While someone might think that this is another film like “Battle of the Sexes”, the reality is that it is a very one-sided battle, if so: the Montgomery character, although with flaws, is not sufficiently flawed to make it a typical example male chauvinist / woman-hater (a great example of this is Michael Douglas in The War of the Roses). In fact, the character is largely feminine, as evidenced not only by Montgomery's sharp clothes (which probably owes much to the most constantly dressed actor), but also his discomfort in trying - but not in that - to play the role of a womanizer His only major flaw is his vanity, but this mistake is not counterbalanced by the excessive cruelty of his partner. And there is no suggestion that she is trying to instill any jealousy of subconscious love. That's what makes him so cruel and sad. Montgomery's character just looks weak. In fact, no wife would want a man to be so weak if she "did not wear pants" in marriage. But then again, a woman who wears pants in marriage will never seek to be so cruel, because she has already confirmed this role at an early stage. Therefore, the whole topic seems strange. This film is not a feminist champion (Lombard’s character shows some signs of some kind of independent woman of the 60s, but this idea is soon canceled and the character returns in the 1940s), and not even a one-sided gender battle (since the character Montgomery is really a cipher masculinity and, therefore, lost cause). <br /> <br /> At first glance, this film is a farce, but under this veneer it is indeed much darker, with a sadistic semitone. All this makes his resolution look, well, strange. (Maybe this was the oddity?). In any case, there is no farce for this film.
