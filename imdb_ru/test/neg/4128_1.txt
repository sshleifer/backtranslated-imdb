First of all, I just watched a movie on SHOWTIME called “Island of Survival”. It says that it was a 2006 film with Billy Zane, and since I like it and I can't sleep, I decided to check it out. It looked interesting. I looked at it and decided to look at IMDb, who was this new face of Juan Pablo Di Pace and OMG I could not believe it, this film was renamed THREE and would become a new film ?? It is played again after 1 hour and 30 minutes on the Showtime Channel, and this date is May 28, Eastern Time or Florida. You can check your show lists by title and see it. I will not go into details so that you can watch the film, but at some point there is a woman in a white bikini who enters the water, taking it all off, you see her naked body ... when she runs out of the water you see her bottom to funny, there are many other problems. I can not believe it by coincidence, I decided to watch this movie ... Go figure it out! Interestingly, the people who renamed him sold him to some movie studio to release, but he already plays on Showtime, haha. Good laugh I give him 1-1 / 2 stars. C-, D + movie.
