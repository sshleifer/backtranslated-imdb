Spoiler with the explanation of the plot: a poor family is thrown in the middle of a war between an evil guy (who appears from nowhere and does not ask questions ...), who has fallen into decay, and the friendly spirit of Casper, who is trying to avenge his death. With each frame, the film becomes more and more predictable, a big disappointment. Finishing stitches is completely stupid, it has nothing to do with the film itself, I think that someone is running out of ideas or just comes to the point that the film is one way or another, so that it can have a stupid ending. A waste of time, resources and money. The acting is very bad. If you think about dialogues, you may find that family conflict is artificially caused by poor communication between the characters. In some scenes, the seam is random. In the end: boring, predictable, poor, pathetic. A waste of time and money.
