I never intended to see Venom, but I caught it on a cable. He has good items. The atmosphere in Louisiana, for example, because of Hurricane Katrina, which we, unfortunately, will not see in the movies. It is based on an interesting concept of an ordinary person, imbued with evil spirits. His confrontation with his son could be interesting, like most of the film. But, as a rule, it happens in Hollywood, an interesting idea goes in a familiar direction: <br /> <br /> Kill all the characters except the good girl, starting with the black guys. I'm a fan of Agnes Bruckner, but the other characters, the aforementioned son of the villain Cecy, who should be a voodoo priestess, are more interesting. And for the love of God, only once would I like to see a virgin being killed. We all like a light girl, why can't she live? In this case, it was Bijou Phillips, and we love her. <br /> <br /> The ending did not make sense, given what was established with regard to the invincibility of the villain. All the slaughter and the atmosphere, and this leads to nothing.
