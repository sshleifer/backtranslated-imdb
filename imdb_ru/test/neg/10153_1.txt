I got it on a double film DVD called The Theater of Screams, and this is without a doubt one of the most horrible films I've ever seen. And I saw some really bad ones. The school is closed, and out of three girls (who, if they were teenagers, I would eat my hat) talked about the “non-stop party,” so, of course, they all go to the girl's house, whose parents are the most severe hen party. Meanwhile, the psychotic escaped from the local bug, where the father of one girl works, and he is free with sharp objects, in green scrubs and with wide eyes ... I think it should show that he is mad. Of course, since he has a bone that can be taken from this particular doctor, he goes to his house, whose location is obviously known. At the same time, some types of fool throw beer into the street to scare the girls, and, of course, the loony also appears and starts to cut the throat. And that's about it, as heavy metal music puffs in the background. Or maybe it’s not, but in fact it’s all you need to know. If you do not spend your time constantly stoned or drunk, you will find little interest here, and even if you spend most of your time, you still probably find that your intellect is offended. 1 out of 10
