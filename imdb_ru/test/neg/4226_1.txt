L'Humanité is the secret of murder. These films tend to be popular, <br /> <br /> and the rating of 6.9, which he currently has, suggests that he too was. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film has no redemptive qualities. /> <br /> For example, some non-spoilers include a 5-minute scene <br /> <br /> in which the main character eats an apple. And 3 more minutes <br /> <br /> where he breathes. <br /> <br /> If you are curious, this is, in fact, not art. And this is not a comment to humanity, which, judging by the name, is trying to <br /> <br />. Actually it is boring. In this film, many attempts to say something about humanity. Some might think: “How would I comment on humanity?” And the most <br /> <br /> obvious and boring answers, of course, will be sex, love and death. <br /> <br /> It’s not that these options are uninteresting when everything is done well - only that <br /> <br /> these are canonical options. As for sex, this film is doing everything possible to make it unattractive and disgusting. In the first five minutes - <br /> <br /> therefore, this is not a spoiler - you will see a bloody vagina <br /> <br /> of a dead 11-year-old girl; it's a murder mystery, remember? Later, <br /> <br /> several people rush at each other and have what the director <br /> <br /> would like us to believe that this is “rough” sex, but in reality this is <br /> <br /> Invented and too symbolic, but, even worse, uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I like it when films bother me. This film showed me why: <br /> <br /> Disturbing films usually show something inside someone, <br /> <br /> his humanity, about which they did not know, and which is a little <br / > <br /> afraid. L'Humanité tried to do just that, but failed, and I left the theater unharmed, but with disgust thinking that I wasted my time in the theater <br /> <br /> Despite watching the movie for free, <br /> <br />
