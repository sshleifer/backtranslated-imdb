May 2: someone pressed 11 NO, and then continued to do another 15 with my previous 15 comments: almost as funny as this turkey! <br /> <br /> May 1: <br /> <br /> While I am writing this, I am still under the impression that there should be the funniest thriller I've ever seen. I have a serious case of giggling, but I will try to calm down. (It is difficult to write when snot is spilled from your nose and sporadic saliva is thrown from the mouth on the keyboard.) <br /> <br /> A couple of young women who had just returned from vacation took a ride on a shuttle bus. They are joined by several young guys. But in fact, the bus is not a taxi service, but a car for the abduction. (Do not giggle!) His driver was part of an organized gang of "white slavery" that snatches young women from airports, and they do this for FIVE years. (Do not laugh.) Five years at the same airport when the police or even the FBI do not know about it. (Do not giggle, please.) Apparently, dozens of women disappear in the same place for years and years - and yet no one notices the trend. FBI is incompetent? Shuttle World seems to consist of three types of people: easily kidnapped blondes, stupid / comatose / invisible FBI agents, and all-powerful psychotic gangsters (who hate sexy blonde with tattooed backs). <br /> <br /> The driver barely survived on this one mission, and yet he did it — I repeat — FIVE years without being killed or losing one of his limbs. (Stop laughing ...) Did I mention that the driver is immortal? Should I mention it? We all know that movie psychopaths have immortal DNA. You can strike them, repeatedly bounce off of them to the bus walls, gently caress them with a hammer, prick nine-inch nails in their ears ... Damn, you can stick a hand grenade in the mouth of an ordinary Hollywood loony and he would still run away with minor scratches. No, the driver is not Satan or even not a small demon, but an ordinary Hollywood loony with better survival abilities than the biggest and most disgusting sewer cockroach. <br /> <br /> The main plot: the guy loses all the fingers on one side, in a silly scene. (The magic bus that reads and listens to the thought!) Passengers try to escape. They fail. It hurts them. They sulk. They approve. They are trying to escape. They fail. They get injured. They approve. They are trying to escape. They fail. They get injured. They are trying to escape. They fail. They are trying to escape. The kidnappers manage to snatch the gun from the driver! Alas, they do not kill him, because the Golden Hollywood Rule of Gandhi-like Pacifism forbids them to do so. (Doesn't giggle.) One of the other passengers turns out to be part of a gang! (Stop laughing.) He is played by an actor who studied at the School of Excessive Action and Rob Zombie / John Travolta’s foolish robbery. He threatens to rape. Later, one of the girls hit him on the head with a crowbar, about a dozen times ... very hard. After a few seconds, he regains consciousness. Yes, he survives. (Immortal, remember?) He is killed a little later. (Although I have no idea how! He should not be killed.) The kidnappers argue. They are trying to escape. One of them runs away! Alas, the psychos are too godlike in their abilities so as not to intercept their prey. The game begins anew: the passengers are trying to escape. They fail. They sulk. They look into the void. It hurts them. They are trying to escape. They fail. It hurts them ... <br /> <br /> You understand. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I believe that a narcotic, heavily disoriented, drunk snail would easily avoid these kidnappers of nindkupa. There were so many possibilities. At some point, these clumsy psychos (remember: five years!) They even sent one of the kidnappers to the grocery store! She leaves a message to the police. Nevertheless, yes ... you guessed it: there is no police in this fictional fabulous American city. <br /> <br /> And just as you thought the film could not be dumber - even if Luc Besson and Brian De Palma had joined forces to help with the script - it is. Girls are abducted to be sent to some remote island (?), And this is achieved by transporting them as cargo. Apparently, in this fictional America there is no FBI, no police or border customs. However, there are immortal criminals in it, who are more fortunate than in twenty lotteries. One blonde had her billionth chance to kill the driver, and yet she failed. How is it that the victims in these stupid thrillers NEVER try to finish off their immortal opponents when they fell to the floor and were injured? Probably, I myself answered this: they are immortal! So why try, she must have thought ... <br /> <br /> So why one blond was gassed to death, and the other was packed in a box and sent alive (complete with a cat litter box and the most amusing photography since then) Photos of Demi Moore in elementary school)? Could it be a tattoo? I think they killed prettier, but that's just me. Was her tattoo so ugly? <br /> <br /> Don't I care? Why should I look for logic in a film shot by imbeciles (for imbeciles)? Also, how can I think straight when I'm laughing so much in half ?! <br /> <br /> Naturally, this is a horror / thriller of the 21st century, the mobile phone does not work ... Perhaps this invincible gang controls not only the FBI, the police and customs, but also satellites in space. <br /> <br /> Is it necessary to clarify this? There are much easier ways to kidnap people. And much smarter people who should make films. Give the idiot a camera, and it will lay an egg every time ... These kind of answers, the eternal mystery of which came first: the egg or the director with the bird's brain.
