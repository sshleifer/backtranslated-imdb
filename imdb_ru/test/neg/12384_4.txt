Pilot Mitch McAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees a UFO during a test flight on an airplane, but nothing appears on the radar. Then the planes and ships begin to disappear, and reports of an increase in UFOs. It turns out that this is a giant monster bird that attacks and kills. But what is it and why is it here? <br /> <br /> There are all the necessary elements for the classics. He really has a rather interesting scenario - I have never been bored. The acting is good (for the monster movie of the 1950s). Morrow does not exaggerate the act of the macho hero, and Mara Corday is pretty good as a necessary female love interest. She is also strong and takes care of herself - even though she does not have food and coffee for everyone throughout the film. The problem here is the monster. Dear God, this is terrible! Looks like a deranged turkey! He has a long neck, a cheerful, dull nod, several teeth, several strands of hair on his head and claws. And - oh yeah - screaming! Do not rumble - scream! The actors had no idea what it looked like â€” it was added after the production. The actors Morrow and Corday were horrified when they finally saw it in the theater. Morrow said his audience laughed and he quickly left the theater before the movie ended! Producer Sam Katzman was in charge of this. He wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever. And you can SEE the wires moving it too! It gets 4 stars just because Morrow and Corday are so good, and the script is well done. He does not get stars for a miserable monster - wait until he attacks a toy train! It is worth seeing if you are a horror fan to see what the stupidest monster in history should be.
