Ever wanted to see how a movie can go low? Well, look no further! This film has it all! <br /> <br /> Racist jokes, jokes with disabilities, jokes with excess weight, jokes about suicide, jokes with murders, drugs, jokes with animal abuse, jokes with dirt, jokes with old men and young wives, jokes about rake, funny jokes, jokes with shit flat on your face again and again jokes, excessive use of bloody jokes, rape jokes, jokes with urine, jokes with alcohol abuse, anal pranks with a rash, a bunch of people who are joking again over coffee, jokes of nudity see who can say it yourself Some unprintable words in one scene are jokes, lesbians, jokes on a girl, and the list goes on and on people! <br /> <br /> Worse, nothing funny! (Itâ€™s not that someone finds most of these funny ones from the very beginning.) It seems that when it simply cannot be worse, it pushes your expectations to a completely new bottom, as it always seems that he finds something else to make the viewer feel worse. There was one scene because of which I almost vomited and at the same time almost completely suppressed. I do not think that I need to indicate which one, but again, I am sure that there are other scenes that will give people the same feeling. <br /> <br /> There was one moment at the end of the film that really made sense and was a bit realistic when suddenly one of the characters in the scene was piled up with the most disgusting remains of a garbage bag and thrown to the ground a few feet only to a bunch of beer bottles slammed into his head. All this is probably when he least deserved it. Thus, all thoughts of another 1 ransom point were quickly considered. This is really a horrible movie. This is the one that should be studied and divided into two parts at the film school to teach students what not to do.
