A young man who never knew his own parents, gets an old farm in an isolated area of ​​West Virginia after the death of his natural father. He visits his property with a number of potential victims, including a comic embossed black guy and a trendy lesbian couple. (Hmm, will there be a skinny lowering? Guess.) Unfortunately, the party ends when the spirits of drifters killed by his evil grandfather and used as stuffed animals return for revenge. This movie starts well. The artful montage of photos of the era of depression and fake newspapers, opposed to the performance of the FDR - I think this is his first appearance in the killer film of stuffed animals - creates a mood. I developed some hopes for the film, which were partially realized. The story was fairly intact. The setting was fairly bucolic. The photo was mostly in focus. The acting, although without much upheaval, was slightly above the face value of horror films in this budget range. The film may have really worked within the narrow requirements of the genre, if the stuffed animals were scary. But they were not. They looked cheap. They were not frightening at all. The better the monster, the better the movie. These stuffed animals wouldn't scare Dorothy, let alone Toto.
