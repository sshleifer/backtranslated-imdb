Adventures in the City of Dinosaurs, although they were a creative idea, were a disgustingly cruel attempt at filmmaking. Being drawn into the TV and in the new world is interesting. Three teenagers are obsessed with semi-animated dinosaurs. Do not waste your time and brain power to see this confident loser. I wouldn't even let my children watch this.
