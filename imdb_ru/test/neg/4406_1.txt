It was one of the most dishonest, senseless and unworldly films I've ever seen. The view of the other, the Israelis, was racist, backward and unjust. On the one hand, the song that sounded on the E.S. automobile radio station when it pulled up next to the very right Israeli driver was “I cast a spell on you” from Natasha Atlas. The style of the song is quite Arabic, but it was released on an Israeli compilation, and I even heard it on the radio in Israel. Many Israeli songs (as well as architecture, food, and slang) were influenced by Arabic culture, and there is no reason why an Israeli Jew would be offended or angry by a nearby car performing this song. Method E.S. it seems so calm and collected in sunglasses and a cool look, with the help of a long fixed shot, designed to make the viewer see the Jew haggard and racist, as well as E.S. I am noble and moderate. <br /> <br /> I traveled all over Israel and never saw a poster for recruiting IDF, because the service is obligatory. But the film not only has a recruitment poster, but also depicts a stereotypical image of an Arab terrorist and the words “do you want to shoot?” . In particular, the director seeks to convince viewers that Israel is a society of anti-Arab racists obsessed with murder. <br /> <br /> The ninja scene was unreasonable and unnecessarily cruel. A Hollywood-style action movie scene with Israeli soldiers shooting at Palestinians would be just as undesirable in a film shot by Israeli filmmakers as the ninja scene. But for some reason, images of an unrealistic, non-comic, and violent script can be applauded by the audience, since the director has so smeared the Israeli side that any shot of the killed Israeli soldiers would be welcome. The director is absolutely not trying to build bridges, to portray "others" as people or to strive for peace; violence is made to be the only solution. This is facilitated by the scene of an explosion of tanks, falling watchtowers and other random acts of destruction. One of my best friends is serving in the Israeli military, and the targets on the ranges are never Arab women dressed in black, or any other quasi-Iileans on canvas. Checkpoint soldiers are ordered not to shoot at the head of an approaching Palestinian if it is not clear that their own lives are in danger; the method, according to my friend, is to provide a warning cry, shoot in the air or around the area, and then, if nothing helps, shoot in the leg, and then interrogate and hospitalize. Arbitrary targeting of a woman in the head, as shown in the film, is not a proper procedure. <br /> <br /> In addition to these inaccuracies, the direction style was also bad. Repetition has become repetitive and no longer fun. Symbols, such as the balloon with the painted Arafat, are forced out of any plot structure or effective integration in the setting; the balloon is Palestine penetrating and returning Jerusalem, and it was created without a reason. E.S. An ambulance, checked by Israeli soldiers for permits, followed by Israeli ambulances that fly past a checkpoint, is an overly open statement by the director about Israel’s double standards. The director’s attempt to show life in Nazareth as sad and meaningless was made because of the excesses; show the routine of random people again and again, even with small changes every time, and emphasizing that no one of the actors ever smiles and is minimalistic in the dialogue, almost cries out about the purpose of such scenes, about the sadness of life, without providing much space for personal interpretation. Contrasting one “fragment” of the film “Daily Life in Nazareth” with the second section - “checkpoint between Ramallah and Israel”, the director secretly accuses Israel of this gloom, but never gives direct evidence of why such a fault can be justified. argued. <br /> <br /> I spent hours trying to understand why the music suddenly ended and started suddenly, and why many modern tracks, similar to fashion shows and metal action, were included in the score. I still can not think of an answer. I felt the music was out of place in this film; the contrast between quieter scenes and intense scenes was actually annoying and did not affect or make you think. I can understand whether the director intended the music to give some comic aspect in certain scenes, but I found that there was nothing funny about Israeli soldiers shooting at targets or fighting with ninjas, or when a woman had to go for another walk checkpoint, albeit defiant. In fact, I was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes and was annoyed by the lack of a score during quiet scenes. Whatever the director's intentions, in the film he caused only auditory discontent. <br /> <br /> There is no legitimate political message in this film because it gives an inaccurate and extreme impression of the other and does not take into account actual problems. This is a propaganda film, because the director intends to use various characters, styles and scenes to arouse sympathy for the Palestinian side, showing the Israeli side as cruel and inhuman without exception; the lively atmosphere of a lively Hollywood scene or intense music manifests itself in every act of violence by Palestinians against Israelis, so that almost inevitably the positive and exciting feelings that music and cinematography cause to the audience are directed in one direction. There is no thought, reflection or deepening of the understanding of the conflict by the audience; Emotions simply move aside and remain there, according to the “good versus bad” scenario. I believe that this film lacked the depth, quality and power of other Palestinian films, such as Paradise Now and The Wedding in Galilee.
