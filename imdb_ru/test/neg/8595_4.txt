If you can watch a movie without worrying about the plot or the banal action, then Backdraft is definitely the one. <br /> <br /> However, if, like me, you like to watch movies that you can believe in, then Backdraft has some serious flaws. He does not offer anything new, and there are hundreds of militants of the 90s who follow the same formulas, although they are not so clumsy. <br /> <br /> After two skirmishes, I think itâ€™s needed somewhere else, I mean, how many large fires in one city? Of course, firefighters do other things, for example, extract cats from trees? Well, I was wrong, and the repetition continues again and again, until the very end. <br /> <br /> A good aspect of the film is the fire itself, well filmed, and I must say that I was pretty hot while watching it, which suggests that two hours of watching the fire without a story or action would be more appropriate for my taste.
