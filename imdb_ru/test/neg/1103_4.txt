Children's films about death and horror will always remain a sensitive and controversial combination, and therefore I personally believe that every film that demonstrates the courage to revolve on this topic should receive additional attention from horror fans. Of course, as is the case with Unholy Trivia, controversial topics do not always guarantee a good movie. Despite the potentially interesting plot, the atmospheric setting and the attraction of the video-opposite director J.S. Cardone (“The Killer”) is a boring movie, in which there was not a single fright and shock. Having lost their husband and father, the remaining Tunisian women (mother Karen and her daughters Sarah and Emma) move to a small and remote mountain town in Pennsylvania, where they inherited an old, decrepit mansion. Their new home is dangerously close to the ruins of an old mine, where dozens of innocent children died tragically in 1913. Strange things are starting to happen, for example, how young Emma made friends with the (imaginary?) Girl who used to live in their house, and the creepy locals seem to keep secrets from Karen and her daughters. It quickly turns out that the undead children still leave their graves at night to take revenge on the descendants of the mine owner Mr. Carlton, who was responsible for their death. "Wicked Little Things" is pretty tame and extremely predictable. The script shamelessly serves one awful cliche after another, like car wheels stuck in the dirt at critical moments, broken flashlights and terribly broken dolls. There is very little expectation, even less blood, and the effects of the makeup are disappointingly weak. Zombie children do not look threatening at all. In fact, they all look like miniature versions of Marilyn Manson, with their black outfits, pale faces and dark eyes. The final without excitement is stupid and just as derivative as this whole meaningless performance. Lori Heyring is not at all impressive with her lead mother role, but scout Taylor-Compton (currently a big star thanks to the Halloween remake) and young Chloe Moretz are like daughters.
