Being a fan of comedies ZaSu Pitts, I thought that this one looked like it was worth a try. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> (The version I saw was on TCM, but consisted only of the film “Niagara Falls”; the film “Miss Polly” was missing.) The talents of the actors who give good performances were wasted The most stupid stories I've ever come across. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown (Tom Wilson) surprised me that I am the strongest actor in the series, but Slim is paying all attention to Summerville (Sam Sawyer), who, if he has some talent, has not shown it's here. <br /> <br /> ZaS Pitts (Ellie Sawyer) is gorgeous, but does not have a large enough role. The biggest laugh in the film is when she gets under Sam under the table. <br /> <br /> The only one in the film who has at least some meaning is Tom Wilson. Margie (Marjorie Woodworth) is generally unwise. Although she is physically quite attractive, her personality and attitude make her completely undesirable. Ellie, Sam and the hotel clerk are fools. <br /> <br /> Sam and Ellie abandon their bridal suite in a crowded hotel for Tom and Margie. But then they take it back. Sam ends up imprisoning Tom and Margie in their room. They try to break off most of the movie, but Sam, using a rifle, always returns them back. <br /> <br /> Towards the end comes the worst part. Tom, who is finally going to run away, runs into the hotel’s downstairs minister. Now the guy who, as I said, is the only one in the whole film whose head is on his shoulders, suddenly, for no reason at all, decides to marry Margie! <br /> <br /> He drags the minister into the room from which he had just escaped, but Margie does not want to marry him. He kisses her, and now, after one kiss, she feels obliged to marry him. <br /> <br /> Finally, Sam has the courage to say to Tom: “You deceived me,” when Tom was with Sam almost the only line before: “We are not married,” to which Sam replied, “You think I would believed it? ”Idiocy. <br /> <br />
