Again, as in many other TV shows, the spotlight was a certain actress / actress, in this case Miranda Cosgrove, who earned a reputation in previous films / TV shows (especially Nickelodeon and Dan Schneider. Now she's the star of the show, forcing the soundtrack to sing (which she did not write, and thus gains even greater fame from this.) Great? This creates the same imbalance in popularity compared to her other colleagues, especially Nathan Kress, who is constantly being pushed into minor rolls in each episode e, besides iDont Want to Fight, Cosgrove music would never hit the charts without this show and its singing of the main theme music (which was not written by it) and other covers, such as About You Now and Stay my Baby. she synchronizes her lips and sings her song live. Is this how you create a vocalist now? <br /> <br /> Coming back to the show, Cosgrove is more physically physical when she plays bikini, hawaiian bra, and mentions a bra many times. Bras and seen in many cases (although not other actresses). Wedges are mentioned, once panties were mentioned. Oh, let's not forget the phrase “Oh God” (are any of the scriptwriters / actors Christian?) Of course, the show is not only for children, I am surprised by the many references to women's underwear Especially in the first episode, where the phrase “pointed tits ". I am not sure whether children will thus refrain from saying this at home / at school afterwards. <br /> <br /> I am not against the mention or demonstration of women's underwear (which will be worn by girls), but for the Nickelodeon show, those in charge should have understood that children would be exposed to such things. I doubt that other Nickelodeon shows contain such content. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, other reviews, the laugh track is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many parts - for example, when the character Sam cries, how on earth is it time to laugh? It distracts people from jokes and is used in almost every sentence. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, Cosgrove became the star of the show and thus receives maximum fame and support from fans, who even scolded the hotel staff when she was told that her noise level was lower (see http : //www.youtube.com/watch? v = kk0gtfUk98U). Jennett McCardi is the second star of the show, but she faces competition from Cosgrove in the music industry (compare the popularity of her new single with the covers of Cosgrove). As already noted, the third colleague in the film Nathan Kress - the least visible of all. He is portrayed as an atypical boy who suffers from bullying by a girl and other boys, but is somehow a wizard of technology. His height in the early episodes makes him a sweet actor, but unusual, given his character’s love for Carly / Cosgrove. In addition, Kress does not break into the music industry, and as Cosgrove grows in popularity with each episode, Kress falls behind. I can bet that he is the least paid of all three actors. <br /> <br /> The content of the show is, of course, fictional, but it also allows you to wonder how it fits into the comedy series at certain points in time (thus, the track of laughter is used). It also contains several succession errors (how can your father and Air Force Colonel be on a submarine? The US Special Forces has its own units, and the Air Force does not use US submarines - this is for Navy Seals). A unique feature is that viewers can send their own videos for display during or after the episodes, but, again, for some reason, the videos do not correspond to the theme of comedy. <br /> <br /> Once again, this show is riddled with references to women's underwear, bare skin and used tracks of laughter. This is a series in which a youth actress is so strongly pushed into the crowd that her songs / actions are overly supported by her fans, leaving her stellar behind.
