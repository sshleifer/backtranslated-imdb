Not to be confused with the 1943 George Zucco film "Mad Ghoul", "Mad Monster" - a film that Zucco appeared last year. Zukko invented a way to transform his stupid craftsman Peter into a hybrid of a wolf and a man by injecting wolf blood, and then spent some time sending the transformed fool to kill his former colleagues who mocked his experiments. In fact, this is a very simple plot and extremely low-budget production. Glenn Strange, who plays the human / wolf here, will soon achieve greater glory by playing the Frankie monster in films such as House of Frankenstein (1944) and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). Working with make-up for him is pretty lame here, and he only manages to look like a hippie with bad teeth (like the one that was in the Teenage Monster of 1957). In addition, the sets in this film are practically absent, and the outcome is abrupt and inconclusive. I gave the film a very generous 4 stars, partly because I have a constant love for the horror films of the 1940s, but, to tell the truth, most objective viewers will probably find it ridiculous shit, and I suppose so. This, of course, is not a well-thought-out universal novel or a masterpiece of Val Lewton, that's for sure! Nevertheless, Zucco is always fun to watch, even in such unassuming beauty as this one. If you can save 72 minutes of your life, I suppose you could have done worse than “Mad Monster” (of course, not much worse!). Oh ... one more thing. This DVD is from Alpha Video, and you know what that means: fuzzy images, lousy sound (in fact, the worst sound among all the Alpha Video DVD videos I've ever encountered) and no extras. You have been warned!
