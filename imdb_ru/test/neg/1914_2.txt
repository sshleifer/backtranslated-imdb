I watched it on cable because I was a big fan of Lily. Big mistake. What a horrible movie. You do not care about any of the characters in the film. Chris Klein plays a guy who is a complete jerk in the film, and steals Josh Hartnett's longtime girlfriend. If the writer knew what they were doing, this film would follow a proven formula and make Hartnett an ass, and Lily a friend who fell into a bad relationship, from which she saved Klein. But Hartnett is a really cool guy who shows a lot of emotion and love for Lily. <br /> <br /> You then hate lily, because she cheats Hartnett with Klein, who is a jerk for everyone in the city who is trying to help him, and is really stuck. <br /> <br /> This is also very decent, and the characters do everything, but they run around the kitchen, dancing and synchronizing their lips, using combs and spoons and artificial microphones (although they come very close). <br /> <br /> What a horrible horrible movie. You donâ€™t even care what happens in the end, because the director never lets you take care of the characters.
