What a cast ... and what a waste of it. Seriously, when there are Gabriel Byrne, Jamie Foxx, Tandi Newton, Stuart Townsend, Hal Holbrook, Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone in the movie, you expect some quality. The film, however, is one big mess with an unlikely story that seems to be able to stop making a turn to it. Yes, I think they thought they were really smart with all of this. <br /> <br /> The story is not only dirty and unlikely, but not quite original. He uses elements of earlier and much better poker movies. But for me it was really meaningless turns in the film that made it. It made the story so incredible to watch. In addition, the script is still filled with lots of holes, stupid bugs in the game of poker and things that just do not make much sense. Why someone, above all, wants to play against the card player, who is known as the best cheater in the game. This is what the film is about and which it builds, but for me it never made much sense. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film is a great cast, it seems that the majority of actors make mistakes in their roles. I don't know what this is Stuart Townsend. He is a good actor, but in most of the roles he plays, he always feels out of place. Perhaps this is his appearance, I do not know. In fact, it also caused him to be replaced in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Also, Tandy Newton is not very good and is actually quite annoying in her “strong” female role. And what's the point of getting involved with Melanie Griffith? Oh, I think that I could continue the film about his casting and could complain even more about the very limited screen time that the character Jamie Foxx gets, but I think you already understood my point of view. <br /> <br /> Damian Simply Niemann is not a very good writer / director, and besides, he doesn’t do very well with his own material. Scenes often seem unrelated, trying to use too many characters in them, and everything in the film is superficial and predictable. In addition, from time to time in the film there is a bad editing, which also does not help to turn this film into one. The film was also one of the main box office bombs, and it is not surprising that Damien Niemann has not made a film since then. <br /> <br /> Too much of a mess so you can enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
