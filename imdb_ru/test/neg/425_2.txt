Oh, well, I thought it should be a good action, but it was not. Although the stars Jeff Speakman look no matter what. Only two are fighting for almost 1.5 hours, yak. A lot of talk, and everything is so artificial that you could not believe it. The plot is clear from the outset. If you want good action, do not shoot this movie.
