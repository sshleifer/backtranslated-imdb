O'Neill's play, four and a half hours long, comes down to two and a half, and most of this time is given to actors with frozen expressions on their faces when they read the thoughts of their characters in voice acting. It may work on the stage, but in this soap opera she looks funny, which softens the bad behavior of the heroine and never explains why she charmed so many men so much. Norma Shearer and Alexander Kirkland, ridiculously replaying, are surpassed by the naturalist Clark Gable - he is the only one who makes the frozen face technique work. It becomes even funnier when the son of Shearer and Gable, a gloomy mopet, makes a frozen face. There is also Frank Morgan's brother Ralph as an unfortunate admirer who was greeted "poor Charlie!" over and over and young Robert Young and Maureen O'Sullivan. By the time they appear, the voice-over is basically already abandoned, and it plays like a mature soap with a sentimental fading that actually plays “Silver threads among gold” as background music. Direction of Robert Leonard is heavy, and it shows few opportunities to curb hyperactive actors. This is certainly entertaining - there is nothing else like this, except for Groucho's satirical parody in Animal Crackers or the old satirical version of Mad Magazine, in which Shirley Booth’s Hazel sitcom became Strange Interlude. But this is not good.
