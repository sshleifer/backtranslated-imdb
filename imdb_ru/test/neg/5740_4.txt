I believe that in the future, any film made by a sci-fi channel and subsequently released on DVD should say that it really was made by such a channel, since I would not buy this material if I knew this fact. Not that it was all bad, but when you stopped making ads in the middle of a movie, it just disrupts the flow of the movie. This, in turn, makes the film quite boring. It had an interesting story, but the frivolous and extremely general soundtrack distracted one from the film, like most bad actors, with the exception of Dayen and Linda Carter. The story that vampires are attacking in South America, of course, the rules of vampire films do not work, which is usually not found in any of the vampire films I have seen recently, with the exception of the Blade trilogy. A group of soldiers is sent into battle, and the squad is sent to another team to meet with the team and hunt down the ex-wife of one of the soldiers ... why is she not just his wife, who knows how this part of the plot really does not go anywhere. Nevertheless, we get an interesting boat ride, beautiful jungle landscapes and lots of blood. This fact, however, does not save the film from a stupid presentation and really boring from time to time. I don’t know, maybe it was CGI blood, smoke and all that they have to do CGI now, even if the old effects look better and don’t cost so much. I mean, cheap Italian zombie movies can make a bullet hole without a cgi, why can't we now?
