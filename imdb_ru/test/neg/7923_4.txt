Such films do not need to continue. Part of the advantage of Don Bluth, who is leaving Disney, is that he did not have to endure their endless tirade of video clips, poorly animated sequels with a prize pool. But, obviously, it was someone's brilliant idea to make a sequel, “All dogs go to heaven,” so we got it. <br /> <br /> Charlie Sheen replaced Bert, and he's not really that good. Much of the film is simply a bad excuse for a sequel, and it’s not as dark, unusual or interesting as the original. <br /> <br /> I’m sorry for future generations who will endlessly suffer like sequels without even knowing what time it was when Hollywood didn’t fully rely on successful films as a support for releasing banal crap. <br /> <br /> Please, no more sequels for children's films that they do not need.
