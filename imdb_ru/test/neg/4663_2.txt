The game was terrible. Special effects, though exceptional, dominated the film. The letter was pathetic, and the dialogue was incredible. And the silly little love story between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck was out of place. <br /> <br /> But the worst crime of Armageddon is the complete absence of scientific reality. “A Texas-sized asteroid,” says Billy Bob Thornton. Uh, it's 800 miles wide! Does anyone at NASA even see an asteroid until the afternoon meteor shower destroys New York? Suuuuure. Does NASA hire a drilling team to join astronauts and train them in a week? Yes, right. Does someone bring a weapon on the space shuttle? Yes it is real. And Bruce Willis explodes an asteroid three seconds before the end. Like Disney Esk! <br /> <br /> How bad is this movie? I was rooting for the asteroid!
