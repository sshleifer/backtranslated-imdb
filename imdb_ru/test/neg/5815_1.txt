I saw this movie when it came out. Let me now see - this guy who previously skied down Mount Fuji, managed to accumulate funding and hire staff to document what sounds on the surface like a bold and audacious act - to go down to the highest peak in the world. Good - and SPOILER COMES HERE - what happens, you know, after a large team of people can help him climb to the top - and life is lost in the deal - he gets on his skis, manages to do it in a very, very short way, when his parachute opens ... and all. And instead of recording the footage to hide this strikingly anti-climate final before the embarrassing defeat, the guy goes further and releases it. THE END OF SPOILER I admire the amazing courage and effort that the film crew may have needed to get some of the amazing pictures they got. ANOTHER SPOILER - Oh yes, one of the Sherpas dies, falling into a crack. The narrator, who quotes the “daredevil skier”, casually notes that, according to the religion of the Sherpas, since this man’s body cannot be restored, his soul will wander around the world forever and will never know peace. Is it worth it, the narrator is pondering. YES he answers - because it was the fact that this clown "was skiing on Everest". I don't remember ever seeing a more vile piece of celluloid. This is the one that should be missed at all costs.
