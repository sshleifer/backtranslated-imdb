This film is different in that it is the worst movie I've ever seen, and the only movie I've ever done 1 out of 10 on imdb. I was fooled to rent it because of the cool cover of H.R. Giger on the box. This cover is the only thing that is more or less good in this steaming pile ... <br /> <br /> It was about the boys fighting "freaks" in a strange, but no less interesting post-apocalyptic world where cities are in ruins / chaos, but obviously, the suburb is still a safe and wonderful place for young people to turn other people into organizations fighting the dead. The most boring performances with boring characters, not such special effects, boring, not original decorations and simply extremely low quality in all aspects of production make this lemon the most loser on my list. <br /> <br /> FINAL RATING: 1/10 I would like to give him zero. <br /> <br /> noob aalox
