A 1974 Orson Welles documentary film F for Fake explores deception and fraud, mainly focusing on two men who themselves were exposed as fraudsters. Clifford Irving is a biographer who allegedly wrote fraudulent autobiography of Howard Hughes, but at least he talks about his innocence. Another main subject of the film is the artist Elmir de Gori, a man who has been painting fakes of famous masterpieces all his life, sometimes selling them to museums as real works of original artists. Among these stories are scattered fragments in which Wells does magic tricks to illustrate moments, etc., and he also takes into account the fact that his career began as a fraud when he first lied in his resume and then created a radio sensation with " War of the Worlds. ". <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this film and find it deep, since I’m such a faithful Wells, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. Part of the problem was that it was not just non-linear, but completely dispersed. Although I appreciate the stylish editing and quick transitions and scaling, especially when used in an unusual format, such as a documentary, there was too much of it in F for Fake. They created a distraction unlike the credit style. was more comprehensible and comprehensive i think that Editing would probably not be so annoying. The scattered narration became even more unpleasant due to the fact that these were really interesting subjects, especially Elmir de Gori. works, and if the works are not authentic, what does this say about those who admire the works in museums? This is one documentary film that I would say to at least take a picture, but don’t be afraid to turn it off if you don’t like it. This is by far the most messy documentary I've ever seen; it is a cross between a documentary, a feature film and an experimental film, none of which are properly presented or isolated. I have no lesser opinion about Wells after I saw him, but, of course, in my opinion, he does not stand out as a luminous pattern in his work. 4/10 - Shelley
