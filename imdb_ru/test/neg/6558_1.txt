Welcome to Plan 9 from the Star Trek movie space. Come on, trekkers, admit it. This film is so bad, so incredibly inept in every department, that it has become something of a classic. <br /> <br /> “Shat” is the worst celluloid ever made. Hi, Bones "Brilliant!" This is not just Ham - these are several large Kentucky pig farms! <br /> <br /> “Special Effects”. Must be done in accordance with the trade description of the act to use such a term. An enterprise is a moving piece of cardboard in this film. Indeed! Even the Star Trek TV show turned out better. <br /> <br /> Bones, Spock and Shat are singing! Yes, Spock sings Row Row Row Your Boat. After the struggle for the meaning of words !!!! "Captain. Life is not a dream. ”Poor Leonard Nimoy, he really wants to strangle Shatner for it. Didn't Shat give us his performance of “Mr. Tambourine” or not coordinate it with Nimoy in the ballad Bilbo Baggins? Very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery-like plays Spock's half-brother. Only because they could not get Sean Connery! Uhura performs a fan dance! It would be sexy in 1966. In 1989, this is similar to how your drunken grandmother is embarrassed at a Christmas party. <br /> <br /> Catwoman jumps on the back of Shatner! Shat turns it several times, like a WWF wrestler, and throws it away. Yayy The Shat! Connery 2.0 seems to have been a bit of a Vulcan rebel. This explains why Spock had not previously mentioned him in 79 TV shows and 4 films. McCoy, apparently mercifully - killed his father, but after that they found a cure. Tell me this is not hysterically funny. <br /> <br /> The 11-deck Enterprise has unexpectedly been gaining another 400 decks to escape in the elevator shaft. Spock's antigravity boots perfectly support Bones and The Shat. You should also use them on humpback whales in Star Trek IV! Shatner meets God! Or what is meant by God, but I suppose that this is really some kind of alien creature. God is a little like Charlton Heston in The Ten Commandments. Sean Connery 2nd calls on God to share his pain and quickly dies. Or something. God punishes Shat for doubting his personality. So Spock kills God with a photon torpedo. I would very much like to know what Jehovah's Witnesses made from this scene. <br /> <br /> “Damn” who killed God quickly returns to his song with Spock and Bones. Overall now, Row Row Row Your Boat .....
