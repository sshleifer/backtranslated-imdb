I was looking forward to this movie. I like travel thrillers. I like sex, drugs, young people, action and a great sound track. And it was especially interesting for me to go to the cinema in Europe to find out if I recognized any of my own travel places. <br /> <br /> However, from the first scene this film was not available. What was Guy doing driving on the other side of the road? What could have blown up a van that was rolling gracefully down the gentle slope of grass? If they are such bad drivers, why should they take work? And this is only the first scene! Not even bad enough to be polite or stupid. Just awful! Terrible! Terrible! Waste of time. Go on to something ... something else!
