One of the reviewers talks about those who may not like this film, “only those who are tired of the film, which is tired of entertainment, will appreciate it”. This, I feel, is rather unfair to those of us who are bored. <br /> <br /> I was not tired or disappointed in films or directors, but I found this tedious and indulgent. But then, it is true, I am not too keen on deep meaning. I feel that this can make a big difference for those in the know, you know. <br /> <br /> This is very slow, and he spends a lot of time trying to isolate his individual points, using images, really, to do so. But on such days as these, it seems possible that a film like this could be the type of thing you encounter in one of these dark and frightening tents in modern art galleries, rather than on the screen of a popular cinema. ,
