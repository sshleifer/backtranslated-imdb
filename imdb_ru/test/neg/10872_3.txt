I had a more boring 80 minutes in my life, but none of them occur to me right now. "Hell's Ride" is based on the theme of the retro cult of the 70s, which Tarantino returned and did correctly in films such as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The problem with Hell Ride is that, unlike PF and RD, the story is rubbish and character development. How many films does Bishop think he can steal? Portfolio in “Pulp Fiction”, an air pistol in “No Country”, etc. And so on. Speaking of Bishop, what the hell is he doing when filming this film? I could not help but laugh at those scenes where he stands with a trusted pelvis, desperately trying to seem like a seasoned biker. Nothing in this film is believable. Why Dennis Hopper? Do they really need an Easy Rider tune too? I blame Larry Bishop for his terrible conspiracy and dialogue, not to mention his failed attempt to play a leading role. Do not worry about watching this movie, it is a waste of time.
