I can not believe that I was sitting through this garbage. Palm trees in DC (already mentioned), stuffed like a dead body, so obviously artificial that I thought it MUST be a stuffed ... until it left a bloody ... unnatural dialogue, a ridiculous plot. I think it's a shame that Jill Ireland's latest movie before her death was so nasty. Do not waste your time - I would not want that. The only salvation is that he was on the cable, so I did not spend my money on everything.
