This is a pale imitation of "officer and gentleman." There is no chemistry between Kutcher and an unknown woman who plays his love interest. The dialogue is wooden, situations are beaten. This is too long, and the climax is anti-climatic (!). I love USCG, its men and women are fearless and tough. The fighting scenes are awesome, but I'm afraid this film does little for recruiting. The script is sample but confusing. Is Kutcher's character trying to redeem himself for an accident that was not his mistake? Costner is raging against the death of light, but why? His “conflict” with his wife is as deep as a muddy puddle. I saw this preview for free and, of course, I felt I had received my money's worth.
