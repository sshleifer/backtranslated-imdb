I saw this movie right in the middle when I was experiencing a break. It was about 3 in the morning, and I quickly struggled with insomnia. It wasn’t so bad at the time, but every time I tried to watch it since then, I couldn’t understand it the way I did it that night. <br /> <br /> At that time, I thought it was cute and I liked the variety of characters, although in my opinion they could be better than Goran V. But the only thing that made me watch was character Heather and her sad “commitment” to her husband, who no longer wanted her, which made me feel sorry for her and cheer for her at the same time. (Considering that I was in a similar situation at that time, perhaps that is why I liked it so much.) A good movie, but you most likely need to be close to the character in a romantic relationship in order to appreciate it, and let's hope that you never are.
