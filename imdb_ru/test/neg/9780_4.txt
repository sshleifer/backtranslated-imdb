This is another alien imitation, but not very good. Replace outer space with the South African desert, add the same ingredients, a group of people in unfavorable terrain, hunt them down with an alien creature and get the same old story of a very ordinary movie trying to ape a classic movie. A group of miners and scientists go hunting for a few missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert, cleared of flesh. Their vehicle breaks down and they head for civilization, pursued by the monster. The African location is pretty pretty, but this is basically all that this film has for it. There is a futile attempt to create tension, but I found that it did not work, and the film became quite boring. The creature did not appear much, and when this happened, it really did not evoke a sense of horror. one scene where someone tears the flesh from his hand, but mostly it was on the blood front. In conclusion, I found this film as exciting as watching the paint dry. I give this film 4/10, and this is only because of an interesting place, which alone is not enough to save this film from full replay.
