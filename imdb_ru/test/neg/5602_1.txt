DeCoteau has to be one of the worst "directors" working today in any genre, and it has nothing to do with his films, usually containing homoeroticism and forcing guys to run in their respective boxer underpants. Remember ... anyone in tight black underwear is satanic and evil and wants to suck out your blood / soul ... such deep symbolism is here). I just sat in "Sisterhood" to give him honest shocking things, I try to see all the horror films I can, and this was Barbara (FROM THEIR, REIMATOR), which was Crampton (I was previously dragged into the world of DeKoto) . Thanks to Linni Quigley, Adrienne Barbo and a few other actresses that I like). <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about the Sisterhood ... As another reviewer noted, the intended plot includes lesbian vampires on campus. But there has never been a parade of hot young kids (“actresses”, if you will) running around dressed in bras, panties and bikinis, so boring. There is no plot, blood, nudity in the film, and the dialogue is ridiculous, and it seems that they came up with it as soon as they advanced. Details are put in slow mode and repeated many times to increase the work time. About ten minutes of this film is made up of characters just walking around campus (oh, the excitement!), Who look more like a hotel resort than any college I've ever been to. And acting is the absolute worst. The only thing these girls do well is leaning forward and leaning to show their body. The actors were so devoid of talent that I would be shocked to see that one of them would get a one-day role in the film Passion in the future. Same for guys. Yes, DeCoteau squeezed even more hot guys in underwear and in this ... Guys who should be in some K-Mart brochure, and not try to act. Do these people actually have to audition or just appear in Dave's office and take off their clothes? I think the answer is obvious. <br /> <br /> I’m ready to give any film a chance, if 1.) it is well written, well directed, original and well acted (or, damn it, even ambitious and stylish) .. Or 2.) it’s filled with blood , nudity, all sorts of crap and / or unintentionally ridiculous. David DeKoto's films do NOT give ANY of this, and they do it on better-than-normal production figures for live video clips. What a waste! So what is the appeal, especially with the advent of porn on the program-malicious variety, which is easily accessible for those with a computer? I just can not answer this question. <br /> <br /> DeCoteau is a gay horror director, and he could use his resources to make the genre unique. Instead, he produces heartbreaking nonsense without ounces of talent or intelligence shining through it. Ironically, when you think about it, his films are something, BUT prog. They actually make homosexuality seem wretched, secretive and sinister. Obviously, funny characters in his films always try to corrupt, seduce, and / or kill innocent, sexually entangled characters. There is no shading to make things interesting. The main characters are naive and rarely find themselves strong, self-confident or self-confident. I would understand this conspiracy if Jerry Falwell, Fred Phelps or Dr. Laura start making horror films right on the video, but from a gay director, this simply means that he hardly thinks about these cheese festivals.
