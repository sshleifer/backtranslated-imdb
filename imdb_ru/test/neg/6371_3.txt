I am a teacher of literature in fifth grade, and after we read this book (which the students loved), we watched a movie. They laughed out loud! Unfortunately, this is NOT a comedy! The game was so terrible that I felt that I was watching how a bunch of children in the neighborhood put on a show. My students imitated the lines and ridiculed from time to time. I have to agree with them, sometimes it was pretty bad. However, I would like to show this to students again, just for fun, and compare the film with the book. After that, we made a Venn diagram (the teachers know what it is) to show what was the same in both and what the differences were, so it has educational value to show it. I noticed that another adaptation is being removed in 2005, so we can only hope that the game will be better!
