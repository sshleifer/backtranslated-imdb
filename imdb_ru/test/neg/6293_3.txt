1st review 1/1/2003 - 3 out of 10 (Deer-Henri Verneuil): a sober drama about a wealthy Doctor, who has problems in relations with a young woman with whom his family wants to live them, as well as in marriage with another same house. His search for happiness is not clear, but they are pretty good at identifying the cause of his misfortune, demonstrating the power line of women in the line of his wife. Well played, but predictable drama.
