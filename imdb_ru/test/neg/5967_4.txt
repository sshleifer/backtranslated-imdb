I saw the film in the original Italian. It must be said that the action and interpretation are most heavily polluted by the television-generated tendency to speak in a strictly muffled voice, without moving lips, straining tones, as appeared in the works “This is real life” and “Let's raise” Our audience with a few tears over other characters for intensity, clarity of expression and intellectual honesty. The film has some useful hints, but (as in another previous comment) it has no focus, and it loses its meaning in many plots of lesser and lesser importance - another tendency leaked from television productions well known to Italians. A few drops in style could be spared for the public, such as pastries (Charm and aesthetics of cooking, sensual usefulness of sweets, see Chocolate, Babette’s dinner, Vatel, etc.). Hammam and Fairies are definitely more truthful. Ozpetek recognized the melody of Italy in the early 2000s and sings ... I will give him one last chance, though ...
