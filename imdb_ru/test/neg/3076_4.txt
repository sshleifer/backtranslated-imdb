What an uninteresting mess. It could have been more than that, but no imagination seemed to go into the script or guide. A man was set up for the murder by his wife and her lover. The conspirators are doing a pretty thorough job to make him look guilty. But the man (Richard Thomas), whose psychiatric records show him as “stable” and “unimaginative”, manages to escape from prison, beat him to the conspirator’s beach house and secretly record a conversation between them in which they reveal their guilt. Then he accidentally dropped the tape recorder with all the evidence on it in sea water, but managed to pick it up. He shows a hell of a lot of creative and improvisational skills for an unimaginable guy if you ask me. <br /> <br /> The tape is now damaged, but this is enough to break his wife's lover, and he sobs a confession. Bad people are punished. Good people saved. <br /> <br /> The location is impressive. The beach house is nothing more than a wooden facade built on the territory of the Fort Fisher battlefield on the Cape Fear peninsula. The house was demolished immediately after the end of production. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful place. Unfortunately, this is a bit difficult to see, because someone seems to be shooting every scene through the tights strung over the camera lens. This is all very vague. And with all the natural magnificence of the location, the viewer will never get a real sense of place, what feels like sand, textures of gray bark on low-growing evergreens. <br /> <br /> The game is in order, but there is nothing much to do with the performers. The best performance, as is often the case, gives Dick Olsen as a mean, but not unprincipled, defender. Virginia Madsen exudes infidelity with every blow of her eyelashes. Ted McGinley is within reach of the amoral weakling. <br /> <br /> The musical score neatly combines the sinister and the mysterious and effective. If you want to hear the original from which it was ripped off, hire Hitchcock's "Dizziness" and listen to Bernard Hermann's disturbing theme. <br /> <br /> I can’t think of any particular reason to catch this, besides total boredom.
