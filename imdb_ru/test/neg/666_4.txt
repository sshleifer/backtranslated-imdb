The first official release of the cinema division of World Wrestling Entertainment is a fairly simple horror movie / slasher called “See No Evil” with Kane in the lead role, one of their famous fighters, known for his frightening presence, hard blows and one of the most intricate backstories in the fight. And let's not strike here; Although this film is advertised as the greatest horror film of all time (mostly WWE), it goes without saying that after watching this movie I can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all time. <br /> <br /> “I see no evil” sees a group of juvenile offenders sent to a hotel so that they can restore order. Of course, the monstrous killer (played by Kane) also lives in this hotel, and we all know what this will lead to. Without giving away too much of the plot, this film has all the similarity and structure of a slasher click of the early 1980s, with the majority of untouched cliches, but without any panic that those films accompany. And this is the main problem with "See No Evil". He tries so many tricks, hinted at by his predecessors in the genre, that it seems predictable; old horror fans will easily recognize some tricks ahead of time, and even those who have seen only a few clicks have to say what happens next. This is too general to be scary. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the film is terrible, but only for effect. The gloomy atmosphere inherent in the film initially creates a feeling of horror, but when you approach the end, for some reason, it feels out of place and quickly becomes tedious. Death scenes do not seem so terrible and terrible as ridiculous, although some of them are quite creative. <br /> <br /> And in this film, the actors are also pretty bad, as the main characters are not sufficiently developed for us to take care of when they will be eventually fired. Some cannot even portray fear properly; they just scream and cry in a vain pursuit of emotions. Therefore, when they die, it only adds to the comedy, because you do not care so much about them that you simply consider them the equivalent of the red shirts of a star fleet to the monster Kane. <br /> <br /> As for Kane, he simply portrays his character in the film just as he portrays his wrestling character, only he uses axes and hooks instead of hell and sulfur. I have no doubt that Kane can be an excellent device in the horror genre. He has an appearance and presence for it; he just needs better quality material (in particular, a script that is not written by someone who writes a wrestling show) to work with him. <br /> <br /> Now, despite the fact that it may seem like a harsh review, I really liked the movie. This is one of those ridiculously bad films in which you can't not sit and enjoy. Again, my main claim to the film is that this is just an exercise in shooting bloody murders, in which there are no frightening or shocking moments. I liked it, but I liked it, because it was easy for me to laugh at some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the film. If this happens because it should have been like this, the film would have been rated higher. But it is not. He got a laugh, because it is a B-film, and it does not help that the director’s previous experience was porn movies and music videos; not too complicated things to direct anyway. However, I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> If you don’t mind a funny B-movie or a horror movie, I highly recommend “See No Evil.” If you are a real enthusiast of the genre, I will wait until the DVD comes out before checking it out. Everyone else should probably go and see something else.
