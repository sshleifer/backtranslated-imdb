Tom Cutler (Jackson) is a retired policeman who now works as a crime scene cleaner. At his last job, he removes a new crime scene and destroys evidence and does not know that the crime was not officially reported. Oh, that can't be good. <br /> <br /> You always hear about the Cleaners, but usually when it comes to hitting a crowd or a gangster, when you need to remove bodies, etc. This one is different in that Tom Cutler works with the police after the police investigated the crime scene. Hey, someone has to do this. You know the police will not. The film clearly shows this, and it's up to the family to clean up the area. <br /> <br /> This is almost a good thriller, but the side story with the participation of his daughter Tom (Palmer) makes this story somewhat awkward. I guess they should have filled out some time. Oh, they brought this side conspiracy to connect with another conspiracy, but it was still reachable and uncomfortable. Do you see? <br /> <br /> It was almost a good thriller, because there was a noticeable lack of tension, tension, and the tempo was somewhat slow. Music also did not help, as I noticed that music is more suitable for observing people who are going on a long journey. Do you know music travel Take? HA! <br /> <br /> In this almost good thriller, everything was great. <br /> <br /> Violence: yes, sex: no, nudity: no, language: no
