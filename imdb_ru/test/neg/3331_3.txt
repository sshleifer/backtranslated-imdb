This extremely low-budget monster film centers around a group of surveyors exploring an abandoned gold mine to find out if it should be rediscovered. They fall into the trap after the cave and discover that they are in the grip of a strange, slimy creature who seems to be trying to knock them down one by one. The word that most came to mind when I watched this movie was “desperate.” The script and the action are terrible, the effects of the stop motion monsters were unintentionally funny, and since most of the film takes place under underground lighting, the sets looked convincingly like a logistic nightmare. However, all this, for some reason, it seemed that this film failed not because of lack of effort, but because of lack of budget, experience and / or lack of creative inspiration. Everything turned out as if it was either a college project, or the first film made by amateurs; I have a certain affection for such films, even when they do not completely hit the target. I guess I say that I give him B for the effort and D for the actual results, not so bad as some of the low-budget monster films I’ve seen, but still don’t look if you’re not free time on your hands. I vote for 4.
