If you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece, it is not. If you are looking for one of those horrible films that are so terrible that they are really good, then this may be for you. There are so many unintended laughter in this film that it can almost be considered a comedy. Let's start with introductory headlines that say "Jack-O", and then add the word "Lantern", as if the viewer could not understand that the film about the pumpkin is a giant pumpkin shown on both covers. and in the initial scene of the film. After that, the film goes in 20 different directions, none of which makes much sense. Jack is about everywhere, he's in people's homes, in the forest, and yet he never seems to do anything. He does commit several killings, but the long preparation for these killings was so bad and built up that you almost wanted Jack-o to take off your anger at the viewer. In addition, the plot consists of bad acting, unreasonable nudity and a ridiculous storyline. Acting in this film is one of the worst I've ever seen in my 35-odd years of watching movies. The boy who plays the main role in the film (the son of the director) has as much emotion as the corpse, and almost all the other actors / actresses are just as bad for many reasons (especially a stupid lady with big eyes) than saucer. But, having said all this, if you accept it for what it is (it's a bunch of dung), then you will get some laughter from this movie. What seemed amusing to me was the fact that the creators of the DVD found it expedient to release the “10th anniversary” of this film (as if the original was not good enough). And someone actually had the idea to make a backstage mini-film that was also included on the 10th anniversary of the publication (I'm not sure why) ....... I will give these 3 broken pumpkins out of 10 ...
