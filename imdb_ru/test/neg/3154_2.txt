Well, when I was little (I mean 2 or 3, not 6 and 7), Barney was one of my favorite shows. Then I grew out of it and threw out all my old Barney records. So, one day, when I switch channels, I see that Barney is now in the galley, and I thought, “Aha, is this the right show?” When I realized that this was so, I got scared. Why did they change the show setting from school to CABOOSE? Since then the show has been absolutely terrible, and the only reason I give him 2 is a) because I'm good, b) because of Riff and c) because in old times the show was tolerable. Now I just hate it. HATE. <br /> <br /> 2/10
