Am I the only person who believes that the entire community of criminologists and criminologists in the United States should hate this all-powerful slap in the face. The police rookie is the first at the crime scene, where her backup copy responds so slowly that she has time to send the child who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera. By the time he returns (there are still no senior policemen, SOCO or other help for beautiful Jolie - this is New York, isn't it?), It rained, and she starts to work, photographing evidence, only after she stood in front of Amtrak so that he did not interfere with the scene. <br /> <br /> I want to know the name of this camera, since the photos were so incredibly detailed that no magnification distorted the images !! The horror continues: - not in the movie itself (I'm afraid, quite ordinary), but in the character of Lincoln Rhyme, played by Mr. Washington. This person is a dedicated forensic scene expert with many years of experience, who instead of highly qualified but invisible local crime scene experts entrusts the work to an unprepared cop, a recruit cop who starts to search for obvious evidence and move them before taking photos. by contaminating each item and making DNA profiling virtually impossible. Now it was a brilliant idea, eh? I know that it is possible to suspend disbelief to some extent, but those who consider this film clever must completely turn off their ability to think in order to find this film believable. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 4/10 for Denzel Washington's great game and for the lips of Miss Jolie, which are the only items that require the suspension of my disbelief!
