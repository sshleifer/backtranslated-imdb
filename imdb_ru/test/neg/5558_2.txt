Of course, all this nonsense suggests the question: “Does the genre need the same reference film as in the youthful comedy, yet another parody film?” for teenagers "really has nothing clever nor incredibly unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The plot, essentially based on the teenager’s fabulous film “She's All That,” follows a shaky line between parody and reverence (“John Hughes High School”). Everything from 'American Beauty' to 'Varsity Blues' is mined for references. The result is the unsatisfactory experience of the viewer. The disadvantage of providing us with an exact copy of the plot “It is everything” is that we still know where it goes. And if we had not done this, then the jokes would have been meaningless. <br /> <br /> There is very little to recommend. The scene of fraud (erupting toilet) here seems completely out of place among all the references to "well-being". There are moments of humor - the song is quite funny, and the strange good line is to send viewers. Stinks, don't look.
