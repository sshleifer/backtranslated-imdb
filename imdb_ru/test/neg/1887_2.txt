I watched this movie in childhood and thought it was terrible. Now that I’m older, I’ve found it to be just as awful. Universal could do better than this. They simply decided to earn as much money as possible, using all their monsters at the same time. For me it was a cheap shot. These characters were able to sustain their own films, and the choice of actors was deplorable. Dracula was supposed to be White Lugosi, Frankenstein, the monster was to be Karloff. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this was a dismal sequel to Disney, made several decades ago, and was not appreciated. Umiversal started with something great and original, and then thought that they could indulge the masses with sloka, which is especially obvious in this film.
