This movie is not worth watching, at least in the cinema. The story is difficult to understand and understand (it starts with 10 minutes of something that happened 3 years ago). It is difficult to understand whether this film is trying to become a comedy or is it so bad / strange that sometimes it seems to be so. American sirens and lights on Swedish police cars are just one example. The game of Persbrandt and Bergkvist, as usual, is good, but I think that Jenny Lamp plays very badly in the role of Jasmine. Zara Zetterqvist behaves well, she has not been seen in Swedish films as an actor for a long time. If you still want to see it, wait until it is released on DVD or appears on TV.
