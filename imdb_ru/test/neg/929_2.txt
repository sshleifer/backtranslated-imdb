Is it an FMV game or a movie? Honestly, I watched it from "choice without choice." This is a very big waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> It seems that HK films are moving in the opposite direction to the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Try to put more effort and money into production and make us want to look, not what you want us to watch. <br /> <br /> The graphics are so terrible that they looked like some of the low-resolution games of the beginning and mid-90s compared to today’s) <br /> <br /> The way they made this film is almost the same as in the game “Wing Commander” of the 90s, namely in the third edition of the series. Stop regressing and make us Asian look so bad compared to the big guns in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Of course! They have big budgets and the best actors. But we have some of the oldest stories, myths and legends, the best technophiles, and perhaps the largest base of computer graphics talent in the world! So what went wrong? Did you start using the same old companies that worked with you for so many films ?! Please stop wasting our time and money. This is the reason why HK films are rapidly going down. Didn't you say that you are Hollywood of the East? I think no.
