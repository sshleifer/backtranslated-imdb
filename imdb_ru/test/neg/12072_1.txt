Well, I think I finally saw my last Woody Allen movie! I read a review in a newspaper and went to see this movie, expecting to get a good Woody Allen experience (as I have already done many times in the past). Well, that was not the case. This film has nothing to offer. Even with the wonderful game of talented Sean Penn - this film failed. One of the features of his other films is several characters - a variety, witty dialogue. This film basically consisted of only one character - very one-dimensional. There was almost no laughter. It probably looked good on paper! I think that the only thing that was special was the performance of Samantha Morton. Now I will look for her films in the future. So in conclusion, this film was a big disappointment. >
