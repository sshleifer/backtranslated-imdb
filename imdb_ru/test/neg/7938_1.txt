I'm a big fan of the original Assault On Precinct 13. The ice cream scene haunts me to this day. I am now 33 years old, and I still remember how I was terrified as a child. When I heard that they were reworking it, I thought that it might be good, but when I saw the movie, it is not 100% the same movie. This is not a remake. This is a bad stolen idea. It was completely destroyed. Cast: Maria Bello, Lawrence Fishburne, Ethan Hawke, Gabriel Bourne, John Leguizamo and Drea De Matteo are great actors, but even they could not save this film. It was just wrong. Even the situation was completely opposite. And how the hell did no one in this city notice that there was a war in the neighborhood? Why did not help appear earlier? Stupid. It makes no sense.
