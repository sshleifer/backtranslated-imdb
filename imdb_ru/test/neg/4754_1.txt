A review on the main page admits that the movie is terrible, but you have to forgive it, because it is very cruel. No, you should not. There are spoilers at the end of this review, but how can I “spoil” this rotten film, I have no idea. Even if you're an Alien / Pred fan, it's like I'm waiting for a DVD. It is also not worth 3.99 rentals, but you will be much less inclined to really hate this film if you pay more than $ 12 or more per person, as well as preferential purchases in the theater. <br /> <br /> In the theater I watched AVPr there were exactly two laughs, both from the girl sitting next to me. Besides that, there was complete silence everywhere. No ohhh, or “it was a bad ass!”, Nothing. Imagine that you are a patient on an operating table and are simply receiving anesthesia. Now you know how you feel in the theater after the AVPr opening scene. <br /> <br /> What was the budget of this film? Like the War of the Worlds, MI 3 and other e / x-driven films, the director seems to be much more involved in what CGI people can come up with than developing characters or a plot. Spielberg tried and failed several times, usually with Tom Cruise. Of course, films make money, but should they? In the “Report on the War of Worlds and Minorities” there was a budget to pay for a decent script, Tom Cruise et al., And also SS himself, but they were still terrible. I’m sure AVP spent 90% of its budget on CG, and he had no choice but to hire any actor who would say yes, even if the casting agent would do better if he went to the supermarket and chose actors at random. <br /> <br /> There is no tension in any scene, so we are never surprised. Who cares who will be killed? We didn't know any of them, we all know what happens when aliens leave the body, we all know that blood is acid. In Alien, Aliens, 3, Resurrection and even AVP directors use the fact that Aliens can think, can hide and can set traps. This director decided that Ridley Scott, James Cameron and others were idiots to develop the characters that you really want to see live or kill. In this edition you never care who lives or dies: a child, a parent, a pregnant woman. In this film, the characters serve only one purpose - to die. The opening scenes establish the fact that the film will be a predictable joke. Character development scenes mix clichés, bad humor and bad play and stun the viewer to such an extent that we don’t really care if they are killed while they die in ways previously unknown. But they do not. The director tried to do something different from those who preceded him in the “Alien” franchise, but succeeded only in discarding the good parts of the first films, human characters, and stealing everything else from other recent sci-fi films. <br /> There is no original use of Alien or Pred characters. Preda has almost no problems with killing a dozen aliens, although the last film made us believe that it had pretended to strangers as such a mortal enemy that they used the killing of one of them as a “Rite of passage”. AlienPred never developed as a formidable creature. His ability to inject parasites into the host is extracted from several different films, the last of which was probably Hellboy, where Samiel’s dissected tongue squirted eggs into Hellboy or Doom, where mutated creatures left their tongues after piercing the victim's throat. <br /> Simply put, we have no reason to care about anything in this film. There is violence, but it is not shocking and not surprising, and nothing that could not be seen in any of the hundreds of blows. CG is fine, and both kinds of aliens make you look and move, like in previous films. But since the characters never evolve, and the game is so bad, we hope that they all die. The little girl was probably the best actor in the group, but unfortunately we didn’t care whether children, women or anyone else were living or dying. We just want the movie to end. In the end, this happens, but not before a nuclear target from Resident Evil 2 is stolen from another stolen storyline, which Gunnison can destroy with the "infection." And not before the next stupid scene, which should open the door for further sequels, but is this true? In a film filled with bad scenes, the worst may have been saved last. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the repetition, but everything repeats: bad script, no plot, unoriginal fighting scenes, not inspired leadership, terrible action, worthy of the f / x that were wasted because of many flaws. <br /> <br /> I don’t mind going to an indie movie and being disappointed. Actors, directors and film crews probably start their careers and work with a limited budget. For a movie with this type of budget and cheating, I feel deceived along with disappointed. This film is a terribly boring waste of time from the initial scene to the closing credits. Sad to say that the Hellboy 2 preview was the best part of the AVPr, and the HB2 didn't even look that good.
