What else can I add? This is without a doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen. A terrible game, a dull scenario, a tiresomely slow pace - even visible microphones hang from the top of the screen. I could go on, but I really can't be bothered. I watched it for 90 minutes before the feeling of losing the will to live became too big for me. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the first set of comments and voices were from people associated with promoting this insult to British filmmaking. <br /> <br /> And, even worse, I had to buy “Mail” on Sunday to get it :-) Place in my collection Top 10 Worst Films Ever. <br /> <br /> Definitely to be avoided.
