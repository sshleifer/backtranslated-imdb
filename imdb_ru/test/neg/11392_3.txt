This strange little film begins with the story of Bruno (Alex Linz) in a Catholic school that has no friends and is beaten every day. He likes to wear dresses, and his fat mom, Angela, who works as a dressmaker, does not think that everything is in order with her son. Angela complains to her older mother (Kathy Bates), but she is ignored, and when they return to their car, they are followed by other children and they throw eggs. Father Bruno Dino (Gary Sinise) is divorced from Angela and has an aversion to his son and practically renounced him. Bruno meets a new student at a school named Shavnikva (Kami Davael), who is free to spirit and dresses like Annie Oakley with a gun. Angela has a heart attack and Grandmother Bruno intervenes to take care of him when Dino refuses. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a very hard and impartial look at all the involved characters. Angela has a lot in common with Bruno, who wears dresses, as she practically encourages him. Dino told him when he was a little boy that he was a woman because he loved opera, and now he refuses to help Bruno when he needs it. The Catholic school where Bruno is studying is very unmanageable, and all the children run wildly and even call Shavnikva the word "N". As soon as Shirley MacLaine enters the film, he becomes more family-oriented (so to speak). **** SPOILER WARNING **** The ending of the bee after the spelling bee is incredibly contrived and "I feel good." Bruno's hugs and greetings as reporters follow him and take pictures of him. All this time, Shirley MacLaine behaves like a “cool old woman” who snaps at everyone. There is one thing about the McLane character in the film that no one mentioned in these comments, and this is due to her male character. I think the Helen character might be a lesbian! She is very strong and strong, and at some point in the film she shares a glass of whiskey with Bruno and simultaneously smokes a cigar. I don't remember anyone in the film mentioning who her husband was or whether she was married at all! That's why I think her character could be gay. In the film, there are many other good actors. Joey Lauren Adams, Jennifer Tilly, Brett Butler, Gwen Verdon and Leini Kazan had an even better look at the script before signing. I think when they heard that MacLaine was in charge, it would be an honor to be part of that. It is very difficult to feel any remorse or understanding towards any of the characters, and the subject is probably impossible for most. The actors are not bad, but what exactly did Maclaine aspire to? Tolerance for a young guy who wants to wear dresses and freedom of expression? We get it in the first 10 minutes, the rest of the time I tried not to cringe.
