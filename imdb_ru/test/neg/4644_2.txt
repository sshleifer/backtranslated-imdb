It’s true that making a bad movie takes a lot of effort, and this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> I don’t like the Yankees, but their surprisingly simplistic view of the world and their ability to reduce everything for black and white, as well as to ensure that events (even fictional in novels) fit into the agenda It is related to the complexity of any kind, causes extreme irritation. <br /> <br /> Wilbur Smith is descriptively verbose but weaves intricate tales that deserve more than was obtained as a result of this terrible confusion in the film. <br /> <br /> Very sad for those who never read Smith. They will remain less decent image of his Egyptian series, which, I must say, is gigantic in its exposure. <br /> <br /> Indiana Jones films were instant. Attempting to repeat this by manipulating Smith’s novels in this performance misses the mile of the country. <br /> <br /> Pathetic, except for photography and art of Malik.
