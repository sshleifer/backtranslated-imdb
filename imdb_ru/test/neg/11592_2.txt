If you are looking for a film that is interesting to watch simply because you can make a joke about a not very good game, stupid "special effects" and a typical science fiction plot ... then this movie is for you! Not in the acting game was bad, in fact, several actors were actually quite decent. The special effects were not the best (to say the least); the animals looked completely computer animated. Annoyed by the scandal to hide the abuse, and throughout the film, only one song played again and again. In general, a good movie, if you are looking for something completely funny and fun to make fun of. Not a very good movie to watch if you are looking for something serious.
