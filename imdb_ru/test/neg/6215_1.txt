The alleged screenwriter and director Mr. Devan copied almost the entire blockbuster plot of the Hollywood film "HITCH" with Will Smith in the title role. Many scenes are also exactly the same. The plot was simply copied, some low-quality humor was added (probably Mr. Davanâ€™s own creation) and frequent dances in order to increase the time the film was shown in accordance with local standards. <br /> <br /> Although the actions of Salman Khan and Govinda gave us some smiles, it does not suit the legendary artists, such as them, to be part of plagiarism, especially when they continue to tell people to stop buying pirated discs !
