El Chupacabra is one of York Entertainment's latest disaster films, which makes the viewer want to die after spending two hours watching it. This film seems to have been shot using a backup video camera, usually used for birthday parties. The only reason I could say that this was not the case was due to certain scenes where the operator's shadow is in the frame. <br /> <br /> This film amazes almost every aspect of the movie, and Iâ€™m sure that it has dropped the film industry for another ten years. Actors are lagging behind the border and often stop waiting for the change of a key card behind the scenes. The actor who plays Navarro, not only does not speak the words and skips the words in his dialogue, but also stumbles upon the plot of Swiss cheese with a squinting and confused facial expression. Other actors break the fourth wall and generally demonstrate the acting skills of a twelve-year-old child performing a science project in his backyard. <br /> <br /> My friends and I are purposefully looking for the worst films, and this one has given us more than we expected. Humorous parts are not ridiculous, and the rest is permeated with horrible cliches and holes in the plot. As one of his friends modestly said, this film is the interrupted fruit of the industry. I highly recommend this film for people like me who are specifically looking for these films, but for everyone else, be careful!
