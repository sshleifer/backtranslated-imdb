Of course, this is a good small budget film, this “Gorilla Bride”, but nothing special, and not memorable enough to be counted among the significant sci-fi efforts of its time. Director Kurt Shiodmak was an outstanding screenwriter in the 1930s and 1940s and told stories about some classic genres (“I went with zombies”, “The Wolfman”), but as a director he clearly lacked the necessary competencies. "Gorilla's Bride" is similar to the aforementioned "Wolf Man" in its plot and atmosphere, but the film looks much more amateur and pathetic. Both relate to damned people who at night turn into large animals, but the title gorilla does not look half as threatening as a werewolf, even though the movie was released a full decade later. During the indecent opening speech, actor Lon Cheney tries to convince us that the jungle is an ominous place that hides many mysteries, but in fact there is no real mystery in the plot. This is just a certificate of the plantation manager, who is jealous of his senior colleague for having such a beautiful young wife, and he is killing him. A local woman witnesses his crime and casts a spell on Barney, which makes him turn into a terribly big gorilla at night ... Or maybe she just wants him to believe that he is becoming a horribly big gorilla? Lon Cheney himself plays for the police Commissioner accused of investigating the murder, while Raymond Barr (starring in about a thousand television films about Perry Mason) portrays a greedy plantation / night gorilla. Does Siodmak try to make the movie look like a supernatural thriller ?? Is this or is it all just happening in Barney's head? ?? fail, and it causes too much talk and too little jungle. Some of the settings of the jungle are well depicted, but the rest of the “special effects” are sticky and poorly made. However, the acting is pretty good, does Barbara Payton look beautiful and although very predictable ?? the story is strangely irresistible to the very end. A strange film, he probably cursed me to voodoo ??
