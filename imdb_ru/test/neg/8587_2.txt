This noisy, dizzying football film directed by Oliver Stone seems to have everything in the cast - well, everything except William H. Macy, who could play the role of Mr. Stone, the team doctors or “fruit pie” selling flakes. If you are a fan of expletives, there are some wonderful, profanity that you can try on two-faced friends and travelers amateurs. The film is sometimes good as a lively background party atmosphere, especially in the first two hours; it even has several music video scenes in the style of MTV. <br /> <br /> ** Any Sunday (12/16/99) Oliver Stone ~ Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid
