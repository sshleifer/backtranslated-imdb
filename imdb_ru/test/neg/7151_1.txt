Help, I went to hell movies! What a stupid movie! In fact, nothing good about it. <br /> <br /> Let's spit it out: <br /> <br /> 1) The story is incredibly contrived: a terrorist group against the EU pursues a group of guys who travel around Western Europe, carrying a delivery of transparent bags full of xtc tablets. And the worst thing: they take it seriously! <br /> <br /> 2) The level of acting should shame all the people involved. <br /> <br /> 3) Some one-eyed guy decided to allow everyone to speak English so that the international market would gain popularity. The ugliest advertisement! Clever French and Dutch make sense, but the result is laughable. <br /> <br /> 4) The soundtrack is completely inappropriate and poorly matched. <br /> <br /> 5) It is assumed that camera work, editing and effects should be in the style of post-noir. , but is hardly worth something and is not intended to accompany this story (read: anti-story). <br /> <br /> 6) Hidde Meuse. Hero Wildshut never ceases to convince. This actor. Normally, I would give an extra point just to be around. But no, I'm sorry, not this time, I just would not forgive myself ...
