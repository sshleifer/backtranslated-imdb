I was not impressed by the Graffiti Artist, despite his artistic (aka. Low budget improvisation) appeal. There is little dialogue, and, at least for me, I was disappointed that he did not give more recognition and did not promote the work of partisan artists such as these. Instead, it was a story that spans familiar territory. Two guys who mostly do a little more than mark buildings, become friends, tag partners and eventually experiment with relationships. They seem opposites, rather uncomfortable together. Little is explained about their origins and what happens between two young people at high speed (although I can understand this because it is only about 70 minutes). In recent years, an infinite number of similar plots and productions have appeared, and as a result, the sphere of independent cinema begins to be as saturated with this particular story as the mainstream is saturated with this and not only. <br /> <br /> Most of the film can tire the viewer, who needs direct dialogue and purpose. The main figure of this story (at least extensively) performs its routines with almost no dialogue, no understanding and nothing else to carry the viewer. And for a short film, I would like them to get to the point much faster. This, besides the typical plot, annoyed me. However, there was something about a brief look at the daily habits of at least two graffiti artists, even if most of them were fairly unoccupied. <br /> <br /> Recommended if you are tired of mainstream bullshit Keep in mind the indie picture and are interested in this underground, urban art form. But you really have to watch it yourself, because it seems like a more acquired taste. For later indie films focusing on graffiti artists, check out Transit.
