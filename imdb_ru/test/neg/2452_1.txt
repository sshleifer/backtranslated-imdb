When I think of television films, I always think of this film, I watched it several times in Sky Movies, it was awful. <br /> <br /> A lot of time has passed since I watched this movie, I just watched it, and came across it here: -S. <br /> <br /> A microbiologist (Linda Flemming) goes on vacation with her son (William Flemming) to this resort city where they meet. with Paul Johnson (taxi driver / owns a bar?) and Katie Johnson. <br /> <br /> William, as a strange romantic thing, begins to fall in love with Katie, and Paul - with Linda. <br /> <br /> Some guy loses consciousness in the street, he has a sign on his hand, Joseph (Joseph was a deep-sea diver who saw a light or something like that in some kind of diving and turned to religion), says that he will take care of this person, there is a gap in my memory, then the virus has spread widely, I think Linda offers her help to come up with a medicine, Katie becomes infected (William notices a mark on Katieâ€™s arm), virus, too, makes Joseph. <br /> <br /> Paul says a few lines to Joseph, then Joseph stumbles when the next time you see Joseph he is somehow healed, this information is used to treat the infected, then the beach party, the end.
