Enjoying the work of Neil Guyman (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in “Hunters for Dreams”) in the past, I thought that the Mirror Mask was probably very disappointed. The beginning, live action of the film section was intriguing enough. The relationship between the characters was believable and easy to empathize, and I liked the scenery, costumes and creativity of Helena. The subsequent computer scenes, however, were painful. The dialogue was awkward and pretentious, the interaction between live actors and terrifying CGI. The events took place for unknown reasons, and most of the events seemed redundant for any plot that could exist. I only watched the first twenty or thirty minutes of the film, so I’m not quite authoritative, but I strongly recommend that you don’t watch anything at all and stick to Guyman’s strong writing.
