PDQ Bach made it better. Most of the conversational part of “Bach” is letters written to various visitors with complaints about the amount and speed of payment. The diary of Anna Magdalena, mostly about the death of children and other family matters, is more fascinating. The music is confusing: 17th century orchestras and choirs the size of a 20th century concert hall. Overall production quality reminded me of a senior slide show. JS Bach was a brilliant man whose music speaks for itself. This movie adds nothing. Netflix sent me 2 discs that could not be played, so I watched the movie. Obviously, Netflix was trying to tell me something.
