This show, "Paranormal State", is similar to the "Project Blairwich". For example, you are watching a “documentary”, which is actually a script of a movie created to look and feel like a documentary. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem on the show is “contact outside consultants” by Warren, who became famous for his “investigations” of Amityville murders, who were shown to be completely fraudulent, only on the basis of police reports of death families! (for example, the eldest daughter was indeed involved in all of this, even perhaps helping some deaths!) Then there is the way they constantly jump, blaming the demons for everything. Not to mention how arrogant the group is about what they are doing. They do not want to help those who need it most, they just want the most strange cases that will attract the most press and attention to them. <br /> <br /> They are full of fraud, simple and understandable.
