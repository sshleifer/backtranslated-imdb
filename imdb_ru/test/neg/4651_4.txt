Definitely not a good movie, but nowhere is it as bad as some would have painted it. The Nightmare in Wax tells the story of a man whose face was disfigured in a typical flashback scene, he takes revenge on those who are directly and indirectly responsible for the loss in his life - first of all love and friendship with a beautiful young actress. Cameron Mitchell plays the artist with his typical talent, albeit limited. In fact, I thought he gave one of his best performances. What exactly does this mean? Mitchell wears an eye patch, endlessly smokes cigarettes, wears a motley tunic and talks to his creations in wax. These are not your usual wax mannequins, but people who are still living under the control of some serum, which causes them to lose control over all neurological functions. They become zombies in reality. I thought the premise here was inventive, if nothing else. It has some ridiculous explanation, but it serves the plot. This is a 60's film, of course, with Bad Townsend and the company’s psychedelic camera work. The game is mediocre, but Mitchell, Scott Brady and Barry Kröger make interesting twists and turns. The wax figures of the bygone Hollywood era were made very efficiently, and most of the filming was very reliable. The end of the film turns into something not entirely real - either another example of the cultural cinema of the 60s, or the end of the work of the screenwriter. I look forward to the latter. Despite numerous shortcomings, I liked the movie. The initial scene showing the actor who was being drank with a needle was actually made, as was the police chase on the embankment.
