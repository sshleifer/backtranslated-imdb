I signed up for IMDb.com just to comment on this movie. My God, what a hell of horse shit! It should not even be advertised as a real movie, it is very deceptive. This is a 15-year film project at best. The game is terrible. But even good actors could not save it. The dialogue is probably the worst part of this film. Who the hell wrote this shit? And this constant joke, coming from the plump lesbians that Kay is a “girl in need,” very quickly became outdated. God, I would prefer a camel to take a wet dump in your ear than to look at this shit again. Don't rent this movie. If they gave you a movie for free, don't watch it. smash it with a hammer. Even if you break this video, you lose a Hollywood video or a blockbuster, it's worth it. it's an abomination I guess I said everything I could about it without being superfluous. any questions .... email me.
