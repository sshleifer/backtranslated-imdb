Firstly, it has nothing to do with the much better Kung Fu weapon in the lead role with Gordon Liu. I mention this because my DVD play at the Kung Fu Theater on the cover shows a completely misleading picture, and on the back is the wrong story, and then (I donâ€™t know why) the Young Hero starring Huang Jang Lee. In addition to introducing the weapon-style narrated by a monk to some children during the discovery and the usual mysterious leadership, followed by all, into the history of 18, the weapon never appears again, and all fights are boxing. The hero is Li Shao Hwa, whom I have never heard of before, and other actors. The film mentions another director, U Yuen Lin, as well as one of the lists IMDb. Other actors are Wang Fu Quen, Wang Wing San, Chen Fei Fei, Wang Ki San, Suen King Kai and Hwa Yue Suen, who seem to have drowned without a trace after this film. Fights are reasonable and frequent, but not great, and the "star" does not have much charisma. The turn at the end is simply stupid, and the film seems to end suddenly, as if they are tired of it. Landscape and training sequences on the river are slightly different from the usual. Unfortunately, the pretty sister drowns a not very annoying (albeit acrobatic) boy.
