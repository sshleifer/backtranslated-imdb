Bad movie, but with one movie worth trying. For most of the movie, the jokes are bad, the songs are bad, even W.C. Fields are bad. Then there is one sequence with Bob Hope and his former movie; the dialogue is witty, and the song (version “Thank you for the memories”) is light, cynical and delightful. Who jumped with a parachute for this a bit? Yet this makes the whole thing worth the original admission of 25 cents.
