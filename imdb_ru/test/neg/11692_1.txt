Oh, how awful this movie is! I do not know, a horror film or a drama, because the plot and both genres are not very well established! The story does not move, it is slow, boring and sleepy from beginning to end. This film really bothered me! But I really liked the camera work, it is genuine, fresh and clear, the acting is also great, the little boy was a great performer in this film, but it did not make me jump from my seat. But this film makes me take a pillow, lie down on the bed and sleep until the credits roll over ... <br /> <br /> Boring! Not worth watching! I tell you, this movie sucks! <br /> <br /> 1/10
