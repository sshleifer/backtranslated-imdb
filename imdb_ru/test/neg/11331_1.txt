it's hard to distinguish between actors and non-actors. Bad American films can be seen by all young people pre-ordering each line of the dialogue with "Do you know what?" Bad Canadian films can be seen by all teens ending each separate line of the “A?” Dialogue. Have we not learned anything in a century of filmmaking? Wouldn't the whole weight of millions of scum going down Hollywood with scripts and videos in their hands save us from these horrible, bespoke television films?
