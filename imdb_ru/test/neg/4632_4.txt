History and experience over the past couple of decades have shown us that sex intellectuals are the most non-sexual and non-intellectual things anyone can do, but this was not so obvious in 1986. In fact, the idea in this film is that Insatiable characters, eager to find solace, safety and pleasure in sexual activities, are in fact an unhealthy motive that makes them so unbearable for themselves that they hide from themselves with lots of sex. This desire is associated with the "decline of the American empire," as discussed in an early interview in the film. <br /> <br /> So the idea is that relatively disgusting people talk about sex, and that this conversation is supposed to show how disgusting they are, like people do. Arcand, at least, continues to give it momentum and momentum, doing interesting things with the camera, such as isolating most of the characters in single shots, identifying their final loneliness and quickly separating them, showing how they fight more each other than they by agreement. And to pay tribute to Arkanda, this is largely what constitutes an intellectual life, a constant struggle with other intellectuals to stand out, even when everyone knows that highlighting means loneliness. <br /> <br /> But yes, the characters and the Action are nonsexual and partly pitiful. I think this film is a much more facet of its time than something that should go on for a long time, which makes it somewhat outdated. It is also an exact mental chatter in the dialogue and references of people like Susan Sontag, which makes art-house films so unpopular among populist movie lovers. In general, I will take it anyway - it takes its place among those people who are characters - it's just not very interesting or important for those who are not these characters. <br /> - PolarisDiB
