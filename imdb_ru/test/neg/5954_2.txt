There is so much in this movie. Prehistoric society, adventure, romance, real brotherhood, violence, sex, religion; everything is copiously depicted .. without a single spoken word !!! And why is it so bad? This film will make you rethink the origins of humanity. If it were a product of anthropology, you would prefer to defy Darwin's theory and Hegel's synthesis. You cannot look at it, even if your brain is off. And now you are thinking: "I must see this." I warned you. I take no responsibility if you regret having spent more than an hour looking at this work of art. Well, I warned you. It must be forgotten and buried forever.
