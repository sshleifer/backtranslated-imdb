I basically shot this film to see Shannon Elizabeth. She played well in this film, but the plot sucks. In fact, the film is not about something, but about being lonely after the conclusion of the contract, when one of Jerry O'Connell’s friends marries. The rest of the friends collected the money, and who last married got money ($ 10,000) from all his friends. In any case, just try to bring the film to the end, making “not since then” and making it more fun than “Since then”. I'm glad I paid only 0.50 for this movie. It really was not very good. I rated it **** out of 10 stars!
