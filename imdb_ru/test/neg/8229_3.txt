This is not a very good movie, but this is the best Troma Studios film I have ever watched. Lloyd Kaufman - Tromy’s “brain” doesn’t care about a good plot or even making a moderately interesting film. His main task is to do something strange. And his strange definition often reflects my definition of a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> In this film, we have the titled character Luther, whose favorite occupation is not Baseball, but biting off the heads of chickens, getting him released from prison. The board considers him rehabilitated, despite the fact that he does not speak — he just cracks like a chicken — and he has many dentures at his disposal. Of course, after the release of Luther, he begins to cause unrest first at the grocery store, and then at the farmhouse. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$$$ (a lot of violence in this, often tasteless) click. Luther lowers his shaving blazers into a poor old woman waiting at the bus stop, and then spends the rest of the film terrorizing the mother and daughter on the farm). <br /> <br /> Nudity: $$$$$ (Stacy Hajduk creates remarkable skin in her picture, since the former Lois Lane (I can't remember which Superman edition she was from) gives us a scene in the soul there is noisy fuss in bed with her boyfriend - a guy who just doesn't know I don't have any chemistry with Ms. Hajduk. The extended footage from the shower scene in DVD movies gives the viewer a little more about Stacy. <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (Forgettaboutit !!! Scenario! The Whitey Styles might just be the worst written ever. The way Luther is released from the asylum completely throws all authority into the window. ogue is what a preschooler can write, and the actions he writes for his characters, border on the absurd. As if Stiles spent ten years without contact with a person and completely forgot how people react in certain situations. <br /> <br /> ACTION: $$ (The film is owned by Edward Terry, who actually works quite well as a geek. He is quite formidable about Ratskoy manner: mother Joan Roth copes with support, but the lack of chemistry in Hajduk and her boyfriend at best makes their roles awkward).
