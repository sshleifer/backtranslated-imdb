Saw this used dvd cheap and got it for a chuckle. Recently, I also found “Octagon” on DVD and bought it to remember, seeing it as teenage in the theater, and loving it at the time. Now the problem with the "return" to these American films about karate is that since then I have seen a lot of fighters from Hong Kong and Thailand, in which the fighting scenes are long, fast and amazing. I mean fights like Jackie and Benny "The Jet" at the end of Dragons Forever, or Tony Jaa’s fight on the The Protector’s circular staircase. Kung Fu Hollywood offers are simply not “shot correctly”, and even make someone with a skilled skill, such as Chuck, look awkward from time to time. And what could be worse than a fight in slow motion? Then you know that it looked like shit at normal speed, so they slowed down the effect. It really underlines how ridiculous the opponent looks when he stands, and just WAIT for his chest hit. <br /> <br /> Poor Chuck, he simply has no intensity in this film, nor does he pose any righteous threat. Compare this with his former colleague in the film Bruce Lee, who had the charm and attitude to the burn. When Bruce came out against some adversary (s), you could almost see the air around him crackling with what was going to happen. In Breaker, Breaker, Chuck seemed to accidentally kick people with total nonchalance. When a judge comes to his prison and sentences him to death, Chuck looks at me with a sad look, and I thought, “Well ... he focuses on the third eye and is going to grab the judge by the throat and get out of it”, but he doesn’t do anything except look up with a squint-eyed look. Terrible. And although in the case of a DVD you hope to indicate 1 hour 5 minutes, it’s actually 1 hour 25 minutes, so you still have 20 minutes to watch the pain. <br /> <br /> For great combat, look at Jackie Chan in the first “Policeman oh stories "... the fight in the mall at the end is pure gold ......
