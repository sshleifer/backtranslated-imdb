By the standards of Randolph Scott of the 1950s, this is a disappointing and domineering western star. With two or three characters you can do, and two or three other characters can be given more attention. (Humor must be completely rewritten.) De Toth copes well with the action - as always - but his understanding of the general narrative is weak
