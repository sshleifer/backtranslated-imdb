The first film was quite fashionable and had funny moments, this film has exactly the same standard. Calvin Palmer (Ice Cube) is still trying to maintain his hair salon, but this is not only against stylist Gina (Queen Latifa) with a beauty store next door, but pretty soon, a large hairdressing salon called Nappy Cutz opens across the street. Calvin, along with colleagues and friends Eddie (Cedric Entertainer), Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas), Terry (Eve) and Isaac Rosenberg (Troy Garity) do everything they can to make regular customers come against the competition . Also starring Michael Or in the role of Ricky Nash, Leonard Earl House in the role of Dinka, Harry Lennic in the role of Quentin Leroux, Robert Woods in the role of Alderman Brown, Jazmin Lewis in the role of Jennifer, Kenan Thompson in the role of Kenard and Garsel Beauvais-Nilon in Bad Company as Loretta. I did not like this film more than the first one, because of unnecessary memories of Eddie, and he is not so witty, I just got tired of it. Good!
