With great expectations, I went to see this film, Spain’s contribution to the Oscar race this year. Being partly meaningless, banal, pathetic, poorly written, edited, played and directed, the film is too long. He is not able to convey the “message” that he is trying to give, not in his storytelling, clumsy historical settings and, above all, in his rhythm. There are some such extreme misfires that I have not seen in the movies for a long time (the story of Lucas, whose dead sister lives in his head, divine revelations, all this nonsense lizards). Hispanic audience yawned around me and quickly lost patience, and some of the comments I heard were whether members of the Spanish Academy took drugs before choosing a film for the Oscar.
