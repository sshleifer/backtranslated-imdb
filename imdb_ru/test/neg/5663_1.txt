Have you ever visited Youtube? Well, a definite question for this is YES. Do you see a boat with ICarly and Nickelodeon welts? No definite answer. <br /> <br /> Many people consider ICarly a boring and idiotic program, while others consider it the best program on Earth. I saw a lot of reviews panning ICarly in my head, and some gave him a bouquet of roses. In my opinion, Ikarli is for kids, but the show is just awful. <br /> <br /> If you didn’t read the latest review, then there are 1-8 reasons: # 1: Stereotypes # 2: Fool - up drama # 3: Everything is stupid (for example, a taco truck) # 4: Carly thinks that she is good, but she means # 5: Is anybody older than drunken age stupid? # 6: Sam is miniature but strong # 7: No real companies # 8: Evil teachers <br /> <br /> # 9: 3DFX is used on the web show. Just look at the web show to see what I mean. # 10: Web shows also spill personal information. No. 11: Almost all known things are offended. Ikarly insults the Japanese race, Solitare, Mercades-Benz and Pac-Man to name a few. # 12: Too many repeated jokes (Sam’s obsession with meat, Freddy’s computer, Gibby takes off his shirt, etc.) # 13: Video games based on the show, sucks. No. 14: Freddie lacks manliness. What for? It becomes non-original. No. 15: The show is intended for a female audience. I also hate shows intended for a male audience, so I prefer Icarly to be for both genders. # 16: The words "noob" and "without cheese." # 17: Excessive use of tracks of laughter. <br /> <br /> Part 3 - early spring! Just in time for spring break!
