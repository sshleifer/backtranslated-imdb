Wow. What can I say? I was born in 1960. I love bad tv movies. Love them. I'm getting involved. Works I want to participate. I spend time watching the thing. I watched Amy last night on TV. How was the Falls Empire movie (great name) in an endless world for any awards? He really had a wonderful talent. Of course. And they tried superbly. But how does ANY pretend it was a good script? Ok direction? You know, I wish you all the best. Indeed. But I thought it was just amazing that Hollywood puts this very bad film for so many honors. Awards? For me, it was a kind of wake-up call that Hollywood is such a small island community. Being cynical is not really mine. But wow. --xptyngi
