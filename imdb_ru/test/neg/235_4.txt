Firstly, I was not sure who this film was aimed at - it seemed like a story for children, but there was something in it that the children would not understand and would not find boring. There was nothing special about this, Bruce Willis was not an actor at all. He looked aside with his half-smile many times - if you are not a big fan of his, I would not worry. And if this is a story that interests you (a guy who seems to have everything, but emotionally is not enough, they learn lessons from a child), I would go to see About A Boy. It has everything that was missing in this film, humor, sadness and reality.
