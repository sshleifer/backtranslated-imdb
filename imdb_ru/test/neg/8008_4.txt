I think that if we talk about this film too much, it does not make the film bad. Twists is not a movie problem. The story is pretty clever and could be very cool if it were shot correctly. The main problems, why everyone complains about the turns in the film, is that the film is not so exciting to get people to follow them. The film is poorly filmed (at least compared to Brother Locke's genre, Stoke). Worse, the characters (although often well-functioning) are simply flat. Characters do not have enough time to be represented well enough to allow the viewer to get involved with one of them, not to mention understanding them. Oh, and the locations are terrible: the location of the person (I did not bother to see the credits in your name) - get another job (maybe still a photo or interior design)
