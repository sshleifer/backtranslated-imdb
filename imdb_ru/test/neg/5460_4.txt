I was also disappointed with this film. To begin with, the things that happen to him do not seem to me too scary (sorry, chauvinist, man). As one of the abductors unequivocally says: “Most men will pay to be in your place.” To which he replies: "But this is not my choice." Good, good, honest, since it was really bad? Please let us know. But now the kicker: he does not let _anyone_ know until after the end of the film (imperceptibly). Not his girlfriend, not a mentor, not the police, not anyone. Instead, he comes up with a brilliant plan for every girl he knows, so that he can recognize the tattoo (or something) of one of his captors. I thought he just had enough bad sex for 12 days of his captivity? Is it time to take a break from all this? For me, to put it mildly, thoughtless actions broke the “suspension of disbelief” of the film. I took out a book, watching the last half hour out of the corner of my eye.
