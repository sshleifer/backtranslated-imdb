This is another anti-communist controversy of the Hollywood golden 1950s. Valiant American Gene Barry, beautiful Englishwoman Valerie French and three others were abducted by aliens and got clamshells containing fantastic - and fantastically vague - power. What will earthlings do with such force? Throw it in the sea or use to destroy all of humanity? Anyone familiar with American cinema around 1957 knows the answer to what commissions will do, but the story ripens when Americans actually experience things in the middle of the Pacific. Then one scientist, alone with the highest power in the universe, comes up with his theory and uses it! After that, his intelligent attitude causes nausea, and the joyful mood of everyone else is terrifying. <br /> <br /> Here is the spoiler for this dog: the capsules inside the clamshells have a mathematical code that tells the prof that they kill only confirmed enemies of freedom "! That's right - don't worry about the ethical mystery of killing everyone that the alien tablet regards as freedom; just do it! Hooray! No communicators! Stupid woman - and you threw yours into the sea! Ha ha! Kiss me baby!
