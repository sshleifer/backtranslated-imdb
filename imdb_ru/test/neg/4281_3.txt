Being a big Disney fan, I was very disappointed when I watched this garbage. The animation was beautiful, and the backgrounds were amazing, but I think that good animation does not compensate for a weak script and a weak story. I will have to disagree with people who say it is not suitable for children. Yes, there are several deaths in the film, but shouldn't death be children? But I digress. The script is replete with bad puns and silly jokes ... the kind I would expect from most Dreamworks movies. The music was deplorable, moral forced (and forced without any charm), and the characters broke into the song at a completely inappropriate time. The characters were also cold, and I really couldn't collect any emotions towards them (bar irritation). I'm a big fan of the jungle book, Aladdin, and the new emperor, but this Disney film was a complete and complete waste of time ..... don't watch it !!!
