Maybe it's just me, but this film was more like a sequel or a sequel than a separate project. What for? When he was filmed (just a few years after the war), most viewers probably knew why Rommel was so famous, why his death was so important for the allies, why he was Hitler's favorite general, but now, 50 years later, this is not So. it's not so obvious anymore. <br /> <br /> Desert Fox: Rommel's Story is a worthy war film, but he doesn’t explain how Rommel got his nickname, what he did. The Allies considered him his best general, why their soldiers were so afraid of the African Corps. ? That's what is missing in this film - we see his fame, his character, his way of dealing with soldiers and enemies, but, for example, we also see that Hitler complained about his achievements in Africa, called him a coward, etc. So, we lack the overall picture here - this is the “History of Rommel”, but, unfortunately, there is a missing part of the “Desert Fox”.
