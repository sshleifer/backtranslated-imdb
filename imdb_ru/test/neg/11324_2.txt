Wow, I swear, has this ever happened to me before ?? I just watched “Amazons of the Golden Temple” yesterday, and have not received the slightest recollection of what happened in this film. I think that's how great this movie is! By now, I only remember how I was enticed to watch it because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover showing the eerie drawing of a voluptuous amazon preparing her bow for shooting at an unknown target. Do I often get tricked by attractive DVD covers ?? especially those Jesse Franco ?? and I still have not learned to resist even after literally hundreds of terrible experiences. Well?? After reading other user comments, some parts of my memory returned, although I still suspect that I confused this film with another masterpiece Jess Franco, which I watched the day before, namely “Kilimanjaro's Diamonds” (and, yes, it also had a terrific DVD cover also ). <br /> <br /> “The Golden Temple of the Amazons” opens with a squad of hot white African Amazons ?? I know about the contradiction, but do not blame me ?? to kill the parents of a fragile young girl, because they entered the lawn with the intention of stealing the golden treasures from the temple. After several years and hormonal changes, the girl returns to the jungle to take revenge. She is accompanied by a bunch of dirty adventurers who are less interested in the act of revenge, but do not mind taking a bit of gold home. The rudimentary premise is obviously secondary to the whole demonstration of the delightful female nudity and causeless meanness. Analia Ivars, Eva Leon and other unnamed Amazons - all the usual choices of Franco and willingly go with proudly naked breasts. You prefer to look at all of these beautiful feminine twists, since the rest of the Amazons of the Golden Temple is a boring and incompetent mess. There is almost no violence or action, and at least half of the film is pure filler, fragments of National Geographic documentaries edited in the plot, and the like. A DVD cover will certainly be a great addition to your collection, but opening the box is completely pointless.
