I rarely laughed so hard at a movie. Please note that I laughed at Iron Eagle, not at him, because this is probably the silliest movie I've ever seen (with the notable exception of the sci-fi monster CyberTracker). You must also remember that this film is not a comedy! <br /> <br /> Even losing sight of the ridiculous storyline (the idea that a 16-year-old teenager can enter the US Air Force base, steal an F-16, fly to the Middle East and kill about a thousand people so that no one would notice that it is impossible to believe), the film is full of ridiculous action films that almost have no meaning. For example, at various points Dag Masters uses a machine gun on his plane to shoot at a steel beam, a control tower and a tent. All this explodes with a huge fireball. What for? The enemy plane also explodes in a strange way, reminiscent of a firework exploded by a paper plane. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I really liked this movie. Admittedly, not as the creators probably wanted it to be delivered, but still I laughed at it and later bought a DVD. It also improved thanks to the amazing presence of David Suchet as the evil leader of the terrorists (maybe you remember him as the mustache of the Belgian detective Poirot?) In general, the film is a laugh and a carefree alternative to a more serious fighter like Top Gun movies. Even if itâ€™s just as subtly homoerotic (check the masculine embrace between Dag and Chappy. Something happens between them!)
