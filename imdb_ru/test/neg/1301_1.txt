This film was only two evenings on ITV1 .. dear, dear. Someone really bought it thanks to the strength of Robert Carlyles ... Well, I missed the start ... but what I saw was so bad that I thought no ... I embarrassedly watched the stars that were in it . Nothing was grounded in reality, I doubt that everything will evolve as much as in this film. In this film, everything was bad. OK, CGI .. but no reality. The letter gave the impression of the end of the cliff hanger .. sorry, I was not impressed. Yes, the formula. Could not guess the end. From what I saw that the military had gained the upper hand, people who were engaged in heroic affairs were given almost no time to do their work, just wouldn't it have happened? It was worse than leaving your brain at the door. It was annoying ... as someone said ... yes, right ... of course, it would have happened ... no !! The credits mention Quebec and Canada ... so this was a co-production, missed the third interested party ... I will have to check on this site. I'm usually not so critical, but it annoyed me.
