Directed by "The Messengers" Danny Pang and Oxide Pang are responsible for "The Eye" and its continuation, and their premiere - the American film, similar to the TV series "The Grudge" on the farm. A family of four moves from Chicago to the race. sunflower farm in the countryside of North Dakota. Almost immediately, their teenage daughter, Jess, begins to see ghosts. Of course, her parents and the police are skeptical. Admittedly, the film is well made, and there are two or three effective scares, but relies too much on the 'boo' effect. Nevertheless, the plot is an exact copy of many ghost stories, and the final is anti-climatic and terrible. Panic attacks are also low with a tendency towards CGI. In general, “The Messengers” is a rather weak horror film that simply does not give 4 out of 10.
