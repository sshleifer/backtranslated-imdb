There are so many bad things in this movie. Greiko with a wig for girls, an old time machine repair scientist, a sturdy guy Jones who stays with a shotgun who has three shots, spidermen with hands with tentacles and bad teeth, etc. The make up was very bad and they only had a few visible spidermen on the screen at one time (you could use Cameron alien technique), instead they decided to dress every spiderman in the same way ... bad. The good thing about Greikoâ€™s actions is that he shakes his words on each syllable, as if he considers how many words he says in the script. It amazes me that with all the information contained in the comments to the DVD, there are still people who make films. This film could be worse, as far as I do not know. Oh, and the last. I'm going to look for the SCI-FI movie. The people who manage this channel should not have the right to continue the cronyism that exists in film and on television.
