I like the full moon the most, so I ordered this film from the USA, because it is nowhere in Germany. I thought it would be as cute and funny as in the Subspecies or Puppetmaster Series, because they were full of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was glad when the movie finally appeared. <br /> <br /> But after Watching this cheesy film, I was very disappointed. Actors (I think you can't even say actors) are boring and untalented. The story was a bad game, and even the kit and the monster were very cheap and lousy. <br /> <br /> I hope that no one will ever make a sequel or remake of this terrible movie. :-)
