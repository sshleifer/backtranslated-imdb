In order to enjoy “Fur - an Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus,” Stephen Sheinberg needs a viewer to suspend all of the reality and prior knowledge of the American photographer Diane Arbus. Paradoxically, but it was the use of Diane Arbus’s name and knowledge in her life and work that led to the collapse of this film on a large scale. <br /> <br /> What becomes apparent quite early after the casting The beautiful WASPish and glamorous Nicole Kidman, like the anti-blazing Jewish woman Diane Arbus, says that Shainberg did not get Arbus or what her work was about (unsentimental realism) , and seems to have attracted Arbus on a superficial level only thanks to her photos of circus freaks. <br /> <br /> What follows is a kind of pretty and trivial biopic The Beauty and the Beast with Robert Downey JR in the role of Kidman's hairy fictional love interest. However, the banality of this story is not the main drawback of this film, but the mistaken position of the director that Diane Arbus, one of the most unusual and original female photographers in the art world, was unable to form her own ideas about her work. While his previous film “The Secretary” was a study of female masochism, his continued image of the female as submissive completely spoils this film - and challenges real courage, perseverance and fearlessness of Diane Arbus in real life, exploring alone is often a shady world of outsiders . <br /> <br /> Imagine an imaginary biopic about the life of pop star Madonna with Guy Richie as Svengali, the man behind her career, and you will feel how serious and imaginary this Film is: “It may work, only if you absolutely do not know the subject or simply ignore all the facts. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because as soon as you remove all references to Diane Arbus, this film may have risen on their own as an interesting study of fetishism and a good companion for the secretary. 4/10
