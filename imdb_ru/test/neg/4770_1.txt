My review is divided into questions that you really have to ask yourself: <br /> <br /> 1. Plants that eat people were hundreds of times. It was used by Nintendo in everything from Mario to Zelda to Metroid Prime. It was used in many low-budget films of the 50s, along with the lowest of the Godzilla franchise. And this leads him to a completely different level of cheese with plants that say. I did not know anyone who had left, but I know many people who had completely burst into hysterical laughter during parts of this film. I was one of them. Doesn't the horror genre deserve something better than this bunch of ridiculous shit? <br /> <br /> 2. Characters could easily be copied / pasted from Hostel, Wrong Run, Wolf Stream, or any other film with collage kids who were not lucky. And yet it’s called “characterize” when the film takes hours of your time to tell you the cliches that hundreds of characters had before? Didn't you want to see characters in the film that were not just forgettable pieces of meat with legs? <br /> <br /> 3. It was not terrible. The guy cuts off his skin. Oh, my! (No.) The guy's legs were broken. Oh my God! Suffocation! (No.) I showed such films to my mother, who hates everything connected with horror because she is sick of her, and she said: “I watched PG movies worse than this! Why was it rated R? ”So why was it rated R? <br /> <br /> 4. Here is the only plot of the film / film: children drink collages, have sex, undress, get annoyed, bleed and, eventually, die. Perhaps this is the most typical example of a cheap, thoughtless horror film, but people call it "mature"? What the . .? <br /> <br /> 5. I don’t think I’ve ever seen something less original feeling that I watched A Beautiful Mind. <br /> <br /> Have you never sat there and didn’t want the horror genre, perhaps the most diverse genre, to do something. well, diverse? Is something really original? <br /> <br /> I just wanted more horror films to be real horror, and not just cheap collage parties shot on film with a spray of a few sprays of fake blood. <br /> <br /> 1/10
