It should be one of, if not the worst movie I've ever seen. After watching this passage, I felt that I had to write Madonna and demand compensation for my time, but now I feel that I have to write Madonna and demand a great 80s album (considering that she cannot make a good album to save her life anymore) in exchange for this disaster. <br /> <br /> About the film itself, which can be described as follows: <br /> <br /> Madonna jumps in it, acting as a spoiled teenager who has gone astray. She is trying to impress this absolute jerk actor who plays the “attorney” in the film. But the finale was the best. I was watching with my jaw on the ground at the television when the credits rolled, thinking of myself. “Is this it? This is the end? What a piece of shit!”. If Madonna were not a pop icon during this film, this film alone would have ruined her career. And the funny thing about this situation was that I just looked damn Movie to see where they put the song “Who's that girl.” Well, guess where they put it? .......................... .. .......in the end!
