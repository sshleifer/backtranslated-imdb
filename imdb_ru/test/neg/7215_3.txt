Last night I had a chance to see a commercial for this movie on the Spike Channel, he was grouped with Patrick's repeat of another film he made, and thought that Swazi was in this sequel ..... Boy, I was wrong .... I see the screenwriter also starred in this, and I think the budget was a bit limited. I am surprised to see Will Patton in the film, in which he recommended himself much better to play in such a film “c” as this one. Bussy Jr. struggled to portray the image of his father (one of the best actors of the bad guys) who failed miserably, the only redemptive qualities in the film were chicks, beautiful, good looking and with lots of T & A, just worth spending time or your hard earned dollar to rent it
