It seems that some of the previous reviewers have seen another film, different from what I saw tonight ... In fact, this film is the reason I signed up for IMDb. Of course, Bobby Phillips can “fight”, and for that I give this movie 2, but the rest of this movie is just crap ... The game is bad, the plot is bad, the camera angles are bad, and the effects are bad. Of course, the actors are physically fit, but they cannot act! Sometimes I like to watch bad movies for laughter, but there was no charm in this movie, and after I saw this movie, I was full of regrets for watching it. Of course, if you would like to see a mediocre struggle without anything else, then this film is for you. If not, stay away from this movie! PS: sorry for any spelling mistakes ... i'm just tired as the reason for this movie!
