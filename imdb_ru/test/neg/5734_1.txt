In the mid-1970s, my apartment is in New York. the building was finally connected to cable television, and since Showtime (instead of HBO) was the only premium channel offering the latest films, I subscribed to it. Being a writer and an owl by nature, I soon discovered that the channel was showing films late at night, and until I even heard about the first hours of the morning — most of them were American independent films and foreign films that had never happened. was given an American theatrical release. Many of them had recognizable star celebrities and respectable directors, and thanks to Showtime, I found many first-class films that I (and other Showtime subscribers) would never have seen. Most of these cinema mongrels were really “dogs”, but often so bad that they were unintentionally funny. One evening, Showtime unveiled a small Italian-made gem called Redneck (shot in 1972, with limited access to Europe in 1973). Although the film was never released in the United States, the MPAA rating was listed as “R”. Since the director was one Silvio Narizano (the director who made his name with the glorious “Georgian girl”), and the three presenters were Mark (“Oliver”) Leicester, Fabio Testi and Telly Savalas, I decided to try. And he found that he nailed to my TV screen in disbelief for 89 minutes. As far as I remember, Savalas and Testi played two criminals, a former mad maniac who, in one of the scenes spewing the stomach, accidentally sent the German family to death, pushing his trailer off the cliff, thereby plunging into the depths of the desert below. So far so bad. Then, out of nowhere, the Testimonies (as the “sweet” psycho) and Lester (all 14 when they made the film) can be seen naked in the men's room, when the Testi is sneaking up to the child’s body during shaving, and the poor fellow. confused, Leicester focused on close-ups of Testy's naked ass. Being not yet a tortured representative of the film industry and a liberal carrying cards (I was also against censorship then today), the whole film made me nauseous (and, being in the early 70s, when I thought that I had seen everything in the films of this liberated era, including “anything,” including the uncut version of Altman’s “That Cold Day at the Park”, a real jaw-dropper, until it was cut for an “R” rating and could write Letters The end of Altman’s career if he didn’t come up with something called “M * A * S * H ​​”), I'm still wondering if anyone else besides me saw Redneck was as shocked as I was. To crush the actors and the audience to the cinema is a joy, since directors from time immemorial have played fun in them. But fiercely exploited a very respected and talented child actor (Mr. Lester) at the time when he began to make a difficult deal from child to adult actor (and I am sure that his film proposals, thus, were reduced to terrible junk, such as "Redneck "") ... Mister. It is decided that you should lower your head in shame. (By the way, I soon had to make friends with the actors who appeared in the future, with unremarkable efforts. They both despised him. Surprise?)
