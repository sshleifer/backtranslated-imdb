I enjoy science fiction just like the next person? but what the hell was that? Apparently filmed in just three days using the excess film left over from his previous film Nana (1926), this short Jean Renoir is an amazing futuristic satire created with a budget that could not be much more than zero. In 2028, after the great war, Africa became the most civilized region on Earth, and what used to be Europe was called "Terres Inconnues (Unknown Land)". African researcher ?? played by Johnny Huggins, black, dressed like white, dressed like black, if you follow me ?? travels to the ruins of Paris on his spherical plane and lands at the lair of a Parisian savage (Catherine Hessling, then the director's wife) and her primate companions, possibly the most eerie monkey costume I've ever seen. The savage, as part of some strange ritual of sexual initiation, begins to show the explorer the dance of Charleston, which he gladly learns himself. <br /> <br /> The film doesn’t help Hessling, who was wonderful next year in Renoir’s Little Match Girl film (1928) not very many dancers, although the extensive use of slow motion adds a bit of surrealism to the ceremony. Also, am I very shocked that Renoir used his own wife as such a crying sexual object? It did not come as a surprise to learn about their divorce just three years later! On the other hand, I liked the general sci-fi concept of the film and the cunning satirical touch of changing racial roles usually characteristic of such stories as this one. But why Renoir decided to dress up his black actor as a minstrel, will forever remain a mystery. The Fool's Parade of Charleston (1927) is a strange cinematic oddity of one of the most respected film directors, and perhaps an attempt that he would like to forget. The DVD version was without a musical soundtrack, but I compromised with a selection of Dmitri Shostakovich’s works.
