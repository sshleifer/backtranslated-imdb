A friend gave me this film because she liked it. I decided to finally take a look. It was sooooo long. I kept waiting until the unknown happens, but this did not happen. I kept waiting for something to happen after the opening scenes, and it never happened. I stopped the movie and came back later. I actually forced myself to watch everything else, hoping that everything would get better. It got worse. I kept asking myself who are these people? Do they have feelings? are they just robots? I am glad that I did not pay to see it or pay to rent it. The end would be better if the Dutchman died from a gunshot wound. At the very least, we would get some emotions from the audience. Or maybe not.
