This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The highlight of the film is the comparison between the smell of natural gas and dirty vagina. <br /> <br /> Acting is pathetic. I know that acting is hard work and all that, but thatâ€™s why it should be left to real actors. Watching these people play is similar to the way Michael J. Fox performs brain surgery. At best, it is shaky. <br /> <br /> In one of the other comments, you would believe that the film was saved by Dan Gordon's acting talent as Chris. Only Dan himself or perhaps his mother could believe that this is a good game. <br /> <br /> The special effects in this film were terrible. The worst special effects were for a gas explosion in a lighthouse. It seems that someone shone orange light from the bottom of the model, built from the refrigerator. Of course, there was some computer animation, but it did not help. I suspect that the special effects for this film were created and reproduced using a single Amiga computer in the late 80s.
