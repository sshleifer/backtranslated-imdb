What about the gangster disguise movie? Not so much. With average indie-style filmmaking, this film is all wrong. Editing is just awful. As for the story of the gangsters, it could be done if the gangsters had no lack of character. It seemed that everyone was there for some kind of zest. None of this was funny. The usual suspects in this film are a hooker with a heart of gold, a dying mafia father who wants his son to make his business legitimate, a best friend with "stupefied" one-liners. But the main character, a gangster who loves to dress up like a girl. Only his motive for dressing up like a girl is that he was robbed by a woman? Weird. The end of the film was supposed to be the nail in the coffin. It was anti-climatic, to say the least. I mean, I understand that independent directors do not have the equipment to shoot properly, but they could also use water cannons. Overall, I would say that the hype leading to this (the premiere of the red carpet in Vancouver) was a disappointment.
