I rented it from my local blockbuster called SPECK - it might be a way to find it if you still feel the need to see it after this review. <br /> <br /> This is a film about serial killer Richard Speke. who killed several nurses in Chicago in the sixties. Watching the movie, there is a feeling that it follows the crimes to the letter. Unfortunately, this is not suitable for a good movie. <br /> <br /> Another problem I encountered was almost constant music, giving us to understand that it was a scary movie, and some terrible story that let us know that it was a motivating spec. Acting was average for this type of film; to pay tribute to where merit, the film is very beautifully photographed for my taste. Your mileage may vary. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are interested in the subject, it may be worth your time.
