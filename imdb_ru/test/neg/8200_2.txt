This story begins at the end! So the opening credits of the film advise us. Unfortunately, this is not true, since we are then considered about 70 minutes of a typical science fiction film from the 1950s. The story is boring; the plot is very weak and clearly filmed with a small budget, as often happened in those days. <br /> <br /> This story could cover any situation where people take refuge in an isolated house and are threatened by someone on the street. he is simply adapted to science fiction. <br /> <br /> The landscape consisted of several stones, bushes and smoke. “Oh yes, there was a pool with water.” Someone was wearing a rubber mask with a klyuvobodobnym face and something similar to feathers. <br /> <br /> Author Lou Rusoff, who has written several science fiction stories during this time, including “She is the creature” and “She conquered the world.” It was completed in a matter of days, not allowing actors to develop their characters in time for the best advantage. Budget constraints also prevented this film from reaching its full potential. It could be a movie much better than it turned out. <br /> <br /> Mike Connors and Richard Denning put a little bit of life into the film, but even they couldn’t raise this film to the category in which I could say I liked this film. Richard Denning’s acting career began in 1937. He starred with Gregory Peck and Deborah Kerr in the movie "Remember, and then" became more famous on television in the TV series "Hawaii Five-O" and "The Flying Doctor." br /> <br /> Directed by Roger Corman, who has in his possession a lot of films as a director and producer. He made some good films and still makes them. He became very famous for directing films from the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, often with Vincent Price in the lead role. He also made other low-budget films; some of them were good and interesting for one reason or another, and most were much better than this. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone. <br /> <br /> Darmeia <br /> <September 10, 2007
