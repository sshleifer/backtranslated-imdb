This show, in my opinion, is not very good, but again I didnâ€™t like any Disney Channel cartoon. With the exception of "Proud Family", because it concerns a normal teenage girl. This show is very similar to what I feel for Lilo and Stitch on the show. It was a mistake to turn the film into a cartoon, because the film was excellent, the cartoon was terrible. The Disney Channel coped well before adding all these silly cartoons such as Dave Barbarian, Brandy and Mr. Wiskers, Lilo and Stitch TV Series, American Dragon Jake Long, and where it all began: Kim Possibly The show would be better if they came to Disney's PlayHouse! As for this particular show, Kuzko will never leave the school just as Dave Parents of the barbarian will never return home, and Brandy and Mr. Uksers will never leave the jungle.
