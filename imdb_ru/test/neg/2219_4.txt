Doug McClure starred in several British genre adventures, and this film was the worst of them all. I know that EARTH, WHICH HAS FORGOTTEN, has its critics, but please, at least in this film places and relatively good production figures have been shot. This is the problem with this film: production values ​​go far beyond “So bad, they are good” and become “so bad that I think I'll go and see what is on other channels” <br /> <br /> V As an example, we can give the first scene in which the fearless Cushing and McClure meet a monster. It is terribly obvious that a monster is a medium-sized man, dressed as a rubber monster, more than twenty feet tall, looking because of a bloated rear projection. It becomes even more painfully obvious that our heroes are trying to escape from the monster, running on the spot. Did I mention that this is one of the most compelling scenery? In fact, it does not look like it was filmed in someone’s living room with an extra change left from the WHO DOCTOR’s budget this year. Even the former DOCTOR, which Peter Cushing is soft, and what should have been a funny line “You can't hypnotize me - I'm British,” is written very flatly (a very similar line is written by Cushing in HORROR EXPRESS) to the script, devoid of characteristics, plot and memorable dialogue. The point is not only that the dialogue is not memorable, it is also infrequent and rare, since the monsters do not speak. Wouldn't it be better to have the main humanoids of the bad guys, as in the WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS, so that they can explain the plot. Does anyone here know what the plot really is? <br /> <br /> A very boring British film that even the twin talents of Caroline Munro cannot save. The whole mood of the film is summed up by a final sequence with the participation of two policemen.
