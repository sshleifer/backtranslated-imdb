CinemaScope color cinema by Leon Shamroy is quite remarkable here, including his use of color filters for various scenes <br /> <br />. Alfred Newman's score should be the most sensual and seductive result of Hollywood. It's a shame that he is no longer on the CD. The actors, however, never fit the occasion. The accents are so diverse, from the muffled Britons of Ustinov and Purdom to Hollywood Baxter and the Mature, that it seems like a jumble without central vision. Tommy Rettig is awfully American. Acting styles range from zombie-like to stilts. Only Ustinov, as a cunning one-eyed servant, steals the show â€” something that can be stolen from him. The premise is the story of a young Egyptian doctor, seduced and abandoned by the rich, and the parallel theme of the cult of the single God Ra, pursued by the authorities, has its own interesting moments. But when the plot of the film disappears, the haunting music and visual effects remain.
