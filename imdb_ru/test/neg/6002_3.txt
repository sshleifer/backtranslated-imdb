Predictable, bloody, overly useless, mediocre. Do not waste your time - there are many much better movies. <br /> <br /> Resurrection begins normally, but the plot quickly becomes repetitive. My level of interest steadily declined. By the end of the film, I was just glad that it was finally over. Characters never fully developed. The cinematography is muddy and the rapid change in POV - although impressive in 1999, perhaps now serves only to designate the film as an attempt to replace the buzzing flash with a plot and character essence. The tricks on the set of the film serve some purpose (convey tension and anxiety), but they are constantly used too often and eventually become counterproductive. It's a shame in general - the film / story obviously had potential, and the producers / directors and actors obviously have technical skills. Disappointment
