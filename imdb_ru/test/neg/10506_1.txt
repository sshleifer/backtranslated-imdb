I hope that the people who made these films read these comments. The choreography was terrible, the plot was zero, and the actors who have such low-budget Rangers seem to have 5 stars for this junk. <br /> <br /> Scenes of fighting, where so slowly, you could see the actors waiting for each other to complete the next move. Segments of the camera and poor lighting could not hide cheap effects. Lightning was just stupid. The weapons looked like something from the final fantasy game, and double bows and arrows were just boring, like everything I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> In the next movie you decide to make, try investing in some wireless script microphones and try to spend some time on your stunts. <br /> <br /> Honestly, there are shows on TV that play forever and gather for a few hours that look better than this one. <br /> <br /> Stick to the martial arts (if they are not as poor as your game), and then proceed to the quilting.
