This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The cast was fantastic, but the movie itself was terrible. It was so terrible, I had to register, just to say how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and wanted to interrupt it every minute I watched. This could be great. There was a great premise. If you are going to rob an armored car, and the homeless person sees you, you should do what you have to do. For the main character to decide to kill the policeman and kill his friends and colleagues after the homeless guy was already dead, it's just ridiculous. And yes, I am sure that there will be answers to this question about how his mind reached him, but come on. <br /> <br /> The main character crawled out of the bottom of the armored truck, no one saw him. He blew up the treasury of money, grabbed and dragged the policeman right behind the other guards, and no one saw him. He was able to return to the armored car, and no one saw him ... This film had the potential, but he blew it up. <br /> <br /> You could not pay me to watch this movie again! NEVER watch it! Aggravating ...
