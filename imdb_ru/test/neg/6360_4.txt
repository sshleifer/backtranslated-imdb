Critters 3 starts on the open road when Clifford (John Calvin), his teenage daughter Annie (Aimee Brooks) and his younger son Johnny (two actors in the IMDb list are Christian and Joseph Cousins, possibly identical twins?) Returning home from vacation. Suddenly the tire on their van is blowing, and they have to stop in a public recreation area to fix it. While there, Annie and Johnny meet a child named Josh (Leonardo DiCaprio, yes), who in turn faces Charlie McFadden (co-producer of films Don Keith Opper) from the two previous films about Critter. Charlie tells them the story of Critters and the city of Grovers Bend, but they don’t believe him. Meanwhile, in the van, Critter lays eggs on the underside, out of sight of everyone. After Clifford installed the tire, the trio went to their home in Los Angeles, where a multi-family residential building was broken, where Critter was bundled with eggs. Upon arrival, the hatchway with the eggs and the animals go straight into the apartment building, quickly getting rid of Frank (Jeffrey Blake), the superintendent. As the night approaches the few remaining residents, a fat woman named Rosalie (Diana Bellamy), a repairman for Marsha’s phone (Catherine Cortez), an elderly couple Mr. (Bill Zuckert) and Mrs. Menges (Francis Bay) should get together with Clifford and his children to fight Critters. Josh also appears as his stepfather (William Dennis Hunt) owns the building. But will the band be able to defeat Critters and prevent them from becoming dinner? <br /> <br /> Directed by Kristin Peterson: I think Critters 3 was an incredibly extraordinary film, but at least she can say that she starred in a film with Leonardo DiCaprio, and not many people can say it ! The budget for Critters 3 probably wasn't a whole fortune, since the whole performance looks cheap everywhere, very few characters, very few Critters, and I think only 3 ever appear in one frame at a time, and this eliminates any kind of space angle, so there are no expensive spacecraft or distant special effects of alien planets. The script of David J. Shaw is strictly by numbers and very predictable. A group of people is stuck in an isolated situation with Critters and does not have the opportunity to contact the outside world for help, this plot of the plot sounds very familiar, right? Well, this is just like previous Critters (1986) and Critters 2: Main Course (1988) and many other horror films, as it should be. Critters 3 does not do anything with the premise, it does not even try to add anything to the already old, tired and well-used storyline. Critters 3 is also very tame for a horror movie, in which only two people are actually killed and comedy elements are seriously missing, and the best joke Critters 3 can play the role of Critter, eating some beans and then farting, very funny if you are about 5 years old. Characters are mostly standard horror movie clichés and quickly become annoying. There is almost no blood or blood in Critters 3, only a few splashes of blood, and unfortunately Critters 3 seems to be trying hard not to show any violence. The special effects on Critters are fine, but they still look like static, simplified puppets with very few movements. The acting is not so good, and Critters 3 turns out to be the very first Leonardo DiCaprio feature film to be honest with the child he is fine with, and I wonder if any of the other actors or film crew had any idea who he would be Why on earth should this Charlie guy appear in Critter films? To pay tribute to Critters 3, it moves at a good pace and is not boring, it is usually well made with fairly good production performance, and it is a little harmless if you have a good mood, and, fortunately, it lasts only about 80 seconds more minutes. In general, Critters 3 is a good waste of time, but do not expect anything deep or meaningful. There is nothing bad in it, like a cheap horror film, but I couldn't help but feel that I had seen it all before. The average waste of time, which is not as good as in the two previous films about Critter. Critters 3 ends with “being continued ...” because it was taken down closely with Critters 4 (1991), which is not surprising that they immediately went to the video, probably to save even more money. Critters 3 is a decent enough way to spend 80 extra minutes if you can watch it on TV for free, otherwise do not worry.
