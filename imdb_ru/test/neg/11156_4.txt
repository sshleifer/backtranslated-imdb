The end of Days begins quite well, Arnie plays a cop (very similar to Riggs in “Deadly Weapons”), and the plot resembles the fighter from serial killers, which will be good fun. <br /> <Unfortunately, this is not possible, Arnie is as good as we used to expect, but as for Gabriel Byrne, I expect him to choose his roles more carefully than this one. throw like a devil; this is probably the weakest image of the lord of darkness in history. <br /> <br /> This film becomes too stupid for me, and the final sequence, besides being very weak, is visually one of the worst. As we have seen in recent years, CGI is better than this one since the early nineties. <br /> <br /> Just not enough. 4/10 (see if you have, but do not expect too much, because it will not bring results)
