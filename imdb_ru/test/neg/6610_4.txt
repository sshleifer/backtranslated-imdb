Well, for a start, I must say that here, in Russia, the saga of Geralt from Rivia is known and loved. Andrzej Sapkowski - a talented writer or maybe even some kind of genius - created one of the most realistic, honest, cynical and well-written god-fantasy worlds in the history of literature. And when such an amazing material well falls into good hands, look at the Witcher RPG game, and you will understand what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> “Vedmac \ Wiedzmin” is a great example of the opposite outcome. <br /> <br /> Lack of budget. No directing. The lack of a good script. <br /> <br /> These three whales from the film “Disgusting Film” sank this film, ate it alive. Acting well, sometimes even more than well, but for God's sake it cannot save this project. <br /> <br /> I still believe. I still hope that sometime new Vedmak films will be created, and the whole world will see the scope and breathtaking magnificence of Sapkowsky’s books. PS But before that, Uwe Boll must be eliminated. Just in case you know
