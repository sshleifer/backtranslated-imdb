I just watched this movie, and it turned out to be rather unconvincing, as mentioned in other user reviews, and what bothered me most was the southern accent that some characters had, it happened in Wisconsin, not in the south. As mentioned in other reviews, Ed Gein was not a big dude, so why did the guy who plays Jason and Leather Face portray him? <br /> <br /> I quickly moved forward because there are a lot of slow parts in it. <br /> <br /> I hope someone does homework for Ed Heine and the city and makes a more accurate movie
