The video for this film reads: "The history of beauty, passion and forbidden fruits." They talk about the same movie that I just saw ?! They cannot be, since the film that I just watched was beautiful, but there was no passion in it, and as for fruit, it’s all bullshit, designed to seduce a potential viewer to watch this movie. If it had some kind of passion or some kind of life, I would really like this movie. Instead, it was a painfully slow and not very interesting film that I definitely would not want to see again. The point is not that this is a bad film (after all, it is very beautifully filmed), but it is boring to incredibility. I kept waiting for something exciting or interesting, but the film just ended. There was not much excitement, secrecy, or anything else — just a rather uninteresting story about a young girl who becomes a servant and spends the next 10 years of her life working as a maid.
