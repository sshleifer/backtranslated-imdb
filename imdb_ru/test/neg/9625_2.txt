Well, it was definitely a waste of Dave McKean's talents, wasn't it? Don't get me wrong: when it comes to graphic design, Dave McKean might be the best in the world right now. The multi-layered, textured look that he can give with just a few pencil lines on coarse paper makes the efforts of people like Peter Greenaway and David Fincher similar to what they are: hacker work. Mackin was the godfather of the revolution in his views on comics, films and even magazines, which borrowed the special effect of the collage, which he first applied. <br /> <br /> But this film? This is junk. Complete trash. Unfortunately, the story from Neil Guyman is exactly what Guyman gives us since he first broke Clive Barker: a pseudo-mythical, bloated dream landscape inhabited by characters who have Headers in all capital letters, and not names. All this is an allegory, to such an extent that it is impossible to get any human drama, emotions or empathy from anyone involved. People make informative postulates, telling in riddles that remind you that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead could sound as if Tom Stoppard had a grueling blow in the middle of his composition. In fact, Geiman, go with yourself. You are not a prophet. You poser. <br /> <br /> McKean's direction doesn't help - his pace is bad, he spends as much as half an hour actually preparing for the main storyline, and then just provides the event sequence turned off, none of them attached any importance . Monsters are not dangerous, because they do not foretell anything, but simply throw on the screen. The plot is not interesting, because we are not interested in rancid little heroes. Half of the dialogue, turned over in a shirt and the ubiquitous masks, is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Some visual effects are cute and I'm sure fans will like it. A pity. Think of the amount of really good work McKean could have done if he had not been stuck in this unfortunate project. <br /> <br /> Rating: D / D-
