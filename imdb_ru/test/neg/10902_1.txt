Apparently, in the eyes of some - these days there are not enough horror films in which young people chase the desert in a mysterious bloodthirsty madman in a truck. I mean, all we have is Joy Ride, Wolf Creek, Jeepers Creepers, Monster Man and others. STOP REST may well be the worst of those. We are talking about a girl and her boyfriend, who leave their lives to start everything together in California. On the way, they stop in a dirty toilet so that the young lady can calm down, but when she comes back - she discovers that her boyfriend and his car have disappeared. From there, she learns that the culprit is a guy driving a yellow pickup truck who harasses and terrorizes her when she hides in the toilets. This film is so unoriginal that it is boring. Acting is annoying, the blood is soft, and the killer, whose identity is not revealed throughout the entire film, is not at all memorable. Terrible - a terrible movie ...
