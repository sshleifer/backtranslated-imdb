I just add this review to show that I'm not crazy - I like a lot of Vinorsky's works - Deathstalker 2, Chopping Mall, Against the Law are very dynamic and very pleasant - just to prove that I'm not blind, I have to mention it , along with some Shannon Tweed "Body Chemistry 3 or 4 or something like that," lousy - I have nothing against protracted sexual sequences, but Julie Strain's breasts are so unnatural looking that you can't not look at them - that may be the desired effect, but I did not like to look at them - and some e members of the actor seem depressed or uninterested - "Erotic Thriller" was the worst thing to happen to the low-budget film ever, and thank God that their day is more or less done.
