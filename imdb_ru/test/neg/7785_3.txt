I hate a movie that has no end. I don’t care how good or bad others can be, I don’t like to be left without a conclusion. Such shows must insist on a disclaimer ... something like: the movie you are going to watch either has no end or is so ambiguous that it is not final. <br /> <br /> In the film, the last scene in which we are. It remains to quarrel a little with Dee and Dominique, and he says, almost with regret, that I thought it could not be him, because the fingers were girls, or have a child. THEN THE END! Well, of course, the smoking gun, so to speak, is in the hands of the son of Dee, but what about the daughter of Dominic? I really thought we could discover that it was her! In any case, if you do not like inconclusive films, then I would avoid it. Otherwise, I thought the film was generally good.
