Based on the story of Ray Bradbury; a professional photographer (Brian Kerwin) returns to his modest home near a tiny deserted town where most citizens want him to stay away. The lonely boy (Jonathan Carrasco) stares at him; and two witnesses to the landing of an alien ship in a rocky desert region. Aliens are transformed into images of citizens. Kervin must convince to evacuate from the city and fall in love with the mother of a young boy (Elizabeth Pena). Acting rather shallowly; the storyline is not worse than some others; This film leaves you feeling that you are in a decent ending. The supporting lineup includes: Howard Morris, Dean Norris and Mickey Jones.
