It was Chan's first film, shot with a Monogram. What a drop in Fox values ​​and standards! I was shocked when I saw my first monogram after watching great Fox films. It's boring and not inspired by wild music, when Chan quietly walks down the street. Chan is currently working in the US Secret Service, not in the Honolulu Police Department. He is assisted by Benson Fong, who plays Tommy's 3rd son for the first time. He also has a daughter, Iris Chan, played by Marianne Couon. Mantan Morland also debuts as Birmingham Brown. He is a taxi driver in Washington, DC, here, and not the later driver Chan in later films.
