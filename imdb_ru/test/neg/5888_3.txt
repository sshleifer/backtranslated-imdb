I'm at a loss. This whole film had absolutely no meaning. It was like watching a football movie in Soderburg. Camera cutting, tempo, everything is so copied. I thought the subject was too frivolous for them to treat it as it was. Yes, we all know southerners like football and beauty contests. Should we be overwhelmed by this as an audience? I watched from behind Lee and Jay. I expected young talents gathered in the style of the Society of Dead Poets or similar to Remember the Titans. I was completely removed from the film. You did not get the characters. This was due to the nature, but for the most part you did not understand anyone's motives or their actions. Infant obsessed with being a footballer. Why is he so silent? What is his deal? Do we really need a scene with him, "proving" his heterosexuality? Why should we care? The film gave us an idea of ​​the life of these children and did not pay off with care. It just didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Why show a film about the losing team? I know that this is real life, but who makes films about losers? Give us some money for these guys, who worked so hard, as in all their "imaginable" problems. We have nothing. At the end of the film, we received a small message that Mojo had won the next year with the 3rd stringer (Lee). Why didn't you follow this story? What should we choose from this? The film brought you, but did not lead anywhere. I just felt like something was missing. It looked like a bad genetic cross between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans. At the very least, these two films have brought you somewhere. Friday Night Lights was about a team of losers who lost their star player early in the film. The actor who played it was great. You were completely annoyed with him, and that was the point, but at least you understood why. They took care of you to understand him, but he could not play, so why do we need his problems? <br /> <br /> And the other team in the playoffs ... should we believe that these are schoolchildren? These men looked like high school students or professional players at the age of 30. Who are they trying to fool? I know that the other team looked scary, but it crossed the line a bit. I liked how they negotiated with the black team, but again, how it fit into the general theme of the film. Nothing is connected. The characters knew more about each other than we did, and this is strange to me. Jay's characters had nothing to add, but he was demonstrated. It was just a mess. Not worth the movie ticket or rental.
