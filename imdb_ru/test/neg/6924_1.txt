Owen (David Krumholz) and Chloe (Denise Richards) are a young couple living in Manhattan. Owen is a fairly successful author of magazines, and Chloe is an aspiring actress. Fortunately for her, Chloe gets a big role in the sitcom and temporarily moves to Hollywood. Missing her, Owen orders a flight to Lala Land as a surprise. However, when he arrives at her filming trailer, the “house” is trembling, since Chloe and her classmate have a small romantic date. Writer and actress to the end. Offended and mad as a hatter, Owen returns to New York. Sympathizing friends decided to schedule him on a blind date with Nadine (Milla Jovovich) to get him out of his moody funk. But, it goes badly, as the duo mixes like oil and water, mainly due to the fact that everyone has a strong personality and Owen's huge shoulder chip. However, over the next few months, surprisingly, Nadine and Owen become friends who trust each other and hang out. Could this turn into something more? Well, who cares! This film is so stupid that most people pull it out of the DVD player in the first ten minutes. The script is pathetic, gloomy and, oh, stupid too. On the other hand, Krumholtz gives a very unpleasant and offensive performance. Jovovich is not much better, but who could look good with the lines she should spew? William Baldwin also reached a career minimum thanks to his coarse and insane role of Brother Owen. The only good actor is Richards, but she has to cringe, looking back at it. Well, the costumes and production values ​​are adequate. In addition, there is ONE smart element in the fact that sometimes the characters pronounce their lines, but bubbles appear over their heads with the words of what they really think. This does not save the film from the status of "bomb". Do not be stupid, dear lovers of movies and romkom. Do not rent, buy or borrow this giant turkey. Today I am the stupidest person on earth who watches this THING until the very end.
