,, and this is only if you like the look of a beautiful woman with beautiful, elastic jugs running through the so-called African jungle. So for most men there is no problem. <br /> <br /> I looked at this as one of these packages. Forget about the plot, which, in fact, is just a fragile storyline, so that our heroine showed her jugs on the screen at any opportunity. Just to give you an idea, our heroine swings from vine to vine and climbs on the best animals whenever possible for no good reason, just to show you her pitchers from all sides. Again, there are no complaints. <br /> <br /> “wrestling scenes” are ridiculous and borderline on pornographic. Our heroine was caught by the villains at least five times in the film. In cases where she has to fight, the “fight” includes mud skating, an unconvincing grunt and basically a fight like a kitten. I am surprised that I do not pull the hair. It became so bad that the main villain had to be reminded to “combatants”, that “I said that the one who receives the first blood wins!” In order not to watch silly fights anymore. <br /> <br /> Warlock Cook was a bloody blast. Being a big teddy bear at the beginning, he became manic-depressive when he was caught, and then he became a frank psychotic. He muttered the whole film without further ado. <br /> <br /> In addition to Liana (our heroine), bouncing around topless, you can also see many other Amazons, as well as one woman who decided to jump naked in the Lake for a swim without good reason. Yes, this is such a movie. <br /> <br /> Look at the beautiful Liana in her vigorous glory. Despite the fact that the film is over 20 years old, the charm of watching blond women flash their beautiful jugs on the screen will never become obsolete.
