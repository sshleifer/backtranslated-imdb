Only three words are needed for this review: A piece of shit. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed watching a cartoon as a child, you will find that this film is a waste of your time and money. The best thing in your two hours in the gym is your feet stuck to the floor. <br /> <br /> Yes, they use all the names and pick up phrases. The dog is even called the dog "Shoe Shine" (in the cartoon it is about the dog Shoe Shine). They call Polly's love interests, but she is not Miss Sweet Polly Thoroughbred. <br /> <br /> My wife and son give me drugs to see this. They had to give me drugs to see it. <br /> <br /> The original Underdog was voiced by Wally Cox, the absolute nerd. This film is voiced by someone with "an intelligent teenager who knows more than all adults." <br /> <br /> Like a single movie, it's terrible. As a tribute to Underdog, this is even worse. This is not a homage. This is not a retelling of the story. This is not a history update. This is just an attempt to cash in on a well-known name and create merchandising. The next time I go to the store, I'm afraid I will see Underdog toys, pajamas, towels, sheets, clothes, etc. McDonalds and Burger King probably fought for the right of the child to eat. <br /> <br /> However, the worst part of this film is the soundtrack. THEY MAKE A SUBMARINE SUBJECT THEME (read this with the silent "C" in the beginning)! Great, now that we are going to destroy something, let's go to the end. <br /> <br /> I knew it would probably be bad before I left. My fears were confirmed when I got to my local 12 plex and found that they opened it on the first day and first showed it to their smallest audience (and one of the four without seats in the stadium). Even the theater people knew that it would be rubbish! Save your money on tickets and invest them better by going out and buying the original series on DVD. It will be more interesting and have better production values.
