Well, when I bought this film, I thought it was the best movie, the space monkey lands on Earth and immediately starts killing people! <br /> <br /> Well, it was almost all that I expected, a typical low-budget science fiction film of the 60s. Acting must be the worst I've ever seen, especially the girl who plays the main role, and the girl who played the waitress made me laugh at my ass. <br /> <br /> So why does Night Fear not fall into the category of “so bad it is good”? The reason is that some scenes were too long and boring. For example, the scene where the police are looking for evidence in the woods, it was a minute walk without a goal. And then a grand finale, people wait for a monster about 5 minutes, and when the space monkey appears, it gets wack'd in 20 seconds, the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, Night Fear is boring, but it has a couple of funny moments. I can recommend this film to anyone who liked such films as "Zontar, Things from Venus" or "The Curse of the Swamp Being." <br /> <br /> I give “Night Fear” 4 slaps of the Cosmic monkey out of 10.. <br /> <br /> -Rob Gruesome-
