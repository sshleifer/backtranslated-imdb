Stunningly beautiful Charlotte Lewis acts in the role of a woman who is terrorized by ghosts who torment her on the phone. In horror, Charlotte is forced to confront this chilling mystery in order to save her sanity and her life. I can’t believe that Ruggiero Deodato, the director of Ultimo Mondo Cannibale, the Cannibal Holocaust and The Houses on the Edge of the Park, took this absurd piece of trash. Admittedly, Goblin’s frontman music Claudio Simonetti is pretty good, but the Story is painfully stupid. The scenario of Franco Ferrini is ridiculous and does not make sense, the acting is bad and there is absolutely no expectation. The scene in which the alleged rapist Charlotte Lewis is killed by coins thrown from the subway phone is more than funny. Do not waste your time on this piece of shit. There are much better Italian horror movies!
