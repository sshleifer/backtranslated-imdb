I believe that you can write a whole book on odyssey to remake the classic film on which this film is loosely based. When Hollywood first spoke about such an enterprise, the reaction was always negative, because there were too many aspects that could go wrong, starting with a solid ensemble that made the original unforgettable, and it is here that everything starts to deteriorate, with the choice of actresses who Otherwise, they can do a wonderful job, but which are not suitable for parts, and, unfortunately, were directed by a heavy hand of a director who does not understand or does not appreciate the source material. <br /> <br /> It seems that there is no focus or direction, or as if the chosen direction is to erase everything that was good in the original film. This is called updating, as let's exhaust the story from humor, lively dialogue and any interesting prerequisites. First of all, let us prove that women have come a long way, except that the problem is that we do not achieve (at least by watching this film) that women are really going to. <br /> <br /> For Initially, the role of Meg Ryan in the lead role turns out to be almost fatal for the film, because somehow she seems to have been in some kind of limbo when women do not really change their appearance even after 20 years work in the cinema. Her Mary, who turned out to be a difficult role in the 1930s, somehow grew out of her interaction with other stereotypes, such as Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, by studying, observing, and realizing that she had the issue. Perhaps today it was not a choice that women would celebrate, but it was a fun trip, and part of the fun was quirky, stupid, sometimes curses that lifted this film into the realm of the sublime. Here we fall to the ground with a thud. Having changed the character of Sylvia, the film has lost a lot of its spark, and this is by no means the fault of Annette Bening. I couldn't help but admire how she tried to save this sinking ship, and she had a sinking feeling when she struggled with the terrible lines she had to deal with. Fortunately, I had fun looking at some of her amazing outfits, and kept reminding myself how talented this lady really is. Her Sylvia is wise, but imperfect, and she could become a great creature. Unfortunately, Ms. English did not pay attention to her own work and is losing control over one character who could turn the film into a new direction. <br /> <br /> Yet this was not the greatest blasphemy of them all. . In the original, Joan Crawford performs probably one of the best performances of a woman. Her Crystal is legendary, with insidious lines, incendiary movements, double-faced maneuvers and some very sexy poses. She was a link between a man and a woman, and thanks to her we knew what the entire catastrophe was about. She provided tension between men and women. She was dangerous, sexy, the ultimate femme fatale. A woman of intellect whom we feared and admired, and most importantly, we wanted to destroy in order to save our heroine. Eva Mendez, no matter how gorgeous she is, is two-dimensional in this round due to poor writing and, again, due to poor casting. <br /> <br /> In the film, more atrocities, such as adding a horrific role for Mensing as a devoted mother who lives for the birth of children, and a rather annoying turn at lesbian Pinkett. Then comes the biggest waste of talent in the film, since Bette Middler, a little unrecognizable in her make-up, shows a spark of what could have been. Her sour delivery reminds us of the modern perspective of the film. Her words come to life and bring into the film a great, so necessary nonsense joke, and it is very nice to see that she can really fly, and then she will disappear. She is in the film for six minutes, and she calms down in the midst of confusion. <br /> <br /> Here is a movie that raised our level of expectation and really disappointed us, a movie that could have joined the successful Sex in the City, which made a terrific transition to the big screen because he respected his source and did not compromise. It gave us more, more and better adaptation. It really updated what made it successful before. In their current reincarnation, the “women” should return and remake themselves, just as the Hulk did this year, to find more suitable performers, a really good writer and, above all, someone who really appreciates what good films about.
