Perhaps it was the fact that I saw Spider-Man the day before I saw Duces Wild, but I don't think there could be any reason for this film to be as bad as it was. The cast was there to do it, but it seemed that as soon as they found themselves with a decent cast of actors, they should try to fit them into the film. The only problem was that they did not fit. I didnâ€™t like any of the characters, and the story was sketchy at best. I left the question of why I spent my money on this film.
