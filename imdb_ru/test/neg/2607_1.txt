Wow. After watching this film, you will understand why the youth of America still lack intellect and any features that contribute to the welfare of society, except that they are becoming more inept. <br /> <br /> “Donkey number two” - some of the stars are the most worthy performances of people who, in essence, lack any talent or brains to make something of themselves (especially Bam Manger and Steve-O) , and the only possibility of fame was to earn a living, entertaining such stupid as they are, causing harm there to be. A guy drinking horse sperm? Just disgusting. A man puts a fishing hook in the cheek and acts as a "bait" for sharks? This is not humor, this is evidence of its institutionalization. <br /> <br /> In general, I left the theater without hope of humanity.
