This “movie” will give me nightmares, I will wake up, covered in sweat, shouting “I didn’t make this film, please don't blame me!” his mom's basement for an hour or two than watch this shit. I understand that there was little money, but what the hell they thought that no thought, no plot, no effort was put into it. This film needs a warning: “Please, for God's sake, do not fund the drama department at your local JC.” On the other hand, these are the least likeable characters I've ever seen, and I've seen movies with Hitler in them. So, finally, take my advice, the next time you even think about renting, just dial a few hundred adivles and let them sleep.
