I know that this film was shown on local television when I was a child, but I cannot remember whether I watched it or not; seeing it now, considering how completely forgotten it is, I still don’t know ?? so I thought it was the first viewing! There were several films with the participation of the main character, the creation of a visionary-French writer Jules Verne; These include: 20,000 LEAGUE MORE (1954; with the role of James Mason), WORLD MASTER (1961; Vincent Price), SECRET ISLAND (1961; Herbert Lom), CAPTAIN NEMO AND UNDERWATER CITY (1969; Robert Ryan) and SECRET ISLAND CAPTAIN NEMO (1973; Omar Sharif). <br /> <br /> In this version - Oscar winner Jose Ferrer. However, even if the premise itself is not half bad ?? Waking up from the suspended animation on his Nautilus submarine, and finding himself in the modern era, Nemo takes all his ingenuity to help the US Navy in defeating megaloman Burgess Meredith ?? just as easy is his most infantile adventure! For example: five seconds in the film, assistant Meredith ?? put on a steel mask ?? says that “the world will be ours!”); No less cheerful are the zealous gestures of such a decorated dwarf, whose task is to shoot the professor's Delta-Ray - and what about those android-like minions aboard the ship Meredith who never seem to do anything? ! <br /> <br /> Ferrer manages to maintain his dignity everywhere, but Meredith is embarrassed (what is actually the repetition of his characteristics of Penguin from the television series and the 1960s Batman film), where was the budget so narrow ?? Without a doubt, mainly invested in design and poor-quality special effects, and both are clearly influenced by STAR WARS (1977) ?? that, apparently, they could not even allow him a decent suit (he looks stupid in a tie in a subwoofer)! The supporting cast includes Mel Ferrer (playing saboteur in the spirit of Joan Fontaine from other productions of Irwin Allen, “Journey to the bottom of the sea” [1961], and who participates in a routine fight with his namesake in the engine room Nautilus), Linda Day George (no wonder she is the only female character around) and Horst Buchholz (as the King of Atlantis for some reason, Nemo is obsessed with finding the famous Lost Continent). <br /> <br By the way, after the film was shot from a three-part mini-series for a theatrical exhibition, does the film clearly feel uneven ?? although one can still discern where one episode ended, and another began.
