Actually it hurts me to say that, but this film was terrible at all levels. The blame lies not only on Van Damme, as you can see, he tried his best, but let's face it, he is almost fifty, how many more can you ask him? It is so hard for me to believe that the very same people who gathered Undisputed 2; Perhaps this is the best (western) martial arts film in recent years. Everything, from the plot, dialogue, editing and ending with acting, was simply terribly connected, and in many cases simply boring and meaningless. Scott Adkins, whose fighting scenes were more like a demo, was also terribly undervalued and not even the main villain, which is so embarrassing because 1) he is more than able to play this role and 2) a real villain not only frightening at all, but also pretty annoying. Again, do not blame Van Damme. I will always be a fan, but avoid it.
