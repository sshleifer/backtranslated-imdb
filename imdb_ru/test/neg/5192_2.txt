I saw this movie 2 weeks before a snowboarding vacation, so for me it was really easy to recover during the holidays. The film boasts some excellent snowboarding skills throughout the movie in action movies. These moments were great, a bit like watching an extreme sports channel. Unfortunately, the story was pretty fair, the acting was generally good, with a rather small cast of actors. This film seems to be comedic, at least it tries to be comic, but it seems that the comedy and storyline was written by a teenager. The plot lacks depth or purpose, and the comedy struggles to be something more than just giggling a few times during the movie. It may be worth renting just to see a snowboarding action, but again there are a lot of films that are completely devoted to snowboarding tricks and do not contain a funny bad written story.
