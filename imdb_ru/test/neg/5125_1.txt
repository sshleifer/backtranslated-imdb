I am a dance teacher and was looking forward to good dance exercises in this film. How sad to be subjected to such a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I had serious problems with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alex extremely repulsive. Beals face is so young, sweet and innocent, and it is very incompatible with Alex’s very disturbing depravity, especially in this disgusting restaurant scene. She also has outbursts of baby's anger. It is very hard to believe that Nick will continue to return to such a capricious teenager after her frequent ranting and delirium, especially after she opens the door of a moving car and throws the stylet at him, preferring to go home - in the middle of the road - with only one shoe !!! But what about her idiotic behavior after a night in ballet. In fact, the whole novel was very disturbing - a 30-year-old man was chasing a girl who is about 16 years old. <br /> <br /> As for dancing, I'm afraid this style of the 80s is completely outdated. What the hell was this dance television sequence in the club? Who was supposed to dance? I was not even sure that this is a woman or a man in a drag! And even this famous final sequence is rather disappointing, especially given the listening context for the ballet troupe. Camera shots of her jump actually destroy its effect, because you cannot see what she is doing. And what did she do when she walked past each panel, pointing to them? And, as noted in many other comments, she will NEVER get into a ballet troupe because of this audition - perhaps that is why in the end they don’t say whether it was successful or not, the closing is a fact that she eventually overcame her fear. From Flashdancers, I really thought that the best sequence belonged to Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You could see that she was a real dancer, and her acrobatics were very impressive. This, of course, if you can get past her terrible costume and makeup. <br /> <br /> There were two good points in this film - ballet dancers stretch when Alex first auditions - they look so cute and stylish, and at least it helps to highlight the difference between her current dance career and the one she seeks. Another good scene was breakdance on the street. I also liked the skater's parents, they were funny. <br /> <br /> A few other random moments - who was Hannah and how did Alex meet her? That the 18-year-old lived in a converted warehouse alone? How could she afford this lovely bar and all the furniture? Where is her family? Was this scene in the naked club really necessary? The man who wrote in his commentary that it was something like a Disney movie needs to study its head. And in general, what happened to the skater? <br /> <br /> Many people said that the film was bad, but they liked the message - do not lose hope, keep trying, and your dreams will come true. Watch the Mermaid instead.
