I would give it a zero. Of course, I admit that I, too, mistakenly took it, thinking that it was Spielberg's version. A clever marketing ploy releasing it at this time and a prominent display in the video store. However, I was still ready to try - I would not want to. <br /> <br /> How to start? I read some other reviews here and have to say that I disagree with anyone who thinks that any game was good - sorry, even K. Thomas Howell smelled. None of the speeches was good. No one. <br /> <br /> Even if the game was decent, the dialogue is terrible! “Ginormus” and “dick skinners” simply do not fit into this. <br /> <br /> As for the story - it was terribly adapted and must have been edited by a 5-year-old child. The main character is constantly faced with situations that are comfortable - or at least appear due to the way the film was edited together. For example, he is trying to get to a place called New Hope to find his brother. During a short break, someone just randomly passes on instructions to New Hope. What the heck is that? When he gets to New Hope, he just stumbles upon his dying brother. Then there is the part where he traveled far from his destination for several days and just happened to come across a car in which his wife and son were traveling. He was going in a different direction than they were, how did this car get where it was? He has a black backpack that randomly appears and disappears throughout the entire film. There are parts of the film where the characters wake up in the morning, and after two seconds the night comes - or, even worse, at sunset the next day. I also can not forget that the main character and a preacher for no reason fail through the floor of the house - we will not know until an alien has appeared in the house. Which reminds me of the moment when they walk and suddenly find themselves under a stranger whom they do not notice. What the hell, aliens look like double-decker with huge bodies and lots of legs - how could they miss it? There is one moment when an alien kills a random citizen, allegedly spitting on him some rubbish - but you never see a thing take off, it just appears on the guys face. Special effects are generally terrible. The whole movie is like a bad "train wreck". When we finally get to the end, after this guy tries to get to DC to find his family, they just appear. No search, no questions asked, nothing. Just, oh, here I am, I'm so happy - the end. <br /> <br /> I’m sorry if my review is a little loose, but this film was so bad that it was difficult for me to organize my contempt. Please save time and do not look at this hidden bunch of cinematic stench. Perhaps this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I would prefer to get a root canal - that would be less painful.
