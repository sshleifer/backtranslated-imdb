My wife and I watched this film because we are planning to visit Sicily and Stromboli soon. Fortunately (or unfortunately), the landscape and seascape (complete with tuna) are the only plausible participants in this composition. We expected a sensible well-written and well-played film, but were disappointed. His only saving grace is an extended and remarkable fishing sequence, full of authenticity: spouting tuna, nets, wooden boats with long oars and passionate, albeit superstitious, fishermen. <br /> <br /> The sequence of the film is stagnant, its dialogue is nonsense, and the action ranges from harsh to completely “over the top.” One scene in which Bergman stresses how her macho, native and naive husband sings his ferret in an “innocent” (but apparently already dead) rabbit would be an ideal figure for Monty Python's parody. <br /> <br /> When Vulcan blew up, we hoped for a merciful end to the suffering (ours and the blind). Unfortunately, the film continues to unfold, and finally strikes melodramatic and absurd finale. If you really dislike old tuna fishing, skip this ridiculous attempt.
