This is the worst movie I've ever seen. And I saw a lot of movies. My friends and I rented this Sunday night. Man, we had a lot of fun. This movie is the worst, most boring nonsense I've ever seen. But it makes you laugh! You will lie on the floor, rolling around, trying to get some air. You wonder why? Just rent it and check if the girl is playing the keyboard in this dirty Russian bar. My mother made the best film about 1000 times how she feeds cats.
