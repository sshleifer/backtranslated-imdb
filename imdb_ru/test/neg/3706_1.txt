The Capture Of Bigfoot is one of the most stupid and worst films of all time. I love Sasquatch and Bigfoot films, but this film is a waste of time. Awful, terrible, terrible! I watched this movie last night, and that was all I could do to finish watching. I realized that this strange madman wanted to capture a snowman, but it was the only thing that made sense in this film. Although there were some funny parts in it. There was this very crappy and banal disco club with a very bad disco dance that seemed to go on for too long in a movie. I think the director was trying to fill the time. Worst of all, it looked like a snow man. The obvious man in the suit looked like a pink faux snow snowman. That was funny. If you want to watch a very bad snowman movie Then I suggest you buy this movie. Personally, I wasted my time and money on this film!
