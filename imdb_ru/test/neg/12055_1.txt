But I can't say that I really feel for this pile of steaming manure. Where to start The quality of the film is not there. I saw clearer photos on the funniest videos in America! The game is poor quality, the effects of blood are in order. The clown mask is the best part of this film, the story repeats. The same thing over and over again. At least on Friday the 13th or HALLOWEEN we stick to one main character for the most part. There are no main characters, only victims. Dude, now we come to the worst part of everything. The last survivor kills the clown and finds out that it was one of her friends. Then, when the police finally arrive, they do not believe her, and she is locked in a rubber room. What an ending you call it, shit, that's what. In my opinion, there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie, it was just a careless writing. Justification: "It must end badly, this is a horror film." or “We must put an end to this in order to leave it open for continuation” - that’s just lame excuses, that's all. I have to give the BLOOD CAMP THANKS TO TURKEY.
