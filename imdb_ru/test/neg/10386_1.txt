Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small town's ranch where teenager Isabel (Christine Erickson) is haunting, covered in dog blood. Her parents Eli (Randy Colton) and Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell) own a ranch and are very worried about their daughter, she was not herself recently and was considered dangerous for herself and others. Rancho and ex-priest Miguel (Del Zamora) recognize Isabel's symptoms as a possible case of obsession, and when she begins to speak ancient Latin in a strange voice, he becomes convinced of this. Blanche calls priest Jacob (Cameron Daddo), the ex-husband of her other daughter Claire (Madison Taylor), to see Isabel, he confirms Miguel’s suspicions and takes on the job of executing a spell that we hope will drive the demon into Isabel and the innocent girl to freedom. .. <br /> <br /> Director Ethan Willey I sat there in my house in front of my TV channel and watched the exorcism in Blackwater Valley, and I kept asking the same question over and over again, why I was doing it. Why do I continue to watch all these terrible low-budget horror films that look as if they were filmed on a video camera? To be honest, let's face it, "Exorcism in the Blackwater Valley" is a complete and shameless robbery of the Exorcist (1973), and you literally mark the main plot points that are shared by both. There is a possessed teenage girl who starts to get very excited and offer inappropriate things, a demon who uses past offenses against others, worried parents, the way a possessed girl avoids doctors, a priest with a problem past and an obsessive girl is tied to her bed among other things . I assume that the exorcism of Blackwater Valley is different (except that it is complete nonsense) in that it tries to give all the characters some time on the screen and tries to understand how the situation affects them, but it is so poorly written and acted that it’s just turns out to be boring. The film begins with the fact that Isabelle is already obsessed, so we never knew what she looked like an ordinary person, so we never care about her or what happens to her, the other characters are poorly written and specified. At times I wondered if the exorcism in the Blackwater Valley was fraudulent, there is a silly scene in which the vet tries to calm the obsessed Isabelle with equestrian tranquilizers, and after he declares that she needs a “small injection”, he enters his room with a huge hidden needle behind his back! There are several scenes in which people beat their fists, accompanied by a silly comedic sound effect. As a result, the film has an uneven hue, because it goes between a silly parody and a serious horror drama, or at least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> For some texts, before the opening credits, Blackwater Valley exorcism was based on “Actual events”, yes, the correct factual events of 1973 that occurred in the film “The Exorcist” ... This text fragment also states that the scenes of the exorcism were controlled by a real priest. There is not even decent blood or exploitation to revive things, there is a scene of a cut hand, there is a dead dog, someone is slaughtered with a crucifix, and that is all. There is also nothing wrong with it, despite the fact that the demon is trying to be offensive. I think the only reason why an exorcism in Blackwater Valley has an adult rating is in one very short scene in which a pair of breasts are visible. One pair of naked female breasts is not worth the time to watch it, or the money you could spend on it. There is no need for the film, there is no atmosphere and a really amateur feeling. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 1,000,000, I must say that I’m wondering where all the money went, the film looks terrible and cheap in everything. There are no special effects to talk about & production values ​​are the bottom. The acting game is very meager among all participants, the favorite genre of Jeffrey Combs gets almost the maximum score during the opening credits, but he has nothing but cameos, which is about five minutes of screen time. Even he must have been afraid how bad it might be, if he hides behind a mustache and a terrible accent, he is better than that. <br /> <br /> Exorcism in the Blackwater Valley is the complete meanness of the Exorcist without everything that made this film so classic and the creators, anyway were thirty-five years late. Common turkey from start to finish.
