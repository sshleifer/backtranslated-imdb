I watched this movie last night, I'm a big fan of the book, and I was very pleased with the version that Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon starred in. But it's just terrible. My God, I donâ€™t understand how they dared to break this classic story and make the characters completely different, starting with the fact that Beth became the younger sister and Amy became the third. And Joe's interpretation is terrible, Joe was a feminist, intelligent and slightly angry young lady, and the actress Joe in this film acts like a silly and very annoying little girl. And what about Lori in the war? I agree with the fact that when a book turns into a film, it is necessary to make some changes, but not to rewrite the whole story. very, very poorly done.
