A cinema with a bad history of past horrible murders reopens. Of course, the bloody killings begin anew. Written, directed, filmed, downtrodden and edited with the terrifying lack of talent and dexterity of Rick Sloan, who without special talent (who later disgraced celluloid a little more with absolutely terrible "Hobgoblins"), this terrible attempt to stab a vile parody of something rotten in all imaginable senses: painfully sluggish rhythm, painfully static, granular cinematography (there is a smelly excess of dull master-frames in everything), annoyingly buzzing and excessive hum'n'shiver account, flat (un) direction, tiring a talkative and harmless scenario, groaning sense of humor, causing a moan, low-browed humor, uncompromising murderous plots, it is a pity not terrible murderer (he's just some wizened old man in the pasty make-up), equally unpleasant and unsavory characters, unsatisfactory unexpected ending and lifeless performance significantly boring cast - all this ensures that watching this wavy swimming will be as fun and rewarding as eating rancid raw eels drenched with sour vinegar. This rudeness is completely lacking the necessary coarse charm and vile energy necessary for a pleasant junk. Instead, it’s just a soft, dense, and tortuous gesture that never lights up and doesn’t even become remotely funny in such a crappy, smoking manner. Only a little nakedness and the delightful presence of the always trustworthy Maria Voronova as the stinging sardonic secretary provide a slight relief from the common viciousness of this lousy loser.
