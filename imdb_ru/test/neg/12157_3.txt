I've been waiting for this movie for a while. On the first day of the broadcast in Turkey, I looked at it. It was completely a disappointment for me. I was planning to watch a historical film, but the one on the screen was fictional. First of all, the main character of the film Cengiz Khan, the great conqueror, was portrayed as a soft, calm, even a loser. You may not feel the power in the film. Historically, the military machine created by him was conquered by more (even more) of the world known in those years. To do this, Cengiz first unites the Asian tribes. However, in the film, this loser in one scene is a poor single, and in the second he commands armies. The war scenes were incredibly weekly. In the final battle, the Mongol horsemen used double swords at their sides and slashed the enemy. :) As a result, my friends and I just laugh at these scenes. Mongolian army means Mongolian rifleman. You can not see it in the film. Another nuisance is the use of fantastic elements in the film. I do not want to go into the scenes that portrayed Cengiz as a prophet. It can be said in the integrity of the film, it is acceptable. However, the scenes where the old monk saw the future and went in search of Cengiz Khan's wife after Cengiz gave him the task are really funny. When the monk died in the desert, Cengiz's wife felt dead and found a corpse on the continent. Are we talking about Asia ?? We laughed again. There are many more things to say, but I do not feel that this film has value to say more.
