How someone can praise this rude version of the film after watching the amazing VODERLUS BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Myra May Clark is far from the role that Vivien Lea played in the remake. She plays an ordinary American girl with a Brooklyn accent, and the “Yes” answers are a bit annoying when someone expects a less rude character. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (exposed in the final credits as KENT DOUGLASS) is incredibly unlikely when a soldier fights with her, no matter how many times she lets him down. Bette Davis does not play any role in some part. <br /> <br /> Their melodramatic encounters during the last twenty minutes of the film are incredible (extravagant bits of reappraisal) - even considering the fact that this is coarser than the Story version when the sound was only a few years old, but the quiet game was still in fashion . <br /> <br /> Just awful. And this suddenly ends with Clark losing his life during the bombing of the bridge. The end. <br /> <br /> He has none of the beautifully shaded performances in the remake of MGM 1940, including the cast. Instead, he has low-budget performance (and I mean the budget with shoes) without any subtlety. And in the scene where Myra tells the aristocratic lady why not marry her son, Roy, there is no courage in advance. She simply says: "I picked him up on the Waterloo Bridge." Explanation is over. There is nothing brave there. <br /> <br /> To sum up: this time the original is not the best version. VIVIEN LEIGH and ROBERT TAYLOR have never been surpassed by Myra and Roy in the gentle, elegantly played 1940 classic film.
