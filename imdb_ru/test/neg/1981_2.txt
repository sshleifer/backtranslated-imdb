First, I will say that I will be as subjective as I can. <br /> <br /> There will be potential spoilers ahead, so be careful. <br /> <br /> I almost never watch movies, but this one, in particular, I felt I had to consider. This Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children film, based on the ultra-popular RPG (Final Fantasy VII) for the PS1, has been around for quite some time. After many years of hype and dozens of trailers (none of which I have ever seen, I only saw shots), this film made the legions of fans really excited when they saw their favorite characters on the big screen. I myself played and finished the game several times, like any good fan, and, being such a movie fan, I was very excited. So I thought to myself: "WHAT CAN GET WRONG?". <br /> <br /> Well, the film began normally in the first 20 minutes, but then everything went out of control as the film progressed. Without a doubt, this is the best CGI animation, but it does not help a weak plot, undeveloped characters and more lenient action scenes. <br /> <br /> Here is the story basically. These three silver-haired nannies in the skin, who have nothing to do with the game, are presumably clones of Sephiroth (he is the villain of the game who allegedly killed all of his alleged clones), for some reason trying to kidnap all the children, which was not quite explained well, probably to gather an army (of children?) They also focus part of the story on some child named Denzel, I don't know who this child is, or what its meaning is, he just seems depressed all the time. Thus, Sefirot clones also participate in some kind of pattern, including some kind of disease called geostigma, which affects only children. It seems that this disease causes boredom and a slight discoloration of the skin. <br /> <br /> Now Cloud has to save the day from these guys. Apparently, Cloud and his teammates have learned to fly, I was a little offended that these characters fly around the city, fight the dragon and constantly land on his feet. Perhaps, if the film was not so unsurpassed, then you can relax in it, and then they may be surprised by something incredible. The real problem with this movie is logic. Now I know what you say: “But this is called Final FANTASY! It must have these ideas! ”Well, this is a stupid way to think, the game is based on some kind of reality, and the film should end in this CONTEXT. The context and logic in this film are contradictory, I could explain all this, but if I did, I would end up writing the script. <br /> <br /> Also, some of the scenes in this film were extremely contrived and banal. for example, when all the characters from the game appear at the very last moment for their mandatory screen time, so as not to upset the fans. They appear, do it a little bit and pretty much have no meaning in the story. <br /> <br /> If this is too long, here’s a simpler review: <br /> <br /> the pros are the first 20 minutes of first-class cgi animation, decent action scenes visually stunning <br /> <br /> cohesive for an indulgent action / unbalanced action (leaves the viewer exhausted at the climax) weak plot of superhuman characters = no waiting j-rock soundtrack / score (what happened to the orchestra?) Terrible ending <br /> <br /> BIG TIME SPOILER- <br / > <br /> Now the final of this film really disappointed me. they could pass a really cool and sweet finale, where a cloud dies and meets an aeris in the afterlife, but after a great battle at the end, the cloud hits in the back, a kind of wound, where a bullet pulls out of the chest. then the cloud gets its hundredth memory in the film, and then wakes up in a pool of lifestream. (now I remember the lifestream in the game, but he didn’t have resurrection properties, if he had, they could bring the aeris back to life, thus creating a completely different story) so that the cloud would return to life and everyone would have a party and dive to the pool, and we have an incredibly pleasant sign / moment of life. <br /> <br /> There are no moments in the film. Its worth seeing for its visual effects. but that's all. <br /> <br /> except that this is not a very good movie. This is strictly for blind fans of the game. not for people who are not indifferent to the plot, character and story.
