I made this film because it caught my attention as a film with a focus on Jewish comedy - something I had not seen before. <br /> <br /> I approached this film with an open mind and became interested in how it began. The discovery is well structured, and the first half of the film gave me a lot to laugh about, and that’s good. <br /> <br /> However, soon the humor began to repeat, the plot became confused and tense, and I realized that I no longer enjoy the film. I tried not to say it, but the film became rather “cheap” - not a bad thing for a comedy, if humor stands, but it is not. I confess that I may have missed some of the humor, not being a Jew myself and not having much experience in Jewish culture. Nevertheless, considering how heavily the main part of the humor is wired in this film, I hardly missed much. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, and perhaps, if a little more was invested in the film, the thought would be watchable throughout. I would like to give the film a higher rating, but, strictly speaking, it would be better if it was a series or a series. Just not enough fresh material for the full-length film. <br /> <br /> One thing about the casting - the main role looked as if it was conceived by Ben Stiller, but I don’t think the film would be more useful if it were in it.
