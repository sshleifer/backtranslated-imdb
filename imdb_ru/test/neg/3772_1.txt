This film is an incredibly indulgent character who suggests that a simple impression of a story is as good as a true story. It was extremely painful to watch, and if I hadnâ€™t been pulled in to buy a DVD because of John Travolta and positive buzz, I would not have finished watching it. <br /> <br /> This film is nothing like an interesting premise and seems to rely on weighty (and, frankly, hard) characteristics. There is one scene of the quarrel between Portslan and Bobby Long in which the TV is destroyed, and when it plays, it is incredibly sluggish and inopportune. <br /> <br /> I cared less and less about the characters while I watched it. It was probably a lot of fun at the film school to do it. But looking terribly boring. Awesome film school project that you shouldn't spend money on.
