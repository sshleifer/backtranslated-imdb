This is a road movie. At the very least, the film is in yellow, and I think it says about the road film (?). I can not say much positive about the delivery. This is bad, of course, their English. The camera looks like it was made by a child, there is a bomb with a counter, and suddenly the beetle falls from the sky. Since it was so cliché, we all laughed all the time - and it was the funniest thing in the film. This film should be released in America, but I'm not sure that you should go, because it may indicate that we are producing exactly this quality. The blasts look boring. Basically, it's over. Everything is too much: yellow quality, sound, baby, etc. Find all the clichés in other films, put them together and get The Delivery.
