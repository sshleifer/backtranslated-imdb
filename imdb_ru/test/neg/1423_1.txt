Jerry Lewis was a little funny when he didn’t write his own material and had a good director such as Frank Tashlin. When he began writing and directing his own films, his little talent was overshadowed by his selfishness. Whenever his films failed (and deservedly) in the American market (they made money in France), Lewis always blamed everyone and everything except himself; for example, he blamed the failure of this film on the fact that he was, according to Lewis, released on a double count with the porn feature “Deep Throat”. If someone had to complain about this situation, it was supposed to be the producers of "Deep Throat". This is an absolutely idiotic "comedy" about the richest man in the world (Lewis), who is rejected for military service during World War II and decides to equip a special "detachment" to go to Germany and capture Hitler himself. In addition to the many flaws in this film (the script is stunningly unmixed, Lewis 'directing' does not exist, the film looks like a cheap home-made film), Lewis obviously thought he was surrounding himself with the mediocre, overly good Borscht Belt comics, such as Ian Murray and Sydney Miller, was a good idea; he must have thought they would be so bad, they would make him look good. He was half right; they are terribly bad, but it turns out even worse than they are. For “comedy,” the Lewis character is sullen, angry and energetic; the way he insults his subordinates makes one wonder why they will follow such an intimidating tug in such a dangerous mission as an attempt to capture Hitler. The fact that this film took any money is simply amazing. This is definitely the worst Jerry Lewis film I've ever seen - I heard that Slapstick is even more pitiful, but I can't bring myself to see if this is true or not - and it should be avoided at all possible costs.
