Dude, are you serious? Have you read a book or watched this movie? Well, if you did, let me warn you, this is fake. Mark Furman has been looking for a job since he lost his job at LAPD. Do you remember him? He was the guy who lied on the stand and gave the defense of OJ Simpson the foothold they were looking for. Well, he has written three books since. I read all three of them. No, I'm not a fan, they gave me. HOWEVER, I will tell you one similarity in all three, they strongly distort the importance of Mark Furhman. He shamelessly exaggerates his height in all three. In Murder in Spokane, he pretends that he had something to do with the capture of the killer when he had nothing to do with it. In all the books he has great pleasure in suppressing the efforts of local law enforcement. It seems like his efforts were interrupted in the court of OJ. In this film, many slow shots that look at Furman and crave him. Many other pictures put him in the spotlight, although in fact I am sure that the only thing people thought about at the time was: â€œHey, isn't it the racist who made OJ get off? It was an interesting real-life story, but not a good movie above it.
