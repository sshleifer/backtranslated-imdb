This film was recently televised by Turner Classic Cinema. This may have been considered colorful in its time, and may have made money, but even the most staunch fan of Jane Russell will be difficult to sit through this dreck. <br /> <br /> There are many movie musicals from the 1950s that can withstand the test of time, although they are dated by modern standards, but still can be enjoyed thanks to good music or dancing or a funny plot. The “French line,” however, fails in all these aspects. <br /> <br /> It doesn’t matter that Russell was a great singer when she was given lousy vocal material. The whole cast is fascinated by a boring, banal plot and dialogue. <br /> <br /> You should not even record and skip only musical numbers - they are smelly.
