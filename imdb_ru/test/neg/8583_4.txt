For a horror movie, it's criminally boring. A few unforgettable, horrendous bits can't make up for a really bad scenario. Very little coherence is achieved, and the film is steadily superimposed on one main idea (the killer cat) until it becomes repetitive - and things get worse thanks to the constant use of pictures from a cat's point of view.
