This film could have been much better if they hadn’t used Brian Conley as a gangster, and if they hadn’t started the film with Christopher Biggins. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie, I had absolutely no idea what was going on. There were too many double crosses and plot twists to make the movie believable. The film deserves 0, but since I don’t have 0, I gave it 1. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this film to my worst enemy, I would prefer to stick out some rusty scissors eyes than watch this movie again . I tell you that it was one and a half hours of my life, I will not return. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a gangster movie, do not take it. Instead, watch for “Leaving the big time” or “Locking, stock and two smoking barrels”.
