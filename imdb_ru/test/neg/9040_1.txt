The only reason I checked out this film was to see the “early” Kim Bassinger. This and the fact that my TV guide said it was an “exciting expectation,” and it was three stars. The rating must have come from the person who wrote this nonsense, because the only expectation in this film was whether I finished it or not. Robert Culp turns into something that should be a “catastrophe” of his cop career, which is hard to believe. At some point, EVERY suspect, including a frail old woman. If you want to consciously go to see a poorly written, badly-directed, badly-acting film ... then do it. This can make you appreciate good films in comparison. I wish I had that hour and thirty-six minutes ago.
