"First Snow" has an intriguing beginning. The traveler tells the fate of the old man, whose predictions are surprisingly true. From this point on, the film plays out as a bloated episode of the Twilight Zone. I mean only car trips, phone calls and paranoia. William Fichtner gives his usual interesting performance, but Guy Pierce is not a sympathetic character at all, ignoring the welfare of other people for the sake of his own paranoia. The ending is especially weak, with absolutely no reward for a long-suffering audience. Do yourself a big favor and avoid it. Not recommended. - MERK
