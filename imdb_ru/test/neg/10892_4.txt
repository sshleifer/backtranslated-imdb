As horror movies show, “Rest Stop” could be better on many levels. Director / writer John Shiban shows that he probably had the best intentions when he started it. Unfortunately, either he was not sure what to do with the material, or perhaps pressure was put on him to put a film different from what he intended, either in the studio or in patrons. Several endings were included on the DVD, but unfortunately, the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​psychos roaming the back roads of a remote part of California presents many opportunities at first. After Jess disappears into a creepy rest stop, things get out of control. Poor Nicole is left alone to stand up for herself all the wonders that she will find along the way. <br /> <br /> When it became clear that the “Amazing Grace” had begun to be heard in the background, there were forces trying to avenge the ways. in which Nicole and Jess desecrate their neck in the woods, engaging in careless sex, which is not very appreciated by the natives. <br /> <br /> Watch this at your own risk. For fans of the genre a lot of blood.
