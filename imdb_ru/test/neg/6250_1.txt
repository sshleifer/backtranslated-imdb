Before I start, I have to let you know that I love horror movies with passion. LOVE THEM! I have seen thousands, and rarely anyone comes that I do not like. I really forgive the horror genre. One of the greatest lines in film history is the film “Ed Wood,” where Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) goes crazy and screams at overly critical producers after commenting on Plan 9’s cheap sets and continuity problems: do ". I do not know anything! Have you never heard of the “suspension of disbelief?!” “Well, I try to bring this philosophy of“ suspension of disbelief ”with me to every horror movie I see, and it usually works. Unfortunately, this did not work for me during the screening of the movie "Cheerleaders Massacre." <br /> <br /> First Strike: <br /> <br /> The first thing you will notice in this “film” is that it was captured on video and has this disgusting style of handheld digital home camera. The camera's performance and quality are so bad that day soaps look amazing. In fact, this makes Troma and Full Moon video releases look good. And that's bad. <br /> <br /> Second strike: <br /> <br /> Jim Winsky. This “filmmaker” probably imagines himself to be split off from old Corman, but nothing could be further from the truth. Roger Corman shot quickly, violently and with a limited budget, but managed to create a dense original film. Although Vinorsky produces a cheap film, he deceives his viewers (and, possibly, other artists), steals whole fragments of James Horner's musical scores “Humanoids from the Deep” and “Battle for the Stars” and improperly dumps them into the cheerleaders' carnage. On the back of the artwork and during the opening credits, the musical score is falsely attributed to Dan Savio (additionally in Vinorsky’s movie "Deathstalker II"). You will also notice how Cheerleader Massacre jumps from video to movie and back when Vinorsky shoots whole scenes from the Massacre Slumber Party and Humanoids From the Deep. Wynorsky used this deception fourteen years ago in his horrible version of "Not From This Land." <br /> <br /> Beat the third (you have already left): <br /> <br /> While the slaughter of cheerleaders does it I have some nudity (40-year-olds play adolescents and the largest set of fake breasts, I've ever seen in a horror movie, ugh), murders are relatively bloodless. What the hell is all this? The film is called “Cheerleader Massacre”, but a few murders behind the scenes, in my opinion, do not entail massacre. It does not even entail a bad mosquito bite. <br /> <br /> The story of the “film” is fair enough - an invisible killer pursues a group of fans (old girls playing teenagers) until the van runs out of gas. and the "girls" are forced to linger in a secluded two-story mountain house. I will not spoil your finale, but this is one of those “films” where a person who is clearly a murderer is not a murderer. The cheerleader’s massacre would have been great if it had been shot in a movie directed by Joseph Zito and had special effects by Tom Savini. Instead, this is Je Vinorsky, a parody of frames without video. Oh. <br /> <br /> Please, please do not buy or rent this abomination. If we continue to support these clowns, the more this inept video trash they will produce. Get out and rent “The Prowler”, “Last House on a dead end street”, “Brad” or “Burning”. You will be glad you did.
