When I first saw it, I thought it was a joke. All I could think was: “You will get an 8 mm camera, I will take my younger brother's monster toys, we will make a film!” Why would someone in modern times, like 2001, make such a science fiction film, it seems He was shot in the early 80s. With the same wooden actors as an Indian cigar store, a script written by the director’s 4-year-old son, a camera stolen from a burning pawn shop, special effects below the poverty line and, to top it all, a director who thought making this crap would make them famous. The end result was not impressive, full of poor dialogue and continuity. Venus must have been fun, and I’m sure everyone involved was delighted with their stupid little movie. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 for valiant, hopeless effort. <br /> <br />
