Although I used to watch it on Italian television, I found it to be a surprisingly tolerable bowler this time, supported by an international group of familiar faces (including the stunned Joseph Cotten as a baron) and, contrary to many, another Euro-Cult sub-genre film, filled with episodes, not sluggish career. <br /> <br /> The creature itself looks a bit crafty, and Cotten is too old to be taken seriously. an impatient scientist, still fascinated by the creation of life forms from corpses (one would think that he would have made their army of them and would not have fought to improve her technique so far), but Miss Neri looks good both in costume and out of costume and trustworthy, Herbert Fuchs is probably best shown as a lecherous robber / blackmailer.
