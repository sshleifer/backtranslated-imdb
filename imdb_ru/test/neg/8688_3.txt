The VHS cover for The Evil Below makes it look like a cool underwater horror movie. Unfortunately, he is closer to a boring adventure film and does not have real elements of horror. It begins with some divers who are attacked, and we see some blood, but this is the only blood in the whole film. <br /> <br /> The Evil Below is not the worst, but for a horror movie. it's tediously boring. The game is decent, and, frankly, the only thing that keeps you is a developing romance between the two leading ones. There are several nightmares where it seems that the director did not know what to do. I managed to sit through it all (almost), but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Horror fans may want to get a copy for a cool VHS poker, but itâ€™s better to leave it at that.
