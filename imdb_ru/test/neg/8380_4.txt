Thirdly, few brass students have a dad who cooks in their dorm. Fourthly, as soon as the SECOND member of the small college team project meets a violent demise, the college PRESIDENT will dissolve the entire class and DO NOT close their eyes, as the professor cheers the rest of the group toward horrible death. Since the supernatural elements of CULT have absolutely no meaning, it is useful to study the mundane content of this film in order to truly appreciate how this film really sucks!
