I feel a contradiction about this film - this is one of the most beautiful films I have seen, and it gives an insightful look at the lost culture. There was an early scene of men wearing caps and mustaches sitting at the table, with a woman serving and playing the accordion that caused tears in my eyes, simply because she captured a lifestyle that must be incomprehensible to many today. This represents the lives of the characters as inextricably linked with the life of the village, another lost concept in the modern world. Symbolism is always fun, but it seems a bit dated. For me, the fatal flaws of the film were the absence of any convincing dramatic attraction and the complete lack of humor. It never seemed to me that I know any of the heroes, except for the simplest universal things, such as grief because of the loss of a loved one, etc. People were figures in directorial films related to natural disasters, war, etc. The film was just one beautiful tragic scene after another, without the involvement of the narrative thread and without humanity. As a result, it seemed very abstract, not related to the life of real people. In the end, I was too bored to finish watching.
