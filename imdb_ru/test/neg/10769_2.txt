By now, I have read almost all the books and have seen music in two different languages. I absolutely adore everything I was familiar with before. But lately, I ran out of resources to support my imagination. I still have a few books, but they are either on the way or are a continuation, which I am in no hurry to read. So it dawned on me: immerse me! There are films that I did not watch! Therefore, I must immediately see them. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes of this series were ... acceptable. In fact, I quite enjoyed the change in the cause of the denunciation, no matter how different it might seem. From there, everything went down. Chauvin was too ... stupid? And, dare I say, too old for this role. Not that dark and dashing figure with his terrible or-or. (And what was it with the random bed scene with his image? It was too creepy - not his only love - Madame Guillotine, and his only interest - his work and his only obsession - Sir Percy?) Margarita ... The most beautiful woman in France? The smartest woman in Europe? I think no. Although, no matter what made her break into the office of Sir Percy, I have no idea. And what did my Lord Tony do to deserve this death? Yes, each member of the League promised his life to Sir Percy, but he would never endanger one of them and would not run away like a coward when his dear friend is in mortal danger. And if somehow he had to mourn his companion, he would have done it, grieving, and not just went on, as if nothing had happened. Which brings me to another question, Sir Percy. His image was the worst. He was not a lazy guy, nor a valiant and elusive hero who is a master of transformation. Nor did he care much about ties (his pronunciation of this single word made my ears bleed) And he never killed anyone with his own hands. So what happened to him when he accidentally strolled and killed people? <br /> <br /> The costumes were too bright for that period of time. This is post-revolutionary France, of which we speak! Not pre-revolutionary. People in such dresses stand out from the crowd quite easily. It was all just ... ha! <br /> <br /> Although, I have to admit, after seeing the other parts, my opinion has changed a bit. Seeing this as a separate work, independent of the Scarlet Pimpernel series, it was tolerable. Just your second average hero in a mask. But for the fact that they tried to convey it, it is still a pity.
