OK, the end of the story - all the killings were a joke on the main character, and no one really died. Yes, I know that Cry Wolf did it and did it well, but this is not "Cry Wolf", this is "Scream Crap"! Despite the fact that the “characters” obviously do not die, we SEE that they are killed (and in other ways they are killed), although these “killings” do NOT occur as anyone can see them. Mr. Director, if you want to show how people are killed, someone needs to see it, if they are behind the scenes and a character who is pretended to be killed, alone, it does not work - and until the end I liked a couple of scenes but your end destroyed everything this. <br /> <br /> The game is terrible (especially the child at the beginning, who really thinks that he deceived his friends, believing that they are playing with his dead grandmothers brains), the script is less ... half baked (although, if half-baked, you might like the movie), the only reason I gave this movie 3 is that a) they really did something b) they released it and c) filmed it yes you read it Yes, they spent (at least) $ 5,000 on film for this shit. Sadly, if they shot DV, they would have some money for a better cast and another writer to go through the script and make it good. <br /> <br /> I admire the fact that the director did something (as most do not), but it IS necessary that he comes to IMDFB, telling about how “original” the film is. <br /> <br /> Avoid the movie, if it means to buy it, to see if a friend has it, it can be a funny movie to borrow.
