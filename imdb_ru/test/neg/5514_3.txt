As hinted at by several posters, this is the pitiful plagiarism of Star Wars. Now, if you're going to thwart Star Wars, at least do it right; Battlestar Galactica did, and there were several other space operas that didn't do a bad job of it, but this is definitely not one of them. David Mendenhall, the juvenile affairs leader, is not really that bad, although he often ignores the “cute” factor. Vince Edwards hasn't improved much as an actor since his "Ben Casey"; in any case, it is even more wooden than he was ten years old. Other performances also have nothing to talk about. Even worse are the special effects; the best you can say about them is that they are lousy. It is obvious that the "aliens" are just actors wearing rubber masks with a small amount of foam or latex worn on them, and the "battle" scenes between Edwards raiders and aliens are ill-prepared and poorly shot. Very weak effort of Roger Corman. Skip this.
