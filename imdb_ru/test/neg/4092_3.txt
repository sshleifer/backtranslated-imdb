The biggest problem with this film is that it is nothing more than Bruce Almighty. The first film played on the imagination of every dreamer that he can control his surroundings on his own. However, the experience of Evan is completely different. He has no control with which Jim Carrey is fooling, and instead the story centers around the power of faith. Now it would be good, since the first film preached the same message. The problem is that the sequel preaches at the expense of comic relief. And, to add insult to injury, it also throws into politics in a conspiracy. You have the distinct feeling that there is a clear message in this film, and its main goal is not to make you laugh. Summing up, we can say that this film is not Eddie Murphy's mix Dear Gentleman and Charlton Heston Ten Commandments. I'm not sure that if Steve Carrell is guilty here, you get the feeling that it is his character that limits his ability to comedian, former news presenter Evan Baxter should not be funny, he is basically an antagonist, turned into the main character that in this case only adds confusion about what should be said in this film.
