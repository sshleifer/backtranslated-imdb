"Dark Reality" - a film similar to "Saw", slightly decrepit. Although the plot and the plot are good, they have too much extra nudity. Although I feel that the film was technically well-made, acting was unclear, it was too dark for my mood when I watched it. In fact, IT experts say that there are a lot of missing people who will never be found, and perhaps they are tormented by sick sick people. I feel that some information about the abductors and the causes of their illness might help some. It was a snuff film created specifically for violent content. If you like to see women being beaten, tortured and killed, then this is for you. If you are looking for something more liter, more expressive and reasoned, skip it.
