Yes! this film was just bad in all respects, such as actors, effects, boredom, excitement and, of course, fantasy, and we all know that the four characters in this film were a little more colorful than new ones, but still you need to go , fantastic bore, as it really was just stupid trash, which I knew that no one would want, when I saw it, I mean, of course, with this budget, you could make 3 or 4 good films, but no . I'm just glad that the new version, made this year, fully showed everyone how the fantastic four had to be made with a good story, a great cast, like Jessica Alba, one of my favorite actresses, otherwise it would have been completely forgotten, but fortunately not. The new one was superb when I saw it with my friends in the cinema, but this old fantastic bore has to go.
