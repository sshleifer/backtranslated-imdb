Wow, well, you know the shocking things they use in hospitals to make your heart beat again? I needed one for my brain after watching this movie. In a literal sense, it took me almost 4 hours, because I had to take a break and periodically reboot my brain to semi-normal functions. I mean, this film looks too ridiculous, saying that there were about 10 pages of dialogue in the script, that would be generous. They just don't talk !! And although speaking is not all, and I admit that there were some scenes where only music was needed, and the music was excellent, it was probably the best part, but then we went to listen to a symphony or something else and forget about the film. So many people give such great reviews, and in due time, I would say that special effects and filmography are pretty good, but as for acting, or lack of acting, he just needs something else, no filming or sex, etc. ., profanity is not even required, but a little more emotion, these guys were like stones, just sitting there with long faces. In general, if you need something to calm down, just play the movie, don't even start from the beginning, if you have seen it before, just start somewhere, lie down and rest, it will make you sleep,
