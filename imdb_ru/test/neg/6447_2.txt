I rated this movie better than terrible, because I liked to see Jonathon from Buffy again in something, even if it was the same role. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the concept is rather short, but not the whole movie. The letter was forced and contrived. I have a feeling that the film suffered the most during editing. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Amanda Bynes always looks as if her eyes are crossed, even if she is not trying to do it. She's just not funny. She always plays some kind of inappropriate girl who defeats herself - ironically, given that Amanda is always a caricature. I would really like to see her in something serious. I really want to give her a chance, but she always plays in these banal roles, where she moves and makes faces, and for some reason is that good? <br /> <br /> Finally, the whole "I'm a moron" Segment was thwarted by the botanists' revenge. There was nothing unpredictable about this movie. <br /> <br /> Shame, shame, shame.
