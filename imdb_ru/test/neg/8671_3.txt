It has just been transferred here in the USA. Others commented on the loyalty (or lack thereof) of the novel; The 1983 BBC version is far superior in these and other indicators. Given the scale of the novel, it should not be reduced to 85 minutes. Key sections should be omitted or allusions to them, or omitted; there is hardly enough time to simply understand the chronology of events, so character development must be sacrificed: we cannot understand who these people are, what deprives us of what makes Austin so great. <br /> <br /> One of the main drawbacks for me was cinematography, which, in my opinion, was just awful and literally disgusting. The camera constantly makes ultra-close-ups and circles in a circle. Maybe this is normal on a small set-top box, but on our 40-inch high-definition screen it was so literally dizzy that both my wife and I had to look away from the TV several times (I ran out of Dramamine). Of course, this distracted from the rather dull game “I just read what's in the script” (some scenes are well done, but not enough to save). <br /> <br /> Summing up the results so far in Complete JA Sweepstakes: I would appreciate the success of Northanger Abbey because of its excellent direction and production values ​​(and the story can be converted shortly) not equal to other versions) (with re-condensation), both are far ahead of this attempt. I will hope for the best in the two remaining novels in the Digest of this TV show, Jane Austen, like the others, I am grateful that they left P & P alone!
