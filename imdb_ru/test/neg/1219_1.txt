This film is crappy without any restrictions. This is incredible - a very bad burglar from Jaws and other (best) shark films. Very bad - everything is really pitiful. This is pure nonsense, the actors are bad, the effects are very cheap, no creativity. It seems that some really weakened children took the Jaws script and arranged it randomly, then his parents took an 8 mm camera and made a film with their neighbors. The music is really irrelevant, just a bit of “lift” music, soft and overly optimistic when nothing happens, and a little less optimistic when the shark is near or when children are depressed (again listening to the music of a VERY Loud elevator). Carlo Maria (author) should be so ashamed that he should ask that his name be erased from the names !! The film serves as an excellent demonstration of how crappy music will destroy *** ANY *** scene, which should be exciting. There is one significant difference from the jaws: at the beginning of the jaws there are comments about stupid people who are trying to kill a shark with dynamite. Well, there is an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite. When this does not work, the guys take *** GREAT LOAD *** of dynamite and spend about 1/4 of the film, putting explosives in some kind of shipwreck. This is really an original way to catch a fish, I have to admit! They use so much dynamite, as if they were trying to kill the battleship (I suppose the class of the battleship Bismarck) or dig another Panama canal. This is just incredible. I am glad that they did not try to use napalm-flamethrower or tactical nuclear strike to eliminate this bad, approximately 2-meter shark. Well, in this mess there is also a mystic, a disappearing Indian (who looks like a German pensioner). This is not a movie, this is a warning example of how bad movies can be! As a warning, this is useful. But the public should be protected from this crap. Most Italian films are bad, but this ... is really exceptional in the worst sense of the word.
