As a rule, much can be forgiven in historical materials, which ask us to recall important historical events and give them enough love for the story to continue. BATTLE OF BRAVE is engaged in the struggle of the 18th century for control over Quebec (all of Canada) between the British and the French with the side walls of the new America. It has a fascinating epic of charm, but unfortunately in the hands of writer Pierre Billon (whose script deserves Razzy's award for the worst this season) and scattered, unfocused and confused director Jean Boden, this film is dull - a tedious, useless film lasting two about a quarter of an hour. <br /> <br /> Even the cast of great actors is a pair of Noemy Godin-Vigno in the role of Marie-Loup Carignan and David La Hay in the role of Francois Le Garder, adding the beautiful Bianca Gervais in the role of Acuna, the venerable GÃ©rard Depardieu in the role of Le Cure Thomas Blondeau, as well as Irina Jacob, Vincent Perez (ridiculous in period wigs), Tim Roth as William Pitt, Colm Mini as Benjamin Franklin and Jason Isaacs as General James Wolf - does not help Such veteran actors as they surely cringed from the rough lines written for their characters! Cover the entire mess in a juicy musical score with Patrick Doyle, and the result is a long film to be avoided. It is sad to say such bad things about a costly project, but be careful ....
