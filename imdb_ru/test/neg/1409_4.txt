I knew about the critical plans for Man of the Year and the unremarkable gross, but I was ready to give the film the advantage of doubt, because I know that good pictures can get under the radar during the crowded schedule of releases of the autumn months. <br /> <br /> What I learned is that the film is surprisingly boring. The surprise is an understatement, given Barry Levinson's gift for political satire (shown in Good Morning in Vietnam and Wag the Dog) and the obvious comic gifts of Robin Williams. In fact, Robin Williams is mysteriously undervalued. Barry Levinson talked about how sometimes he let Robin Williams improvise with the script, as in some of his naughty secrets. Um, are you really such a jerk, Barry Levinson? Whenever you have Robin Williams in your film and you want to use it for your comic abilities (mostly in every film he starred in, except for Insomnia or The Hour of One Picture), do not put him in scenario. Let him do whatever he wants, because he is funnier than anyone else to write for him, and his runaway comic stunts can instantly raise the bar in any mediocre film such as RV or Patch Adams. What I found even more surprising in his inability to use Robin Williams was that in 1987 Levinson used this exact formula for perfection in Good Morning in Vietnam, incorporating bursts of the comic madness of Robin Williams into the picture of war to make a loud political part . <br /> <br /> So the film is not as fun as it seems, and awkwardly lost in tone. If the film could work as it pleases, it could become one of those thrillers of the mid-90s in the style of “Pelican Briefing”, “The Fugitive” or one of these films about Jack Ryan. His story was centered around a Silicon Valley company employee who discovered a crash in the system, which shows that the country elected the wrong president, and the efforts of the CEOs to fix it before revealing the secret, so if you replaced Robin Williams with Harrison - a Ford-type actor, or maybe even Harrison Ford himself, added a couple more explosions, and maybe that’s what the movie was trying to do. I will never know, and do not try to find out.
