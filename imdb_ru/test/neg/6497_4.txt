I saw this self-centered "effort" to achieve the film "epic" status in the company of several indigenous Russian family members. Five people gave 5 different reactions, from the worship of Mikhalkov to my cynicism. <br /> <br /> I saw a film that looked as though Mikhalkov had taken a lot of money from Channel +, put some of it in his (and other) pockets and handed over the project to a handful of film students. I counted at least 4 different "styles" in the film. It is impossible for the same director to be responsible for these different scenes. Compare this to yourself: <br /> <br /> Cadets polish shoes with a dog. <br /> <br /> · The scene at the station (says goodbye to Andrew). <br /> <br /> · On the street panoramic shots. <br /> <br /> · Ormond talks through the keyhole. <br /> <br /> · The first attempt of the Grand Duke and the subsequent scenes of persecution to return Andrew to sing in Figaro. <br /> <br /> · Fencing. <br /> <br /> Julia Ormond is faster than Superman. Having learned about his translation with a delay, in one minute she passes through the whole of Moscow to say goodbye to Andrey. <br /> <br /> Russian natives felt that the impression of Russian life was a “caricature” and not a story. They called it the “tourist postcard” of Russia. <br /> <br /> All of them were proud that the Russian director / producer / writer managed to break into the “big time” and be able to spend more than $ 30 million on other people's money, while maybe they put A bit in local pockets during filming. <br /> <br /> If you want to think, you have seen Russia watch this movie. Have some coffee before you go.
