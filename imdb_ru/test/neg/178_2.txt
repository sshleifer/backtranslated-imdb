I donâ€™t understand why this film received such good ratings from critics - I saw dozens of documentaries (on TV) about the wine world that were much better when (if) you watched it, think about two very annoying aspects of mondovino: First, the shooting is just awful, terrible and distressing: for me it looked like the guy behind the camera had just received the material and was playing with it: a lot of zooms (for no other purpose than pressing a button, for example, I almost stopped to watch it because of this! secondly, the interviewer (p the director, I think) is not very relevant: he looks and asks questions like a scout, not a journalist, even if the general idea and topics were interesting, too bad a conclusion: an overvalued documentary, perhaps only for guys who know nothing about fault => not recommended at all (2/10)
