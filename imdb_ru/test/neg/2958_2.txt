The film begins with Ingrid Bergman and her two fancy servants arriving in New Orleans from Paris. Apparently, several years ago, her mother was involved in a scandal, and Ingrid returned to irritate relatives who had previously forgotten about the existence of her or her mother. This is because she believes that if they are shocked enough, they will pay her to get rid of her. Then, with this money, she will leave New Orleans and find a millionaire somewhere else, since she pretends to be a countess. Along the way, Gary Cooper appears and looks completely inappropriate as a love interest. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, this film was not the reason that Ingrid Bergman’s career plummeted - her play and character were It was bad! Instead of the cool and modest woman she used to play in films, she is probably one of the most annoying characters in the movie. Her fake countess was petty, demanding, unpredictable and stunningly stupid. The way she was able to kill ANY man seemed a mystery, since she seemed less vampire than just crazy !! I'm not exaggerating to say that she sometimes behaved like someone with a combination of severe mental illness and personality disorder, and all this together makes me think, “who in the world will fall in love with this mess ?!”, Frankly, I endure I couldn't, watching her story and narcissism, and she looked more like a guest on the Jerry Springer Show than a leading lady! Embarrassing, horrible and excessive words that come to my mind when I think about her role. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is, frankly, stunned by Bergman’s ranting and tantrums. Although Gary Cooper is generally a great presenter, he dominates her and looks just bewildered. And, oddly enough, they set up two eccentrics as her entourage - Flora Robson and Jerry Austin. Miss Robson is best known for her images of Queen Elizabeth I, but here, for some strange reason, they put makeup on her, and the end result looked very similar to the love of the child of the Indianka cigar store and Aunt Jemima! Her face was very wooden, she wore strange eyebrows and dressed as a slave. As for Mr. Austin, he was a gnome, and although it should not be considered against him, his role was written as if he were a court jester - a very, very ungrateful role for someone who was "vertically criticized" ! Overall, the rotten acting, writing, and weak direction make it one of the biggest stinky eras - almost as meaningless and boring as famous turkeys like PARNELL and SWING YOUR LADY.
