Radio is probably one of the best films I've ever seen, and at the same time one of the worst. It made me laugh in the places where you had to cry, and made me cringe in moments when you had to laugh. he lacked any character development, which, as a rule, was crucial for a sentimental flick. some questions as to why the character Ed Harris took the radio under his wing, it was not properly explained, and I am sure that their relationship (which is the main aspect of the film) is the most meaningless if ever seen. <br /> Which continues to give Cuba Goodinga a junior job, he is a crappy actor, and he should be ridiculed until he does another job. <br /> <br /> As the real stories show, this is not so interesting. ps The reason why I said that this is one of the best films I've ever seen is because, despite the fact that it was full, I still liked it. laugh at the script, and most of the monologues that really are work or idiot or someone very clever, trying to show how easy it is to make a crappy film about the retard, which becomes everyone's favorite joke. The fact is that the Cuban character is a comedic food for people watching football matches.
