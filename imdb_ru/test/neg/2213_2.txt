It's amazing to think that this film came out just a year before Star Wars, but it looks like it has been lagging behind it in complexity and special effects for millions of years. In fact, the artistic direction and set design (a good Victorian spaceship) is not bad; These are the funniest monster costumes that look like monsters "a guy in rubber clothes" from the series LOST IN SPACE. The evil makeup of the caveman reminded me of some of the aliens from the ancient repetitions of the Twilight zone. <br /> <br /> The script is unnatural, and outside the comic relief of Peter Cushing the game is pretty pathetic. This film is recommended only if you really enjoy a bad kitsch SF. And the music ... yes! The terrible experiment of the 70s with synthesizers that do not fit the period of the film and sound like someone chatting with Minimoog and a 2-track tape recorder.
