This is another one of those fundamentalist Christian films that hit you in the head with religion like a sledgehammer. You know that you are in trouble when the script of the story is completely ridiculous. Three men fly to Mexico to deliver the Bible. This does not make sense, since the church is Protestant, and most Mexicans are Catholics. Protestant and Catholic bibles are not the same thing. There are books in the Catholic Bible that are not found in the Protestant Bible. I also find it hard to believe that churches in Mexico will not distribute bibles to them. I can understand whether they went to a place where Christianity is in the minority. But Mexico is far beyond my ears. If you can’t believe the storyline, you won’t believe it either. A film about religion may be interesting, but not this film.
