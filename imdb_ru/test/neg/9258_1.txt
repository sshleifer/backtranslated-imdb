Staten Island director Andy Milligan is well known in the horror community for being a worse director than Ed Wood. And with this as a vague example of his conclusion, I tend to agree with them. In “Horrible”, we mainly have three married couples going to their childhood home (located on a conveniently secluded island) to collect an inheritance. There they are killed one by one, and the events unfold in the manner of murder / mystery with the added hunchbacked butler in the scars to throw you in the noose. The film is in such a bad shape that it seems that someone just missed it through the dishwasher, the sound is terrible, the dialogue is other-worldly bad, there is some primitive dummy blood (plus some dissections and guts), and it is technically ineffective in every possible way it may be inept. But is it nice in a bad movie? It seems, as it were, something like. Watching this is painful, but, oddly enough, entertaining in the spirit of a train wreck. Approach with caution. If you are not a fan of horrible movies, six are better.
