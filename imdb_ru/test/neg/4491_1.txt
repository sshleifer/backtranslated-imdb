I suspect that this board will soon be full of comments from overly emotional people praising "Dear John" as a "pearl" and "rollercoaster ride" and all the other empty words that are usually used by the target audience of this film. <br /> <br /> I’m definitely not the target audience for this film, but I also don’t like romantic dramas, if they are well shot, so my goal is to make a film. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. OK. <br /> <br /> This is also not a bad movie. But the plot twists, development stalled where it should have moved forward (to be precise, in the center), and as for the end ... it almost seemed like they ran out of ideas, and they suddenly said, “Hey, let's just quickly remove the last scene, we put some sentimental string soundtrack on it and get it over with. ” Even the beauty of Amanda Seyfried could not save it. Channing Tatum spoke well too, but a lot can be done with an erroneous scenario. <br /> <br /> Speaking of music, it is unbearably predictable and kichern. From Smokey, a high-voiced, annoyingly high singer-singer Shtitsk (most likely chosen to please most college-aged girls who will watch this film) to the over-used combination of “flickering strings and piano” only annoys anyone who pays more attention as a whole, and not to his own "feelings". The film has a good start, and the main conflict that triggers us in the second act was promising. So was part of the second act itself, as the story unfolded. Then the film just dropped the ball. In addition, I would have to give spoilers. <br /> <br /> “Dear John” is not a bad film, but it does not work as it should. If you want to watch a truly touching film about long-lasting love awaiting reunification, check out the Notebook, which was really great.
