Watching this for several seasons, two things come to mind: one — I wonder what kind of girl wants to be a “model,” and two — run to the nearest ice cream shop and eat low-fat ice cream. /> <br /> I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of ​​this reality show contest. No other "famous" model thought about it, and Tyre Banks is very pleased to do this. But as the series goes on and on, I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s too bad that many are trying to make an elephant out of a fly. Women should not watch this; adolescents should avoid it if they do not make book reports on the subject. <br /> <br /> Many women try slots to compete for "America Next Top Model." They live together, fight together, cry together, go through meaningless model shots with meaningless model people and fashionistas, they are excluded, and almost all of them declare: "You will see me again." Gosh, I'm trying to see what happened to those who won, in fact. <br /> <br /> This is a dream for some girls, and it's good for them. Watching this, I hope that other girls who see this and run, like Hades, in the other direction - like in college. <br /> <br /> I just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the "trick" of a full-sized model joining the group. It even made me think of it as a lot of people. “Fully-shaped models” were nothing more than medium-sized ladies, competing with what I think is the thinnest group of models they have ever chosen - so, of course, that would make them look even fatter - a fashion “ tricks, which is used all the time. Bad, bad, Tyra and the team. <br /> <br /> But honestly, “America is the next top model” - this is not “full-size” models, but designing an imaginary image, beauty that can be sold on the market and sold as absolute beauty - and this show just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix. Hence the name of the show. Hence the pity of judges, photographers, associations. Therefore, Tyra and her constant “it was me” connect to any corner of the camera that you can get. But again, this is the only thing I like about this show - the former model, giving others who have no chance, - a chance to get in the door. But after that ... everything else is a status quo for this industry, so there are no surprises or weekly interest in the program.
