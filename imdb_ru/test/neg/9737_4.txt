For me, this film was a disappointment. Somehow, I expected this to explain the reason for the popularity of General Rommel and his success as a military strategist in World War II. But this is nothing, it concerns the past or two years of his life and is trying, in some way, to whiten it. So I just have to assume that Rommel was mostly an immoral and apolitical technocrat in the business of conquest and murder, without any particular charm or bad fame in behavior. Such people in real life just do not make good material for the film. I almost feel sorry for James Mason, truly one of my favorite actors, who had to pretend to be a pretty wooden character. Actually, a good director and a lot of great acting talent was wasted in this movie ?? with the exception of Luther Adler, who gives a truly memorable and strangely naturalistic image of Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Cultural problems may also arise for people like me who are part of the German-speaking world. Famous British actors depicting Germans are simply not credible. Rommel, for example, is perceived here not just as a German, but as a typical “southerner” from Baden-Württemberg. You immediately recall a certain dialect, a certain type of wit, a certain way of seeing the world (for example, the Prussian "Junker"). I also think that now there are ambiguous feelings about the July 20 assassination attempt, many of those who participated in the conspiracy were not democrats and simply wanted German troops to join the Western allies against the advancing Bolsheviks (thus prolonging the war forever) . <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Patton (1970) is still the best film about the intellectual, intelligent military mind. By the way, General Patton can be momentarily seen in a sufficient number of documentary bases used for this film, when shooting at a slight angle, when he inspects passing cars. An open holster and a pearl-handled revolver are clearly visible!
