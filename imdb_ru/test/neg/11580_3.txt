A team of amateur and tree-loving journalists learn about Project Carnivore, a secret government project on a remote island in the South Pacific. There, scientists produce gigantic corn, but genes spread to other species, creating abnormally large Komodo dragons and a cobra (one that is bulletproof and swims underwater). With the help of the daughter of a scientist, can they leave the island and tell the world? Even if I had not seen this film on the Science Fiction Channel (which I unfortunately did), he would have shouted the Science Fiction Channel with its low productivity, poor performance and some of the worst special effects in history. The effects here are comparable with another film about creatures, "The Island of Raptors", although not so bad. I suspect that at least there are a handful of people who have worked on both films, but I did not bother to confirm this and probably will not. It will be a sad day when I watch one of these films again. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that it is not very pleasant. I watched it at two in the morning with my sister's boyfriend, and I can't speak for him, but I thought it was a pretty good use of time. No matter how bad it is, it’s all a funny picture if you like to laugh at movies, and the scientist’s daughter is attractive enough to carry the movie (I think the actress is Michelle Borth). Michael Pare also acts as the captain of the ship, and because of his poor choice of roles, his work on The Furnace looks respectable (even if this film is unbearably bad). <br /> <br /> I can't be too hard in this movie simply because it was more or less exactly what I thought it would be. Bad consequences? Low budget? Unnamed actors? I did not have high hopes. However, this does not mean that it is also cool. To come at face value - there is nothing to be proud of, and this one will gradually disappear in the remote department of memory. For one fan who loves this movie (and calls it “KvC”), hold on to your copy, because you have plenty of time to get a replacement.
