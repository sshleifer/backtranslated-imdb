This film would be fine, perhaps even excellent, if the directors left the interview and the concert footage separate. "Into the Void" is a great song, and I hate the way it ends at best to go to a muttering interview with Ozzy Osborne. It should have been at the end of the film or placed in a special function. The best part of live DVDs is to put them in place and let the music play, but “Black Sabbath: The Last Supper” is hard to put on and just let it play because the music is constantly interrupted. However, this film has several strengths; Concert footage when he plays is great. Black Sabbath returns to the stage after a long break without Osborne, and this film captures it well: Sabbath basically shakes its fans. The fans, of course, have a nice advantage in the film, because, of course, they see a live band, but also they don’t have to put up with the incessant interviews that put the DVD audience on. Shame on Jeb Brian and Monica Hardiman (directors) for doing this for a movie! Also, shame Wyatt Smith to edit the film in this way.
