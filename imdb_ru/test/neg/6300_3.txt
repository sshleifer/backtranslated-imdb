The costumes are outrageous, and the Australian landscapes of the provinces are interesting to see, but this story has an advantage — a medium advantage — in transvestites. I especially noticed this in the character of Terrence Stamp: "Ralph Bernadette Baseger." Perhaps this was appropriate, since there is nothing “good guy” in Ralph Bernadette and his group of “queens”. <br /> <br /> Once again, we get a strong liberal bias that says something goes, and if you are not “with it” - or in this case, for a homosexual, then you are a homophobe. (Sigh!) What really bothers is the end, when a young boy leaves with his father for an “alternative lifestyle” and accepts his gay lifestyle, not because it fits the story, but because it fits the agenda of the people who wrote the script. Pathetic.
