Hillary Swank is an unattractive piece of work in this unattractive part of the film. Pat Morita, desperate for work, in any job, agreed to play the role of “teacher of karate” again and again present his brand of karate on the silver screen, except for the time when Hillary “skunk” Swank is a student. br /> <br /> I can only see how Hollywood writers are inspired by the idea that an "exhausted spoiled female" will take on the role of Ralph. The film does not work at any level, and at each level is boring. There is nothing interesting and even a lesson so that no one can hold him. The film was shot without any thought of making money, because it is very bad. <br /> <br /> I would love to spit on all the actors in this film for being involved in it and for the writers to be blacklisted for their participation. pathetic and abusive efforts.
