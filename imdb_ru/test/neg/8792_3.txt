It is painfully clear that all efforts in this film were aimed at cinematography and very little attention to everything else. The most obvious mistake is the mistake of the entire female team. Many of them are very experienced and capable, but they all seemed out of place, and the presence of an amateur director definitely did not help. This story is a very common geisha story, and the characters behaved very inconsistently, so it is extremely difficult for me to communicate with the heroine. <br /> <br /> The theme of this film is “modern prostitution”, but nevertheless it was annoying, as the main character Tsuchiya Anna continued speaking as a member of a motorcycle gang, while everyone else spoke old Japanese suitable for this setting. This film has very beautiful bright colors similar to the “Hero” of Zhang Yimou, but viewers can easily say that it was shot in a cheap, carefully thought-out set. <br /> <br /> Two sequences with Shiina Ringo's inserts were really good, although in the middle of the film. I really didn’t like her music very much before, but they fit in perfectly with this film. Although Mina Ninagawa is a total failure as a director, she has a lot of potential in producing a PV (music video). <br /> <br /> I believe that the story was very simple, because the director was not able to concentrate on the development of the character, and because Tsuchiya Anna is unconvincingly acting like Oyran. If this film were made by a famous director Jidaigeka with any other famous actress in Japan, he could have become a masterpiece.
