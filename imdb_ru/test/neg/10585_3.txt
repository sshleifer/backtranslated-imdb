When an insect bites a teenage loser, he becomes a Dragonfly superhero ... <br /> <br /> Superhero Movie is the latest trickster film to appear on the screen. Unfortunately, however, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was associated with the films "Airplane!", "Top Secret" and "Naked Weapon"), he still suffers from an error made in recent parodies ... Mostly it is more stupid than fun! Basically the fault lies in the jokes. It's just not funny enough. Some of the jokes work, for example, a scene with a nail, but other parts just fall. For example, X-Men fake or the whole sequence of farting. Blazing Saddles is not! One of the key moments in the best films about parody, such as “Airplane”, is that, although the dialogue is very funny, the cast of actors is for the most part completely straightforward. It makes it even funnier. Even when the foreground is a simple dialogue, funny things can happen to the actors. It's funny again. Another key point is that they all have a peculiar storyline on which you can hang jokes. <br /> <br /> It seems that there has recently been a tendency to shoot scenes from different films and then try to fake them. As a result, the so-called plot of these films exists very rarely. Another disadvantage of these films is that some scenes were actually funny in the original versions, and in most cases even funnier than the scene of deception! Actors try to get into the spirit that is required, but with a lot of unfunny dialogues and scenes it is difficult to take care of this. <br /> <br /> As recent films show, they are not as bad as Epic Movie, Date Movie, or the terrible Meeting of the Spartans, but given that some people who participated here made good, funny films in the past far from good enough.
