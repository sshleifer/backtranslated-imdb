Arthur Hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role of a mountain man (probably Ozarkov) who hunts with his beloved kun dog. However, the dog seems to be drowning when Hunnicutt jumps after him. It soon becomes obvious that, despite the fact that the Hunnicut and his dog roam after coming out of the water, they both died in the water - because no one answers when he talks to them, he sees and hears people talking about him and dog's death. However, oddly enough, Hunnicutt is REALLY slow to learn, and it takes him some time to understand what they are saying about him! I think that in fact it was done as an addition, because in fact there was not enough material to fill in half an hour. <br /> <br /> Later, in an “unexpected turn”, he goes to heaven - or at least his concept of space. He is invited, but as dogs are not allowed, he has other ideas! In general, he acted quite well, but he has dubious spiritual value! No frills and irony, this episode is a bit boring - not enough of the Twilight Zone-y, I think.
