The word "boring" is found too often when it comes to how bad or not a low-budget horror movie can be. I have seen many B-films. Many terrible, terribly inept B-movies. Some with a production cost of several hundred dollars. Is the ineptitude, the lousy game, the worst continuity and embarrassing budgets really make the film invisible? Some no doubt yes. Most of which are probably big fans of the Matrix. Well, I hate big-budget films, so I say no. The bad can sometimes be funny (Blood Freak), sometimes even stunning (Troll 2), but it’s always impossible to see Boring ... Hey, it’s like Bloodthirsty Butchers, which reminds me, I’m writing a review for this heap of garbage ... yes , anyway. This is one of the many alternatives to the late British director Andy Milligan. This one is based on Sweeney Todd ... Great. Milligan takes a boring story and still manages to kill her. Hey, that's pretty funny, I said boo ... sorry, I keep getting distracted. It is not quite easy. If I think about it, I will make it easy. No blood, no fear, no fun, just incredible, annoying people leading rambling talk. these are bloodthirsty butchers. Oh, yes, and something about a hairdresser, killing people, and something about meat cakes. I don't know, it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> For something more useful from Andy Milligan, there is always only one that I saw: Rats are walking, Werewolves are here. Yes, you heard me. But how about we forget about this guy from Milligan all together and pick up something sweet, like Sick Girl or Teenape Goes To Camp. Whatever you decide, just know Bloodthirsty Butchers sucks, perhaps even more than any other version of this already grim story. And this, fans of B-movies, really says something. 2/10
