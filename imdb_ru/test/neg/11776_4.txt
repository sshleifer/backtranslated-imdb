Given the topic of addiction, "To the bone" almost can not seem quite depressing film. But depression does not necessarily mean bad. Unfortunately, in this case it is actually quite bad. There are a few good things in the film, in particular, the quality game of Vera Farmigi starring Irene, a working mom fighting cocaine addiction. But there is not enough good to outweigh the bad. The disadvantages of the film are mainly related to the story, which does not enthrall and seems to never begin. Irene goes to rehab and comes home to an ignorant husband who has no idea how to support her trying to give up her habit. Irene is growing up next to another recovering drug addict, a nurse from her rehabilitation center. Complications arise. But the story never flashes. It seems that the film really is not going anywhere. You can say that this is a harsh, realistic look at the daily struggle with the addict. Maybe so, but in this case it does not make an interesting film. All this has a very "bla" feeling. Minimalistic cinematography does not help, adding another layer of gray to an incredibly gray production. And none of the other ideas compares with Farmigoy. Hugh Dillon is fine, like Nurse's friend Irene, but no one in the cast adds anything useful to the job. Overall, this film is a dark, depressive and rather boring ride.
