For the Norris film, this is pretty handwork. For an action movie, it's pretty boring, and as far as predictability goes, my friend and I almost nailed this move. It was nice that every movement of the killer was not wired to cliches from 80s militants, but come on, the only unpredictable move challenges the plot and the editing setting. Basically, they say quite early that the killer (Jack O'Halloran, one of the few little-known actors) kills only women. YES, he suddenly stops his M.O. and killing men, huh? I guess it could be interpreted and rationalized in some way, but why was the film edited to show that he was going to kill women? <br /> <br /> Again, Iâ€™m sure there is a reason (that is, to create the unknown), but why waste time watching it when many other films are unknown. <br /> <br /> Renegade fans may like Branscombe Richmond's little cameo as Victor, but his short performance cannot save the film, and even voting for 4 seems generous. <br /> <br />
