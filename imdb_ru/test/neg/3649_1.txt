Subject: Worth acting: Fair (some of them) Story: Funny <br /> <br /> Details: The sound changes from shrillly high to almost inaudible; the music is not really terrible (but mostly there is); dialogue and characterization are ridiculous; the process of opening the main character is dazzlingly obvious to everyone except himself (and the author, obviously); scenes with animals are just stupid (for example, singing the "Moon River" in secret, forgotten lyrics, stupid duet with the "flock" of boars for several hours). Finally, the competition "wet t-shirt" is so stupid that it can not be seen. (Hint: the "girl" who wins is not ... well, I will not give it up.)
