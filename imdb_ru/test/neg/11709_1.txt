This film was included in the BBC mini-series "The Six Wives of Henry VIII." I loved these six films. They were well functioning, well written and historically accurate. I did read Gregory's book, and I liked it quite well, despite its HUGE historical inaccuracies (I mean the whole fake homosexual look with George Boleyn, in particular), but this film wasn’t even mentioned. This angle was one of the key points of the book. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film just makes me ask "WHY?" Why do we see someone successfully say: “The Real World: Tudor England”? Why are camera angles so bad at all? <br /> <br /> Why is the script so bad? I mean, I know it was improvisation, but come on! Actors stutter from time to time and stutter over their lines, and it is obvious that they invent them when they go forward. <br /> <br /> Why are sex scenes so awkward? The way they were made in the book made them at least somewhat interesting. In the film, they are just bad, bordering on being absolutely funny. One day, the actress playing Mary Boleyn had sex with an actor playing Henry VIII. He pushes away, and on her face is such an expression: “Hmm ... I need to go to the store. Has he finished yet? Maybe if he finishes, I'll go for cheese really fast ... ”just bad. <br /> <br /> Why does Catherine of Aragon play such a small role in this film? Her refusal to divorce was one of the main reasons for the scandal that shook Christiandom. She is the reason why Henry VIII and Ann Boleyn could not marry immediately. Why is she not here? In general, this film is just bad.
