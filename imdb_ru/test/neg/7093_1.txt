The moral of this show is that bad eating habits give people bad hair, bad taste in clothes, bad posture, bad work, and so on. They are clearly unhappy and hate themselves. However, if they learn to eat broccoli, they will be rich, successful and attractive. <br /> <br /> TLC should be ashamed of this blatant use of parental fears and guilt. If nutrition is really so important, they should be able to create a show using honest and truthful methods. If they really believed in their computer simulations, I would like them to do a double-blind test, find out about 40-year-olds, find out what they had eating and exercise habits in childhood, and matured. a photo. Then compare with real things. Hey, that sounds like a project for Mythbusters! Discovery Channel - are you listening? <br /> <br /> TLC should stand for Tabloid Lies and Minuses.
