I decided to erase this show from my memory in the toilet of a bad TV show into the obscurity of a forgetful, disappointing, senseless, hellish TV show. <br /> <br /> Skyler guy, who is the host / star / creator of this series, is boring, uninteresting, incredible, not very good looking and not at all funny, in general, why this guy is on TV and especially why he is in a comedy show when he is not funny, pretending to be a professional fraudster? when he is definitely nothing but an obvious challenger? Others have said it here, but this guy is a complete fake and a fraud, if you think that any of these minuses, I think you should seriously think about checking your head, because they are all fake, and those that can be true so pointless, how to spend all day trying to deceive someone to give you regular food in a restaurant? Seriously, this guy needs to leave, glad that this show is inhibited.
