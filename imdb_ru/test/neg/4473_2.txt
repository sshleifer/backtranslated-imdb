Hollywood will stop at nothing to make money on the film, even if they have to continue to draw stereotypes and put them in the most impossible and stupid situations. This effort is a prime example of this, and I truly believe in my heart that a film like this is racially irresponsible. The story of a divorced lawyer named Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin), who chatted with a lady on his computer, and when he finally met her, she was the opposite of what he expected. Charlene Morton (Queen Latifa) - a stocky black woman who is not going to meet with Peter, but wants him to look at her case, in which she was convicted of robbery. He wants her to go away forever, but she continues to appear at the wrong time, and to save his work, he reluctantly agrees to look at the facts related to her case. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT *** ** <br /> <br /> Peter keeps his children next to him, and Charlene is helpful in raising them, but suddenly he is announced in the newsletter that escaped a convict named Charlene Morton was released from prison. Peter tells her to leave when the FBI snoops, but he realizes that she is innocent when her old boyfriend appears and threatens him. <br /> <br /> This film was made by Adam Shankman, which makes things move. at a good pace, and this is a good-looking film, technically speaking, but the script is so unbelievable, and every character is so stereotyped that the 1970 film called “The Host” is clearly more in tune with race relations than this mess. I have always been a big fan of Martin, and I think that he is one of the most talented people in the district, but he loves to work all the time, and sometimes, it seems, he just chooses any script that is given to him. On the other hand, I have always had problems with Latifa, and the way she breaks into the life of Martin, so much exceeds all expectations that she instantly fawns over. The basic premise that Hollywood loves to use is a dark-skinned black man who demonstrates excited whiteness to relax and then convey some street logic that will help them in their lives. In fact, this is the story, but, of course, they must allow Martin to dress in black and replay as backward Eminem, because Hollywood knows that this is what the viewers want. Well, I was offended by all this in this film, and not because I have no sense of humor, but, unfortunately (in any case, for Hollywood), I use logic and common sense when I watch a movie. Yes, I liked Eugene Levy's talking jive, but do we really think that he will be attracted to Latif immediately? I guess stranger things have happened, and how many times does the main actor shoot, just to be saved by something in his pocket? Doesn't a mobile phone break if a bullet hits it? Even if you are the most loyal fan of Martin and Latifah, I would not recommend it. I know I said this before, but this is not an attempt to make a good film, this is an excuse to try to make money!
