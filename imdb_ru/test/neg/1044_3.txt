I saw this movie previewed before something I rented some time ago ... and it looked decent. I saw something good from the Full Moon video and thought it was worth it ... Unfortunately, it was not good. <br /> <br /> The story of the obsessive bed. The couple moves into a new apartment, finds a bed, and strange things start to happen. Strange things like a woman discover weird sex. And the man discovers a strange sex. And the woman draws pictures of strange sex. And a man takes pictures of strange sex. And they both begin to dream of dead people having strange sex. You would think that a movie with such a perverted sex would be good, right? <br /> <br /> Well .... no. The problem is that it must be a scary movie or at least a thriller and it just does not deliver. There is little stress, no waiting and no fear. In addition to some disturbing dreams and visions, this couple really has nothing to worry about. The whole movie is basically two of them, having these visions and playing in bed. Of course, in the end you will get a fight with a monster ... and bloodshed ... but nothing special ... There is only one murder and one good panic, that's all. <br /> <br /> And weird sex? Do not expect (or anything else for that matter). Their idea of ​​strange sex is a woman from above, fully dressed, trying to strangle her half with a tie. Not really my idea of ​​having a good time.
