I rate the “Decline of the American Empire” a little below average, as it was not terrible, but not very. I liked very open conversations from people incredibly selfish and ugly inside and out. Was that probably the most original aspect? sexy little film, permeated with dialogue, with people who are very far from the models. In addition, it seems ironic that these French-speaking Canadians have a film about a neighboring society, which, well, is in a state of “Decline”, when their own actions are their own doom. A group of girlfriends and girlfriends spends half of the film, laughing at their infidelities and the adoption of such behavior, and the other half "intellectually" speaks about how strong they are for their speech and actions. These are common targets in typical sitcoms, over which the main characters make fun of parties, mostly occupied by college professors. Unfortunately, it is not their “intelligence” or mastery of “history” that bothers me. It is their pedestal made of ego and a relationship stronger than you that pushes me away, and no character can be connected or similar. When someone cries, do I give a damn? This is your bed. When someone complains, I barely flinch. What made me shootout was one character, pissing red. (Another example of a game of fire.) Of course, I understand that this happens to some people, but it was difficult to watch. And I sincerely hoped that he washed his hands, as he had no problems with returning to cooking for everyone. At the opposite end of the nasal educators, they introduce a stereotypical nomad. It made me cringe because no one seemed real; they were all as petty as their laughter in society. Unfortunately, if there is no one to root for you, you are as empty as the souls of this character.
