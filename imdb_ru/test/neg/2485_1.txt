I saw this movie on videotape with my younger brother a long time ago, even though I was a little boy with a hearing impairment. At that time I did not have a subtitle decoder (it was 1986, the year of The Transformers: The Movie), but I could follow the plot and understand what was happening. It is not my fault that I watched an animated film intended for girls. My father rented a video to show it to my younger sister. <br /> <br /> Ten years later I rented a video (for 50 cents) to watch it again with subtitles on. My memories of this film have been completely destroyed by none other than a CLOSED SCENARIO. I have seen a lot of badly written films (such as COOL AS ICE and JASON GOES TO HELL: FINAL FRIDAY), but I have never seen (or heard) such bad dialogues, just being flooded with enough stupidity to make you circling with laughter in hysterics and cry of pain, which he suffers trying to sit in this film. Despite a good plot and intriguing plot concepts, the script should be one of the worst screenshots ever written for the screen, with no exceptions! The incompetent Howard R. Cohen should never work as a screenwriter, professional or otherwise. I can't believe that they would even allow a terrible script to produce a film like this in the first place. Did the Japanese manufacturers read the script in broken English or translated before they knew what they were sent to? Even shit like gi Joe The Movie and My Little Pony The Movie have expiatory values ​​compared to this abomination. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of the 80s animation or just go into nostalgia, beware of the RAINBOW BRITE AND STAR kidnapper! It doesn't matter if you were agitated or traumatized by a sloppy animated film with a horribly written script, or you didn’t see the film “STAY FROM THIS FILM”. The film should be watched with care to learn how to NOT write a bad script!
