Nishabd means wordless. This should be a prerequisite of the script prior to the start of filming of this film and, therefore, throughout the whole film shouts about the content. What you are striving for is an unusual love story between a 60-year-old man and an 18-year-old girl, and you get very ordinary, very common events that do not excite or surprise. So in the end we are left with the picturesque places of Kerala, brilliantly filmed by cinematographer Amit Roy, and the camera-friendly story of the newly discovered Jia Khan. This does not cover the absence of a specific scenario. Producer-director Ram Gopal Varma, who has such a good track record of films, should pull up his socks. As for Mr. Bachchan, I do not want to discuss it in the context of this film. <br /> <br /> When I watch, I feel a loss of words. I remained speechless, rather speechless! <br /> <br /> Personal opinion: This film can be compared to a no less bad film released some time ago called “BLACK”. I do not see the difference between the story of the main characters in both films. What did you say just now - it was a world class movie, blah blah, and I have no taste. Well, take a walk. No, I do not mean literally, but it is important for theaters showing this film. Because in this case, you could find this film material Oscar level.
