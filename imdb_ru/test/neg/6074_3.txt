This film is proof that a good actor is nothing without a good director. Ed Harris is terrible. How could you play an actor like Rambo in the role of "Maestro"? He doesn't trust at all and beats up Beethoven. Most of all on his head is long hair. The main actress lacks all the subtleties necessary for her character. Images from the camera look stupid and too arbitrary. The lights should close the feelings of the characters. Bad casting and cheap direction. Very bad! The only scene that costs the film is when Beats (I hope you don’t care what I call him by the nickname?) Turns the girl’s song into a joke. In any case, I hope that Harris will be able to return to this film, where he can really show his hairless talent.
