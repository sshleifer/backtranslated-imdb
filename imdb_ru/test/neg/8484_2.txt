SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I love movies. I have seen a lot of movies. I did not think that I would ever watch a movie that I really hated. Masky's son ruined it. Mask's son is so bad that I am not even going to make a detailed comment, as usual. Actually, I'm not even going to write much. I think that all of you should know that this film is terribly awful. And poor Jamie Kennedy. He was great at Scream, but now this movie! In addition, this film takes the SMO-CAN film and turns it into this stupid children's film that even children will not like. This film also consists of a very rude humor. Like the nose of a woman. She has a nose for her head, and when she sneezes, white matter comes out of her nose. There is also an exorcist parody. Yes, the children's film has a parody for adults. Maybe they thought that adults would like it. Frankly, it made the movie even more fun and rude. Here is the main, stupid plot. Tim Avery's dog gets Loki's amazing mask and turns into a cartoon dog. When Tim pays more attention to a child with special abilities, the cartoon dog becomes the robber of Wiley Coyote. Then Loki takes a child with amazing abilities, and Tim and Loki make a really funny animation fight. Tim wears a mask. It all ends happy. Too bad this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> Overall, the original “Mask” was a fantastic Jim Carrey film. There is no such principle. Please do not shoot, buy or download this film. I made a terrible mistake renting it. I don't want you guys to make the same mistake. I terribly feel that I can not write a detailed comment, but in fact, what is there to comment? <br /> <br /> 2/10 I would give one, but come on, this is basically a children's film. <br /> <br /> Recommended Movies: Mask.
