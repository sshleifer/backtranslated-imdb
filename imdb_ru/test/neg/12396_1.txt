It was a pathetic movie. The alien was decent, but the film itself gave a new meaning to the pitiful. The plot is what has been done over and over again! However, this one makes it the worst! The acting was c ** p, the scenes were often too dark to understand what was going on. No one showed concern for the main character. The film was going too slowly, and the murder scenes that were there were stupidly processed and ultimately looked no more interesting than the rest of the film. There are some films that "suck", but can still be used because of complete outrage, but this is not even there! Whoever made this film, he thought they could do something good, and they failed miserably. This film is nothing but a headache. Avoid it!
