11 years after the release of this film, only 5 people watched it here on IMDb. There is a reason for this complete lack of interest in "Across the Moon." It is connected, but lacks the whole cinematic virtue. Watch this movie for examples of terrible production in all respects. For example, initial credits are white letters, mechanically rising from a red background. In the final, Michael Mackin looks out of the prison window with the words: "There are many mysteries there." then a clip / music video of all the inspirational moments of a tragically bad movie. Julinana Hatfield. Everything between them is terrible. I struggled to find any value in this film and it turned out to be empty. Although this is hard to believe, even the cameo role from Burgess Meridith (always pleasing the public) only disappointed me. This film is like a mockery of what is special about movies. On paper, the film is below average. Women live together in a trailer. But what was actually produced was almost imperceptible. The film tries to branch out in many directions, but never passes through one. The unattractive conflict with the fact that their boys in prison is never resolved. No conflict is ever resolved. There really is no conflict. Women try to become prostitutes, but this never happens. Instead, they get a job as a bartender and storekeeper. It sounds exciting? THIS was not. THIS was stupid. And the main part of the film is two women speaking and generating contrived conflict. Women are capable actresses, but the script was below the poverty line. Useless. It was a terrible film, but itâ€™s even worse that they killed Burgess Meridita from his nursing home to do it. Bad from start to finish. Like a lion without teeth, this film does not bite.
