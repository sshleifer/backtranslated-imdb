The book is great. This is one of my favorite books. The film, on the other hand, is surprisingly tasteless and bad! When I heard that Damon would play Ripley, I knew that this production was doomed. But I did not expect it to be so bad. Actors walk and behave very effectively. With the exception of Low (and even he is guilty of some spectacular game), all the actors here are almost amateur. Speaking Italian and moving your arms or hair should not be considered valid. Damon is wrong. He is too hard for a character who should be a chameleon. Paltrow can be forgotten, and Hoffman plays another effeminate slimy character. Talk about typing. <br /> <br /> What is really inexcusable in the script (written by an overvalued director) is that he completely abandons all the fine details from the book and offers many of his own, and none of them works! Adding jazz music is completely WRONG! I suppose that Minghella’s idea of ​​Italy in the late 1950s and early 1960s was overshadowed by the images of Chet Baker wandering around the Italian countryside and spreading love. Yes, Minghella is a true visionary. The film is bleeding so obviously. This stupid scene when Ripley is driving along a narrow street full of mirrors. Very funny Yes, we understood the point !!! Each point or detail is found per mile, so much so that the film can give the audience a false impression that they have extrasensory abilities. We know, for example, that the character Blanchett, introduced at the beginning of the film, will later return only to complicating things. And the soundtrack, at times, is completely inappropriate. Freaky when should not be. The film continues for too long and in a variety of meaningless directions. There are too many boring characters inhabiting the landscape (many who were not in the book). This movie is bad! Really bad! <br /> <br /> Apparently, Minghella’s son told his father that Ripley’s novel was his favorite. Then Mr. Minghella continued to direct him in favor of his son. Well, the director really achieved what he intended to do: the talented Mr. Ripley with his aspirations Hitchcock is a film made for 12-year-olds!
