With the dialogue in the dubbed version of this film, I do not think that Shakespeare is in great danger. This is the story of an ancient Aztec mummy, which was deprived of civil rights. His things were taken, and it really pushes him away. It seems that he knows who does it, although he is spinning, delirious. I loved two boring men who tell the story of how the mummy was found, and the doctor who is determined to destroy the creature. In this ridiculous cemetery there are all these scenes, full of cheap crosses and other junk. There is a mausoleum where the mummy is kept. I can not begin to reproduce the idiocy of this, including the pit with a snake, where a good doctor is thrown (next to him there is a door so that he can crawl out) to the robot, the mass of metal cans with the guy inside. The dialogue is terrible. There are long pauses between speeches, as if someone behind the scenes is feeding them with their own lines. I like the scene in which two young children accuse their mother of leaving at night (she enters this zombie state or something like that). However, if you are looking for a film that you can laugh at and never take yourself seriously, take a look. First, drink a couple of beers. Like a straight line from mom's tomb: “Watch this, and your eyes will bleed, and your breath will stink.” What else can I say?
