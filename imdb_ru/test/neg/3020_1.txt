This is exactly what we need, a show about people that no one likes in high school or at university. Man or woman. People who objectify others and congratulate themselves on this are the complete opposite of rational thinking. And this show is just disgusting because of this. <br /> <br /> Four men sit on chairs and watch the other two guys try to pick up women to have sex with them. And in the end, one of the two victories is great ... just great. I also had to accept these four bags as the "judges" of the people's "Game." The term “game” must be the most moronic of modern English, since the term “bling bling” added to the fact that these people are called “experts” simply makes me give up what is left of my respect for modern culture. This is not a damn role models, they are the result of the fact that the MTV culture has come to bite us in the ass. If you like any nonsense spreading around this monster, then you probably think that Paris Hilton and Brittany Spears have talent. This is not true, and you should be ashamed of yourself for thinking that. <br /> <br /> And for all those people who say that I would like it better if they put me in bed or I just envy. Go yourself, because it is obvious that the REAL girl will definitely not be.
