I have never seen this movie by itself, but, like many others who have already commented, I saw it as an episode of MST3K. A really terrible 70s television slok. But someone saw its potential, because it was simply turned into a $ 125 million failure called the “Island”. <br /> <br /> And to the man who asked if ANY good films were made in the 70s, I want to remind her that it was a golden age for American cinema when such directors as Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese first came to their own rights. Not to mention such trifles as Star Wars (1977). Just a reminder that the 70s were much more creative than the 21st century.
