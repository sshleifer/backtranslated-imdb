George Clooney’s spectacular production and good comedy can’t save a curious, detached, sometimes awkward quasi-comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen. The road history of the Depression epoch begins yesterday, when three escaped prisoner gangs are looking for a hidden state and accidentally become stars of country music! The film squirms, but never grows. It really gets a strong impulse from Clooney's charismatic, predatory robbery, as well as from the artistic direction and live music of T-Bone Burnett. Otherwise, the script (based on the Coens) seriously lacks humor and interest, with the support of supporting roles of John Goodman and Holly Hunter fails to add any lift, and the second half of the film unreliable turns into complacency. ** from ****
