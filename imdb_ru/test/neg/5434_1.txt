I love bad movies: Showgirls, Plan 9 from Outerspace and so on. And this film fits. Do not believe anyone who tells you that this is a good movie. It's horrible. Tim Curry's focus moves from German to Portuguese to Hungarian. There is a man in a gorilla suit who needs to communicate in gloves that interpret monkey's sign language. There is a scene with a killer behemoth that moves around the river, like the Great White Shark. There are people jumping up and down the mountain. Kilimanjaro, as if on it are installed escalators. This thing is ridiculous. So funny that I rolled on the floor. This is absolutely implausible. I loved every minute of it.
