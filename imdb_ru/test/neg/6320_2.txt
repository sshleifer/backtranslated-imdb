In the debut episode “Where's Daddy?” George Seagal gets up one morning from his bed, shaves, takes a shower, puts on a gorilla costume and goes to his mother’s bedroom, as we understand later, to give her a massive heart attack that will kill her and pull her out of his life forever. This is the level of humor that can be expected from most of this picture: madness, mixed with what can be taken for painful audacity. <br /> <br /> Seagal plays a New York lawyer who lives with her allegedly senile mother (Ruth Gordon), whose life is even more complicated when, hiring a nurse to take care of an old bag, meets the girl of her dreams, a pleasant chopor Trish van Dover, decorated like Florence Nightingale. His dilemma is how to integrate the beautiful nurse into the lives of his and his annoying mother. <br /> <br /> Segal is the only thing that keeps the picture together. His disappointments, his reactions, his comic time is almost unmatched (what happened to this guy?); where the film fails is in other areas. Characteristic Ruth Gordon is terrible as a mother. At first, you cannot understand whether her character is senile or just intentionally vague, so as not to let her son go. By the end it is clear that she is just crazy. When Seagal brings Van Dever home to meet her, Gordon purses her eyebrows and she gets an ominous, angry look. She wants the troublemaker in her son's life to be removed; she counts. This is not the mode of an old man. You do not get a consistent presentation throughout the whole picture, which is probably a director's mistake (Carl Reiner), just like Gordon. Old Ruth Gordon in Rosemary Baby is much more successful, because with such an ingratious, reticent man, who is usually played by Ruth Gordon, the public perceives her as annoying. But when Mia Farrow is too shy to resist, Gordon becomes more peaceful, her fangs dig deeper and deeper, and we fear for Farrow; this kind of imposing is really terrible. Here we are asked to laugh at what we usually find annoying, and if Gordon played it all helplessly crazy, we could. But she is selfish and evil, and it weakens the slightest humor. <br /> <br /> Although there are some good laughter. The scene in the courtroom with Barnard Hughes as a military officer and Rob Reiner as a punk counterculture is pretty funny, and Vincent Gardenia copes well with the role of the Lombard football coach. There is also an inspired episode in which Brother Segal (Ron Liebman), being undressed by robbers on his way to Seagal, asks him for something to wear at home - and he gives him a gorilla costume. <br /> <br /> But many scenarios are poorly thought out and simply do not make sense. Why does a New York lawyer with his own practice generally live at home? Why Segal, if his mother is an old man, tries to reason logically with her: “If you ruin this for me, I will beat your terrible heart”. Why does Liebman continue to cut the park if he knows that he is being robbed? Why does he take a taxi after leaving Seagal in a gorilla costume? Why didn't he take a taxi all the time? Liebman would be more ridiculous, as a gorilla terrorizing robbers. Why does Van Dever keep coming back - after her first husband was deceived, why does she want to participate in this group? I believe that if I say this to Carl Rainer, he will say: "These are crazy people, they do not need to have a meaning." This is a convenient way to justify a lousy scenario full of holes. The behavior of characters from moment to moment may not make sense, but their motives do, and that's where the "Where's Dad?" falling apart; situations are created only to shut the mouth, and the plugs are mostly single, they lead to nothing. <br /> <br /> Karl Reiner is the culprit in this whole fiasco. The way he acquired this vaunted reputation as a comedy pillar puzzles me; mostly his career was to hold the microphone in front of Sid Caesar and Mel Brooks while they talk in funny voices. His son Rob has ten times more skills and intelligence than the director. In terms of show business, Rainer presses buttons; Monkey can do its job. And this is most apparent in his action creation. Why is the whole of New York shot in close and close-up, but the scenes in the country are all far and panoramic? This is the mentality of the leadership of Karl Reiner, claustrophobia for the city, spatial for the country. In the last crazy scene in a nursing home, the camera is so far away that you can't even make out what is happening. A sharp ending suggests a resolution that Seagal could easily have reached ninety minutes ago; it also suggests that Rainer could not figure out how to complete the picture. Therefore, he simply cut it off, as another example of "madness." Rainer seems to think that dumbness is tantamount to insanity, and insanity without logic is always funny. It is not, and the creators of “Where's Poppa” are crazy, like Ruth Gordon, putting Pepsi in their fruit loops.
