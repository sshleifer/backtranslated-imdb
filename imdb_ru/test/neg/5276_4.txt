The German regional broadcast station WDR showed both the “General” and ODC. On Saturday, I looked at the “General” and thought that it was not very bad, but also not very good. But yesterday I saw ODC and turned it off in about an hour. Although Kevin Spacey was the main actor, the film was completely confusing and seemed restless. The “General” told the story straight and in order, but ODC just wanted to be cool. There is a link to Guy Ritchie's films "Locking, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch", but they do not have the coolness of these films. <br /> <br /> In the end, I would rate it 3 out of 10!
