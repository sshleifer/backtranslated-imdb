Carefully, my beauty (1952) Director: Harry Horner <br /> <br /> Production: The Filmmakers / RKO Radio Pictures <br /> <br /> A pompous thriller from a team of innovative producers Collier Young and Ida Lupino Filmmakers (with Lupino in some uncredited direction). <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan is “danger”, and Ida Lupino is “woman” in this recording in the film in the style of “woman in danger”. Ryan plays Howard Wilton, a seriously wounded psychotic handicraftsman (nope, Ryan? I know it's hard to believe). Lupino is a lonely military widow, Helen Gordon, who hires Howard for housework. From there things go down when Howard makes Helen a captive in his own home. <br /> <br /> Howard has an unpleasant secret, but he cannot reveal it. You see, consciousness is a real test for him. Maintenance, that is. He has a sad habit of coming and finding his employers dead. This is part of the film's problem. The nature of Howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is almost impossible to believe that he could move freely from town to town, even in 1918 (when the film was made). He can't remember anything that happened ten minutes ago. His violent, threatening, antisocial tendencies are caused by the smallest and most common things (young girl flirting, inconsistencies associated with the war, because he was rejected for service). I don't know how he went through the interview with Helen. There are other improbables. If you were locked in your house with a madman, but nevertheless remained alone for a while, could you find a way to escape? <br /> <br /> Ryan, I think, is defeated by the material. It feels like he is replaying his hand. His series of ticks and spasms, as well as loosely woven flashes of dementia - all this has already been done, this is a robotic feeling to them. At this point in his career, he probably played this character, to some extent, ten times, and it shows. We are encouraged to empathize with Howard (and I do not) through the shown pieces of humanity, such as the fact that the music box stops him, and his attitude towards a group of children who will not judge him. Lupino just has to act exhausted and in trouble, what she is more than capable of and what she is capable of. <br /> <br /> There was one thing in the picture: what will be the final resolution of the conflict? Therefore, naturally, there was a disappointing final, which was harsh and ineffective. <br /> <br /> A recurring motive in which the camera caught Howard’s reflection (in mirrors, water, Christmas decorations) caused a small interest. This indicated that what was happening or was going to continue was in his head. Horner (Wiki 1953), who earned his reputation for manufacturing design, does an excellent job of making the house feel like a prison. Credit is also always in a reliable RKO art department for housework. After all, non-standard work from directors who all have much better films to their credit. <br /> <br /> * ½ of 4
