So boring that you fall asleep after the first 20 minutes. Excuse me, Mr. Butonnat, I admire your work (all these wonderful "movies" that you made, such as Tristan, Without Logic, etc.), but here the plot is extremely ... vain! With the exception of a gorgeous photo, everything looks stupid, and there is no envy to know what will happen with these “average” actors. Moreover, the dialogues are minimalistic. The famous question “where are the children” is repeated so often that it looks like a farce. Believe me, this is a waste of time (relative to the plot), and 3 hours is a very long time. Of course, the real reason for this box office mess!
