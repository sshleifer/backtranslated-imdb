The action was terrible, the stupid, fake, INexpensive green screen effects were ridiculous, and the creatures were completely backward. The only good thing about this movie was the concept, and the laughter I got from watching such a bad movie â€” then I got angry because I realized that I had spent $ 4 on rent. Why should such a film be in cinemas? I know that this film was released almost 5 years ago, but does anyone make more efforts to create films? I just write random things to fill the space - because I need ten lines of text to publish this review. This next line is about to be made. Annnndddddd there!
