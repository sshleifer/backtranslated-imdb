I can't knock out this movie too badly, because in the middle of watching it, it’s obvious that they tried to make it bad or “amiable” if you like. In any case, many of the pieces that they tried to make funny, in fact, but often simply because of the cheese factor. Look at the game "Space Invaders", which really play, as in real life! Scratch your head with awkward robots ... oh, bullshit! And watch how it all goes through the top, at the end with “temporary deformation”! And the sexy hints just keep on flying ... I'm actually surprised that this will get away with PG. Well. An interesting way to spend a couple of hours, but this is not true, guys. 3 out of 10
