If this is the author's and director's idea about a piece of life, then this is a clinically manic-depressive syndrome. A sad, dark movie is, at best, with universally aimless and unhappy characters who negatively interact with catastrophic results. This film is a comedy. What was funny was that you lost your home because of an alleged arson or rape of one of the main characters. Does this art imitate life? Jack Black was a bit funny, like a mountain man, a grassy farmer. However, even this fragment of the film was full of pathos. What is the point of living off the beaten path with the environment. If Black's character was so paranoid, why did he make acid with a group of people straight from Woodstock? Is there no end to unrelated relationships, a plot without a script, and scene transitions devoid of any kind of coherence or logical chronology.
