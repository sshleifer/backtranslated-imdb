I like ghost stories, and I’ll watch a movie to the very end, even if I don’t really like it. I rarely feel that I wasted my time ... BUT, this adaptation of the Bell Witch story was terrible! <br /> <br /> It was not at all scary. What about comic relief moments? The dialogue was tedious. Act contradictory. The film was TOO long, and some scenes were unnecessarily drawn out in my revelation. (As with the birthday party) <br /> <br /> The only good idea I can think of is mentioning that the costumes and props were well made. <br /> <br /> I’m interested in another device, but until then I’ll stick to reading about the story.
