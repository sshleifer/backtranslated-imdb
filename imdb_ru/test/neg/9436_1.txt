You will feel that you have experienced a vacation in hell after you sat down and watched this terrible television movie. This film is an exercise in excessive action (very bad action) in situations that should be more than they are. I will not reveal the plot, but as soon as you understand why people in this film run away from the natives in the film, you will demand two hours of wasted time of your life. The only plus point is that Marcy Brady runs in bikini!
