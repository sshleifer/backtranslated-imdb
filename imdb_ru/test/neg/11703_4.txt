Phantom History has an interesting feminist background for the story of revenge, A-list veteran actors, colorful flashbacks with exquisite young old-looking colleagues. Staccato's awesome music, foreshadowing the approaching horrors, the atmospheric winter weather of New England and the superb charismatic actress in the lead role. A ghost story could be much more effective in black and white and eliminate some of the more sinister special effects, as well as present a more convincing scenario (we should not be wondering why there are two parkist-trailer assistants in the script)) the damage to the film - Craig Wassan (definitely separated at birth from Bill Maher), which, perhaps, from editing or just a bad game, is completely ineffective. It seems that he "specializes" in return shots with wide eyes; there is not much individuality here. However, the revelation is Alice Krieg, pale, mysterious, frightening under a calm appearance. However, her Eva Galley is eerie even before she meets her fate; I mean a young woman who says things like “I would like to take a bite out of you” or “Dance with me, little toad!” Is no longer on earth alive. The ghost story would be much better in the restrained Val Lewton mode. Excessive special effects completely reduce the cold factor.
