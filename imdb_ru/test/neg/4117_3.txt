Time travel is theoretical, so I can give the script some leeway. <br /> <br /> I also understand the concept that by changing only one variable, you can change the way the story is revealed. <br /> <br /> However, I cannot understand how the change occurred over time. We are subject to a series of "waves of time" that are gradually retrogradely evolving. Although this is a convenient plot device, since it gives our heroes enough time to solve the problem, there is no point in it. Of course, if you change a variable, and this variable has significantly or even completely changed the evolution of the planet, then by the time you return “back to the future,” is the evolutionary process already established, and there will be no need for waves? After all, why should the changes that occurred 65 million years ago wait until they take effect? The fact that the moth was designed on time could give it some credibility, but the life of this moth 65 million years ago was significantly changed, so any change in the evolutionary history would begin then, and would not depend on a return to our current time. <br /> <br /> To solve this problem, the command goes back in time to prevent changing the variable. By doing this successfully, we see that changes in evolution have never occurred, and that no one even remembers the event! Of course, what works for the solution should work for the initial change? I like a good adventure sci-fi adventure, but if it is not installed “in the galaxy far, far”, he needs to have at least some theoretical possibilities to make it really interesting. <br /> <br /> A good premise, a bad conspiracy, a sensible game and, to tell the truth, just a turn in the Jurassic Park. <br /> <br /> Not on my list again.
