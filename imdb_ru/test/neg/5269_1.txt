“An ordinary decent criminal” is based in some way on the exploits of Martin Cahill, who has already become the subject of John Boorman’s The General film of 1998. Cahill had a rough upbringing in slums and with distinction passed from petty crime to armed robbery. He justified his criminal career by pointing out his bad past at every opportunity. This is a common excuse for criminals who conveniently ignore thousands of slum dwellers who don’t want to rob post offices and sell weapons to make ends meet. Cahill made fools of the police and local authorities, not to mention the IRA, which brought him a sort of “People’s Hero” status, and also made him many enemies. Nevertheless, he was basically an immoral, self-serving thief. <br /> <br /> My main problem with ODC is that the main character is a cute Irish rogue. Kevin Spacey does a good job of portraying Michael Lynch with a mixture of oily charm and quiet threat, but the character is too immoral and selfish to be considered as any hero, even an antihero. <br /> <br /> The film is well shot and well shot by a good actor, but the script sums it up. Writer Gerard Stembridge cannot decide; Is he writing the Irish "Lock Stock" or more rude approach to Martin Cahill's thieves career? This is a problem when the writer bases his central character on a real person. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ODC followed the cinema release of the film The General by John Boorman, which was a more accurate reflection of the story of Martin Cahill. Cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good advertising, so it is not surprising that his exploits were film screenings. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is that the studio was ready to take Cahill's story and give it a happy ending to the Hollywood style. Kevin Spacey's charismatic sparrow thief, Michael Lynch, becomes anonymous on his motorcycle at ODC. In the real world, Martin Cahill was executed by an IRA, just to prove that no one makes fools of an outdated, sectarian and corrupt militarized organization and does not get away with it. <br /> <br /> The real Cahill would never go away from his ill fame, because it strengthened his self-esteem “The Man of the People”. If Michael Lynch leaves everything to avoid death in ODC, this is an excuse, ending in a weak and superficial film.
