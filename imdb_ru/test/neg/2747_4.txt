“AfterLife” is a rather arrogant, rich enough person who discovers that his mother is dying and discovers that he is caring for his sister, who has Down syndrome. He cannot be bothered with her, and basically just wants to take her off his hands; He has more important things to do. At some point, he found that he needed to take her by car (she does not like to fly) throughout the country. <br /> <br /> If all of this seems familiar to you, perhaps this is because you have seen `Rainman, a film far superior to its imitator, AfterLife. The fact that he copies the main premise (hell, he knocks out a few characters and even scenes) is not a fundamental problem of the film. The main problem is that I did not like these characters. <br /> <br /> Brother Kenny (Kevin McKidd) is a little womanizer. He has a girlfriend who comes and goes down in history, and who learns to love the sister of Down Syndrome (again, this is taken from "Rainman"). He is a journalist trying to interview a doctor who faces a scandal. When he ultimately looks after Robert, his sister, he doesn’t have much time for her, and sometimes he leaves her alone for too long. When she leaves, he becomes even angrier to her. Can I spoil something by saying that by the end of the film he will become a sweeter, loving person? <br /> <br /> Robert’s is not considered “normal”; she is “normal” and wants people to stop treating her differently. She is played by Paula Sage, an actress with Down Syndrome, and her performance is the best thing in the film; why did the screenwriter no longer study her character? Well, probably because it would mean that the characters would interfere with the stories. When we probably already know the story, didn't the filmmakers see the problem they were creating? <br /> <br /> For a film about a dying mother and her disabled daughter (father is absent; I think he is dead, but I'm not sure), it is amazing how little a film influences the emotions of the viewer. The scenes are made in such a standard, boring way, with such a standard, predictable dialogue that I rolled my eyes. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against sentimentality in films, but it really works if you take care of the characters. Here the characters are so uninteresting and two-dimensional that I did not even think that there is anything to worry about. “Rain” has an emotional climax, but it excited me because I took care of the characters. <br /> <br /> Speaking of climaxes, this film has an abomination. At the end of the film, there is a sequence that begins as an incredible situation and ends in an even worse territory; An unforgivable cruel stunt is played out in the audience. This sequence is designed to move the audience, but in the end it turns out to be terribly manipulating and insulting the viewer's intellect. The audience is not stupid, and they know when the film is deceiving. What a cheap shot. <br /> <br /> There is not a single scene in this film that has such an impact. Yes, there are some funny episodes, but when the characters talk to each other, I practically see the script in front of me, moving predictably and uninterestingly, never hitting anything that affects the mind or heart. There are those strange arguments that are reserved specifically for films, where another character knows exactly what kind of answer. Why supposedly “realistic” films do not realize that in real life anger can be irrational, and sometimes people can not express their emotions, and they can say something that does not make sense, or they can say nothing at all? All the actors in this film deserve better material. This film is not based on facts, but I think that a documentary about a family with Down syndrome will be much more interesting. So we could have truth and emotions. For some reason, the characters in this film think that emotion involves only saying something loudly and making the right expression. <br /> <br /> ** (of 5)
