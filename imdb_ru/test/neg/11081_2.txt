When I looked at the review of this film after watching it, I was surprised that there were people who gave it good grades. <br /> <br /> This is a film with a bad camera work. Everything “frightening” happens behind the scenes, usually accompanied by a close-up when someone shouts: “Have you seen / heard this?” Well, no, we have not seen it! We can not! And when there were no close-ups, the camera did something strange, for example, rotated upside down or really swung back and forth to convey the action or make us physically sick. <br /> <br /> The characters were incredible, because every two minutes they started shouting the same thing over and over again. I don’t care how it will be, I didn’t make a scary film to see sensible things! I expect unreasonable things like aliens, demons, or a good game! They were stupid too. Come on, let's have an intimate relationship in a cave! With all our clothes! Speaking about this, the ending somewhat contradicts what Domingo said just before his death. It strained me a little, though not as much as the fact that the finale led to ... a serious invasion of the privacy of a single girl. <br /> <br /> No plot, no climax, no good game, terrible camera -Work. What is left? Oh right. The end may have had a “twist,” but, as a rule, in horror films, the turn at the end really has a clear relationship to what happened during the film. The sixth sense explains a lot. Hide and seek also done. But the Cave had a weak turn, which served as an “explanation” if you could call it that way. Explain. Anything. <br /> <br /> I do not see this. You are welcome.
