The name of the Bible passage (Deut. 28:28). Let's say it is horribly taken out of context, but, nevertheless, it is from here that the name of this painful film comes. Other reviewers cover plot details, so I will not rephrase. But the husband, who is a psychiatrist, gives a lecture on “Lower Function”, where he discusses how a person can meet another person, and they can experience a “catastrophic crisis” in their lives when they cease to be masters of themselves and are incapable of fair judgment. He says it on the podium at the very moment when he sees Leonora Vale in the audience - a woman who will become his lover. It is not very subtle to show that this is really what will happen with this poor fellow. <br /> <br /> I think the whole premise of the film is implausible and simply did not work. This is a psychiatrist working on a hill, and we have to believe that this young, beautiful woman falls in love with him and finds himself between the happiness that he and his wife have shared. What is even more improbable is how a faithful wife reacts when she finds out about infidelity. Not only does she understand, but she INSURTS her husband to go on vacation with a vagabond for a few months - “so that we all can relieve ourselves a little from this unbearable stress.” Give me a break! I wanted to stretch my hand across the screen and strangle not only the adulterer, but also the dim wife. <br /> <br /> The fact that the entire film becomes a memory, already revealing the end of the film at the beginning. (the fact that the husband was in a terrible accident) - this leaves no doubt as to the outcome of the dirty business. I think it was a bad decision, since it leaves absolutely no turns for the plot, since the whole film is completely predictable. You already know about his wife’s departure from the case at the beginning of the film, when she calls the lover to the dying man’s bed and does not express any ill will towards her. <br /> <br /> Not only the script is faulty, but Noel Trus is terribly mistaken (although this is his script). He and Leonora have absolutely no chemistry on the screen. Interestingly, Michael Redgrave was originally played in this role, but was replaced during filming. I wonder what it is about? In the end, neither the husband nor the wife cause you sympathy for any of them. I think Margaret Leighton played the string quite well. But she could not overcome all the shortcomings of this film. In addition, as is the case with many British producers of this era, the dialogue is difficult to understand because of the limited, quick speech picture of the actors. I saw it on TV and could not even rely on hidden subtitles to fill in the blanks for me. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this.
