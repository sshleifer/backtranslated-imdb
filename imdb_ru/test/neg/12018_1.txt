I saw this movie in the theater, and it was a terrible movie. The way Michael Oliver has now become even worse in the sequel is the greatest intolerance that I cannot bear. Junior upset his father because he did not go to school, which made his father Ben insanely insane. In addition, the operator of a crazy dance trip is unfair to Junior for not allowing him to go on a trip. And this Lawanda Dumore is as terrible as a serial killer for Junior, because she made threatening insults to Junior, so I can't stand this movie. Even if the film is re-released back to the cinema in the extended version, I still will not watch this film, because I can not stand this film. Actually, it stinks!
