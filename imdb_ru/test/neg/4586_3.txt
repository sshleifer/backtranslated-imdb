The plot: the trucker (Christopherson) fights with the corrupt sheriff (Borgnine), forcing his trucker comrades to unite and form an irrepressible convoy, stretching for miles and soon creating national madness in the media. <br /> <br /> NEGATIVE: The installation of the film is weak, and the ending is even weaker. It has all the clichés of "good ole-boy / trucker", without adding anything new to the process. The result is that SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT look shiny and inspired. Christofferson is too relaxed to play a major role, and can not bear the picture. The character Borgnina is pictured awkwardly. In the beginning, he was made to look like a real jerk of the sheriff, who overdid a little trick that begins the whole spin. Then, eventually, he becomes a little more sympathetic and even secretly supports Christopherson, which does not work at all. In any case, Jackie Gleason is a much better actor for this role. The worst part of the film is the Pekingpa director’s attempt to add a “serious message” to this stupid action movie that only slows it down and explodes in the process. <br /> <br /> POSITIVE: the only good scene in the whole film is the fight in the truck stop restaurant. Directed by Pekingapa, it is ridiculous to talk about violence in "slow motion", and the result is fun. Unfortunately, he begins to put all the action in slow motion during the rest of the picture, until it eventually becomes tedious. It is always a pleasure to look at McGraw, but, unfortunately, she is given very little to say or do. <br /> <br /> LOW: If you read a quick review, you essentially “watched” the movie. The song on which this film is based is pretty good, but the film adds nothing to it and should never have been made. This is all very boring stuff for such an independent director. RATING: 3 out of 10.
