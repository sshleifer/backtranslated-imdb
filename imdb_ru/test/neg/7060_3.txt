I like a lot of movies about Mirna Loy. This film was shot before the identity of the actor was developed. It would be a good short film, but it seems to last forever in full form. <br /> <br /> Mirna Loy seems to have told what to do with her acting and does her job. That's almost all you can say about her. <br /> <br /> Her gypsy character has a trashy character, and the film has many flaws, such as a scene in a jewelry store. <br /> <br /> This film is probably interesting for fans of Mirna Loy, but even that is disappointing.
