The film had an interesting surprise. Somewhat psychologically exciting. And the creators could finish it with taste, without turning it into another series of films released by Hollywood, promoting homosexuality and / or other sexual deviations. This could have resulted in a “payback”, but there were other motives behind the pen. What distracts me is that the dirt hit your face AFTER you saw the whole movie. Like the disappointing "Talented Mr. Ripley." Yes, of course, I'm just another Puritan. This fun content blurred the whole movie. I would not judge a film by artistic or entertainment value if its sole purpose was to promote hidden political motivation, especially for this.
