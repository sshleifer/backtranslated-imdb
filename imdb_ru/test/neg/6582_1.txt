I know that most other reviews say that this film was great, but I have to disagree. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a good book! It was one of my favorites when I was very young. But this is just not for theaters. Maybe for half an hour, but I donâ€™t understand how they can turn a short book about children into a whole feature film. <br /> <br /> This is a cute movie, but I would recommend it really small children. Older children will not be interested in this. Adults may have a little more interest if they watch it with their young ones. But anyone over 7 years old will hold a snoring festival. <br /> <br /> Sorry if you do not agree with me, but this is my opinion. :)
