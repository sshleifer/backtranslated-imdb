I heard a lot of new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in Southeast Asia over the past three years. Apparently, he is on the verge of mutation into something very contagious, and millions and millions of people will be destroyed in a global pandemic. Just thought that I will mention this if you have not had time to write your will. <br /> <br /> I also thought that I would mention this because I watched something tonight called CAREER that didn’t. "t about a naval war, but it starts with a scene that is something the average between outbreak and the episode “X FILES" that I saw many years ago. I thought I would watch something with an additional resonance after hearing stories about the danger posed by avian flu, but after the inconspicuous opening of CARRIERS goes down to cheap and funny TVM and, like any other TVM, you will see that the main characters are women alone and of which, an authority figure, while another leading woman is the mother of small children. It goes without saying that there is a story about a sick child. <br /> <br /> What is annoying in the TVM format is that suppresses the potential of what could be a good movie if it was made for a movie. There is a rather bloody scene when someone coughs blood all over the nurse's face, and a very impressive crazy walker becomes insane, but these bits are quickly forgotten, so as the mood goes down to family moods, as it is - and and every other TVM, ever - made for essentially a female audience
