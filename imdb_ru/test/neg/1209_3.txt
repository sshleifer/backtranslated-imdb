It's hard to believe that this bad film was shot not once, but four times! Most films need to have a certain “suspension of reality”, but this one goes too far. The main scenario - the pilot of the Air Force, who was shot down over the "Middle Eastern" country. The US government is delaying his search, forcing Pilot’s son (Doug Masters) to attempt a rescue operation. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with the film, which shows that the USAF is one huge joke. In the film, you will find that Doug and his friends at the air base managed to provide two F-16s, all ammunition, fuel, Intel for the mission, and so on. Security on this base seems like a joke. It seems no one has any problems with the fact that a sixteen year old child has full qualifications for piloting an F-16! <br /> <br /> If this was not enough, you might think that the producers would at least try to get the ammunition right, as people like to see them explode. Not this way! Several times in the film, Doug launches AIM-9 missiles at ground targets. AIM stands for Air Intercept Missile, which means the weapon used to hit targets in the AIR. It also launches 15-20 missiles, where the maximum F-16 can hold 6 AIM-9. The film also lacks continuity. You will see that the plane is configured with one set of ammunition, and in the next scene it has a completely different package of ammunition. In addition, 20 mm does not just completely destroy everything it touches! The F-16 will hold 500 shots of 20 mm each and it is mainly used for self defense. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever with plot holes, flaws and frankly incorrect information from the film, but I won not tired of you. If you're in the mood for a good BBC movie, your choice is rather meager. Most war films deal with the army, navy, or marines. Until Hollywood can create an Air Force film based on "Saving Private Ryan" or "A Few Good People", we will have to watch films like the Iron Eagle series. <br /> <br />
