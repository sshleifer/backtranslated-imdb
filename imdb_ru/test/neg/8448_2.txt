This is just one of those films that cannot justify much of what is happening. These people go hiking: a young girl wants to photograph animals. Piranhas are not really there, but I think that the psychosis hunter is a real piranha. In any case, there are a lot of animals and a lot of driving. There is a lot of talk about fighting weapons, but we all know where this is going. By the end, there is a lot of action and rape. Someone must pay, and they pay. It would be nice to have a couple of piranhas to somehow fill it. There were many monkeys. If you move forward through the dim parts, you will have a little tense five minutes.
