As a serious marathon runner, I was seriously disappointed in this film. His target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon, or novice marathoners. Following the stories of two novice marathoners, one older, one wounded runner, and two elites preparing for the Chicago Marathon, the film devotes most of its attention to one novice woman whose story is bored because of the lack of a better word. Although I really liked the brief information about the training sessions of Dina Castor, a brief history of the Boston Marathon and the Marathon in general, let me emphasize: they were brief !! Watching some of Jo's runners getting ready for Saturday's race with their water bottles and talking about how they look at the marathon is not inspiring, and the nonstop cliches about achievements and good smiling runners make you want the movie to be about an hour is shorter. If you are a marathoner for the first time, this film can give you the feeling “I can do it”. For anyone else, run away.
