This must have been the worst Steven Seagal film I've ever watched (even worse than an eco-series like Deadly Land and Fire Down). I'll start with good moments ... he has a stylish direction for a DTV movie and a wonderful scene ... That's it! The story is really not going anywhere, it's just a collection of well-put on stage plays, just like Segal, go and shoot the bad guys (the number of victims can easily be compared to Tarantino in his bloody game!). The plot is unnecessarily complex and confusing, you forget who the good and bad guys are. The action (I use the term loosely) is mediocre at best, Seagal's usual SIMULTANEOUS facial expression and wooden behavior, which I can accept, but others, especially the British, were terrible. <br /> <br /> What's in the package? Why are the bad guys after that? Seagal customizable? <br /> <br /> WHO GIVES ***! <br /> <br /> When I made this film in my local blockbuster (as soon as I paid), the assistant laughed at me and said that this was the worst movie in the store I could choose! (I wanted to hit him before my arm went numb) <br /> <br /> In any case, I haven’t yet seen Half Past Dead or Out for murder, and I don’t dare to go back for more humiliation in my shop, but they can't be worse than this turkey. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack must be young and fashionable - it just gave me a boost for half a dozen asprin. <br /> <br /> All in all this is Seagal on his MAIN! The guy who scored about 100 pounds and looks good behind this, he is a guy who just does not know when to stop, he should retire NOW! and go behind the camera or become a martial arts teacher or something. <br /> <br /> My score is 2/10 (1 point for the scenery)
