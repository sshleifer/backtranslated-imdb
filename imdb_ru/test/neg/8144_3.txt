For an Indian film, it's probably a little better than 3 out of 10, but overall it only gets 3. The effects are not terrible, and at least they have adults playing roles for adults, and not all children as much. indie low budget horror movies do. The acting is very wooden, but at least they had a better “show” than some films in the budget category. This is filmed a lot inside the building and not in the basement of a friend. The plot as a whole is not the worst. This Resident Evil is cheating about an evil corporation that invaded a small city, and a flash makes people into zombies. I would like some creatures, not a big villain, to be just “super” zombies. I try not to write spoilers, but this review has one, so be careful! CAUTION, SPOILERS !!! Not only do some of the cast seem to simply neglect the zombies (the same ones are processed again and again, but at least they are played by more than 5 people). But one of the plot twists really doesn't fly with me. The deputy who goes inside turns out to be on the salary of evil corporations. He kills one of the other employees in cold blood, and then meets with the main bad guy in the office, talking about how to put things in order. The deputy just showed us that he is also a very bad person and speaks as if he can remove him (that is, kill all the surviving witnesses) without any problems. But after 2 seconds he helps them. There were no real emotions of “changing the heart” or something that could make me feel that this bad guy stopped killing an innocent guy just a few minutes ago, and then talked about putting everyone away to become their savior. There were no accidents or anything that could make me buy it. It is worth seeing if you are a fan of low-budget films, otherwise you will not like it.
