As if the editor and screenwriter had only 40 minutes of real-time work. It is assumed that this is a remake of the Chinese film, which is clearly far superior to this garbage. It is clear that some brainless Hollywood lawsuit or writer has decided that this film will be “Mano, Mano, Man vs. Man,” instead of just giving the storyline of characters that were created in the first 40 minutes. At the moment in the film, the characters simply do not behave like ordinary people and do not even like their own personalities. It makes little sense. It is quite clear why this film failed. This is simply implausible, and this is very bad - it all started with a promise. Do not be fooled.
