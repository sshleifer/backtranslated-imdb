"House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim" (2005) is a sequel, although you really don't need to watch the first "House of the Dead" to get this movie. However, the production value is definitely here, with great zombie effects, and it is edited pretty well, with very effective sound effects. However, this is all that is good here. <br /> <br /> History and script are terrible. There are obvious holes in the conspiracy everywhere. It's also funny that soldiers don't mind if they get blood on their faces (as opposed to 28 days later, when blood in any part of the body will infect you). Also realistic, as there is little order with the soldiers, as opposed to the usual US military discipline. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
