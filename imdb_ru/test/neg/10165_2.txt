When I watched this movie today, I got the feeling that this thing was missing in about 10-15 minutes from the beginning of the story. John Wayne rides this trading post / sedan off the beaten path to meet with the owner about some looting. All he sees are signs of a massacre, several corpses, signs of a fight and no one alive in sight. This is because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, similar to the one you find in the ancient English murder mysteries. <br /> <br /> The reason why you find these hidden rooms in similar stories is that they used to be priests. Catholic families clinging to the old faith in England of the 16th century built these things to hide those who were on the run from the royal authorities because of their faith. Not what you see in westerns, but a good trick. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, due to poor editing or writing, or both, we never know exactly what brought Wayne to this place. But it was B western and even not very good. <br /> <br /> Gabby Hayes is in this, he is clean-shaven and plays the dumb part of the time. Unusual circumstance for the talkative Gabby. <br /> <br /> If you want to take care and find out what is happening and see Gabby Hayes without a mustache, watch this movie.
