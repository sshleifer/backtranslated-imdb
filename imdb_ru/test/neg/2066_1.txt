I don’t even know where to start ... <br /> <br /> You shouldn’t print a review, so I’ll just quote what another user wrote, because I completely agree, but I give 1/10 instead of 2 / 10 "I find it difficult to find words to express how badly I thought this film was. The initial commandment was promising, but in all respects it was completely terrible later. Let's get the basics right. The plot is a good initial Idea, but really awful development. There were many moments when I thought, “No, no one will do anything oh so stupid. ”The ending was amazingly anti-climatic. Characterization — all the characters were either completely soft or grotesque cartoons. I keep thinking about one that wasn’t — maybe a mother, but that’s all. The direction is completely amateur. Cinematography - I doubt they heard about it. The viewing angles / stability / zoom of the camera are often very bad. I’m completely taken aback by how this film has received such high praise. This is the worst film I’ve seen in movies in many years, if not ever. "
