Before Stan Lorel became the lesser half of the greatest comedy team of all time, he worked under contract with Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of cheap performances, many of which were parodies of major Hollywood roles. Most of the “parody” Laurel films are only slightly ridiculous and even less ridiculous for a modern audience who have not seen the original film that Laurel parodies. Fortunately, “Mud and Sand” is filming a film that is still well known: “Blood and Sand”, starring Rudolf Valentino. “Blood and Sand” was released just nine weeks before this parody, giving you some insight into how quickly Broncho Billy’s films were selected, edited and distributed. <br /> <br /> Various sources (including IMDb) state that Stan Lorel of the character in this film is called Vaselino's rhubarb, with the final “o”. I looked at the “Dirt and Sand” print with the original headers (Hobo font), so I report that the role of Laurel was in fact screaming rhubarb Vaseline with “e.” But I agree that Vaselino is funnier. Laurel copies the carefully thought-out whiskers that Valentino wore in Blood and Sand (he had to make them longer!), And there is a parody of Valentino's dressing scene from this film, from which in 1922 female viewers fainted. Carmen in the original film is parodied here as Caramel (the girl I would like to sink my teeth into). <br /> <br /> This film (like the original) obviously takes place in Spain, but there is a gag for the ban, Laurel uses a distinctive gesture that could become his calling card (for example, Hardy’s characteristic tie), but I have never seen him in any other Laurel movie. There is an amusing dialogue: rhubarb Vaseline tells other matadors: “Save the bull for me.” When Vaseline becomes a successful bullfighter, the footman says to him: “A bull without, sir” ... it is funny, but I was disappointed that Laurel did not answer “Without WHAT?”. <br /> <br /> There is one funny moment here that was almost certainly not planned when Vaseline appears on auditions for the bullfighter. Laurel bursts into the bullring, and - before you can say “kerid bullfight” - he throws the bull over the fence, where he lands with a beat next to other listeners. The bull is obviously fake, but shut up anyway ridiculous ... and, yes, there is a title card with a joke about how to "throw the bull." Accident occurs when Laurel repeats the gag, and Vaseline throws a second bull over the fence. This one lands on the ass and balances in an upright position for a moment before falling. Very funny! If someone planned this venture in this comedy, I salute the unknown villain ... and the techie who set up the bull to land in that position. Most likely, this happened by luck, and the director and editor were smart enough to keep it to themselves. <br /> <br /> In an era of silence, whenever Hollywood shot a high-budget feature film that was installed in any place where people don’t wear it, if you don’t speak English, it was a common cinematographic device: showing a piece of text local jargon, and then dissolved in the frame of the same English text. I was surprised that this low-cost comedy spent money on copying this device here: we see a bulletin board outside the bullfight with a message in Spanish, then it dissolves into the same text in English. Unfortunately, the photo in this cheap movie is so dark that the effect is lost. <br /> <br /> The actresses in this film are attractive ... including Broncho Billy Leon Anderson’s wife and Stan Laurel Mae Dahlberg’s civil wife; the latter is briefly dancing. (May danced in Stan's vaudeville act.) I was surprised to see stepbrother Charlie Chaplin Wheeler Dryden in a short role, since Chaplin had nothing to do with this film. In Dirt and Sand, Laurel gives a funny presentation that is not at all like his later familiar character Stanley ... but this film is much less fun than his brilliant work with Oliver Hardy. My rating: only 3 out of 10. NOTE TO TRIVIA: Twenty-three years later, in the latest American film of Stan Lorel - The Toreador (1945) - he again played the Spanish bullfighter (with his Spanish voice after dubbing). ). Coincidentally, in this film, footage from the movie “Blood and Sand” was used: not the Valentino film, but a remake of Tyrone Power. The “dirt and sand” is funnier than the “Toreador”, but not by much.
