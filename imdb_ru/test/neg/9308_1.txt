Yahoo Serious is like a $ 3 bottle of wine - there was no substance to begin with and only gets worse with age. This film proves that it is completely toxic. We can only hope that this is his last film and that his serious lack of success will reduce his chances of getting funding for any future ventures. It's right there with "Lightning Jack" and "Les Patterson Saves the World" as the most horrible example of an Australian comedy imaginable. How tragic that with so many endlessly excellent comedic talents in Australia, Yahoo gives such means to express its brand of children's school comedy. And to think - he had 7 years to come up with a script. This genius!
