this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and what disappoints me the most is the fact that this is Yash Raj, so first, when you see commercials, you think yes, itâ€™s definitely another hit is Yash Raj. to disappoint the plot is stupid and stupid we have seen this many times a boy will soon marry and fall in love with a girl blah blah blah. if you see this pathetic movie, don't go with your family, too many scenes and kisses. I don't even understand why you go for it yourself. In general, this shameful is disgusting, and everything else that is bad and begins with movie D, do not watch it, eventually you will hate films Yash Ji and Yash RJJ
