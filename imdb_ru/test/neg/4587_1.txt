This movie is included in my file "The worst movies ever made." I have a copy of this film, which I watch when I want to laugh, and this is not even a comedy. I am disappointed that such great actors agreed to be in such a piece of garbage. This film is inaccurate (in a hockey image), offensive (for Canadians), and I was not even impressed with the game. Even the story was a little weak. If you've never seen this movie, you're in luck. If you have, sorry.
