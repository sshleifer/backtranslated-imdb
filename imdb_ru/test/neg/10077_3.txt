(Possible minor spoiler) The first “Jurassic Park” was an effective but stupid film that did the trick and was actually quite good. There were some decent moments in the sequel to The Lost World, but those were destroyed by the lame final part of the film, in which T-Rex broke out in San Diego. Now in Jurassic Park III, what a little story that was first and subsequent was thrown out of the window and replaced with simple 90 minute non-stop actions that would work if the film had not been so poorly done. <br /> <br /> Sam Neal returned as a doctor Grant, to whom the couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) offered to go with them to the island to help them find a son who was lost for more than 2 months. But, of course, this island, as it turned out, is inhabited by dinosaurs, and, of course, the plane on which it is located, just crashed, leaving them stranded with a bunch of dinosaurs after them. <br /> <br /> This one was obviously conceived as an exciting journey, with no real story at all, but even at this level the film does not deliver. Director Joe Johnston (“Jumanji”) somehow managed to take the little magic left in the Jurassic films and squeeze life out of it. <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs look good, although by now they’re just a standard fair and not very scary. The bottom line is that this is not a very good movie, even as an exciting trip. * of 4 stars.
