I wanted this movie so much ... I really loved it. But it was a terrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> I read the novel by Jennifer Egan in 1996 and was delighted with this story. In fact, it remains one of my favorite books of all time. Keep in mind, the book had a much greater depth than this film, in the plot and emotional resonance. It made you take care of the characters. She painted a complete picture of Phoebe, in contrast to the extremely poor characteristics of a young girl in the film. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that she is beautiful and shows * some * promises in her burgeoning career, Jordana Brewster was as flat and hollow as the performance was in the script. And Christopher Eccleston (Wolf) was just a terrible choice for the role of Wolf, both physically and logically. What an awkward looking couple. The wolf was supposed to be a darker thoughtful character and more physically attractive, as he was in the book. Moreover, the chemistry between the two actors was painfully constrained. <br /> <br /> Cameron Diaz, however, deserves the highest praise for her performance. She took an incredibly mediocre script and gave her character a life, a real spirit. She is simply gorgeous, and her cautious manners make her very believable, like a hippie. It is a pity that her talent was spent on this forgettable film. <br /> <br /> In the “movie book” category, this is a terrible translation, almost as bad as “Message in a Bottle” with Kevin Costner. But don't make me start with this ... <br /> <br /> I am usually not so harsh in my criticisms, but I was so disappointed because I really cared about the story and wanted her to tell the right. It did not deliver ... <br /> <br />
