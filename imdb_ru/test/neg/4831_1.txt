Wait until you see it .... I mean even after reading this review. No other goodbye movie sucked more than this one ... One thing I don’t understand is that when you make an English movie, why add your own creativity? With the amount spent on making this film, the producers had to think about buying the rights to “Cellular” in Hindi and releasing the film. I think they could make a profit that way. If there was a chance to rate this film with 0, I would do it, and the most pretentious performances belong to Tanushri Datta and the girl who played as an associate with Aftab. I do not know if my problem is that I saw Cellular much earlier than this film ..... but this may not be the reason to support this movie ... I could go on for a few hours, but I don’t have time to discuss this useless crap from the movie, I don’t want to remember these terrible scenes from the movie ..... <br /> <br /> Please stay away from this movie.
