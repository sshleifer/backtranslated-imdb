I have been an avid fan of Jane Austen for many years. I have never seen this adaptation, so when I heard about it, I came here and read all the great reviews. Based on this, I willingly ordered it from Netflix. What a cruel disappointment! They took one of the most subtle and vivid comic novels and made it boring. It seems that each character was given one facial expression, one tone, on which their flat characters were based. Although this adaptation seems to have used every word written by Jane Austen, they seem to have been randomly transmitted to the characters. Despite the fact that it was made as a mini-series, this adaptation manages to confuse and feel how it was done, as in the film of the week. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bennett is too harsh, Mrs. Bennet is just a talkative chipmunk, Mr. Darcy is lifeless like a nutcracker, Bennett's girls are almost indistinguishable, and Mr. Wickham is a man whom no one will look twice, - hardly an attractive ham! I'm totally upset!
