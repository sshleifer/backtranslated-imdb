I watched this movie because I thought it would be a classic Amy Adams movie. Wow, this film is so bad on many levels that it is amazing. He is poorly designed, the script and acting is terrible. But hey, even Johnny Depp has a lot of bad movies under his belt. The positive moment of this film would be Amy's singing, and even on that score, I think, one could choose the best songs. Amy is nice to see, of course, and if you are a devoted fan of her, you’ll probably watch this title, no matter what, just don’t expect too much. I wish I could find more to please, but it was just painful to watch. I recommend Sunshine Cleaning or Doubt.
