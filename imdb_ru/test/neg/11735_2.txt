So, Gus Van Sant wanted to remake Psycho in color so that he could bring it to the modern audience, who is likely to have a cardiac arrest if they are ever forced to watch a movie in black and white while they are comfortable. they forget that both the "Clerks" and "Schindler's List" were shot in black and white and are excellent films. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the same narrow-minded people who would not like to watch a great movie just because it is in black and white. Whites are the same people who, in any case, will not like Psycho, because there is no scene of murder or sex every two minutes. And the killings are not the terrible bloody / intestinal / bleeding / bunk that people are used to after watching Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Nightmare on Elm Street. That is why remaking "Psycho" almost exactly as it was originally intended, did not work, because it is really interesting only to people who are fans of the original. All the rest just watch how they are added until the next sequel “Cry” comes out, and for this reason they will be disappointed. "Psycho" relies on uncertainty and mystery, and not on blood and courage. (And so that no one would think that I should be a senior citizen, if I like old films, let me just say that I am 21 years old). <br /> <br /> So, if everything was in a color movie that Van Sant wanted to change, why not just color the film and not release it again? I mean, what's the point of remaking a movie if you're not going to change anything? The least he could do was incorporate his own directorial work into it, and not just copy Hitchcock — or, even better, hire a new writer to adapt the new script from the original book Psycho. But it seems that Van Sant could not decide whether he wanted to remake Psycho * for sure * or not. It was supposed to be an “all or nothing” project - either to remake the film accurately, or to do it differently - but in its current form this film is about 95% the same, but with a few added strokes that seem to have no purpose, For example, when Norman masturbates while he is spying on Marion undressing. It doesn’t fit the plot at all, and the only reason he did it was because he * could * He wanted to say: “Hitch couldn’t show that people masturbated in 1960, so I'm going to do it.” Damn it, a big deal, as if I'm so shocked to see someone masturbating. And what's the point of showing single shots of clouds and farm animals, glued to the scene of the murder? And then he misses the * important * scene where Leela and Sam meet the sheriff outside the church. <br /> <br /> In addition, using almost the exact same script, the whole film seems an anachronism. The opening credits state that 1998. Then what about the 60-year-old Marion dress or the umbrella that she carries with her? Why do Marion and Sam have a date in a hotel room, when these days no one will be shocked by what they are doing? Why is there no air conditioning in the office of Marion? Why are there no TVs in the Bates Motel and there are apparently no automatic locks on the doors? Why should the sheriff ask the operator to associate him with the Bates Motel? That is why the use of the same scenario was a mistake - just changed a few words here, and they were not enough to modernize it. It needed a complete revision. <br /> <br /> Although Vince Vaughn and Norman performed well, he was simply not right. Part of what made the original “Psycho” so creepy was that Norman had such an innocent quality of “the boy next door”, so no one could believe that he was capable of such horrible crimes. When Vince Vaughn plays a role, is anyone really surprised that Norman was a psychopathic killer? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I can understand that Gus Van Sant was obviously a fan of the original film Psycho and wanted to be a tribute. This is not a bad film, but the problem is that it can only be the effect of some people on Psycho. I really think you should see this movie only if you saw the original. Since I am a fan of everything connected with Psycho, I bought a used copy of the remake, which I can sometimes watch. The original film was filet mignon, while the remake was a hamburger. But even filet mignon will become boring if you eat every day, so it's nice, if there is an occasional hamburger for a change.
