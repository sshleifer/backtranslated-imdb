As you probably remember, it seemed to me that all three garbage trilogies and the first film was the only one even remotely close to viewing. The second part was poor quality sewage, and this contribution is slightly better than two, but still one smoking pile of something that I removed from my yard last Monday. The assumption does not make sense why self-racers killed this poor old woman, and even in 1921 I think that someone will notice a bunch of fat guys where a cute little old woman once lived. Secondly, this scarecrow is pathetic compared to how cool they looked in the first film. It's just old clothes and burlap. Let's face it, the TV series garbage and which you need to forget. A LOOP!
