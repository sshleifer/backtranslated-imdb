Now I know that a lot of black humor makes fun of typical black things, such as gold teeth. But this does not mean that they are always fun. Do not be a threat - an example of this. The urban film is definitely suitable for satire. The problem is that the vaianas and their spouses are not only trying to saturate the typical culture of the "ghetto", but also belittle the actual statements made in urban films, such as Boyz 'n' Hood or Threat Society II. Personally, I think that the creators of this film should be distracted from the excrements of their white masters. In addition, the film itself is terrible. This is absolutely not funny. Anecdotes racist. Instead of making fun of the genre of urban cinema, the filmmakers show their views on the "ignorant" urban (ghetto) blacks. Now there are other jokes in this movie, but I think this is the main rate. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film is crap, and creators must use their talents to create a constructive comedy / satirical film. They have examples in the movies “Men with black hats” (shot before this film) and on Friday.
