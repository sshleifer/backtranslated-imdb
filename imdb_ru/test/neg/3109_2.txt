Honestly, I didn’t have high expectations from this film, but at the same time I was full of hope. The presence of director Albert Pune - one of the most famous authors of b-films - did not quite inspire hope. I mean, how many Albert Pune films rate this high? Yes, precisely ... but still the film advertised a decent cast. Rob Lowe, Burt Reynolds (before glory reincarnation), Ice-T and Mario Van Peebles. <br /> <br /> It’s like squatting because the film is so boring and moves so slowly that the energy just seemed to drain right out of me, the longer it went on. It lasts more than 90 minutes, but tells a story that could be told in 30 minutes. I don't know why Pune is here. I mean, the film is imbued with artistic style, but sometimes it's a blur, and maybe I'm an idiot to expect more from Pyun this time. Here he seemed to really have a budget and a potentially excellent composition for the material, but this was all in vain. "Mad Six" - not so much an action movie, but nothing at all. <br /> <br /> I think the saddest thing here is that I think that the last roles are the most interesting part of the film. The musical accompaniment is actually half decent, with a little female vocal, but the rest is a waste, and the less said, the better. Avoid.
