Although I watched this movie myself (fortunately), I still felt embarrassed while watching. I was fooled by the front cover reviews, and the bloody / sand camera was still on the back panel, which made me believe that it was some kind of documentary. These actors are ridiculous throughout the film, not at all convincing. In this story, the Italian Australian (?) Gang just fights with other gangs, and then runs, fights, repeats. Supposedly, they train very hard, which makes them much better than other gangs. For some reason, I do not believe that they can beat some of these guys, who are twice as many as them. I can be wrong ... no, I am not mistaken, this film does not deliver any pleasure at any level. The montage in prison looked like it was a summer camp, just instead of children it was a sausage celebration of horrible actors, just hanging out and laughing and trying to look hard. This movie is not worth your time, save your money or throw it in the trash, just donâ€™t waste it on this movie.
