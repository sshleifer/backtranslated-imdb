it could have been better, but it was good ... it helped me get rid of my boredom. I didnâ€™t even want to see it, the only reason I wanted to rent it is because Jamie Marz is in it ... he is an unknown actor, but he shines and is the highlight of the film ... the final was so terrible and the action was good for the movie ... i give it 4 out of 10
