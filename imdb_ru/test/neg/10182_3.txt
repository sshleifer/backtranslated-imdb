Wow, just wow. There are already a lot of reviews on this film, but I would like to add my own comments. I agree with the majority of reviewers who said that in this film is a terrible acting game, composition and direction. However, I think there are other problems here. <br /> <br /> 1. Why are Christian faith and benefits for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive? Does the film act as if you simply cannot be a Christian, and also admit such a possibility? What for? They very briefly relate to this in the film (that is, “The Bible does not say that there are aliens.” “Well, the Bible does not say no.) But the actual refutation has never been answered. The Bible doesn't really say no. So how about resolving the issue instead of turning it out of control? Or, even better, to recognize that this is the infinite universe in which we live, and if we believe in the infinite God there is the likelihood that he somewhere has arranged some other life and has his own plans for them. <br /> <br /> 2. Why are the ONLY two explanations of the abductions demons and hoaxes? What about sleep paralysis and night terrors that were associated with abductions? What if it is something completely different? It is a pity that the filmmakers have already made a decision. <br /> <br /> 3. The filmmakers claim that everyone who has had an abduction experience I had connections with the occult. This is a fairly large claim that can be made without any actual evidence. I contend that they do not, but if you are going to say something so stupid, you better have the facts to prove it. <br /> <br /> 4. Why does another reporter (and not Gray-haired blond, another) always keep his hands in his pockets? It is difficult to take someone seriously when he constantly plays a pocket pool. <br /> <br /> I WANT this to be a study of the Christian faith and UFO phenomena, but unfortunately the filmmakers were too concerned about their “Message of Faith”. “a lot of care about making a thought-provoking film. As a Christian himself, it saddens me.
