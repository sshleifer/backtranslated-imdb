Ron Hall poses a triple threat when he writes, directs and acts in Vampire Killers. Derek Washington (Hall) - your cliché-cop on a mission that turns upside down in some other action of a vampire. Throwing away his badge, he is looking for the last vampire killer (no, not Buffy!) To take the streets and beat the bloodsuckers back to the grave. <br /> <br /> “Vampire Slayer” is a terrible movie. He is ripping off so many other films (can you say Blade?) That he is not even trying to establish his own identity. The script does not exist. The action is terrible. Who said microbud stimulates creativity? There is nothing even remotely interesting. You get nothing from this except a headache. Stay away at all costs.
