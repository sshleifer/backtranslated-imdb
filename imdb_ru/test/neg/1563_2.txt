By a strange coincidence, I began to watch this movement right after Bris de Nice, and it’s good that few films could be worse than Bris de Nice, so I was really waiting for something better that would make me forget this terrible failure. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, OSS-117 again left me disappointed - I don’t know, maybe it's just a problem with translations, but since Diner de Cons I haven’t seen ANY French comedy that I would called really good. Even when I watch reviews on IMDb, only people from France give high marks to OSS-117 ... <br /> <br /> For me, this film really didn’t work - in some parts it is as funny as real Bond films In others, the jokes were a bit too predictable or too banal.
