This is a typical student comedy and it is very average. The story is fine, but not very interesting. It's about an unlucky guy named Reno, who loses his job, tears off his car, and then his uncle dies in a strip bar. He has a girlfriend though (good by the way. :-). In any case, this uncle gives him his mansion in Los Angeles and Mercedes as a legacy, and soon Renault and his girlfriend move to Los Angeles to this new home. The problem is that they would need several roommates to pay a high rent for this house, and so the film unfolds. but suddenly the film turns into hell ... The end is bad. Really bad. It destroys everything about the film. When you watch a movie, you will understand what I am saying ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
