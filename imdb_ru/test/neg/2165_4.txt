With Mathias Hughes on the cover and only $ 3.00 I had to buy it. I enjoyed some moments, such as the irritation of the Hawks with pleasure droids, but I did watch to see the scenes of Mathias Hughes. I especially enjoyed the autopsy at the end. It was a cross between “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” by Clint Eastwood and “A few dollars more” (a quick draw for 3 people, with musical pocket watches used as a countdown timer). In addition, I can not add anything else. The actors gave good performances (everything except “Assassin Droid”, whose performance was not anything but comic), but the film really lacked depth and purpose; it's just not enough to fill in an hour and a half of the standard movie time, so we are stuck with the main characters, wandering aimlessly from a spot on the spot for an hour or so until the ball starts rolling. For example, the main character returns to the same strip club about 4 times, taking up two-fifths of the film. <br /> <br /> The scenery really lacked depth and creativity, possibly due to the budget of the films. I don’t think we’ve ever seen this “perfect city” New Angeles, which was always talked about, in fact, when the main characters finally reached New Angeles, his set in a factory or warehouse filled with pipes and aisles; there is hardly a “kingdom” in which the owner / creator of a whole city could live. New York has also always been talking about “ultra-high security”, but there were a total of 15, maybe 20 security guards, even when the alarm went off; not even close to Mathias' approach to "at least a hundred people." <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of any of the actors / actresses in this film, then you can watch it, just “add it to the list”. However, if you value an hour and a half of your time or $ 3.00 of your money, you can skip this one.
