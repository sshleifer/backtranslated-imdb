After sitting in a train accident, which was the first film "Dark Harvest", I could not leave enough bad alone. Seeing a sequel (or rather, what I considered a sequel), I had to increase the level of pain. Seeing that it had nothing to do with Dark Harvest, it should have been good. We had no frightening killers in this, instead we got a donkey walking through a cornfield screaming little things like "Girls!" And "Do you hear me?" very often Plus we have two (four, if you include two girls who the director wanted the same effect as the twins in “Shining”) disgusting little girls who could not act. And the cherry on top of this mess should be the Corn Cop. I should have known that this movie would be terrible when the dog received the starting credit. How I managed not to fall asleep in this film, I will never know.
