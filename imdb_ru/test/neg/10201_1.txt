This film has changed my life! Hogan’s performance was incredible, and I still haven't recovered from his exclusion from Oscar nominations in 1990. And as brightly as Hulkster shines in this film, you cannot discount the brilliant writing and direction that takes this masterpiece to the highest levels of achievement to the cinema. If you have not seen this movie, leave your actions right now and get yourself a copy. I guarantee it will amaze you. And if you don’t like it, then I have only one question for you ... Watcha is going to do when 24-inch pythons and Hulkamania are crazy for you !!!!
