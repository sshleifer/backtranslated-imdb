I recently looked at a copy of this (under the heading "Ate Alive"). Any film Ed Wood has ever released looks like Oscar material compared to this ridiculous cast. To be fair, a couple of lines from the script will live in memory for a long time, for example: “These people (cannibals) do not buy frozen meat in a supermarket like us, they get it fresh every day from people like you or me.” Classic! The crazy leader like "Jonesville" in the jungle was the best character in the film, he really looked like crazy. I think that he was the only actor who was not voiced (badly), if these Italians should have American characters in their films, why don't they force Americans to duplicate in dialogue instead of the British, who are trying their best to be like Annie Oakley. I'll give it 3 out of 10, I'll give it three, because it's really funnier than most comedies these days.
