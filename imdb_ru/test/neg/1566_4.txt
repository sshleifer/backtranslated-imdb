GEORGE AND MILDRED was a by-product of the mid-1970s comedy "MAN OF HOME". Although I have not seen the show since it was last time, I remember that it was quite funny with most comedies originating from the same-named couple who are going to live alongside the snobbish Fourmile family, a kind of LOVE THY NEIGHBOR jokes <br /> <br /> After seeing this “widescreen version of the show,” I ask myself, what is this widescreen version? Of course, not from the popular mid-70s sit a lump of the same name. For some reason, the film throws off all the character interactions from television when George and Mildred leave the street where they live and get involved in a plot involving some serious gangsters who want something that George accidentally pushed, and that leads to some shock. such situations and lines as: <br /> <br /> “He gave it to you” <br /> <br /> “No, this is the first time a man resists my spell” <br /> <br /> “I meant the envelope” <br /> <br /> You get the impression that screenwriter Dick Sharples (who never wrote the episode for the original sit-com) never saw the episode of the original material and got the show confused with the CARRY movie series ON. In many respects, it reminds the same mistakes of the last film “Lost in Space” in that it has absolutely nothing to do with the series that spawned it.
