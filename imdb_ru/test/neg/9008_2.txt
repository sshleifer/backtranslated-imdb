I had a funny chance to see it at Mystery Science Theater 3000 four years ago. I have to admit that it wasnâ€™t as badly done as some of the other science fiction / horror movies of the time. The plot revolved around an astronaut who returned to earth with an alien embryo inside it. Now the plot is rather strange, well, if you can even call it plot. (Seeing the space program from one building ends, and the old pickup is awesomely funny!) I admit it was terrible by today's standards (and 20 years ago) ... but I can see myself 43 years ago, watching and being enchanted this movie. It is not even close to the evil of the Neptune Invasion, Manos: Hands of Fate or Future War. <br /> <br />
