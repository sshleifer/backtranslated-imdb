Like the beauty of the jungle, the gorgeous smile and sultry Jessica Alba hang over the film, but alas, these are the only two things worth watching this movie. When in theory we have to follow the narration. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin on the ground, and it’s hard to believe. Despite the fact that Jessica Alba is beautiful, she does not add a spark, which she added to the credible TV series “Dark Angel”. Since the days of “Dark Angel”, it seems that Alba has turned into just a candy for the eyes (but what a candy for the eyes!), And this is the only reason why she is shot in films. <br /> <br /> The concept of a sleeping dictionary is stupid and implausible, with a little character development (or, for that matter, character) to make us want to spend 109 minutes in this world. Despite the fact that films are short-lived, they still manage to feel too long and exhausting. <br /> <br /> It seems a shame that such talents as Brenda Bletin, Emily Mortimer, Bob Hoskins, are wasted on a worn story that barely boosts the pulse. This film seriously misses a trick, an exotic setting, a more than capable cast, with excellent cinema and a chance to use themes and dualistic concepts of "civilization." But there is little narration, no drama, no sense that we are watching a love story, more a story about lust and a woman who pleases men without question. Let's be honest, if Jessica Alba would freely let you sleep with her, do you seriously think you can concentrate on learning tribal language? This is a big problem, both in suspending disbelief, and in what female characters are limited and reduced. Take, for example, the fact that Jessica Alba’s character is subjected to mental and physical suffering from pregnancy and birth from her forbidden love, but all we see is that she looks pretty and seductive in one minute, then beautiful and seductive with a child next. br /> <br /> The sad state of affairs is to watch a film with a promise that does not justify its capabilities. I could endlessly write about the shortcomings of films, but it hurts me to do it. The film looks good, the background could be turned into a beautiful film, but unfortunately this did not happen.
