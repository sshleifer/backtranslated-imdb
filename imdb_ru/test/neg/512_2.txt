I think vampire movies are (usually) evil. Even if the movie itself is not so good, I still like it, because there are vampires in it. But it stinks. It really gives the vampire films a bad name. <br /> <br /> For a start, cheapness really shows. I don't usually worry about low-budget films — one of my favorite films of all time — El Mariachi, which costs only $ 7,000 — but I hate it. These actions are also shit, resorting to a "stylish" swinging camera, from which you have a headache. <br /> <br /> You will not say anything more than to not look at it. I bought it for £ 1.50, since it was a former rental, and I feel deceived by my money, even for such a low price.
