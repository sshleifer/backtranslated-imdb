I'm a little scared by some of these reviews praising A.K.A. They not only sound as if they were written by the same person, but also contain all sorts of insider information that you probably can find only by reading a book for the press from cover to cover. Please do not tell me that the director is writing his own reviews, as it would be too sad to think about. <br /> <br /> I am afraid that I am one of those who hated the film and was surprised by its intransigence dilettantism. Great idea, shame about performance. And it was very disappointing to see how many good actors (as well as very bad ones, including the lead leader) all clearly thought that they were being shot in a series of completely different films. <br /> <br /> I would like AKA to be cocky, innovative or just interesting. Unfortunately, it was like watching an unintentionally hysterical home video with hot aspirations. Missed opportunity.
