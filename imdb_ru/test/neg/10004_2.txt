While watching Mosquito, a funny thing happened to me: on the one hand, the hero is deaf and dumb, and the director is completely unable to make us understand why he does what he does (cripples dummies ... eh, excuse me) dead bodies his images. On the other hand, the English version is at least very poorly duplicated. So I found that I wanted more and less dialogue at the same time! This film is stupid (it's funny how this guy has access to all the cemeteries and morgues in his city) and is terrible (where would we have been an exploiter in the 70s without our free lesbian scene?). Not to mention the "romantic" aspect (oh, how cute!) ... Miss it. (*)
