I could not hold out for ten minutes in this horrible movie. In the era of DV cameras, he seems to have been shot on VHS without the help of any color correction or microphone. <br /> <br /> As a filmmaker, I know the limitations associated with independent filmmaking, and even With all this in mind, I am amazed that films can be made so badly. <br /> <br /> The only praise I can offer is that this film has spread as I have seen significantly better films still looking for a modest domestic or international release. I guess this is what they sell, this is a box ... it has a good box, but everything goes down from there. <br /> <br /> Note: the director seems to have 11 friends, since no one on this planet would give this film "10".
