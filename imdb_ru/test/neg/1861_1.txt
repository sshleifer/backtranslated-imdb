They do ... Every sequel is the worst. You, who think that Ghoulies 2 or 3 need 1, please look at this sequel ... You will be surprised by the first three parts. Then you give 10 to the first, 8 to the second and 5 or 6 to the other. This is because Ghoulies 4 really gets a big 1 (it does it from me).
