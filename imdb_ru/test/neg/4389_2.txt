Stupid teenage comedy that causes serious misunderstanding, including (but not limited to) confusion, which is confused with an exchange student, beating up a girlfriend, a girl who loves a gay, and an ordinary guy who loves her, and bitches. None of the following is funny or even funny. Nation Lampoon uses fun in the past. Now the name is sadly synonymous with shit. And this is no exception. I used to think that Topeng was pretty sweet when she was at Boy Meets World, but she seemed to let herself go (and yes, I know she has a name, but she does something else, she Topengoy will remain) <br /> <br /> My rating: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kati Lohmann becomes topless; Boti Bliss relies on a double body (BOOOOO !!!)
