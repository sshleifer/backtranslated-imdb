So when Bob and Marion Boxletter see the guy at the hotel, Marion thinks that this is her long-lost brother, Brian, but when she comes to him, he seems like someone else with exactly the same face. Marion manages to get her fingerprints and deliver them to the police, and when the identity is confirmed that in fact it was her brother Brian, she and Bob go to New York after searching for his whereabouts. They take possession of Brian, but he still doesnâ€™t know what they are talking about, but all the couple really want to know is where Brian has their 8 - 9-year-old son Joey ... and even when they see Joey, he doesn't know them either. The plot thickens, and they once think that they, too, are someone else. Experiments conducted on humans only to make perfect killers, yet the question of why they would bother to put Bob and Marion in the same building with each other, outside of me. Personally, Gregory Harrison superbly played his 2 roles, but I have no idea what is wrong with the other actors, they seemed bored and lost. 3 out of 10, a little unknown yes, but that's all.
