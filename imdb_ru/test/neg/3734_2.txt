The first time I saw this film, he was with this cute girl who attracted me. we had fun laughing at it and making fun of it in general. Thus, I got the impression that it was terrible, but watchable for the value of damp. Then, as part of our anniversary, we watched it together again in the video. As it turned out, the film is just awful and invisible. It's amazing how cute girls can change the way the world looks.
