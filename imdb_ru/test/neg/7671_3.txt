My opinion: the stupidest of films at the airport and, perhaps, one of the worst films about the disasters of the 70s. <br /> <br /> As if to milk the franchise with all its acquisitions, the producers of this third sequel in AIRPORT throw in more actions - stupid stories, unfounded star appearances and elements of stupidity. CONCORDE: AIRPORT '79, in its attempt to become the largest airport, is currently the worst and possibly one of the worst films about the disasters of the 1970s. Not surprisingly, this genre has delayed its success. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a rather catchy performance by Lalo Schifrin, supported by impressive footage of the title plane. in former glory (the same plane as in this film would have been involved in an accident in July 2000). But then there are captions, and we get an idea of ​​the "star" actors, which included no more than faded Hollywood stars, television actors and not very popular bi-actors. The plot is more stupid than ever: George Kennedy returned in the role of Joe Patroni, now a Concorde pilot (whose pilot is the second pilot of Alain Delon) on his way to France after the Summer Olympics. On board is the journalist Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely), who just discovered that his boyfriend, a well-known manufacturer of weapons Kevin Harrison (Robert Wagner), sells his weapons to terrorists. To prevent her from revealing news to the world, Harrison sends her most advanced missiles and the best saboteurs to prevent Concord from landing. <br /> <br /> Actors / plots are dumber than ever, even dumber than the alcoholic Myrna. Loy or singing nun. We have Cecily Tyson carrying a living human heart in a cooler (!), Martha Ray as a woman with bladder disease (and the character does not go further), J.J. Walker, a smoking saxophonist (perhaps the most annoying character in the film), Eddie Albert married the “old” wife Sybil Dunning, Avery Schreiber as a Russian coach with a deaf daughter and, finally, a love story between journalist John Davidson and gymnast Andrea Marcovici observant glance coach Mercedes McCambidge). Plus, the film is much closer to the episode "LOVE BOAT" than ever with the most stupid cameos Charo (and her favorite chihuahua) and Bibi Anderson. Fans of the camp, no doubt, will get a real kick on the ball in this stupid introduction to the long series of films about the disasters of the 70s. This is, by and large, a real disaster. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 of 5.
