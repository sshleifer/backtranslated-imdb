I thought it was difficult, if not impossible, to look, and not because of the horrors that he depicts, but by the way they were depicted. Imagine what Costa Gavras could do with this true horror story. What I object to is the idea of ​​the necessity of a judgment to which I subscribe, enough. How about showing it to us with powerful cinema? I feel that the director’s zeal, perhaps even justified anger, did not allow him to see it clearly from a cinematic point of view. Or, if it was a cinematic point of view, I mean the choice, then I didn’t like it at all. I was more worried about how the film was made than the film itself. I am sure, with good intentions, but, unfortunately, this is not enough.
