Being too young to experience the Hammer films when they were new and new, I discover their sacred horror films when I find them on DVD. I know that almost a decade and a half has passed between them, but it is difficult to see much of the magic in the original Hammer Dracula in this later recording in the series of Christopher Lee. In the original story about the vampires of Hammer, there was a lot of atmosphere and a terrific story in which to take part. Lee was a great Dracula, a bright vampire, if possible, at the very beginning, but here he is just a cardboard character who mostly stands around threateningly Fashionable young people speak like cartoon characters and she says that people really talked to these terrible cliches). I did not care who lived or died among young people. They were all pretty awful characters. I really enjoyed seeing the young and charismatic Caroline Munro; but it leaves the story too early. Lee and his historic arch enemy, Peter Cushing, add authentic atmosphere to the film, but they cannot draw blood from this empty film. This is D.O.A.
