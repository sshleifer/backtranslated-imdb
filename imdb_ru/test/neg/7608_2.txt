I watched a movie called Dark Claw, dated 1974. The captions of this film are exactly the same as those of the Dark Star, so I guess it was an alternative title. Dark Claw was far from being as ridiculous as everyone else. The acting was lame, editing and stupid. In the beginning there is an annoying 1970s song called Benson, Arizona, which has absolutely nothing to do with the film. Basically, the plot revolves around a small team of an interstellar bomber that bypasses unstable bombardment sites. Bombs are sensitive and respond to people. Mandatory natural disaster disrupts communication between the bombs and the crew. One of the crew members goes out and leads an absurdly idiotic existential conversation with a bomb, which makes no sense. The film I saw was made in less than an hour and a half, with the addition of advertising, so I suspect Dark Talon is an overrated version of Dark Star. <br /> <br /> Alien - an inflatable red ball for a beach ball drawn by a pair of monster hands, on which he walks. It was stupid and unconvincing as an alien. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that John Carpenter had a hand in this. His other films were much better.
