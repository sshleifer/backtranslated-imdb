This four-hour production of the mini-series is about two hours longer than necessary, primarily because the filmmakers did not seem to have a clear idea of ​​how to adapt the novel to the screen. It seemed that they did not know what should be stored and what could be safely left. The film begins with the fact that Sir Walter reads the Book of Pirage, which is his main consolation in his troubles. This introduces the family - everyone we still know for the next four hours - but serves a very different purpose. Similarly, the scenes where Musgrove bemoaned the “poor Richard” do not serve any purpose other than to delay the story. Some of the actual Austin dialogue are assigned to different characters, and part of its narration is processed as a dialogue, awkwardly falling out of the characters' languages. There is also some dialogue, and it is awful awful. The scene where Charles Hayter misses Henrietta because of his concern about getting medicine from Dr. Shirley was hardly interesting as a story in the book; like a scene in this performance, it nullifies the scene on Cobb, when Louise falls down and is "taken lifeless!", absolutely urgent, and I wonder if Wentworth has the line "Can anyone help me?" may have been directed to writers, as well as to other actors. <br /> <br /> This production often looks and is perceived as a piece that was shot, and not like a real film, and this is most obvious in an action that is opposite to subtle: stormy supply of lines, exaggerated gestures and actors who do not have no idea what to do with your hands, feet, or faces when they do not speak their lines. Charles Musgrove is standing in his room with his legs spread shoulder-width apart, and seems to be speaking out onto the balcony (if he was) when he talks to other people in the room with him. Louise Musgrove's face, when she is not active and does not giggle, seems to be confused. Louise is a frivolous, frivolous, dizzy creature, and I never believed for a second that Wentworth would be interested in her. <br /> <br /> The costumes are mixed, but mostly horrible, and Anna Elliott’s green tartan dress is perhaps the most disgusting costume ever created. We are given dates at the beginning of the show - this is the end of the 1790s or perhaps the very beginning of the 1800s - and yet many of the costumes seem to be Victorian in style, and therefore 60 years earlier! The hair is so wrong that I won't even mention it here. Except that I won't mention it. :-) <br /> <br /> However, this production does some things right. Mrs. Smith is given her due importance, and her story with Mr. Elliott, his scattering and his intrigues are fully revealed. I was also pleased to see at the end the unfolded scenes of “reconciliation” with Ann and Frederick, which are a precious reward for the reader, but are embellished in 1995. <br /> <br /> If you like the book Persuasion, and even vaguely, as in the 1995 film, do not waste a single minute (or a penny) on this production; You will find it very willing.
