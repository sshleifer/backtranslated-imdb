Despite a completely horrendous script (more on this later), this film still only vaguely looks because it was shot by two great actors, Barbara Stenwick and Henry Fonda. Aside from one or two REAL stinkers, I would probably watch almost everyone in the film with them, since I'm a big fan of the golden age of Hollywood in the 1930s and 40s. However, no matter how much I love their films, I simply cannot recommend this film. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the Foundations and Stanvik, having a rest at some ski resort. They have not yet met, but the film starts out loud and unpleasant from the stage in which Fonda terribly screams while skiing. This was done so awkwardly and made my teeth grit, but I stuck out — especially when Fonda fell into a snowdrift, and it stopped jodling !! Looking back, maybe I should just turn it off then! The Foundation is knocked out in the fall, and Barbara goes to the rescue. Back at the ski lodge, he seems fine, but fortunately, she is ALSO a doctor, he is X-rayed and cared for. He, in turn, falls in love with her and makes her an offer. Despite the fact that they barely know each other, they are getting married, and while the film looks like a sweet but very light romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> However, when she is at home, things are not as bright as she returns to her work, the family doctor, and he begins to show signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous person because of his jealousy. The film plays all this for the sake of laughter, but, frankly, the Foundation’s behavior was really creepy — spying on her and her male patients, attacking or threatening ANY person she treats, confusing a patient who already has a back injury, and stomp in an unexpected party and insist that everyone there (men and women) want to steal his wife. He looks like a combination of a sociopath and a paranoid schizophrenic, but all this must be for a laugh. Considering that it seems to be a dangerous nutlet, one might think that Stanvik will submit a request for cancellation along with a restraining order! But, oddly enough, she is angry, but simply can not be angry at the Foundation, because he is so ........? I can't come up with the right word - “creepy” - that's all that comes to mind !!! Later, unexpectedly, the Foundation's multi-millionaire gets a job at the counter in a department store. Then, thanks to magical thinking, he and Babs seem to believe that his hostility and violent jealousy are a thing of the past - so the work obviously cures anger and suspicion. When this job fails, the film ends with Fonda buying her own hospital, giving Barbara a job there, and they live happily ever after. They do not go further with the story, but I guess, based on the nature of the Foundations, that he spent most of his time as a hospital administrator, beating up all the male patients. <br /> <br /> The first part of the Lodge Lodge and the next did not fit each other, as the last section on Horatio Alger, where the rich boy excelled in the business world. They looked like three separate plots, but despite this, the film’s most serious problem was its justification for domestic violence and delusional jealousy! What a creepy little movie! Thank God, neither Fonda nor Stanwick is known for this film, but all their other beautiful films.
