Gamera vs Viras was made lazily, and as a result, much of it suffers. <br /> <br /> Space aliens are trying to take over Earth and stop Gamera. Therefore, they send another ship that manages to kidnap two young guys. Then the aliens take possession of Gamera and force him to attack humanity. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must say that I really enjoyed the battle with the monsters at the end between Gamera and Viras. Viras looks like a big squid with a beak. He does not have an energetic velvet and he does not emit any rays, but he can close the superstructures on the top of his head to make a sharp pointed wapon. So overall, this is not a bad monster for Gamera to fight and is worthy. Virass really hurts Gamera, striking him with a sharp head with a blow to the lower part of the body, and I am surprised that Gamer managed to survive this. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Gamera and Viras decided to use shots from previous films from Gamera to fill the time for this film. They show the battles between Gamera and Barugon, Gamera and Gaos, when aliens look at Gameras in past battles. However, when they show the Battle of Gamera with Gaos, they first show the battle between Gamera and Gaos in the city, and then show the final battle between them. After they show the used footage of the final battle between Gamera and Kaos, they show the FIRST battle between Gamera and Gaos !!! Talk about showing battles in a non-chronological order. They didnâ€™t even have to show the first battle, which they had to simply stop after they showed the final battle between them. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that they decided to re-show footage of the attack on the city when the aliens ordered him to attack Tokyo. Thus, they show the scene from "Gamera vs Barugon", where it destroys the dam. After showing the scenes from "Gamera The Invincible", which is a huge problem for me. Mainly due to the fact that "Gamera The Invincible" was in BLACK AND WHITE !!!! Using stock frames from black and white film in the COLOR film is really lazy, and this is not good. <br /> <br /> In addition, duplication is bad again. Two young children are not so annoying, but it would be nice to see a Gamera film in which small children did not participate. <br /> <br /> Therefore, excessive use of videos from other Gamera films is a deterrent to this film. The final fight is awesome, so I recommend going to the last ten minutes and watching this movie. The rest is what has already been seen before.
