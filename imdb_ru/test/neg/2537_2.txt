Horrible Indonesian fighter from the legendary Arizal with a triumph sculpts a template for the future of Cinemax pap, like “China O'Brien” and “Do or Die” with Eric Estrada, simultaneously burying the poor rising star of militants Pat O'Brien with a squeaky backyard and three gel cans hair styling to make it an impressive 1984 mullet. This guy’s physical mastery is reminiscent of more fatal Mark Gregory, and his next achievement will be the second violin for Chris Mitchum in the role of “Tom Selick”. Powerful. At the very least, the action is pointless and non-stop, when some bold Asian stuntmen risk their lives for what is essentially a poorly designed film for teenagers and / or drug addicts without the concept of reality. One poor man is subjected to sharp grinding with an electric scissors, and many others die from getting into the head of strange objects, such as a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box. Classic scenes of rape are a tasteless and priceless dialogue, such as “I would prefer to trust a rattlesnake!” Delivered with such abundance and fervor from third-class polystyle voice actors. Random highlight: some crazy dude eating live lizards. The film is also a record for the number of cars passing through the walls. 2/10
