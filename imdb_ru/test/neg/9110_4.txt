Higher than normal video fighter, Airborne has enough in the tank to continue working for a full 90 minutes, although you can't help but think about how low 80s comedian boy of the 80s stepped low in such a cheap production (and at the same time cruel man!). The plot is simple, the villains kidnapped the deadly virus, and Guttenburg and the rest of his buddies go in search, not bad in its own way, but not in the same league (obviously) as the films that compare and cover, for example, AIR FORCE ONE and CON AIR. Nevertheless, the cast is good, because Sean Bean repeats his character as a British bad guy, whom we saw in such box office sessions as GOLDENEYE and PATRIOT GAMES.
