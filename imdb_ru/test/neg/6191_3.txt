Pepe Le Moko, played by Charles Boyer, is a kind of international criminal inspiration, wanted in countries across Europe, and to remain free, he locks himself in the Casbah, the mysterious part of Algeria, where even the police do not want to go while the senior officer leaves from Paris to capture Le Moko once and for all. For Le Moko, although Kasbah allows him to remain in police custody, he also becomes a kind of prison at the same time — a place that he cannot leave, because once he does this, he knows that he will be arrested. <br /> <br /> Boyer's game was good, and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar. He reflects the essence of such a character - the perfect combination of a very dangerous and at the same time very stylish at the same time. The film itself, unfortunately, was a real disappointment. Some parts of the story seemed contradictory, of which I will mention two. First there was the idea that the police would not enter the Kasbah. This was quite clearly stated at the beginning of the film by the local commander, and, nevertheless, the repeated references in the film suggest that, in fact, the police did come to Kasbah regularly. Thus, neither Commissioner Janvier’s proposal that the police come in, nor the statement by Inspector Slimane (also worthy of a statement by Joseph Callea) that they could get to the Kasbah, but did not leave it, did not seem to make much sense. It was also hard for me to believe that Gebi (Hedy Lamarr) could beat Le Moko so easily - the hardened criminal mastermind as he was - to the extent that he entertains the local population, sings love songs, and then leaves Kasbah to find her, essentially surrendering. Of course, I understand the irony of the last few scenes, when Pepe leaves the prison (Kasbah )’s freedom only to gain real freedom in his capture (because he was shot by the police). I just found it impossible. Consider that a person like Le Moko would fall into such a trap. <br /> <br /> It’s worth looking at Boyer and, to a lesser extent, Calle, but the story is disappointing and contradictory. 3/10
