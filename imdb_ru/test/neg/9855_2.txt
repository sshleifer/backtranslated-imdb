Watching the Enterprise for the first time, as we all no doubt do with all the shows, I entered it with an open mind, enjoying about half the past effort in Star Trek and dislike of the other. <br /> <br /> Enterprise failed, but this episode of "Night in Sickbay" made me seriously wonder why I was worried about the broadcast of the show on Monday night on Sci Fi. <br /> <br /> By disguising some idea that this is one of those In the Day In The Life episodes in which we learn what causes some characters to act as humanoids, the authors seem to have forgotten that it should have been a starship and not Ricardo and Mertz. <br /> <br /> On the planet, especially the one whose people were previously offended by the Enterprise team (for eating in public), there was no room for a dog. As an animal lover, I would never have taken one of my pets on Wednesday, which was tense in the past. <br /> <br /> But what made this episode even more ridiculous is the endless problem with all of these ST shows, constantly depicting things that are sacred and offensive to other cultures, because they offer some insight into American religious fanatics. <br /> <br /> Aliens were now being offended when a dog urinated on a sacred tree. However, aliens were quite capable of seeing the urination of a dog as an insult. <br /> <br /> It is strange that the urination of a dog was not considered any form of worship. I wonder how the authors of the series did it? <br /> <br /> From there we fall into the captain, who was deceived by his duties. Watching the episode, I found it very easy to forget that Bakula was to be the captain of the ship. <br /> <br /> He decided to sleep in the infirmary, and from there we are given more insanity of behavior (sigh), we do not need to understand, and this makes us pucker our eyebrows. <br /> <br /> The doctor carelessly cuts off long hairy toenails and feeds them to hungry animals in cages. Ewwwwww! Then the white bat runs away. <br /> <br /> Oh, how can you sleep when all this happens! Cutting nails for crying out loud! I waited for something that feeds on vomiting. <br /> <br /> Then we were inexplicably given to understand that the captain was in love with T'Pol, and perhaps he disguised these feelings with his concern. over the dog. <br /> <br /> Countless trash. <br /> <br /> "Your dog is sick, so go have sex. You will feel better." And, of course, the captain had to apologize, and we, the people, should have considered his apologies absolutely ridiculous, because we are (all smiling sarcastically) limited people! Saw images like this, endlessly buzzing on the PNP. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, the only thing missing in this terrible episode was that the Trip man, offering his smirks and pathetic boyism, seemed to Bakula to cover it all with a stupid dog. <br /> <br /> Oh, the dog has survived, so now go and play for it.
