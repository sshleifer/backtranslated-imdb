This film lacked confidence for two reasons. Firstly, there is no mayor of a large city, and New York is certainly as important as he. Would allow a neighborhood in his city to degenerate into such a cruel place to live; especially for voters who can say a lot about their future work. All the victims in the film were mostly elderly, Jewish, or defenseless. At 62, I had never seen a single film that described such complete disrespect for authority as in this film. Even "Escape from New York", which was fictional, that is, they told you that it was science fiction, did not resort to such deep violence. In this film, most elderly victims were victims, but at the same time they had a weapon, but did not want to use it. In addition, in this film I have not seen the previous two, more lawless than in the movie "Escape." Secondly, gangs, as far as my research shows, have never been as cooperative as this film does. On the one hand, they catch a gang member of another gang operating in their area, and he is killed. However, when heroes start shooting at local group bangers, the next gang is met with open arms. Members of the outer gang are always treated as outsiders and stopped. We must believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, other gangs want to be all in it. Why did external gangs come to the rescue? I believe that more than one gang from the outside came to the rescue. Why did they come? Another question is why the gang leader in prison and why other prisoners ask his permission to attack the character of Bronson? It was not a very good movie, and I could go on, but I will not.
