How insulting! Those who liked this movie probably never opened the Bible. I can imagine how those in NBC say, “Ok. Let's make a film to appease those pesky Christians, but they will never know the difference unless we have anything actual or in the correct chronological order. ” Well, they were wrong. Anyone who is associated with this atrocity should find a church and repent of their involvement in this blasphemous atrocity. I gave this film only 1, because I could not give it 0.
