Every time 4kids brings new shows to their company. Over the past few years, they have brought pure gold, like Kirby: Come back to Me! or Mew Mew Power. But recently, 4kids has been turned off. CatDog is one example. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s hard to write a negative comment without spoiling the show, but in fact Weekenders are pure trash. It revolves around a group that is overly active brain. However, the trick is all that he comes up with, badly. On paper, this may sound good, but after watching it, you will understand how far from this show. <br /> <br /> Pizza is an extremely stupid character. It is very one-dimensional, it is not so much. He is hyperactive, the end of the story. Despite the fact that many believe that all the characters have been torn from South Park, I think the opposite. Cromartie High School Mechazawa is an interesting character and he can make me laugh. Tino can't handle either of the two. <br /> <br /> The cast for the show is no better. Like Tino's mom, they suffer from a lack of character. They adhere to only one characteristic, and that is all. The only redeeming quality is the fact that the show can make you smirk. Maybe the scene is really funny, or you can just grin, because it's stupid. <br /> <br /> Thje Weekenders is a very trashy Disney / 4kids show. Although it seems that he loves some fans, it really should be left to the children.
