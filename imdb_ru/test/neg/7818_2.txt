For many years I did not dare to watch this film. Now I know why. It was even worse than I expected. Ashton Kutcher makes the worst movie mistake in his entire career, since "Dude, where's my car?" Tara Reid acts as a dream girl Ashton, who asks him to look after his beloved owl father (and his boss) for the weekend. Rules: 1. No shoes in the house. 2. There are no people in the house. 3. The boss's son is outside the house. 4. Do not touch the furniture. <br /> <br /> By the end of the first twenty minutes you can guess how the rest of the movie will turn out. <br /> You know, there are films like “Meet the Parents,” where something bad happens to someone, but it's interesting to watch and deliver in such a way that you can't wait to see what happens next. This is not one of those movies. You know from the start that bad things will happen, and these are mostly stupid things that would never have happened. This is a very frustrating film, and I almost turned it off almost three times because it was very bad. But I paid the rent and decided that I should have seen it now. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid was good, and I would like to see her in several films. However, I am not surprised if it affected her career. <br /> <br /> The end result is a happy ending ... but, of course, you don’t expect anything with such a film unless you count it. <br /> <br /> Don't look. You will sincerely regret it!
