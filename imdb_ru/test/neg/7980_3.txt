Produced by International Playhouse Pictures, it looks like it was shot in a dollhouse. All liars, everything is like in a dream, like in a toy, without a good reason. I'm not saying that all films should be absolutely realistic, but there are too many such incredible fantasies and situations in one film. How did they attract these beautiful actors, especially actresses, to this film? Nice to see Mia again; if we had to understand why her husband wants to kill her, Mia does it well. Not funny, not moving, just fake. Stephen Dorff appears briefly at the end, perhaps suitable for a play, not for a film, but this is not something to be measured. Terrible.
