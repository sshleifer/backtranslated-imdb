I think Herzog's documentary work is very uneven. Fate Morgana, a kind of companion "Lessons of darkness", lacks not only the heartbreaking spectacle, but mostly the authorâ€™s keen eye. Compared to the curious, aimless panning left and right across the desert, a view that can be expected from any German tourist equipped with a video camera, the camera running out of a car window shoots all sorts of meaningless images, wire fences, abandoned buildings and dirt spots passing through the lens random order, intersect with shots of sand dunes. At some point, Herzog collides with a group of hungry cattle rotting in the sand, but the image is presented just like you and I, maybe even worse, a camera looking from one cattle to another. For a documentary film that tries to be a visual celebration, a hypnotic, surreal excursion into uncharted landscapes, he lacks visual harmony and conviction of a disciplined author. These are ubiquitous, indecisive and tiresome myths about the creation of the Maya, voiced in the voice acting, then some other text that the Duke submitted to literature. Only at the end of Fata Morgana jumps alive through a series of strange encounters. First, with a man and a woman playing music in a room, a man sings in a distorted voice through a microphone, both of them are indifferent to their task. A man holds a turtle. A group of old people trying to get out of some holes in the ground. Apart from this, it seems to have very little substance to offer or visual splendor to offer.
