... Switch MORANT and ROMPER STOMPER. He also gave us watchable movies such as BOOTMEN and THE ODD ANGRY SHOT. Unfortunately, for everyone who is involved in this rout, THE WOG BOY will not join the appearance on any list. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to seeing this film simply because of a politically incorrect title, so politically incorrect that when the BBC 2 was broadcast late at night, the announcer did not even mention the name of the film, so I was expecting something so offensive, anachronistic, that my jaw dropped in perplexity. It fell in disbelief, I could not believe that the financiers thought it would be a major international hit. <br /> <br /> The problem lies in the cast and script. I know that in Australia with its small population there are not many actors, so I will mostly forgive, but this does not stop my criticism of Nick Jannopoulos as Steve. For this type of comedy to work, you must be impressed with the comic skills of the main actor, and I'm sorry to say, but Nick J simply doesn’t have the skills. I have never heard of him or seen anything else where he was, so maybe he is much better at other shows. Here, however, he is simply annoying, unconvincing, and I have lost count of how many times he robbed a camera. The jokes themselves are very flat and predictable, and, returning to the script, it seems underdeveloped, I mean, who thought it funny to start with a gag about a woman working in the back seat of a limousine? You have a feeling that the production was supposed to be more honest and said: “Listen, buddy, this script is not good enough. Go and make it more subtle and structured. ”<br /> <br /> I was harsh and the sharpness was invoked in this review. I gave the film four out of ten, and he would get only three if it were not for one really funny sequence, where Steve watches the current events show only for himself flashing on the screen and labeled as “Bloder Bloder”. This shows that the writers knew about comic time and social commentary. Too bad they didn't come with a much better written movie
