Unlike most reviewers of this particular film, I am at least not a big fan of Cynthia Rothrock. However, when I saw Fred Williamson and Robert Forster in the film (both great actors), I just had to watch the movie. Williamson - Dakota Smith, an alcoholic policeman who was lowered to cleaning the toilets with a toothbrush and, even worse, teamed up with Cynthia at the behest of the captain (Robert Forster) Forster is always watchable, just ashamed that the film itself is pretty damn trivial and clich√©. It also reveals one of the least horrific villains to ever make celluloid. Williamson will return to the character "Dakota" in several films, the next will be "Down N Dirty". <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nina Richardson shows several T & A; Mary Kupper topless <br /> <br /> My rating: D <br /> <br /> Where I saw her: Showtime Extreme
