Ha ha! First, if you have never seen “Dimension Film”, then you will find real pleasure! Beowulf, best known for its horror films and the SUPER LOW BUDGET horror films, was no exception. <br /> <br /> However, this video was ultra-cheesy. I missed the K-R-A-F-T label on the side. <br /> <br /> Think about anachronisms! (something inappropriate and inappropriate) <br /> <br /> We had: candles, armor, swords .... <br /> <br /> And yet we saw: telescopes, shoes with soles, lighters for cigarettes, loudspeakers, Electricity, Body bags, aluminum foil cans and spoons / forks. <br /> <br /> Not bad for what happens in the 8th century! <br /> <br /> This is not a horror movie, but a horrible movie. This is very funny. This is really a horror movie comedy! I could not stop laughing! <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert (“Highland Series”) - probably in his career really fell, if he works in “Dimension Films”. <br /> <br /> I learned the lesson though. I will look at the movie studios, a lot more now. <br /> <br /> NOMINAL WILL NOT BE FIVE. However, if you want to laugh, it’s hard to refuse this job! <br /> <br /> This movement had some cracks - I especially liked the blonde! <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
