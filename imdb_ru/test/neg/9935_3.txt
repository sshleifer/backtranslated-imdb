The series does not start the way it should go on. Despite the fact that the first two seasons are filled with incredibly average episodes, as well as numerous failures, after that the pace is gaining momentum and one of the best space operas is born. The first ever Star Trek: The Next Generation episode is remarkable for two things: this is an extremely pleasant acquaintance with all the main actors and a special accent by Marina Syrtis, which will disappear later. Seeing how it all began is very nice, and in terms of the rest of the series, itâ€™s actually quite touching. Otherwise, this is a very mediocre episode involving Q and the giant jellyfish. Like this.
