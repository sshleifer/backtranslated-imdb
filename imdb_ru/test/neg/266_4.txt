I enjoyed Oceans 11, I thought it was rather nice, helped by actions and direction. However, I was disappointed with this film. Don't get me wrong, this is not a complete failure, thanks to the star performances of Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and Matt Damon and particularly effective leadership of Stephen Soderbergh. Nevertheless, the film really suffers from a truly sluggish rhythm, part of the film was so slow that I almost fell asleep between one turn of the key. Secondly, the plot is very tangled, and there are many twists and turns in it, because of which it is difficult to keep up. Working with the camera was not as innovative as in the first film. While in the first film it was smooth and professional, it was sluggish and embarrassing, and the music was not particularly memorable. The script was also not so witty or funny, and the film seemed anti-climatic. At the end of the day, it all felt a little lazy, despite the expert game and leadership. Such a big potential, but really missed opportunity. 4/10 Bethany Cox
