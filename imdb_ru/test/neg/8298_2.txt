This film clearly has an agenda that can be stated as follows: never, never cross the border (physical or metaphorical). Let's avoid everything on the other side, a wall, a fence or something else, let's pretend that all “gringos” are evil, satanic or drug dealers. Everything that is outside the borders of their country (and especially the borders of the United States) is dangerous, malicious, and people there will hate you, or envy you, or try to steal you or something else. “Based on real events” is just a perverse tag that can be attached to anything to give it a certain aura of credibility or, in this case, simply to help move the ideology of the film back to some naive gulps. The perversity of the film lies in the fact that it reduces countries, people and everything else into very black and white stereotypical categories: Mexicans are disgusting people, Mexican police are a bunch of corrupt police officers, Republicans are right-wing morons, Democrats are almost hippie humanists, etc. What good in the movie? I don't think so, but maybe you think differently.
