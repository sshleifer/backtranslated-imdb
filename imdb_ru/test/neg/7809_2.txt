Dreamy young Ashton Kutcher (as Tom Stansfield) wants to meet sexy blonde Tara Reid (as Lisa Taylor). Miss Reid thinks Mr Kutcher is gay. Kutcher works for Reid's father, the anal preserving Terence Stamp (as Jack Taylor). Kutcher agrees to "shelter" the boss, believing that this will bring him closer to Reid. Mr. Stamp has a domestic owl named "OJ", which becomes a rogue rogue. <br /> <br /> This is a movie in which your children with a limited “G” rating get ready for a more attractive “R” rate. This will help if they have not seen the conspiracy before, and especially as a retard insignificant humor. Remember that people are paid for such actions. <br /> <br /> ** My boss's daughter (2003) David Zucker ~ Ashton Kutcher, Tara Reid, Terence Stamp
