Infamous for being “Independence Day” “introduced to you by the digital effects team,” Coronado was an even more spectacular failure because it was compared with ID4. This ridiculous clutter of the film begins with a brainless background and completely leaves there. The subjects of this idiotic story are a wealthy couple from Beverly Hills. Claire's girlfriend flew off on a business trip right on Christmas Day, so she decides to fly to Switzerland spontaneously so that they can spend the holidays together. I especially like that her original reason for wanting to leave was that he left the documents at home that she thought he might need. She grabbed them and screamed after him while he was leaving, and came to the conclusion that it was best for her to fly to the other side of the planet, and not to call on his mobile phone. I refuse to believe that the couple living in a cave mansion like them did not know about the existence of mobile phones. <br /> <br /> Up to this point the film is incredibly bad, but check it out, this is where it starts badly! She gets to Switzerland, and when she can't find her husband, she gets a cake and calls a friend to whine about how unfair it is. This woman is not an action movie hero, and she is DEFINITELY not a German Indiana Jones because she cries loudly. She is an overgrown cheerleader, a spoiled female girl whose outdoor experience probably comes down to scooping her hairpins out of the ground when she gets drunk enough to wander the lawn during a bluff party with wine and cheese . <br /> <br /> She gets a hint that her bride is in South America, so she seems to be just flying there to get her. Once there, this idiot thinks that she will go into the jungle, sniff the enemy base and save her poor helpless guy. She laughs at the comment about the danger of getting there, and then goes crazy later because she finds out that there are fights. “You never said anything about a battle!” <br /> <br /> There is one point where Claire and several journalists she met drive this huge truck over a bridge hundreds of feet high and its width hundreds of feet. suspended by two for four. Literally. Thousands of thin pieces of wood are tied together with a string, and these assholes decide to drive it. Not only does he fall apart under the weight of a truck, but Claire manages to fall off him, falling hundreds of feet and landing on his back in the shallow river below. She later recalls the event, joking aside how, well, maybe it was only a hundred. At least she didn't twist the gum on her fingers. <br /> <br /> What is really sad about this terribly bad movie is that they even managed to persuade a terrible performance from the incredibly talented John Rees-Davis, THE REAL Indiana Jones is a veteran. At the end of the film there is a lot of nonsense about the uprising, where we meet with the leader of extremist rebels, who, when we first meet with him, have such a strong accent that he throws his p, as he thinks he is in an advertisement for “Ryabli,” speaks like some guy they took off Venice Beach. Incredible. <br /> <br /> Special effects are minor. The team that brought you Independence Day, due to the fact that they were related to ID4, just carried out the offers, bringing together a few matte and blue screenshots, I have to believe, because they simply had nothing better. The story is surprisingly bad, and Kristin Dattilo, whom many other IMDb users call the sole reason for watching a movie, does not invest the slightest effort in her performance. Maybe she thought that the digital effects team behind Independence Day could make some sense to this mess. <br /> <br /> And considering how far they fell, perhaps they also thought they could. <br /> <br /> They could at least try.
