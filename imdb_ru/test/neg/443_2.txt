Maybe I'm too generous when I give this film two and a half stars out of five, but there was a random moment. However, as the film "American werewolf", this chance is missed! There are no real storyline links with a superb original that you can talk about, but the story is somewhat similar to “London.” <br /> <br /> * Possible warning about a spoiler * American children travel to a foreign country, one falls in love with a beautiful girl. Another of the children is killed by a werewolf on the same night when he is bitten, and, despite the warnings of his undead friend, by the light of the full moon, he grows fur, fangs and claws! <br /> <br /> But there are some differences in history, for example; the girl is one of the werewolves. Secondly, there are three American children. And the third; there is some strange - @ $$ werewolf cult intent to take over the world! No matter how crazy it sounds, this last one is not a joke! * Spoiler Ends * <br /> <br /> The film suffers from many things, firstly, a weak acting film drags it down a lot! The performance of Tom Everret Scott is at best a pretty, and he and Julia Delpy, who is interested in love, seem to have no chemistry at all. Secondly, the Weak scenario, which seems to be everywhere. Many of the elements of obscurity and dark comedy that made the original great are missing in this. And whoever said that after eating the heart of a broken werewolf, you will become a man again? Last I heard, it was not part of the werewolf knowledge! Thirdly; terrible special effects; The effects of the werewolf are made using computer animation, which works for such things as dinosaurs, ghosts and spaceships. But it seems changeable, phony and artificial when used for furry creatures, such as werewolves. <br /> <br /> However, there were a few things that saved this from the general "turkeyd", there is one funny scene in a Parisian cafe, when Andy (Scott) drinks coffee with Serafin (Delpy), he throws a bunch of condoms on the table and trying to pass them for chewing gum, chewing and blowing bubble! Also; The soundtrack is a very cool mix of alternative rock bands like Bush and Smashmouth. Although none of the songs have the word "moon" as in the original film, the soundtrack is nevertheless great. And another funny scene when a rotting corpse played by Julia Bowen tries to whistle, and her eyeball pops out, making me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> But in general, this film seems to lack the wit and expectation of the original. And an overly contrived final does not help much either. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 Two and a half out of five stars (on average).
