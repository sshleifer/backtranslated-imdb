Hip, the eminent Dr. James Coburn (as Peter Carey) arrives to assume the position of a pathologist at Boston hospital. Almost immediately, Mr. Coburn sleeps as an excellent nutritionist Jennifer O'Neill (as Georgia Hightower). Sleeping with Mrs. O'Neill, Coburn woke up from an emergency situation related to an unsuccessful abortion â€” a fifteen-year-old child who is bleeding turns out to be the daughter of a large hospital donor, Dana O'Herlihih (like J. D. Randall), Coburn does not believe that the arrested man, Dr. James Hong (like David Tao), committed the crime; although Mr. Hong admits to having performed illegal abortions on the side. Trying to clear his friend, Coburn sneaks through a thickening conspiracy ?? <br /> <br /> **** The Carey Treatment (3/29/72) Blake Edwards ~ James Coburn, Jennifer O'Neill, Michael Blodgett, James Hong
