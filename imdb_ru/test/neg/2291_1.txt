In fact, I feel that my review should be in one word. My friend, whose opinion I almost always trust in films, especially horror films, warned me NOT to shoot it, no matter how much I missed, didn’t miss and did not despair of watching a new horror movie, because it was a waste of time. Unfortunately, I did not talk to him for a while, and I hurried to choose a film and thought: “What the hell, how bad can it be?” WHY I don’t learn? What was I just thinking about? Do I really think that he will magically turn into the best film if he sits on the shelf for years waiting to be removed? <br /> <br /> “Storyline” refers to a guy who makes films for a company. His boss is a dork. The guy who had the job before him went crazy and blew himself up in a series of pre-credits, so for some reason the boss chose the Ed know-all for a special project on editing Spray Movies “Free Limbs.” He never says that Ed has to edit, but I think it doesn’t matter. Ed is distressed by some of the clips, working on them in this house himself, which is why the boss decided to move him for no apparent reason. He asks his boss if he can stop or do another project, but his boss doesn't care. He slowly begins to go crazy, supposedly from watching videos, and wants to commit bloody murders in real life. Or was he always like this? Please note that I make this story deeper, more interesting and consistent than it really is. <br /> <br /> We don’t care about the characters at all, we don’t like them or even hate the bad guys. The plot is really, very boring and predictable. The splashes are not even so terrible or creative - they should NOT be rented just to see the blood, because what is there is neither interesting nor original. <br /> <br /> All “tribute” to Sam Raymi is just Good Luck, like really bad looting, and no one in the movie looks as good as Bruce Campbell anywhere, so you can not escape from this. I think that the poster The Evil Dead II Is Dead at Dawn is only prominently shown in one scene in the hope that Sam Raimi will be flattered and will not consider any legal action. A trained chimp could write a better script. Every time I hear lines like "We have fun ... for now?" (which even the Rescuer Bride could not take off without making me flinch), I begin to feel that I am collecting some kind of deadly weapon myself. Characters simply appear out of nowhere without giving a reason, wandering only to be killed. It might be nice if the movie was even remotely funny or interesting, but that was all I could do to keep fast-forwarding through most of it. Fortunately, I decided to pay several bills and balance my checkbook at the same time that the movie was played. Believe me, it did not require my full attention - I still felt that more than 90 minutes of my life were wasted because I kept it in the background. <br /> <br /> Do not look as tempted as you are - you will hate yourself for wasting your money. Fans of horror will be completely disgusted, how incompetent it is. Even those who have not seen too many splash films have to stay away, because there are so many films that you can shoot and that are much more expensive. If you want something brainless, low-budget and fun, rent something else. A complete waste of time without any redemptive qualities. Be smarter than I was at the time, and don't be fooled by the words “Not for the faint of heart” on the box. You have been warned! <br /> <br />
