"Dolemite" is a touching story about Dolemite (the names of the films Glota Love Blaxploitation), a former prisoner who probably still has to be in prison. He has problems with cops, friends, drug dealers, women, prostitutes, and the general public. He's just not such a nice guy. This is not a movie, although it is still fun and worth watching. <br /> <br /> A weak premise is that Dolemite (played with the same enthusiasm as the star Rudi Ray Moore) is in prison for a crime that he says he did not commit. When the drug hits, or the drug, or the drug is about to collapse, the warden will let him go to stop, help, or just watch. Not very clear. All I know is that I did not know that the justice system releases convicts in order to allow them to prove their own innocence. I guess my ignorance. <br /> <br /> The plot is convoluted and unimportant, mostly Dolemite kills people (usually with a very poorly placed karate), has sex and scolds people, sometimes even rhymes. The joys of the film are his complete incompetence and complete indifference in this matter. <br /> <br /> I stopped counting the number of times I saw a boom microphone after he was in the same scene for the entire time (about two minutes of the film). I stopped asking questions, why the warden looked down at the place where Dolemite was sitting, even after he got up and walked around, when they returned to the original shot, and Dolemit did inexplicably sat down again. I stopped wondering why Dolemayt dressed like this when he undressed in the street to change clothes, because he didn’t want to get into his car with the ugly (read: normal) clothes that the prison had given him. And I stopped being interested in where he studied karate, when he shakes the hand of a guy in the stomach and somehow cuts him. The only time when I was even nervous and strained at all is when a disgusting, flabby white mayor walks completely naked, and only a towel hangs on his neck, which barely covers him. You keep saying, "Cut ... cut ... cut", but by the time they do this, you are already emotionally traumatized. <br /> <br /> The film is ridiculous in every way imaginable. Moore, like Dolemite, or funny, cool, or both. If you’re looking for a bad movie, you’ve found it with Dolemite.
