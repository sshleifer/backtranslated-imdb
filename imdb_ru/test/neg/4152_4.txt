Thursday, June 9, 21:15. Egyptian theater. Saturday, June 11, 14:00. Theater on the outskirts of the city. <br /> <br /> For most children it is very important to be loved and belong. Those who were born from Vietnamese mothers and GI fathers often did not find either one or the other. “Beautiful Country” is the story of one such child, Binh, who was rejected by his rural settlement, and then he tries to find his American father. The film begins with a green and wild country, but descends into a dirty, sweaty mess and boredom. The significant talents of Tim Roth and Temuera Morrison are wasted in meaningless and ill-thought-out roles on board a rusty cargo ship carrying Bean and a dying brother across the ocean with what appears to be a supply of stormy seas. New York offers slave labor and clichés. Despite the fact that from the very beginning everything is very uneven, a great curiosity about this film is the last segment. Nick Nolte gets the highest score among the actors. I jokingly suggested that he would probably only be in the final scene and not far from the truth. As the journey leads Binh to Texas and his father, the film acquires a serene and austere simplicity. Weak cohabitation unites these two men in the family of father and son. More than ninety minutes of the rubbish that we have just observed are rewarded by a deep and subtle view of Nolte as they slowly interact. Credits rolled, and I was surprised to see the names of Badlands executive producer Edward Pressman and West Texas native Terrence Malick.
