Wow, what exciting visual effects. I also loved the costumes and artwork, the circus and ethereal feeling for the film was sublime. It simply required the viewer to worry about the fate of our main character. Since she is trapped in her imagination, there is never a sense of danger, unlike, say, the films of David Lynch, who pursue every time. It also draws attention to what age group this film is aimed at. Who would do this? <br /> <br /> Mirrormask will obviously make a comparison with the Labyrinth with the theme of a teenager / fantasy, but unfortunately, in fact, this is not close to creating the same Henson essence. The topic with a sick mother is never fully explained, and, of course, this is not what you care about as you caress the eye. <br /> <br /> Not painfully terrible, as in the "Cage", and not as attractive as fabulous, like a Labyrinth. Fantasy.
