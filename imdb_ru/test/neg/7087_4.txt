I definitely watched this movie, because this science fiction film of the 1950s is one of my favorite genres. Unfortunately, although I was looking forward to the aliens with a squint-eyed or insane conquerors, the aliens in this film were a major disappointment! First, you only see one very briefly at the beginning (and it looked pretty ordinary), and you also got only a tiny glimpse of the spacecraft! Secondly, the alien was neither a victorious evil, nor a benevolent friend of mankind, but a real eccentric. And finally, the plot itself seemed so stupid, preaching and tough that it caused more blunders than thrills. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, five people from five different parts of the world (Germany, Great Britain, Russia, China and the USA) were abducted by aliens. The alien gives each of them the devices with the help of which they CAN destroy all life on the planet if they wish - because the alien recognizes that his race of people would like to dwell on the Earth, but they themselves will not be killed to get it. Then he returns them all. Although it is 100% obvious that no one WANTS to use these devices, the alien then announces the names of five on TV without informing them that the weapon is SO powerful! So, all militarists in the world want to find five and get them to reveal how weapons work. Most of the rest of the film consists of the fact that some of the five are hiding, and one of them is tortured in order to make him reveal how the device works - how the Soviets want to use it !!! This part of the film seemed rather stupid. Of course, the USSR was an evil and corrupt nation (sorry, but this is a fact - especially under Stalin), they would never have thought of using it like in the movies! Later, one in five (a German scientist) somehow finds out that the devices can also be used to kill only all the Evil people who hate freedom. Thus, he uses it to destroy all evil communes and, apparently, others that were against freedom, and the world will then become a paradise !! Propaganda, stupid and full of holes in the conspiracy - this film is simply not worth your time, although it is an interesting relic just for the way it addresses communism - in particular, the tension between NATO and the Soviets.
