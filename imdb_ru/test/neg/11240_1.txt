I just gave 10 for Thieves Highway, I mention this for two reasons, one of which is to prove that I am not a bastard who gives only bad reviews, but 2, because the theme of the film has the same thread, namely, falling in love with a woman of the night. <br /> <br /> We all know that beauty is just a chick, but you can't avoid them all, they will eventually catch you. Pretty woman does two things for me, two terrible terrible terrible things, firstly, she portrays prostitution as a career more like a dancer’s career, you know, with absolutely good friends, leggings, giggling, borrowing each other, make up. You see that in reality Beauty is a prostitute, and this is a prostitute we are talking about here, she has a wonderful life, she is happy with happiness, only sobbing to explain her predicament. I feel that this protagonist of the “happy Hooker” type is much nicer than even an almost realistic character, and the question arises for me if you are making a movie about a person, but you are too scared to decorate this player with the characteristics familiar with this role then why do it? If I make a film about a chef, but I don’t want him to cook, talk about food or wear a white hat, then why bother to make a film about a chef? Bailing out and turning a prostitute into a respectable dancer, the story completely misses the point and, therefore, never indulges in any of the moral or social issues that she might have, which is, in fact, lame. <br /> <br /> Secondly, “Pretty Woman” insults the romance itself, Edward Lewis, played by Richard Gere, has no idea how to seduce or seize this “lady” who, without his plastic friend, yes, Do not leave home without it, especially if you are a jerk in a suit that has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments are related to the fact that cash is sprayed one way or another, even when he first meets her, this is a Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces, diamonds, limousines, money, money, where's the charm? where charisma, don't mention this attempt on the piano, please. <br /> <br /> Girls who like this movie will also be girls who love shopping more than most. Guys who like this movie don't even realize that old Eddie has less charm than a calculator, because they probably don't know either, so he didn't register. More importantly, anyone who loves this movie will hate 'The Thieves Highway' a wonderful story, part of which is based on the same theme. <br /> <br /> I’ll finish the song: <br /> <br /> Pretty woman hanging on the street Beauty I like to treat Pretty woman, I don’t believe you, You aren’t true, No one can spend as much as you Mersey. <br /> <br /> Pretty woman, don't excuse me, Pretty Woman, I couldn't help but see the Beautiful Woman, and you look great, as maybe you lack imagination, as I <br /> <br /> Pretty Woman, walk on shopping, Beauty, talk while beauty, sell your smile to me beauty, yes, yes, yes beauty, look in my direction beauty, say that you stay with me .. and I will pay you .. I will treat you right
