Lon Chaney Jr. returns to the lumber when the mummy Haris is looking for his friend, Annanke, whose soul now lives in the beautiful assembly of the descendant Amina (Ramsey Ames). Andoheb, the High Priest of Arkan (George Zucco) leaves Yusef Bey (John Carradine) led by Haris to continue his evil deeds. Tom (Robert Lowry) must find a way to save his beloved Amina from the future horror of the mummy. <br /> <br /> The usual, predictable recording in the TV series Haris proves that almost every movie follows a certain format / formula. The city is threatened by a hidden one-armed corpse in a mask that seems to have been endowed with superhuman strength in order to strangle the lives of able-bodied people who are relatively easily held back by a simple suffocating fight from Haris. Frank Reicher, who saw Haris in action ... and knows a lot about the history of Egypt ... in the previous film (The Tomb of the Mummy) proves that anyone who survived the previous meeting with his mother will surely die if he returns in the next film. Well thought out, but he lacks originality, which would distinguish him from other films in the series. Unfortunately, Carradine passes through his role as the evil Yusef Bey. The embarrassing script error is with Haris, who is known for putting on her lame, lame right arm, carrying the unconscious Amina with both hands over long distances without any harmful consequences. One aspect, the shocking climax, when Tomâ€™s attempt at heroism does not go according to plan, since Haris is holding his hostage in distress, makes a little film of despondency.
