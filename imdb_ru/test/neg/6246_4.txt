Directed by Jim Wynorsky (Chopping Mall, Returning the Swamp Thing), Cheerleader Massacre is the fourth edition of the Massacre at a Sleep Party series. Think about it: this is the fourth chapter of the slasher series that no one cares about! So how can this be good? Well, it is not so! But since when should slasher movies be good? Cheerleader Massacre is interesting, that's for sure. But in the field of entertainment, we have seen better, and for sure! As you can see, I'm not sure where I stand in relation to this film. Those who follow slashers only for nudity will be more than satisfied. In this film, all the boobs, but unfortunately there is no blood or not enough. I think I am generous with this film because I had a good time watching it, and I really like watching slasher films, even such bad ones as sometimes. If you want me to be sincere, part 1 of the “Massacre of the pajama party” is the best, and all the rest is a waste of time, so I think I have a lot of time to waste it !! For more fun, see Sleepaway Camp 2 and Cheerleader Camp.
