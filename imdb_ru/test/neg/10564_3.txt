Well, when I say "wow", I mean "Jesus, please help me." I have an old VHS copy that was printed before Troma got a copy of the name. A film about the fall of aliens to Earth, to terrorize us with a gun that throws people into oblivion. CAUTION!!! And by that I mean beware of these special effects. There is an amazing amount of bugs. The game is terrible, but I would say that the only one who will make any effort will be the sheriff. The film itself is really grainy and poorly lit. In one particular scene, it's a day outside, and then in the picture you can see that the Night Beast shoots his gun with the night behind him. Then it shows the day again. * Shakes his head * I usually like low-budget horror films, but I had to force myself to finish it, because I never watch a movie without completing it. The only achievement this film achieved was a foreigner who was not stereotyped. So for this and ONLY for this ... I give him 3 of 10. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie if you had a bad day. You will be even more overwhelmed by the failure of this film.
