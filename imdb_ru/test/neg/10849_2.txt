As I mentioned in other comments, I have become a big fan of David Bradley since I saw him in American Ninja 3. The guy is great in martial arts, has charisma and looks cool on the screen. Unfortunately, he went to the DTV department from the moment of his debut and remained one of the kings of television films until 2001, where he apparently stopped making films. Now, one thing is watching “Cyborg-cop” or “Justice”, which are shitty clichés, but watching them is a lot of fun (because they are funny bad if it makes any sense), but another is to watch a tasteless piece of boredom such as Total Reality. I mean, this and the Crisis are the two biggest dung pieces that this guy has ever done. I would not recommend this to even the biggest Bradley fans. If I had known this, and the Crisis would have been such a damn shit, I would not have spent 3 or 4 euros, which they cost me. Total reality is as boring as a crisis, although, oddly enough, it begins to promise. A group of prisoners of war in the future is given a chance to stop some kind of catastrophe in the past (sorry, I didn’t pay much attention to this crime), and they have only 24 hours to return or something like that. like this. If they do not, they are stuck there forever. The poor director who watched this “tries” some humorous (?) Cliches, such as convicts, arriving on Earth and not knowing, for example, what a truck is (wow, funny ...). After this film, David Bradley teamed up with some earthly girl until the end of the film. I'm so bored that I had to watch it in 3 or 4 parts in order to at least use the 4 or 5 euros that cost me. This is because every time I tried, I fell asleep. And if you get a film with David Bradley, which will be just one crappy 10-second battle scene, then this is the final touch that will help you throw him off a cliff a hundred feet, never to see him again. I would like to meet with the “director” of this handful of shit on the street, and I swear to God, I would ask him to return me 5 euros. I would also like to meet with David Bradley to ask him why, in the name of God, he decided to act in this bad excuse for the film. Do not even worry about this film, I mean it from the heart, not renting a loan and especially not buying it.
