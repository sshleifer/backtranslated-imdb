Ok ... so ... I really like Chris Christopherson and his usual easy line feed in his films. Age has helped him with his quiet low energy style, and he easily steals the stage. But Disappearance is his mistake. Oh my god, it was a bad movie! <br /> <br /> I have to thank the filmmakers and actors, including Chris, for trying their best to comprehend this silly, confusing story! None of this made sense, and Chris probably didn’t understand it either, and he just moved, hoping that someone would come up to him and tell him what this was all about! <br /> <br /> I don’t care that everyone in this film was making love to the project or some kind of nonsense ... I saw low-budget films in which there was a story for God's sake! There was nothing in it, silt, nada, zippo, empty of reason ... a complete waste of good talent, scenery and celluloid! <br /> <br /> I rented this piece of garbage for a dollar, and I want my money back! I want my 2 hours ago, I invested in this waste of class F of my time! Do not watch this movie and do not waste 1 minute of your precious time passing through the room where it plays, or even open the DVD box! Believe me, thank you for your advice!
