Just listen to the album of Broadway actors and the voices of Barbara Harris and John Callum, who work wonders with the wonderful scores of Lerner and Lane. Then, with this beautiful new actor's record, watch a film with Streisand as Streisand and Yves Montand, reading his lines with such a heavy French accent that the chain saw could not get through it. The best part (for those who need something to look forward to) is what Montand does with the intro part of the title song. Listen to how he sings / says: can any of us have an idea or a hint about what magical skills of magic and voodoo you can do? (This part sums up the problem arising from the imposition of "named stars" in musicals, and not because of the corresponding talent for different roles.) the beauty of the English language. <br /> <br />
