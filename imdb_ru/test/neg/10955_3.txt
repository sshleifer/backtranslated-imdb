The production company for this film calls itself “Nott Entertainment,” and this is an amazingly successful title. It's very funny 'Nott' from start to finish, and it's a shame, because a mixture of zombie and western movies could be interesting. Every time a low-cost zombie movie comes out, it will be “for fans of fans.” I really consider myself a fan of zombie movies, but too many like this one, and I will overestimate my opinion! It seems that the film is a rip-off of half-decent Australian zombie film Undead, instead of just playing the main role in a cowboy hat; all wear one; but it doesn't make much sense, because the film seems to be happening in our time. The sequence of titles at the beginning of the film deceives us, forcing us to believe that an atmospheric film is waiting for us, but when the film starts properly; it soon becomes apparent what we really are for. Naturally, there is a fair amount of blood, and this is actually quite well done, although the good things I have to say about the film basically end there. Halfway there is a turn, which might be interesting if the rest of the film were. Overall, this is just another zombie film in a world where there are too many zombie films. I do not recommend it.
