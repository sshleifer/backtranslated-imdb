What a mess - and I do not mean "destruction" in the title. I could continue the story of the beaten plot, lousy effects, (actually remarkable) grimaces of actors, as they provide the worst features of their careers, etc. Iâ€™ll just say that there were no palm trees in Chicago last time leave it alone. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... you need ten lines to publish it on IMDb ... Well, I think the release of the DVD with excerpts may be interesting. Maybe Dennehy will show what service he called for so that he would appear in this thing. Maybe Dianne Wayst will show us a bag of money that must have been needed to get her involved. Maybe CBS execs will apologize ...
