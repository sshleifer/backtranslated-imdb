Hope Floats with Sandra Bullock is a real disappointment. The story begins well. Her husband is cheating on her, and she finds out about it on national television. Therefore, she must restore her life. Here it could be interesting or built into the storyline, but you got so bored. She comes back with her parents, and Harry Connick Jr., who plays Justin, begins to beat her. These two have no real chemistry, but you should get the impression that Justin is in love with her. The film ends the way you think it will, but you would like it to not end like everyone else. They had a good start with this film, and they could turn it into something watchable, but instead it is a film that you definitely want to miss.
