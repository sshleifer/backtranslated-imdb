“The Ballad of a Sad Cafe” worked hard on its image, but when it came to a crunch, they left it to stand in its own dust created by itself. <br /> <br /> No one can portray it by saying this. loud, but if Amelia Vanessa Redgrave fought John Wayne or even Clint Eastwood, my hard-earned dollars would have to be sent to Redgrave. Her image of Amelia was so close to perfection and absorbed in more detailed dedication than most actors are willing to give to any person who has signed a contract for several million dollars. Redgrave gave Amelia this emotional pull that was a mixture of her own unique voice and a hard-earned woman from the south. For the average viewer, this can be interpreted as annoying, but as the film evolved, did it become its ?? Miss Amelia turns this beauty scene into a rough neck. It was the performance of Redgrave, as well as her interaction with other characters that made this film outstanding. but not the highest. Others after her performance were needed, but not stellar. When we passed the grim cliché that all the decorators hired to work in the south after the Depression passed, the minor characters felt like posters. The image was necessary to set the scene, but the characters of the city had no other purpose. Take, for example, the vision of Rod Staiger of some old savage preacher. Only his scenes will force any viewer to question the reality of this city in the wilderness. The main two players who surrounded Amelia fought with charm for a delightful moment of theft of the scene, but due to the lack of direction ?? it just seemed faded. The most absurd of these two (although both occupy a high place among the dubious lines of sanity) is Cork Hubbard, who plays Amelia's "cousin", who happens to appear one night by chance. His character is never fully defined, he has no true motive, and his loyalty remains uncertain. He does not play a vital role in this film without forcing us, the audience, to question his sanity and honesty. Can you create a character by simply sticking your tongue out, clicking your ears and hitting your chest and head? Finally, is there another end to the absurd? Keith Carradine. Close-ups of Callow with this exhausted person build a character, but our lack of understanding between him and Amelia causes his goal to fluctuate. It was the characters, the same southern cliche, what were they? some stood forward and tried to create an absurdist play of the period, and I cannot say that they failed. <br /> <br /> Where the “Ballad of a Sad Cafe” could not rise above mediocrity, was in cinema and narration. This film was about Amelia and her need for other souls in her life. The comfort level of the audience with the arrival of her little cousin was interesting ?? no one could not wonder if he was honest or just a confident man trying to throw out a warm heart. Cork Hubbard's character is never entirely clear, but we take it with short snapshots of how he and Amelia do small things together. This is his idea, which turns from a recluse into a bona fide cafe owner. The problem is that the director Callow never brings us to such a dramatic level between Cork and Redgrave ?? is this man crazy or does he represent the whole family of Amelia? I need something from Callow that brought these two out of the David Lynch-Esquire relationship that they had. Then our pool gets even deeper with the addition of Carradine as Amelia’s “love interest”. Using the memory technique in memory, we see two, but never reach their love ?? which Amelia's anger against their love draws him into the world of madness. Why was Amelia so angry? Why was there no connection between Carradine and Redgrave? Why was this even in the film? Due to the lack of attention to the connection of these characters, the possible scenes between them did not make sense ?? throw a choice of Cork, and it just becomes completely erratic. Although there were several excellent choreographic scenes created by Callow, the inability to transfer his characters from point A to point B. I lost concentration, interest, and my concern for the characters fell when I did not understand the final question ?? "What for"? <br /> <br /> In general, The Ballad of a Sad Cafe began with a crash, but ended with a very small bang of fireworks. My emotional feeling of this film fluctuated up and down, up and down, and ultimately remained even lower, mainly due to a lack of understanding of the motives of the characters. Redgrave did a phenomenal job as Amelia, and although the other characters (with the exception of the random Steiger) did their best, I just didn’t quite know who they were. Their motives were so confused that when the emotional ending finally came, I was indifferent. Director Callow, it seems, lacked import scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all our main players. Callow created some beautiful scenes where the faces seemed to overlap the landscape, which allowed us to focus on Amelia ?? or Carradine, but nothing has been explained or developed. The film is played out with anger, revelation, happiness, memories, anger, anger, anger, fading. Without comparative connectors, this transformed from an outstanding historical film into actors playing roles in front of the camera. It was a shame, because Sad Café had a promise, it simply could not fulfill. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** ½ of *****
