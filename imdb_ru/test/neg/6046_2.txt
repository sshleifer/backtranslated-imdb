Sci-fi network original. Not the best. Not far from the worst. An electrician (Richard Greco) stumbles upon a "key" that can open the gates to the parallel Earth, which have been captured by mutant spiders. For the past thirty years, mutations have been controlled by an extraterrestrial alien queen. She has already eaten the population of this parallel world, which resembles Chicago minus residents. Guess what? Now she must find another world to feed on. The electrician leads a four-person team that is reluctant to face the task of saving the world. The final confrontation is probably the best part of the whole movie. The cast also includes: Richard Godwood, Colin Fox, Keith Greenhouse, Jason Jones and David Newman. One would think that the Sci-Fi Network could spend more money on special effects.
