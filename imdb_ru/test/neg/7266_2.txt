What can I say about PLANET'S pleasure, what I said about the harbors of numerous other tiresomely soft core porn movies? Very little . It's just another movie with a very weak plot that is used to create very flimsy scenery between men, non-actors, who spend too much time in the gym, and bimbo, which obviously had silicone implants. In fact, the sex scenes in this film are somewhat less convincing than you usually see in this type of film, as the actors squeeze their hips together, expressing painful expressions that they are constipated or something like that. Not surprisingly, many people claim that sex is overpriced, they probably watched too many of these films on cable stations late at night.
