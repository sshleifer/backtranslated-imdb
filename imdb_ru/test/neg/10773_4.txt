I’m not quite sure that I agree with the director of this version of Scarlet Puppy. I represented Sir Percy Blakney as a very calm, seemingly lazy aristocrat. This particular Sir Percy Blakney seems to be replete with overwhelming energy and volatility. I did not like the shoots in the style of Houdini, James Bond, “Mission Impossible”, which was designed by Sir Percy. In previous versions, wit was a tool of salvation, not technology. Also, the characters of Margarita and Shovelin were not adequately depicted. It seemed that there was little energy or chemistry in the interaction between the characters. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to blame, because the reason for my dislike of this film may just be a difference in interpretation. If the director's interpretation had coincided with mine, perhaps I might not have been irritated by what seemed to me a bad character image. <br /> <br /> I preferred the 1982 version. Anthony Andrews was very effective, as a calm, calm veil. There were also Jane Seymour and Ian McKellen. In my opinion, the style of this period seems to have been lost with this last adaptation. I recommend sticking to previous versions, starting in 1934 or 1982. <br /> <br />
