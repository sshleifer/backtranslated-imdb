Perhaps the most disgusting thing from Australia since the time of Vegemite ... Predictably unpleasant comedy with Barry Humphreys as the double Australian diplomat Le Patterson and the secret agent Dada Edna! So many gags related to bodily functions that even the Farrelli brothers would be sick, and a few rude moments, especially the consequences of the terrible H.E.L.P. virus. Only for lovers of extreme toilet humor. Oh, and this is “NeverEnding Story II”, not “Mad Max” George Miller, director ... * ½ <br /> <br />
