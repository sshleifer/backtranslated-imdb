Bank robbery / police thriller sounds good, right? <br /> <br /> Chaos looks good: beautifully designed, good performance, high conceptual robber ... <br /> <br /> But ... <br /> <br /> The plot has a unique achievement - being both smart and incredibly incredibly implausible in the mode “how we actually got the money” and too complicated in the section “who did it and why” at the same time ... <br /> <br /> Also, Ryan Philip shouts NOT, seriously, NOT cruel or scary ... and he is not particularly cruel and not terrible when he throws a dizzying fit. To be honest, his amazing flash is the only really funny scene in the whole movie. He must be worried that he has abandoned the role of Anakin Skywalker and is now doing it .... <br /> <br /> Stratham is usually good as a strong but quiet hard nut with self-deprecating humor, but here the extra lines of relationship are so ridiculously bad that even he looks awkward when talking about the necessary cliche. More quiet seems better? <br /> <br /> Snipes is actually in order, but another nail in the tomb of a talented actor: he needs the role of an actor, not a paraphrase of the action movie hero. Perhaps this business with its taxes will allow it to break this form, and the public and critics will allow it to vote for sympathy. It would be good if he had not been so typographical all the time. <br /> <br /> These lines, which these guys pronounce when they are not engaged in plot development and detective work, can be summarized in one word ... pheeeuuuh. <br /> <br /> The film feels completely uncomfortable, and it never turns into a gel: for the first 45 minutes I found it annoying, and the last tough part was bearable. It should have been / could be good, but it simply cannot redeem the terrible features that are overwhelming the expense and the general level of irritation with likelihood levels. <br /> <br /> In general, I almost did not cope: incredibly annoying, and Ryan .... please, please, please, get rid of goldilocks ....
