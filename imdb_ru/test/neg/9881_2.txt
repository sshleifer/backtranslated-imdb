My first impression when I read the synopsis for the upcoming film was that it would be very different from the book. The trailer for the film says that the film should take place when Vivian turns 19 years old after her parents died in a fire in America. She meets Aiden, a beginner graphic novelist. Working in a chocolate shop that day, she must admit that she will never be normal, because every full moon she becomes a loop-gar — an imaginary mythical creature that can be compared to a werewolf. br /> <br /> Most of the small changes did not seem to me too bad, although I am a fan of the book under the general title Annette Curtis Klause. I knew that it would be different, but I wanted it to support the book, believing that a change in age, a change in the situation and a few small changes in the profession would not affect the storyline as a whole so that I wanted to explode. my eyes go out of their sockets, and I leave myself with blood on the cinema site. <br /> <br /> In the film, many important characters are unnecessarily killed, one of which is Esme, mother Vivan, immediately after the fire in the intended fire. to kill her father. I pushed it aside and ventured into the film, tired and slightly irritated. Driving through Romania, the camera angles were decent, the scenery was beautiful, and the music was ... interesting ... but I got the impression: "Why does Vivian look like this, and why does she wear a hoodie?" Moving on to the later parts of the film, I have to say that I am surprised that the writers seem to support incest in some way, and instead of sticking to the character relationship from the book between Vivian and Rafe, The Five leader has now become her her cousin (surprise!) Aunt Astrid, who in the novel was a cruel and hateful rival of Vivan's mother, and I can add, is in no way connected with any of them. <br /> <br /> Upstairs from the distortion of character, Gabriel somehow became the leader of the pack and was obsessed with the fact that Vivian was his partner so that they could fulfill some non-existent prophecy. Not only did his appearance take as much as 180 from the description in the book, he apparently also was the father of Rafe. Yes, that's right, this is a cute little incestuous wolf knot, closely related to each other. <br /> <br /> The little things that annoyed me were scenes like forest hunting. From the rest of the crowd stood out a redhead, one who "kissed her enemy" before their victim was released to run and hunt. Why was she there? Why does she look like Astrid? I believe that my mind is not extensive enough to understand why such a character should have existed in the film without explaining the reasons for which it existed, except to kiss pretty victims. <br /> <br /> I liked how Amoeba was completely cut from the movie. I liked how Aiden’s legally intertwined, that between an allegedly dramatic scene where he told Vivian how his father wanted him to learn self-defense and then beat his father “in self-defense” to make him appear so tragic character. <br /> <br /> 180s characters are a lot of fun when they are completely unnecessary. At the end of the film, I felt that some person had flipped through a novel, sketched half of the character list, drew several links here and there, mentioned that Gabriel was a bit of a jerk, Vivian fell in love with Aiden, he was afraid of her when he learned the legend of legends, and “someone” is “killed by a silver bullet,” and some happy ending comes, because Vivian finally feels that she was accepted by someone who loves her for who she is. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 2/10, because the camera shots were relatively decent, and the casting could be worse, but as far as directing is concerned, why make a jump jump? into the air in human form, as if they want to fly (with curved backs and a tendency to jump from high places), blink briefly, and then fall to the ground like wolves? The only aspects of this film that even made me watch it to the most disgusting, sad end were wolves, beautiful landscapes and cute boys. <br /> <br /> All together, I must say that in order to enjoy this film at all, you need to be prepared for delusions, strange events that are not always explained, incestuous insinuations that either the book didn’t like or read the book.
