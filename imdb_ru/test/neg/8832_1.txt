I watched "The Root of All Evil" with an open purpose to refute this so-called scientific atheist. I do not know where to start, because he is such a rich source of stupidity. <br /> <br /> He is clearly not a statistician, otherwise the chances that 2/1 will burn him for all eternity would push him to believe in God <br /> <br /> He views science as a religion and expects that we will believe him as we make God. One has only to look at the language used in his postulates. <br /> <br /> Regarding Faith. This product is widely used in everyday behavior. Just think about it. When he sits in the electrician, he believes that he will be connected correctly, and trustfully turns on the switch. When he enters the plumber, he pulls the chain in his bathroom and expects the water to flow in the right direction. Regarding faith in science. When I studied in chemistry, I believed, and I was taught that the atom is the smallest particle, and the theory of electrons in the peel of the onions, both of which are now ignored. I was taught this as an atomic theory, so to speak. So why should we believe any scientist, especially when he goes beyond the parameters of his field? Dawkins argues that religion will be the death of civilization. Religion is a civilization. Can he or any other atheist, tell us, please, what kind of civilization did atheism, barbarism, or savagery create and develop? He now lives in the final stages of Christian civilization and receives all the benefits from it, preventing its source. I discovered that Dawkins was an arrogant, dictatorial, judgmental, obvious supporter of eugenics and a Nazi in his attitude towards youth. How dare he tell what parents can teach their child? The child belongs to them, not to the nation, and since the parents bequeathed their genetics to them, they inherit their beliefs. His dismissal of Adam as “he never existed,” since he has no evidence, was an example of the same attitude. So I have no evidence that Joe Blogging lives in New York, but he can do it. I just haven't found the proof. This does not deny his existence. I note his argument with the Bishop of Oxford that the prelate is selective about what he takes and believes in the Bible. Well, Dawkins does it too. Where does he draw the line between this as a historical document and a religious statement? He is also selective. I heard a lot when Dawkins invented the ALTRUISTIC gene. What a horn. He is desperately looking for evidence of his foolishness and how Piltdown was invented, so now we have the so-called ALTRUISTIC gene, which predisposes us to take care of our young and other members of our "group." The problem is that all animals do it - not just monkeys, but with evolution it is the survival of the strongest. not the kindest, and if he really thinks that we are becoming kinder as a race, he does not read the same newspapers as I, I discovered that his arrogance beyond belief limits that, because we only have this life, we must enjoy it to the fullest. So how does he equate this with his obvious position as a wealthy European with a disadvantaged man in Africa who destroyed his entire family and probably raped and starved. Will he help her? I note that his whole opposition to religion is that they go to war. Well, GK Chesterton said that the only war worth fighting is the war of religion. B) we are against the use of contraception, abortion and homosexuality. All sins are against the 6th commandment. It's funny that. <br /> <br /> As a Catholic, I believe that his rejection of Pius XII's “Dogma of the Assumption” statement in 1958 was wrong. He, Pius, never said that it was open to him when he was sitting somewhere alone. In the event that Dawkins does not know this, Revelation ended with the last Apostle. Pius would have taken years of advice and studied the documents transmitted from time immemorial to come up with this statement. Also as a Catholic, I find his dismissal of all religious people contented. what a complete trash. Every day we fight with the world, the flesh and the devil. We are the Church Militant. We can also praise the sunset and admire the beauty of nature, even if we believe in God. The problem with Dawkins was that he interviewed strange fanatics and extrapolated them to all of us.
