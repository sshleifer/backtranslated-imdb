First, Nick 623, Pearl Harbor was blown up in 1941 and not in 1942. They should not have predicted an explosion. <br /> <br /> Secondly, no one noticed these six industrialists / lawyers / that they were missing. quite a lot of time? They were killed * before * operations! Third - how the hell did Lugosi get out of the taxi when he was not seen? Fourth, why didn't the Japanese just kill him instead of jailing him with a comfortable partner and his surgical kit? Fifth - what's the point? There are some interesting moments in this film, but by the time they explain what is happening, you will probably stop watching. If not, you don't care.
