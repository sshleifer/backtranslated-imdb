I can not believe that the number of people calling the main characters "boys" !! no such thing people !!!! There are cows and bulls, and all males of cattle are bulls and have no udder !!!! There was even a real bull, but it looked like it was a completely different type of animal! Oh my god, it's like drawing human ears on a cat, superman tits or Mickey Mouse with Shirley's bright curly temples - even in animation it just doesn't work! giving human qualities to animals is not something new and expected, but changing their actual body to a transsexual figure is strange for a family cartoon - how many editors, writers, producers, animators saw it and didn’t know anything better or didn’t say anything - it’s just amazing I am not a snob, and I love the animation - The Simpsons, Beavis and Butt-head, South Park, even the Ice Age and all the other new things there - behind the hedge was great - but this is crazy - completely crazy - I couldn't accept that many people are so ignorant, and I continued to hope for a reason for the udder in the film - an explanation - no one came - and at the end, when they hold this little newborn calf and half of his belly udder, and they say “this is a boy, I almost choked !!!! please, writer / creator let us joke!
