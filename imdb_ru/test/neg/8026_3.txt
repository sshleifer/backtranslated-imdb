Being a completely overwhelmed movie fan with a furniture house, I'm a big fan of IKEA. My whole house is practically full to the brim with cheap chipboard. And you know how all these stylish IKEA household items have such funny names - a bookshelf called “Holika” and a bathroom mirror called “Grundtal” - well, that just adds to all the European charm. <br /> <br /> Like those things with an interesting title (but with a terrible translation) on the shelves in IKEA, I would like to translate a few of the reviews I read about the Swedish “Kraftverk 3714”. <br /> <br /> Original comment: “For a low-budget movie, this is a very cool thing. It would be great to see what these guys could do on the budget of Hollywood! ”<br /> <br /> Translation: Film is crappy, pedestrian lighting, cinematography is not interesting, the sound recording is empty. <br /> <br /> Original comment: “David Lynch’s sci-fi drama in a strange forest town with no less strange characters!” <br /> <br /> Translation: these “actors” act for free, the storyline is round and tedious, the ideas that underlie the film are desperately trying to be existential, but are just mundane, and the settings (especially the interiors) are boring and filled with ugly wallpapers. <br /> <br /> Original comment: using computer graphics shows that eff ktnye CGI-effects do not necessarily have to come out of Hollywood studio "<br /> <br /> Translation:.! if you have sketchy cinematography, hide flaws digitize all this on a Mac, and vigorously mixing for three minutes. Brilliant! <br /> <br /> I took a chance on this DVD because I adore independent films, especially those that try to tackle the often expensive and awe-inspiring genre of science fiction. I mean, some of the best science fiction films of all time were realized with little or no budget, with focused actors. Take, for example, Peter's Idaho-Transfer Foundation's travel warning! Classic. <br /> <br /> But Kraftverk 3714 does not fit into the category of “carefully thought out, discreet, based on sci-fi ideas.” He constantly focuses on characters who do little and don’t say interesting things. He goes in a circle in a circle. This is too long (this is from a big fan of Tarkovsky). Worse, his concept of "reality-changing aliens" is food from the Twilight Zone, created 40 years ago. It's just not a very good movie, and I really wanted it to be damn it! <br /> <br /> However, as an IKEA fan, I made one amazing observation. First, anyone who bought at IKEA knows how their tricky shopping carts work - all four wheels are differently directed. Trolleys can be rotated 360 degrees, and, as any avid IKEA customer knows, in order to treat them as a professional, some skill is required. Well, damn me, but one of the main actresses in "Kraftverk 3714" is sent to some inky-nuts grocery store in the middle of nowhere, and what does she push? Multidirectional basket! In the end, this is not the invention of IKEA, but another great invention (let's call it “Tacklebee”, damn it) from the land of Hey-doo!
