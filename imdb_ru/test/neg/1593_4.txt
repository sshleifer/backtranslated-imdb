I think I was ready to hear about it after all the years. I first heard about this from Siskel and Ebert. When they said that Divine ate excrement, I had to look at it. Then one friend told me about it in 1991. She also said that her parents saw it when she first appeared, and that her mother almost left her father because of this! So by the time I caught the Pink Flamingos on Sundance today, I was ready. Mostly. <br /> <br /> I still could not help wondering at the anal close up and the blowjob scene. However, the only characters I sympathized with were Edie and the egg cell. Her crying scene at the beginning of the film, though because of something frivolous for normal people, really upsets me. Although she was not beautiful, she had a sweet voice. I was happy for her and for the egg, and they really touched me. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the play in this low-poverty performance was bad. As for the script, how did John Waters come up with this material? Well, at least that's different.
