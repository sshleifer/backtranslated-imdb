without a doubt, one of the most racially biased films I've ever seen, with a prejudice directed against Hayden Panettiere when she enters a tough urban school. She is constantly called the "white girl" and other spots based on her color. First, will it be allowed on the other hand, if a black girl becomes the subject of all abuses? and, secondly, the stereotypes of ethnic children from the city school are also shameful. The authors' obvious desire to show that they were "fashionable" also did not take into account the fact that the school in the city center won the cheer-cutting competition not because of talent, but intimidation of its white opponents !! these overtones for the film took him from the expected direction of a harmless, carefree comedy, suitable for a family audience, to a vehicle that none of the participants had any meaning. Hayden Panettiere has a stellar quality, but I would be surprised if anyone in the class goes much further. In general, a tasteless movie that was a waste of time.
