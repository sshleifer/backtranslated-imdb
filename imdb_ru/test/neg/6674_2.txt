Okay, maybe the game was not bad, but I am writing this review as a public service, so that no one else who happens after the intriguing start of this TV movie loses two hours of its life in anticipation of the plot that will never come. The chief investigator has an intuitive feeling that ended up with the missing naval officer (Guy), and few, apart from bystanders and the accused, seem to dispute her. So what's the point of staying in this drama? Damn it out of me. I continued to think (or hoped) that there would be some sort of plot twist or new revelation, but nothing was received. Thus, I cannot think of the only reason to sit and watch this meaningless television film, based on a true story or not.
