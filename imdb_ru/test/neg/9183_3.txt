This film is stupid and very funny. The unfortunate "Easterners" are not happy with the fact that they are leaving to the west; therefore, they hire a drunken master of wagons (John Candy) to drive them back to the east. Watch jokes were just not funny enough to carry it. And Richard Lewis is very nervous; but honestly, I don't like him in everything he does. Ed Lauter is hilarious as an awkward villain. <br /> <br /> The film is about Candy. He died of a severe heart attack ten days before the film ends. Stand and digital enhancement allowed to see the character Candy in the final scenes. Candy was a very good comedian and gave us really good slaps, belly laughs in her career. This film was not the best in its class. <br /> <br /> In this film you will find out: William Sanderson, Gailard Sartain, Ethan Phillips, Ellen Green and Rodney A. Grant.
