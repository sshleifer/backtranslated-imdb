Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito), a “cryptozoologist” (a fancy term for one of those self-deceiving losers who love to study extremely rarely - read: nonexistent - animals) and his team of hunters manage to catch the Chupacabra, a large, scaly, elusive, fast-moving beast. To deliver it to the mainland, they secretly smuggle it on a Greek cruise ship, and some idiots open a box in which it is located, despite the fact that they were not specifically told about it. I assume that the strange growling noises emanating from the inside were also not a sufficient deterrent. The monster then makes a monster tang; run, biting pieces of various passengers, while the captain of the ship (John Rhys-Davies), a special agent with a square jaw, pretending to be a merchant for some reason (Dylan Neal), a blond man with instructor Tai Bo (Chelan Simmons), a bunch of guys with machine guns and others try to stop it. The main victims (which, I think, should be comic, but hard to say), is an old rich bitch (Paula Shaw) with an agile terrier and a gold digger snob (David Millburn). Obviously, the monster can be knocked out by a single tranquilizer, but he can survive dozens of bullet hits. Chupacabra's design is acceptable (albeit non-original), but the rest of the film is devoid of expectation, surprise, or interest. Boring science fiction channel "Original" film; they made dozens of similar films with almost interchangeable characters and plots, but with slight changes in the creature. Already enough!
