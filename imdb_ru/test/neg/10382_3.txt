In this film, just not enough direction. The plot has developed so many turns in such a short time that it seemed that he had lost some kind of vision of the true storyline. There was a lot of wasted dialogue and it just seemed like the letter was urgently sent and wandered too much. The scenes of exorcism and the history of obsession began to recede into the background of the character (which were a bit weak to begin with). <br /> <br /> In general, I would say, skip it if you are not rented out the rest of the horror section in your local video store, and you have Jones for a movie that you have not seen. It's much better for you to just watch an exorcist or an exorcism of Emily Rose.
