The plot includes a new barber shop with a franchise that moves across the street from Calvin's barber shop. Thus, he feels he needs to change and improve his store, acquiring new things and the like. It sounds very exciting, yes. As for the rest of the film, much of this includes the same material from the first film. People who work for Calvin are standing nearby, talking loudly and talking to each other and customers. Once again, Cedric the Entertainer was a bit funny, but he looked more like a routine than a movie. And Calvin was faced with another moral problem associated with obtaining a large amount of money. He has already shown that in the end he will do the right thing. <br /> <br /> CONCLUDING REMARKS: nothing new. I do not recommend this if you did not think that the first barbershop was the best of the sliced ​​pieces of bread.
