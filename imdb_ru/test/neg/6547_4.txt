It was the first fighter shot in a Hollywood action movie banned in the USSR. It's not even close to the Hollywood action movies of the time. The plot is childish, directing so-so. This film was a success because he was the first of its kind in Russia. Despite the fact that I watched it many times, I must admit that it was naive and I did not like it. This is not the best example of a Russian action movie. This is only the first experience.
