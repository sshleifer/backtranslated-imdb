I saw the previous films of Cedric Klapisz and therefore I expected a high-quality film with psychological depth. As an Erasmus student and visiting several friends studying abroad, I know very well what it means to spend some time abroad and mix with different cultures at the same time. Yes it is a lot of fun! Because of this, I thought that I should not miss this film. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find that L'Auberge Espagnol could not satisfy in many ways: the characters are stereotypical, the events are banal, and the story is shallow. Although there are quite a few familiar situations, they are annoyingly cliché and do not go beyond the bounds of trivial events. This made the film uninteresting to watch and gave me a strong expression of “something-something-not-something-add-add?” Feeling. In addition, the film lacks a solid story. Sometimes it’s more like a documentary or a “real” show than a seriously filmed movie. <br /> <br /> However, I can imagine that if you did not study or did not go abroad, it may be interesting to see
