I am 35. Bruce was a man in Evil Dead, and I still love to watch ED1 and ED2. It was also great to see him king two or three years ago in Bubba Ho Tep, in which he showed versatility and great acting talent. But this Screaming Brain adventure is definitely not for early Bruce fans. Either I’m getting old for this sh17, or I’m just not anymore Bruce’s target audience. I am sure that children between the ages of 9 and 13 will love this film. But this overly sophisticated sci-fi comedy contains about 5 minutes of interesting moments, and the rest is cheap children's humor. Campbell is better to talk seriously with Sam Raimi and put their brains together for the latest picture of reuniting the Evil Dead to return my interest At least behind the camera would be a good director ... Sorry Bruce, this is just not for me. Take care of yourself.
