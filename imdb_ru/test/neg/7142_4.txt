Hello! Grudge 2! How are you dude? I have a friend with whom I would like to meet. The Grudge 2 is the worst 2006 Johnny list. The worst of 2006, Johnny meets The Grudge 2. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? I got the impression that this should be a continuation of The Grudge, not a remake. If so, why does he not do anything except rephrase the original? This float doesn't even look like a movie. This is just a 90-minute soundtrack of a strange extravagant chick that makes this annoying croaking sound. <br /> <br /> A sound that I would recommend you not to start. When I heard it for the first time, it was pretty creepy, but since 2004 I have heard it 12,367 times, so pretty much it goes on its way. And that makes it even more annoying to 20 viewers who thought it would be fun to imitate the sound when there was a quiet place in the film. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Guys, you are NOT FUNNY, SO SIMPLY CLOSE! I promise you that EVERYONE ONCE, when a character walks slowly through an empty room (which is about 97% of the film), someone from the audience will launch it, "Uhhhkkkkkkuuuuuhhhhhkkkkkkk". Yes, I know that this is a terrible way to reproduce sound in letters, but you understand the point. And then some dude from the audience giggles, and in order to keep up, says his own performance. I was very close to just strolling around the audience and beating random people. <br /> <br /> I told you not to start. <br /> <br /> In The Grudge 2 there is absolutely nothing I could recommend. There is not a single original fear or idea in the whole film. There is no unforgettable acting performance. Are you a Sarah Michelle Gellar fan? Welcome, enjoy its two minutes of screen time and one line of dialogue. Are you a fan of Amber Tamblyn? I hope that you can cope with the fact that she has nothing to do but to walk, looking as if she is suffering from pinching a nerve. Can you believe that the story (if you can call it that) is even worse than The Grudge? <br /> <br /> At least the original was rather creepy and had some effective jumping scenes. I did not jump once during this lameloznost (yes, I came up with the word, deal with it). Like this. Not one time. The “panic attacks” are so fabricated and so clearly wired that the shock value does not occur when the “caught” moment arrives. Watching this movie is like playing a good game of chess - you always have four or five scenes ahead. <br /> <br /> There are also some weird scenes that make no sense. One that immediately comes to mind is the scene where the girl drinks a gallon of milk and then starts to spew it back into the jug. BUT? I say huh?!?! The audience laughed. I shook my head and sighed. There was a lot like that during the movie. Laughing. Sighing. The head is trembling. Fall asleep (I did it twice). <br /> <br /> The film even attempted 1/5 of the lighthearted plot. Wow. It’s so bad that I don’t think we should even refine it by labeling it with a twist. Do they really think that someone will be surprised by the revelation of who is hiding under the hood? You are welcome. It was as shocking as Elton John, coming out of the closet. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the final passes the entire unclosed route "see, we may have another sequel." As soon as the credits rolled, the audience booed. My feelings for sure. If the audience paid money for this hamburger, then, most likely, everything would become violent, and I would gladly head the charge. <br /> <br /> We learned from The Grudge that there is a Japanese conviction that when someone dies in a powerful grasp of rage, then the curse is left behind. Like Ben Affleck's film, this “spot” that forever becomes part of the place where death occurred. Well, in The Grudge 2, we learn that when a horror film covers its budget during its first weekend, its sequel will be thrown out, and more often it will be as bad as this one, and leave a stain on any theater where Kinoshow . <br /> <br /> GIST <br /> <br /> If you are a complete wimp and have never seen The Grudge, then this can be somewhat frightening. But I highly recommend saving your money, otherwise there is a high probability that you will be the one who leaves the theater with resentment.
