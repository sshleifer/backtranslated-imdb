Here and here there are interesting stories about the likes and dislikes of Bruce Weber. Perhaps if a professional editor put it together for biography, I would feel more pleased. Instead, I spent $ 8 at a film festival. As for his autobiography, almost nothing is said about Bruce Weber, except that he likes to look at photos, take interesting people, especially beautiful teenagers, and listen to jazz. The director of "Tiny" would make a much more interesting and cohesive film.
