Graduate Sanction is a film about a killer woman working for the US government. She has to kill a famous television reporter, but she saves his life when she sees that he has a little daughter. Since she did not kill him, she becomes the next target of her employers. <br /> <br /> The script is not very good, although I have seen the worst films of "BC". A bounty hunter with remorse, the government is killing innocent people in the name of the fight against terror ... What's next? Aliens save the victim ??? No, the Supreme Sanction will never get a reward because of the script. I'm afraid the game is no better. Some of the more famous actors (Michael Madsen and Christy Swanson), who obviously had to pay a lot of bills and therefore took part in this film, along with some other actors who probably donâ€™t even know what the camera actually looks like, Don The film is also not beneficial. <br /> <br /> So why watch this movie? Well, if you have nothing better than to watch some action movie, and you're tired of Mc Gyver's 10,535 restart or A-team, than you want to watch this movie. Otherwise, you had better leave it alone. I give it 3/10.
