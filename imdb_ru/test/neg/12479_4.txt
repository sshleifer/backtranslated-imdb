There are some horror directors whom I respect and admire for so many years that they cannot disappoint me, no matter what garbage it was decided to put on the film. Lucio Fulci is definitely one of them, but what the hell is he trying to disappoint me with his last effort! You can easily afford to miss most of the movies shot or filmed by Fulci in the late 80s and instead just watch “The Cat in the Brain” because this title collects and repeats the best and absolute bloody shots of no less than SEVEN of other Fulci. - films, including the episodes of the most terrible murders in the film “When Alice Smashed the Mirror”. In general, this film is definitely among the weakest and most senseless achievements of our director. The script is damn inconsistent, the basic premise is absolutely implausible and somewhat stupid, and there is absolutely no expectation to enjoy. I love the name, but in fact it is completely meaningless. In this story there is a character named Alice, but this is only a supporting role, and she, of course, does not break the mirror. I believe that she could break things just by using her voice, since she is an opera singer, but she does not. The plot is a middle-aged playboy who is addicted to gambling, who spends his days seducing rich widows and killing them for their money. Lester Parson kills women (as well as unwanted witnesses) in horrible ways, makes steaks from their most succulent body parts, and feeds their leftovers to their cat. There is also a silly psychological plot in which he thinks that his own shadow is responsible for the killings instead. The difference between “When Alice Smashed the Mirror” and some of the greatest horror films of Fulci (“Beyond the Boundary”, “City of the Living Dead” ??) was that he did not bother to create a terrible atmosphere at all. Characters, including Lester, are colorless and boring, and murders are usually portrayed as if the world most often put a woman's head in a microwave or repeatedly run back and forth through a human body on a machine. The lighting is poor, the cinematography is super-ugly, the installation is clumsy and amateurish, and the actors' performances are completely pitiful. If I hadn't known anything better, I would have thought that Lucio made a lousy film on purpose to protest against all the harsh Critics who dislike his repertoire, no matter how much spirit and effort he put into it. The obvious element for enjoying here is simply outrageous blood and bloodshed, because even an attempt to mix in a black comedy does not work properly. While Lester is swinging. His chainsaw cuts off female legs: “When Alice broke a mirror” is an undemanding horror entertainment, but beyond that, not much can be recommended.
