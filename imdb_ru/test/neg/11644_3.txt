Jim Brown is removed and creates a fairy tale in the Philippines immediately after the Japanese invasion. The story says that the Japanese captured several soldiers, including some divers, who they used to extract the gold that MacArthur dropped into Manila Bay. <br /> <br /> This is a dirty film, the purpose of which is to declare war and racism (the film uses Edwin McCainâ€™s war in a not so subtle editing). The performances are at best adequate. Jim Brown is fine, but in fact he does not show any range in the play, which simply makes him stand there with an irritated look. The kits are OK, but they seem pretty cheap. The film suffers from the very beginning due to the large amount of footage, including many of the most famous shots of the Japanese attack on the Torah! Tora! Tora! Using such a large budget sequence effectively makes the rest of the film look positively anemic; it also reminds you that there are the best movies you can watch. For me, the film seems to have half the real story, the extraction of silver and half the story, which is only to fill the time. None of this is particularly exciting, even with an explosive finale. <br /> <br /> If I had a choice, I would take a pass.
