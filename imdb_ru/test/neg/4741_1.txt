Ed Wood rolls over in his grave. He could have made hundreds of cult classic works for the price of this hole. The worst scenario in memory (he makes "X-Men 3" sparkle like "Citizen Kane"); the most amateur direction; pre-K cinematography; the most fun "special effects" (I'm talking about the sequel "Friday the 13th"); and throw in the meaningless, disgusting, deeply disturbed sequence of the maternity hospital. The absence of any talent or sensitivity that puts this garbage on the screen is astounding. The fact that the “industry” could reward anyone who participates in this celluloid pool in future projects should be of serious concern.
