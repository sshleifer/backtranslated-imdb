I liked all the films of Lilo and Stitch. The television series was not so good, but I postponed my opinion about the series when I watched this movie. And I have to say ... It was bad. <br /> <br /> One thing I found disappointing was the animation. Yes, you heard that. Animation. I found that its quality has deteriorated since the release of the first film. His quality was as high as that of the television series, ”which I did not expect at all. If you are looking for candy for the eyes, do not expect anything special here. Also, the animation could not portray any serious moods. Even in the supposedly sad scenes I didn’t feel anything for the character, another disadvantage compared to the first movie. <br /> <br /> The next thing was absolutely terrible dubbing. I found it very, very unconvincing, and wondered why, with all its wealth and fame, Disney could not afford to voice actors with real talent. The mastery of voice acting was just as annoying as in the series. I tolerated one of the episodes, because, hey, who would not get tired when he voiced many episodes? Damn it, I don’t even know how many episodes there are (theoretically there are 624, but I just can’t believe it). Nevertheless, I thought that the voice acting would improve in the film, and I was depressed by the truth that what they could do in the series was already their best. <br /> <br /> Then there was a terrible script. It was stupid, except for redemption, and the writers simply tried too hard. They try to insert some jokes, but I just found them annoying. Maybe it was not the voice acting, but the silly dialogues that destroyed the sound part. (On the other hand, the soundtrack was not too bad and quite matched the mood.) <br /> <br /> Fourth, there was a problem with the plot. I predicted everything, and the storyline made the characters so unoriginal and unexpected. You have aliens get new positions and responsibilities in your space. After the initial hype, they realize that they really didn't like it, and they miss their old life. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, an evil villain gets out of prison after a very “battle-rich” scene and breaks into Jumba’s laboratory to steal his experiment. Then the experiment was cloned into 100 others, and the hamster wants to conquer the Earth. When the main characters find out, they try to stop the evil hamster, but they run into some stupid final bout with the experiment and get it in an extremely unconvincing excuse for trying to make the series look cool. Then the characters abandon their new privileges and return to Earth to resume their lives. Seriously, how many other films have already used this ending? This storyline was extremely short and formal, so don't expect too much from it. <br /> <br /> So Disney failed in sound, graphics and storyline. The only charm of the series is the original characters and how they managed to preserve the “feeling” of the characters, but even this could not save the film. I tried to like, I really did, but I rate 4/10. Another Disney crash.
