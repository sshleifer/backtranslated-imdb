I can only guess that this film was an experiment that failed. Years before it would have been moving images accompanied by music. Later it would be added to silence. In the end, it would be Technicolor, Cinemascope or Imax. This film must have been an erroneous attempt to introduce a new element into the talking picture. During all the emotional scenes, the character stops in the middle of a dialogue, and his inner thoughts are told as they look into the distance or turn to the camera. This interruption is painful, at least. Imagine these top-level actors who are trying to look busy while the buzz is on. Painful. I have no idea who invented this trick, but it was the only time I saw how it was used - and for good reason. In each scene, the actors had to roll their eyes, wring their hands, or replay to such an extent that I really wondered if it was really a comedy. <br /> <br /> This story is a hopeless soap opera that unfolds over several generations. Norma Shearer, disappointed with love, is looking for a reason to live. She has a friend who is played by Ralph Morgan, who worships her, but she takes him for granted. She is attracted to the doctor who is played by Clark Gable, but he is absorbed in himself and not interested in her. She agrees to the weak who desperately needs her. She marries him only to find that there is insanity in his family, and she can never have a baby with him. A doctor comes in, who selfishly inserts a bun in her oven, but then he finds out that he still loves her. The child builds confidence in her husband, who becomes successful, but she realizes that this is really Clark, whom she loves in the end. Are you embarrassed yet? Forget about everything else, just watch a couple of episodes of "How the world unfolds", and everything will become clear. <br /> <br /> If you ever have to watch this movie, hold on to the final scene. The rotations of the actors disgrace Harold Lloyd. This should not be missed.
