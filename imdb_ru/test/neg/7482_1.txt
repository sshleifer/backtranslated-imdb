Carson Daily should be the only talk show host who is not a comedian. What was NBC thinking about! He is not funny! The letter is terrible! All sketches are painful to watch. The current karaoke is not funny at all, especially since it tells you that they will sing before they sing! An interview on an escalator is just silly and, of course, not at all funny. All that he jokes, especially during a monologue, is the least intelligent, stupid, not funny jokes ever shown on television! I mean that every time he makes a joke on Jessica Simpson, he ends it “because she’s stupid,” which nullifies any amusement that was a joke that was already very low. Any three-year-old child could come up with any jokes and sketches that they gave to this lame excuse for the show. Seriously, don't watch this show, unless you're on the verge of suicide and don't want something to push you over the edge.
