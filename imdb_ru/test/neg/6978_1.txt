This film - the abomination of all that is worthy in making the film. The lead actor surprises his audience by not playing at all. We should watch his soulless, soulless face for almost two hours. All these jokes are not convincing. I never laughed when it was Saturday night. Five of us drank beer to laugh, and then put it on, and you felt all the warmth and color flow from the room. The film ended, and the mood was ruined, so we all went our separate ways, ruined the night! OK, so the pros and cons. Pros beautiful setting in Hawaii, looks good on blue. The downsides are the worst acting games ever; You can say that all interested people just think about the salary. Predictable bad plot. Zero nature of development. Forced jokes that fall apart. Many pictures of the guy's penis, who, frankly, acts better than him and has more charisma. Let all the creators of this film hang their heads in shame and make their languid manly things cheap.
