When I bought this film, I expected to get a funny film about the exploitation of the 1970s. Instead, I received this boring holiday from amateur author Andy Milligan. Ah, Andy Milligan. With his intense editing, dizzying rhythm and surprisingly well-known actors, you can almost think that you are watching ... one of his home movies! Seriously, I couldn't even fall asleep the first time I tried to look at it. The scenes of boring people were dragged down, and every time someone was killed, the film slowed down. Sometimes it also accelerated, forcing the voices of the characters to sound like chipmunks, which was probably the best in this film. The screenplay actually seemed a bit better than the film, and seems to be more suitable for being in a soap opera than in the granular 70s sleeping pill, where the actors constantly stumble over its line. The cover read: "Their main sections were strangely erotic ... but completely cruel!" Believe me, there is nothing "erotic" in this film. Oh, we see characters that look like curd lumps, but that's all. As for the “brutality”, the viewer is most fascinated with this film. And one more thing ...
