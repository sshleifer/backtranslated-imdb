Perhaps this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I knew that it was a B-movie before watching it (in fact it was the reason for watching it), but I never thought that it could be so bad. The name promises Dracula in space and does deliver, however, the story does not really use the fact that the character Casper van Dean is a descendant of Van Helsing. And be careful with the ending of the film, it will quickly come on you. I have never seen the final shout: "And now we have more budget!" Clearer. Their resolution of the film was quite comical, although the story so clearly cornered itself. If you feel you have to see it, watch it with a friend who shares your love for B-movies. If I had not done this, I would not have reached the end.
