Perhaps this is just the format of this film, a documentary, but I believe that the film would have been much better supported by good actors and a more solid dialogue. The fact that the actors are also business owners is a double-edged sword. They know better than anyone else the emotions and complexities of the business in which they were, but since they are not professional actors, they convey these emotions very poorly and the documentary suffers. There were a few really memorable scenes and lots of good lines in this film, but they were put so badly that they would disappear with time, and the only memory I have left in this documentary is that there were good scenes which I can't remember, <br /> <br /> Look at this if you want to get a personal report on the bust .com and see what happened to 99% of people in the industry who did not become millionaires. Nevertheless, be prepared for some disgusting work with the camera, a bad game, bad communication and a bad film that personifies the era of the Internet boom.
