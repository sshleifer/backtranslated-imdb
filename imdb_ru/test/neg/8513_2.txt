In my opinion, this film is not very good. I can hardly find something good about it, but still I would like to explain before I decide that this is just another bad movie. <br /> <br /> I decided to watch it because Kostas Mandilor starred in it, and this was the main reason I looked to the end. I like action movies, and I understand that such films are based on action, not story. I know that they did not go into details when it comes to the authenticity of history and events, but even this does not explain why some scenes, simply because they lack the sense of reality, look ridiculous. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the film looks quite promising: a tough, good looking specialist and his not so cool, but an intelligent and cheerful partner should do work that turns out to be a little different than they expected. The story takes place on a cruise ship. Disaster happens, the ship rolls over, and only a few survive. During the struggle for survival, they have to run away from the shark, the professional killer and the rising water. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film is quite brutal. The main weapon (in addition to the disaster, which has already destroyed the majority of passengers) is a weapon that has been used successfully in many cases. I personally missed a good man (or woman, if you will) in battle. Family fun? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this film was shot in a hurry, without a real vision of what he is trying to say. Made from the usual action movie stunts, with something called love, and without real meaning, it just leads to a bad movie.
