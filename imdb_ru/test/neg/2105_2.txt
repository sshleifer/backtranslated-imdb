I probably would like to give this film a zero, if not for the climax, which actually includes “Snake on the train”, but “Train IN a Snake”. The package was made much more often than likely during the night of beer after he heard about Snakes on the Plane (this, in fact, was released to coincide with the release of this film). The joke is probably not lost to those who seek it; I do not think that there would be a soul that would regard this as a serious action of an action movie (if only on an ironic level beyond the capacity for rational thinking). This is a Maya curse imposed on a woman who her family cursed for leaving with another man, and soon sick and coughing green mucus with an admixture, of course, a snake, was noticed. She and her boyfriend ride on a train heading to Los Angeles, and very soon after more than a cliché, the characters are addicted to snakes that outrun the train, and the pioneer woman herself becomes a snake. <br /> <br /> If it were worth listing more about the film, I would do it, but not enough time during the day. All that can be said about the quality factor is that it almost does not exist; There are student short films with a large budget. Perhaps it was a wise calculation from the filmmakers that so many copies would be sold, just for the mere fact of a joke, that they would reconsider their budget on the first weekend. Because, looking at the scenery (the trains themselves change randomly in the middle of the stage!), The actors (if you can call them that, with just one other actor - the one with very thin hair, beat one woman). throughout the film - who benefited from the film being produced), FX (also alongside the non-existent, forcing effects in “Snakes on an airplane” to resemble Star Wars) and the CGI snakes themselves, with the last huge hippo snake what can be seen in sci-fi movie terms. <br /> <br /> All of this means that it is, in general, indiscriminate laughter at every step (especially so cruel as it seems when a little girl becomes involved in the "attention" of the snake), with disdain for good taste, working in his favor. That being said, it is also 100% disposable, like a sour-flavored lollipop B-film.
