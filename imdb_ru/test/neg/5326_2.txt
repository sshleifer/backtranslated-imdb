One of the dumbest films in cinema history. Wait, I take it back - this film cannot be included in any category related to "cinema"; it belongs to such categories as “waste”, poop or similar categories. Ironically, this is even about two scavengers. The film "Men at Work", light crime comedy with the brothers Estevez (Shin) since 1990. Rejecting the plot and implausible storyline, bad behavior, poor dialogue, poorly executed stunts and slaps, continuity errors and a high level of Nameless actors will never see again, in general it was a pretty bad movie (I mean, in fact). It was a film that can be useful on the one hand: you can watch it about 200 times, learn each line and repeat it in public with your * lost * friends, thus securing your status as the biggest jerk in your tenth grade class. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I actually sent a trivial IMDb recording (along with this bad review) to the web page of the IMDb movie, if only because I noticed a silly little punk musical joke, which, apparently, no one noticed (about the statue of Butthole Surfer). I have such a conflict over why I should even spend my time on presenting something like an auxiliary note when I really want to blow up Emilio's acting career (no, wait, he already did it himself. Thank you dude!) I'm so glad that * spent * only time for this, and not for real money. However, can I have at least one tenth of my budget? Anyone other than this director (Emilio) could have made two or three much better films, using only what they spent blasting cars, carefully placing bikinis in a bikini in the background and beating up unnecessary extras (henchmen) in suits from rugs. I would mention Emilio’s merit in writing letters, but to call this script “writing” would be a stretch - it’s more like caricature ideas. And Charlie Sheen, if you are reading this, I assume that M.A. It must have been done during your career, when you were a deceived, prostitute-loving Hollywood boy who had not yet grown up. (Oops! Sorry, I think that part of your life is not over yet. Get well, you are “half human.” Such promising talent, so * wasted * ?? oh, look, this word again.)
