This film worked together with some of the most predictable storylines and small characters ever seen. The author obviously bought the play “How to write a film about a space catastrophe” and followed it after the play. In particular, the stereotypical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from space — arranging bold shows in the face of disaster — was done over and over again. <br /> <br /> Max Q seems to have been written in the hope that the producers will invest 50 million dollars in the project. But, judging by the second half of the film, which contained numerous unsuccessful attempts to create special effects, the producers could collect only 50 thousand dollars. To find out that the film was nominated for Special Visual Effects, Amy just shook me. <br /> <br /> I think that a handful of high school students who have completed a media education course could create more believable effects! <br /> <br /> And there are too many holes in the plot to mention. But I will choose one as an example. Now I’m not a NASA expert, but it’s certainly very improbable that an employee connected to the shuttle simulator suddenly retains the force position in the control room when everything became pear-shaped with the program. Of course, there is someone more experienced in Mission Control who could be addressed by the program director, and not twenty-nine years old, who had not been in the control room before. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace for this film is the work of Bill Campbell. He manages to make a good attempt to save something from a train wreck, which is this scenario. <br /> <br /> I give this film 2 out of 10, with the main work of Bill Campbell starring keeping it from the bottom mark.
