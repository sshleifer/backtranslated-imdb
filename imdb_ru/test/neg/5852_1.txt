I don’t know if I’m wrong or all the others who say that this film is good, sincerely, I just want to do a favor to people who doubt to watch it, make it or, worse, buy it (don’t do it in fact!). <br /> <br /> Trailers and very early previews may seem funny in one way or another, but this is not funny at all, they fall into the “you have to” series. Sweet scenes, which usually lead to very bad jokes, bad, very bad actions, tasteless scenes, cheese effects; this film has everything, everything is wrong. <br /> <br /> As a last comment, the movie would be funny because of the basic concept, but believe me, this is really far from that.
