In this film there is simply no quality redemption. Well, with some costumes everything is in order, but they are not, for example, in the films of Conan. And what about the hair of Ator? I can't believe this is part of a series! I will say one thing about this film: it was considered bad enough for righteous coverage at the beginning of the filming of MST3K, and I offer everyone who is interested to see how bad this film is to watch this version of the film for moral support nothing more.
