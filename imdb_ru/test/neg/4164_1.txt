The film disappointed me for many reasons: first, the image of the future, which at first glance seemed realistic to me, was well built, but there was only a minor role in it. Then the story itself was a weak copy of Lost in Translation. In the Middle East, a man and his family met abroad a new girl, a karaoke bar, camera movements and images - all this was a very bad imitation of the excellent Lost in Translation, which also had confidence. This film is trying to be something brilliant and cultural: it is not. I wonder why Tim Robbins even thought about making this movie !? The main actress is terrible - did she play in the Minority Report? And why do you have to show the vagina in such a film? Lost in translation should not show excessive love scenes. R-rated only for this? This movie is not even worth watching in the video store!
