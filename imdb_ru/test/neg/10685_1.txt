This horrible movie hurt me forever. <br /> <br /> The main action of the film is nothing special. There seems to be a tribe of serpent-worshipers in a remote mountainous region of northern China, where women, not men, are leaders and decision-makers. I believe that among some men this is enough to make a "Succubar" a horror movie ... In any case, sometimes Chinese men wandered into the village, took a fancy to local girls, seduced them, and then left them. Unfortunately for men, women subjected them to a spell derived from the poison of a snake, which caused them to die terribly in 100 days — their bellies were swollen like a pregnant woman with live worms and snakes — if they did not return. <br /> <br /> Forget about the cover of an American video. This has nothing to do with vampires, although there is one inept bloody scene. The name itself fits only marginally: “Succubar” is a Latin verb meaning “to lie under,” and this is the root of the word “Succubus”, a female demon who will seduce men in their sleep. In fact, these are MEN who are seducing here. <br /> <br /> But this is not the main action of this ridiculous film, which is so unpleasant. These are small side incidents. I will miss the slaughter and the slaughter of the bull, which is performed on the screen. The participants seem very experienced, as if this is an unpleasant duty that they actually perform in real life; and I am sure that they really ate the animal afterwards ... although I am indignant that the act of striking me in the face seemed like "entertainment." <br /> <br /> What I want is for me to miss (or miss) the numerous, completely outside shots of an unidentified person who from time to time interrupts the story by eating live animals. He starts the film, tearing with his teeth a living snake. During the film, he devours the beetle, the lizard, the toad (I had to leave the room after that) and the whole mouse (I stopped looking at that moment and lost my appetite for a few days). Let me emphasize that it was completely unexpected and had nothing to do with the film ... unless it is a cynical mention of love, as it is depicted in the film: a blind, selfish, predatory survival mechanism that breaks apart the helpless ... but then again, I’m probably just rationalizing myself to wrest the filth from my head ...
