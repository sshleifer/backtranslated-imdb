A few years ago, when DARLING LILI was playing on TV, it was always a pan and scan version that I hated and decided to wait and watch a movie in the proper widescreen format. So when I saw a cheap DVD with this Julie Andrews / Blake Edwards opus, I decided to buy and watch it once and for all. <br /> <br /> Boy, what a horrible movie. This is so bad and on many levels, that I really do not know where to start, when to describe, where and when everything goes so bad. Looking at it now, it’s obvious to all movie fans that Blake Edwards created this star car for his wife simply because many other directors beat gold in Andrews in musicals (Mary Poppins, SOUND OF MUSIC, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE, etc.) But also because Andrews starred in the projects that have become famous on the stage by Julia herself (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc.), because Hollywood believed that she was not sexy enough or glamorous. So Blake created this stillborn effort to demonstrate his wife in a bizarre spy story / war movie / romance / comedy / musical mix. Darling Lily suffers from several personalities, never knowing who or what it is. Some particular scenes are good or effective, but in general, it just does not work at all to such an extent that it is very confusing. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that the DVD version is a “director's version” or in this case “let's save everything we can” from this notorious box office failure. By releasing the DVD, Edwards cut 19 scenes (19 !!!!!!!!) from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet surprisingly ineffective version. The film moves together without a clue about what it is. We have 25 minutes, and we still do not know what is happening and why we are watching what is happening. What kind of spy is Lily? How strong is she? Has she ever been responsible for someone's death? Instead, we are watching the bored-looking Rock Hudson trying to persuade the totally bored-looking Julie Andrews. Things haven't really helped with the inexplicable reason why both are falling in love. Why does Julie fall in love with Hudson? Why he, and not other men with whom she is associated? There had to be one of her ex, wandering around, trying to get her back or trying to unravel her secret. This would give us the much needed contrast with the intricate action. It would also give us the impulse for the slow process. There is no catalyst in this story. <br /> <br /> Just look at the episodes to see clearly that Edwards and the writer have just come up with ideas inspired by Andrews (and Edwards) previous successes. The best (or worst) example is the scene where Andrews and Hudson follow a group of children who sing in the middle of the forest. Edwards directs the Sound of Music. No wonder he removed it from the DVD. Back in 1970, this scene could work at a certain level, but today this moment smells of despair. There are other plot elements directly inspired by other Andrews and Edwards films. The endless scenes of dog fights are inspired by a much better MODERN MILLI. The musical moment “I will give you three guesses” was created simply to laugh at the character Mary Poppins Julie, who became “obscene” when Julie performs a striptease in an acting game. The ending, a bird's-eye view of Julie, running towards the Hudson plane, is another “wink” of SOUND OF MUSIC. <br /> <br /> This is all confusing. Julie plays a singer born from a German father and a British mother who lives in England, but sings her (English) songs in Paris. You never know exactly where the story is going. Some moments are just poorly edited. For example, when Julie and her "uncle" are riding a horse. They talk and talk, and then Julie suddenly runs out in the middle of a sentence. I like "what happened here?" <br /> <br /> Comic episodes are not funny and worthy of any trouble. Every scene with the French police is pathetic. Where is Peter Sellers when you really need him. The action is stupid for the faith. When Julie and her “uncle” ride the train to Germany, Hudson's squadron shoots cartridges at the train, almost killing Lily in the process. Brilliant. What else is funny in this scene is that two people leave the train in the middle of the night, but Hudson and his squadron reach the train, even if they leave the next morning. This is one slow moving train. <br /> <br /> Musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the whole movie (and the reason why I gave this movie 3 stars), but its effect is significantly reduced because it repeats at the end. Speaking of redundancy, did we really need to see the “can-can” dance, the Crepe Suzette stripping scene and the Julie clearing? “The girl on the no-man’s land” is fine, even if she is bleeding obviously, but this moment simply makes no sense, because Lily sings to his group of wounded soldiers in a French hospital, causing me to wonder how many soldiers there were indirectly injured as a result of her spying ? <br /> <br /> The whole project is sluggish and without energy. Romance is 100% incredible. Rock Hudson looks too old and tired (look at the museum scene). Julie looks stunned, as if she is on Valium. But what really kills this ill-conceived project is that Julie plays a German spy. Edwards desperately wanted to dispel Mary Poppins syndrome, from which his wife suffered, and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision. No matter how much I like Julie, she is not Greta Garbo, who did so well at Mata Hari. Funny enough, even if Julie plays a German spy, she still looks picky and cute. <br /> <br /> How bad is darling lily? Even 37 years after his release, Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on him for his DVD release.
