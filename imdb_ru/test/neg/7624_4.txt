After his success in Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984, director Wes Craven somehow decided that his next project would be this television film. I am not a big fan of this director as a whole; an early film about exploitation “The Last House on the Left”, as well as his modern slasher “The Scream” fit well with me, but the rest of his work is very successful, and I do not dare to call him the owner, whom others have called him. The main theme here is cryogenic freezing, although this is more of a springboard for the plot than an important part of the film. The main influence here, of course, is the excellent zombie film “Deadly Dream” of 1974, and we are focused on Miles Crayton; businessman cryogenically frozen ten years before the accident, which means that he should be thawed out immediately. Miles is part of a project for sick people; they pay for being frozen in the hope that in the future they will be revived when their diseases are cured. Miles successfully revived, and he is considered a miracle ... but the person who wakes is not the person who froze, because Miles returns without a soul. <br /> <br /> This film could be quite decent judging by the idea behind it, but instead we are given a plot that really has nothing in common, and it must be said that Craven does not use all the features of the film . “Soul” is the main focus, but it may seem that the absence of a soul and just a murderous intention / absence of compassion is one and the same that seems unthinkable. The film was made for television, so it is not particularly unpleasant, and it is obvious that not much money was spent on it, since the whole production seems to be very cheap. Michael Beck never became a very popular actor, and it is not surprising, judging by his performance here; while he is demolished, he basically lacks charisma and he is not formidable in a central role. The plot is not too bad, but there is a real lack of tension and / or tension, and things slow down too often, which sometimes causes the film to become quite boring. It all comes down to a predictable ending too. Overall, I have to admit that this film did not impress me at all, and as for the Craven filmography, Chiller would have to go with Shocker, the sequels Creek and The Hills Have Eyes II as a slip.
