The only reason this show did not receive a 0 is that it is unavailable. This show has evolved from informative news to sensational claps. I tried to support this show in its demise, because I like stories about human interests, and Primetime had some very good ones. Unfortunately, April 21 forever changed my opinion about this show and the unethical news that participate in it. ABC effectively documented the abuse of children, and then refused to show it until the statute of limitations expired and the parents could not be arrested on charges they had to face. Worst of all, ABC hid the whole incident under the carpet; instead of taking responsibility and seeking true professional help for these concerned people, they forced some pop psychologists to send strict warnings to the AUDIENCE that they should not judge these poor angels too harshly. I was really nauseous. I hope this review stops one person from viewing this investigative trash in the future. If this happens, I will be happy. These days, all you can expect from Diane Sawyer and the good guys from Primetime Live are kissing celebrities and criminal activities, hiding and praising the stars. Do not waste an hour of your life; you better watch an old comedy movie about Nick in Nite.
