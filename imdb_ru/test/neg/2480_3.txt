I saw each episode, and all the characters remained as self-absorbed as the invented little assholes, there will be no character development in 5 years (getting pregnant is not development if you are still the same daddy, only now Delinda whines Danny) because no next) Sam never changes and never grows, which makes her dull, repetitive and so annoying her nauseous after the 3rd season, Danny is a typical bland character that everyone orders in his life (he has no principals his own morals) Mary and De Indus. The old boring cliche, in which they want the relationship between them and with them to become very boring, really. <br /> <br /> James Cann can act, and his character can watch, only he is just another hacker writer, a former CIA employee, who has huge contacts, training, etc., so he can stop any thief or fraudster , known to a person, even if the cameras cannot do half of what they are doing, it's fun for a while, but after 5 years the writers are very silly, Why? Since they have all these expensive and advanced technologies, but there is no simple walkie-talkie (communication is quick and easy), you will never see security guard walking on the floor only when there is a situation, and suddenly everyone is there. <br /> <br /> Plots very quickly move from casino fraud and robbery in one way or another to the horrible typical American ships that make the relationship between boys and girls, as well as materials made to death around the world, they having sex, but I hate you, I have always loved you, I think I love, but instead I love her / him, but what if, maybe, once, blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> I would recommend “Hotel Babylon” to people who, like in Las Vegas, have much more opportunities because the characters are interesting and do not force us to swallow for 6 months a year. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to be British ?? I would prefer to see the same actors in 5 different shows, rather than 5 years, who are constantly in the same.
