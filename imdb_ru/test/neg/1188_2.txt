As a big fan of the three TV shows, I was very interested to learn that LoG is coming out on the big screen. In my more honest moments, I had doubts about the likely success of the concept and whether the authors would be able to withstand the high level of wit, comedy and horror that fill the original series. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, my fears were not groundless, and the film was a huge disappointment. I struggle to understand other comments on this site. Obviously, people have the right to their opinion, but the guys with whom I followed, everyone agrees with me, and they are just as big fans as I am. <br /> <br /> In acting, there was a lack of conviction, but they are so good that even when not at their best, they are still very watchable. The main problem was the plot - and the script. There were a few laughs, but not enough, a few moments of disgust, but not enough. Worst of all was the feeling of emptiness after leaving the cinema. So rarely did I feel so completely uninspired and so unmotivated to discuss it with others. <br /> <br /> I am writing this comment as a warning to other fans of the League - before I get a wide range of opinions on this film I am going to see it. If you love the League, you can convince yourself that they have not spoiled their way to the movies. If you cannot convince yourself of this, then you have spotted in your consciousness a flawless otherwise genius who exemplifies the series. <br /> <br /> Movie log? More like a log. (or a small brown fish).
