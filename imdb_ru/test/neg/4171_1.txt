Apparently, I'm floating against the flow of luminous comments on this film. I have not seen him since 4 or 5 years, but there is one thing that I clearly remember ... <br /> <br /> Bunyip was AWFUL !!! Nightmare terrifies. With terrible music and a little girl and a kangaroo running around / jumping about their lives ... <br /> <br /> In childhood I also remember the Hobbit come to life ... don't worry. Is the watercraft coming down? I did not blink. Dot and Kangaroo? It still haunts my dreams. And I have a few friends of the same age who also think it was terrible. Maybe we can get a group course on therapy. <br /> <br /> In short: one fancy movie for its time.
