Not very good at all, the whole movie was just Grudge and killed random people from nowhere. Random people who are not related to history are killed, as, for example, 3 schoolgirls. <br /> <br /> The family in the beginning also has nothing to do with the story, I believe that they are a random family that never went around the house and never had anything to do with the killings of Malice. <br /> <br /> It didn’t impress me at all, I wasn’t scared, I didn’t jump into any parts, and the whole movie was just random shit to get more money. Makes Gridge 1 look like shit, which really was a good movie. <br /> <br /> I believe The Grudge 2 is the lead movie for The Grudge 3, if they ever shot it. They shouldn't even call it Grudge 2, they should have called it the prologue to Grudge 2, and you will see if you looked at it because I'm not going to spoil anything. Not that it mattered anyway. <br /> <br /> 1/10, no big deal, bad story, and this is completely random.
