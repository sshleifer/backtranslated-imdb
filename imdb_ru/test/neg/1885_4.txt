Although the concept of "exploitation-cinema" is inevitably associated with the decade of the 1970s, in fact it is almost as old as cinema itself. Moreover, Universal Studios practically invented this term with their long cycles of monsters Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolfman and Mummy. Each original classic spawned at least a couple of sequels, and after a while they even came up with the idea of ​​making a real monster quenching! “House of Frankenstein”, released a year earlier and also directed by Earl S. Kenton, was a pretty successful effort with interesting ideas and performances by enthusiasts, but “House of Dracula” is too crazy for me to recommend it. The plot suffers too much from extremely annoying "random" situations, forced turns and dialogues and most of all ?? too short a time to develop the monster personalities they deserve. Onslow Stevens does not receive the highest bills, but plays the most fundamental role of a miracle doctor who needs to cure Count Dracula (Carradine) of uncontrolled bloodlust and fix Lawrence Talbot's disease, which turns into a hairy Wolfman every time the moon is full walking in some caves, they also pick up the remnants of the Frankenstein monster, and the kind doctor himself eventually undergoes the metamorphosis of Jekyll / Hyde due to poor blood transfusions. The last invitation to the dirty party is a female hunchback (but not from Notre Dame). Something is wrong when you watch a movie literally filled with horror icons, but the only character in the whole movie that may scare you is an ordinary villager named Siegfried. Real monsters are boring, and their once fabulous roots are completely exhausted. Count Dracula is a nagging romantic, Talbot is miserable, as well as the nagging old martyr and the works of Frankenstein ?? Well, his share in the plot is not even worth mentioning. In this universal film there is a serious lack of atmospheric conditions and elegant photography, especially compared to all their other efforts, and the sharp climax is a catastrophe.
