This recent Fulci Schlocker is an absolutely terrible blend dealing with an incurable player (Brett Halsey) who decides how Bluebeard’s style is to pay off his ever-growing debts, seducing some of the ugliest bitches you will ever look at It happens that rich widows! The script, written by Fulci, also provides for the inclusion of several black comedic elements - which lead only to the ridiculous work associated with a corpse that does not remain in place, a victim of an opera singer who will not stop singing, etc., not to mention the theme of the double directly from STUDENT PRAGUE - although, in this case, two persons communicate via pre-recorded radio messages !! In the end, I can’t say that I’m surprised that this film shows no signs of Mario Bava’s (1970) Hatchet’s Honeymoon sophistication, which he looks like differently, and that he’s content to simply accumulate disgusting blood (but not too convincing) the effects of dismembered limbs and crushed or melting faces, with which, alas, Fulci by then became fully associated.
