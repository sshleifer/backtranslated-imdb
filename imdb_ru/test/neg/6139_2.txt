************* SPOILERS BELOW ************ “Night Mom” is the story of Jesse (Sissy Spacek), a divorced epileptic woman who calmly announces her bold mother (Ann Bancroft), that is going to commit suicide. This is a fascinating premise that is devoid of vitality and excitement. The brilliant deceiver turns out to be a deceiver - the following story lacks essence, seriousness and revealing value. Where do mother and daughter shock and surprise, what could be the last talk in their life? Where are secrets, confessions, fantasies and regrets? They are here, but they are all painted in the same dull color that keeps emotions in the background and praises the “genius” of playwright Marsha Norman at the expense of everything else. The result is not a film, but a grueling endurance test. <br /> <br /> Let me preface my comments by saying that I consider Sissy Spacek one of the greatest actresses in the history of movies, a woman who is so attractive, so natural that she continues to amaze and amaze me after twenty years of fame. She brings class and magic to everything she does, and I saw how she saved more than one movie from the trash can with her angelic face and vulnerable eyes, her soft voice and sweet smile. It is because of the great Spacekus that I watched this film in the first place, and in order for one of its films to be terrible, it must suffer a considerable failure. This film fails in two. <br /> <br /> First, the film is so precisely adapted from the play that won the Pulitzer Prize that it is claustrophobic and repetitive. The whole film is a dialogue between two women between Jesse and her mother. What worked on the stage - a middle-aged mother and daughter argue for two hours in small houses on film. A piece, no matter how gorgeous it is, must be * adapted * for the screen ?? It is self-confident and arrogant to believe that the dialogue is so perfect that not a word of this can be changed. The screenplay of this film could be reduced to thirty to forty pages, and a knowledgeable screenwriter would give the brilliant Spacek and competent Bancroft some * physical * sequences, some facial reactions, something to break the yak festival from wall to wall and a prison single. Not surprisingly, the screenplay was adapted by the original playwright Marsha Norman, who may know the theater, but shows herself here to be ignorant of the cinema. <br /> <br /> I can not overstate the effect the script the play has on the film. Watching how Jesse and her Mother argue about Jesse's upcoming suicide is unnecessarily boring. Women leave the living room to the kitchen in the den and back to the living room, where they start all over again. A tiny house in the Midwest is not an ideal place to film one movie, and the director never tries anything clever or original, never tries to break the monotony with an external shot, cut-out, flashback or “something.” There is no music, no other characters, no other stories ... only two women cover the sofa cushions and argue their opinion. Respect for the play disgustingly even the most solemn classics of Shakespeare shake for the screen. Does the commitment to the original play seem almost wicked ?? It is as if the film was made only to capture the dramatic treasure that was the stage performance, and the audience - an afterthought. <br /> <br /> Another reason for the failure of the film is Ann Bancroft. She may be a good stage actress, but in the film - where 80% of the performance - she rarely fits. She, of course, does not fit here, plays a grandmother in the Midwest, but looks more like Mrs. Robinson before morning coffee. She chases Jesse all over the house, looking more irritated than bewildered, and seems unusually sympathetic, even when her lines convey a loving, though flawed woman. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek is great, as always, honest and open and so good that you really understand and agree with the choice of her character. Sissy lets us see that Jesse is a flat tire, a wrong turn of a woman who has had every bad break and made too many wrong choices. She never controlled her life, and her suicide would be her way, finally, to say: “No more - that's where I go.” That's how she expresses it anyway, but when does the Speaker speak ??? You listen. In all her films, she proves that a good actress should not behave like a man, should not be a bluff, bravado and borrowed testosterone. In this and in films like The Miner's Daughter, she quietly displays soft power and quiet depth, as impressive as it is hypnotic. You can't help falling in love. <br /> <br /> That's why it was so hard for me to watch “Night, Mother.” Spacek is wasted on film stilts that never serve to engage or even distract. I would not recommend this film to anyone except loyal Sissy fans like me, and even then you will be disappointed. I give the film a full bonus point for the final, which is bold enough for the main character to do what is right for her and not indulge in a battered happy ending. Grade: C
