Ego. It seems this is the only reason this film was shot. This film is so erroneous in many respects that it is even lower than dignity to write a lot about it. Each character was good only in self-praise, and the main actors (I use this term freely, like the director) manifest themselves in the likeness of a stone. a small story, if one, fails in basic aspects such as logic, feeling, and drama. The direction leaves much to be desired. glaring flaws everywhere (character motives are not identified, prospective husbands are found overnight, broken windows of the car are corrected, among other things) <br /> <br /> Let's face it, Kimesh cannot act. It seems, and Khansika Motvani can not. In her defense, she is still a plump baby who looks older than she, thanks to tons of makeup. Raj Babbar replays and makes his small presence as false as possible. Darshan Jariwala laughs too much. The actor who plays Khimesh’s friend is the only natural one. <br /> <br /> A few questions come to mind: how can such a film cost Rs 50,000,000 ?? Where did the money go??? Considering that one episode of the chase was shot moderately well, and Mallike Sheravat was paid an obscene ruble 15,000,000 for her 15-minute performance and 2 songs. but the stupidity of the film is amazing. (including 3 rickshaws in Mumbai that appear and jump in a police car). <br /> <br /> Khimesh demonstrates courage by allowing the film to make fun of his nasal voice and the brand name “Topi”. Let's give the devil his due: Himesh, as usual, gives good music. <br /> <br /> Bad: the direction, the plot, the singing of Himesh is still hard to ignore. <br /> <br /> Ugly: dialogue and everything else !!! <br /> <br /> Last word: it hurts in every sense of the word! Watch this movie only if you loved Subhash Gaya's "Yaadein"
