ARMED AND DANGEROUS is not one of the great people of John Candy. This film is about a fired cop who ultimately works in a small crowd-controlled security system, very weak and not very comedy. There are some moments that I really liked, for example, looking at Candy in a pilot's suit, but it seems that it does not matter much. Armed and dangerous is still a dangerously frustrating cheater brought to us by the director of an equally stupid thriller COMANDO. What a sad excuse for comedy! <br /> <br /> 1 of 5
