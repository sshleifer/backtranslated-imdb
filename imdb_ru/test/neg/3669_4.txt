"Undercurrent" represents a first-class cast of great actors who could be put together for the perfect comedy in the living room. Alas, they are largely wasted on a boiler with a “feminine look” - and at the same time on thin paper. Katharine Hepburn is really radiant as a tomboy / old maid who is finally getting married, but her husband is deeply concerned and has dark family secrets. Director Vincente Minnelli absolutely does not know how to make this outlandish plot, invented by Edward Khodorov from Thelama Strabel's story, and the friendly, first-class cast (including Robert Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Edmund Gwenn) left in dark waters **
