It was a disappointment in many ways. A film set in Ireland, although sometimes quite beautiful, cannot save this boring movie. Greg Evigan and Alexandra Paul, being a married couple trying to get their marriage back on track and inheriting a haunted mansion, are simply not interesting characters. Paul, towards the end of the film, becomes incredibly annoying and wants her to just shut her mouth and shut up, as if she is screaming, as if this has just become an Olympic event! Other problems with this film are strange segments that have nothing to do with the core of the film, such as the opening sequence with two cleaners and a woman in bed with a severed arm climbing up her writhing bare body. Although the woman is quite adequate in this, she does nothing historically. It remains to think that the production team needed to gain a little time and just throw some stuffings and some T and A. The effects of CGI are also caricature, and the co-executive producer of the fire rivals of the final, Roger Corman, is much earlier and far surpassing the film “Fall of the House of Usher” for all its inefficient cheapness. Any attempt to really strain and strain, and as a result, the chills are thrown out the window in this budget bust. If you like pictures of Ireland, you can find something here, but you better rent or buy a trip. Skip this if you are not picky and think the plot is secondary. Rent another low-budget ghost story (if you can find it) called Woman in Black and see how good and scary a movie can be. It was a missed opportunity.
