Scarecrow Gone Wild begins with a teenager from high school Mike (David Zelin), and his comrades decide to give hazing to a weak diabetic Sam (Caleb Roerig) as an initiation. Mike and his friend decided to take Sam to the cornfield, tie him to the cross next to the bizarre stuffed animal and leave him there all night, sounds fun? Well, things are reversed when Sam falls into a diabetic coma after suffering from a hypo, and Sam's vengeful spirit turns into a scarecrow that comes alive and begins to hunt down the children responsible for Sam's unfortunate life-threatening situation. Can Sam's best friend Jack (Matthew Lynhardt) and his girlfriend Beth (Samantha Isling) save Sam's day and life? <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Brian Katkin: Scarecrow Gone Wild is the third recording made directly on video. in the Scarecrow series, and although I have not seen any of the two previous ones after watching Scarecrow Gone Wild, I’m definitely not in a hurry to change this situation, which is for sure. The script actually has an almost decent premise, as Sam’s offended soul is seeking revenge, and his friends must somehow support the life of the real Sam, but the way they say it is bad, and I think it’s just not relevant to the fact that this is a film about a killer-stuffed animal running around, killing people in not very hard or creative ways. Having said that there are one or two scenes that save him from a one-star rating, the farting gag on a cornfield is fun and can do a lot of immature guys (like me), that is, when two guys bury their half in the sand and then stand over him and pee on him, also quite funny as a young woman and cool when a guy starts singing a terrible song, so the stuffed bird throws a pole that pierces it! However, these good bits are few and far between, and overall this is a stupid, boring, poorly written film for a teenage slasher with very annoying characters who are annoying. It is also very predictable and has a silly end to a turn that doesn’t really show a scarecrow, which is a problem, because when you watch a movie called “Scarecrow Gone Wild”, you expect to see how a scarecrow gets wild, and I have to admit that he looks pretty cool, like a horror character. <br /> <br /> Directed by Katkin really does a reasonable job here, although what happens to this hospital at the end and all this neon lighting everywhere and the fact that there is only one patient and two staff members? Cinematography is much better than the usual low-cost horror movie on the air lately, and there is good, albeit unrealistic coverage. There are no real fears or tensions in the film, and some medical terminology used throughout is a bit unreal, to say the least, and I say this as an insulin-dependent diabetic. There is not a lot of blood here, there are a couple of scenes in which some actor has some fake intestines on his stomach in order to present them with giblets, but it looks rather false, there is also a burnt face and a couple of injections, but a little more. For that matter, here you can see a lot of naked female breasts. <br /> <br /> Technically, Scarecrow Gone Wild is pretty good, given some of the low-budget abominations I recently experienced, unfortunately, this is still a bad movie by and large. The least talk about acting, the better. <br /> <br /> Scarecrow Gone Wild is not as bad as some of the horrors recently filmed live, but having said that it’s not much better and it’s still a bad movie when everything is said and done. Not recommended, the two previous entries are Scarecrow (2002) and Scarecrow Slayer (2003), both of which also went straight to the video.
