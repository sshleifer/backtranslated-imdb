Yes, it may not be for adults, and some adults may find it stupid, but if you don’t think about it, it’s really not that bad. <br /> <br /> The story tells about Alvin and his gang. the world, in search of jewels for a bad person, and the misfortunes they face. <br /> <br /> So the animation is good, the story is nice, the songs are forgotten, but that's good. film. <br /> <br /> I give him 6 out of 10 or *** out of 4 stars.
