A terrible, terrible, terrible movie. I saw the original when I was a kid, and it gave me nightmares as a teenager. When I found out that the remake was on the way, I groaned. WHY WHY WHY remake a good movie? Well, we can thank Dark Castle for making another classic horror movie. This time they replaced a somewhat interesting story with bloody, slower than slower and yawn-inspired characters. Someone had previously said that he / she was surprised that Paris Hilton could act. You watched the movie? She plays a little tramp. Sounds like to me. Half the people in the audience actually cheered when she died! This tells you why people are watching this movie. If this is your only reason, then find the best because, like a black hole, this thing will suck out of your life more than you want. If I were alone, I would leave 10 minutes in a boring exposure. This thing looks like an idiotic guide to creating shitty films: in a spawned southern bastard, silly, but attractive leashes, lots of knives, a lot of blood, a formidable truck, I can continue. After watching this movie, I began to really appreciate Jeepers Creepers, and it seemed to me that this movie sucks. Save yourself and avoid this shit at all costs.
