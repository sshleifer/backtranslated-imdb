If you ever plan to rent (hopefully not buying) this movie, think again. As if Gary Buzie put a gun to his head and was forced to act or die. I just wonder if Buzi was arrested for something and sentenced to participate in this film, because I just donâ€™t see a guy who acted much better with Keanu Reeves in the play Point Break in this disaster. It was a good movie, but there are thousands of other good movies that make you laugh, not wanting you to get your money back. <br /> <br /> The only reason I would tell someone to rent this movie is to watch this movie - to see Gary Busey jump up and down like a monkey. If you want a good funny movie, skip Quigley and rent SpongeBob or something like that.
