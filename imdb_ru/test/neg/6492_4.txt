Robert Lansing plays a scientist experimenting with the passage of objects through solid matter, but he goes too far overnight and inadvertently makes himself four-dimensional! Atomic age fantasy is quite adorable in a very gentle manner. Perhaps at one time it was considered thoughtful science fiction (with psychological overtones), but today the film is somewhat burned out and naive; This is a camp holiday, specially designed for late-televised shows. Wooden performances by Lansing and Lee Merivezer are hardly considered one-dimensional, although Patty Duke (who plays the pretty lousy “Miracle Worker”) gets a colorful, memorable outlet. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
