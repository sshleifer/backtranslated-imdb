First of all, I am a big fan of Robert Blake, always was. <br /> <br /> This movie appeared on Movieplex last night at 10/13, and the name interested me and, of course, the star. But after watching, I was left confused more than I was before it all began ... There are several good scenes, and I thought they would lead somewhere, but they did not, it turned out that this was “anti-police ““ Anti-buddy, ”“ anti-hippie, ”to a large extent,“ film against everything, ”with an extremely convoluted plot that also led to nothing. <br /> <br /> Robert Blake is great as a leader, and someone can be with this bad movie, I'm still a big fan of Mr. Blake and I love his game even in such shit as this ... But this the drug caused a 70s prank, well ... better stay away from that ... And that ending is that urine.
