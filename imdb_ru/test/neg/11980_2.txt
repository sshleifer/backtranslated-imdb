I am a big fan of Farcry, a HUGE fan. He still ranks on my list of the top 10 games of all time! The storyline was new, fresh ... A truly ingenious basis for the film ... or so I thought ... <br /> <br /> Farcry the Movie is nothing more than a direct attempt by filmmakers to cash the film. about the successful gaming franchise (see Doom: The Movie and more ...). <br /> <br /> A video game begins when a player (Jack Carver) wakes up in a sea cave after being shot. Boat RPG from an unknown soldier. Jack then finds a communications device, where (Harlan Doyle) leads him through islands, shipwrecks, jungles, installations and VOLCANES to find him (girlfriend?) (Valerie Konstantin), all sly battling mutated super-soldiers and genetically improved animals. <br /> <br /> The “film” unfolds in a completely and completely different way: 1: “Useless” 30 minutes (1/3 of the film) of “pre-history” even before we get to the scene of “the explosion of a boat”. 2: Jack then goes to the beach, kills some fools, then leaves ... Nothing like a game ... 3: At the other end there is no communicator with Doyle ... 4: “Modified soldiers” look like albinos with singlets ... And there were no mutated "ape-like" creatures jumping out of the bushes. Part of the game Farcry, which I enjoyed ... 5: There are no sun-drenched beach scenes, no aircraft carrier, no communication stations on huge rocks, a LITTLE link to any game content (characters / objects / vehicles), in Actually there is no attempts to follow the storyline altogether. 6: The climate scene of the Volcano from the game is replaced by the old industrial building. 7: There is a final scene ... where everyone (except Krieger) lives happily ... WHAT! <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this movie at all costs! If you are a gamer, you hate this movie with all your soul. This film is clearly intended for men, so the girls stay away ... So, if your man, 12-29 years old, has never played Farcry and is not disgusted with the directors' attempts to port books / games to the cinema ... Then this is for you...
