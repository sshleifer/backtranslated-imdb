Feeling Minnesota, directed by Stephen Beigelmann, and starring Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio: tensions between two brothers, Sam (D'Onofrio) and Jjaks (Reeves), are brought to the limit when Jack arrives at Sam to the wedding and leaves with the bride, a former stripper Freddie (Diaz), married to Sam, to pay off the gambling debt to the owner of the nightclub Red (Lindo). Baigelmanâ€™s writing and directing debut is an unpleasant mess, full of hateful characters and devoid of consistency. Putting Keanu and Diaz in the same film should, at least, give some candy, but Beigelman even copes with this task, acting disgruntly at his actors. Very poor.
