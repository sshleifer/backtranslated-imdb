When a few days before the premiere of the film, his screenwriter refuses the project and demands that his name be removed from the credits, you know that this does not bode well. <br /> <br /> The books on which Wiedzmin is based have great potential for a lively fantasy film. “Geralt de Rivia is a witcher; his only goal is to destroy the monsters that poison the world. But not everything is monstrous looking evil, and not everything fair is good? ”But all this did not matter when the Polish film crew with a small budget and without much gratitude for Sapkowski’s work decided to make a 13-part mini-series out of it. A two-hour film is a by-product of their actions to maximize profits. <br /> <br /> In this case, it’s easy to point out what makes people call this movie bad. The plot (incoherent, thanks to filling with too many stories), action (below average, with the exception of Zebrowski), dialogue (soft), editing (intermittent), special effects (intolerable) and choreography (bad) add up to a bad overall film experience. Only the soundtrack, made by Grzegorz Tsekhovsky, reveals the beauty of the world "Wiedzmin", which was never presented on the screen. Even the grandiose flora and fauna of Poland (where the part of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was filmed), a key element of almost ANY fantasy film, was not fully used. The more I think about this dead loss, the more I run out of words. At least it's nice to know that since then Marek Brodzki, the director of Vidzmina, has shot only one film (also in Germany). <br /> <br /> At the moment, we still have top-notch fantasy stories and a fantastic computer RPG (released in 2007) with reference to the books of Vidzmin. But I am sure that justice will one day be restored in the Widzmin saga, and we will soon have an equally good adaptation of the film.
