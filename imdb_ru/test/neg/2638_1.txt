This film was so weak that it did not even have good stamps. I love horror movies and see almost everything, but if I had to do it again, I would completely miss this one. You may think that I am exaggerating, but I urge anyone to find something even remotely satisfying or interesting in this piece of garbage. Not scary, not funny, not curious, not worth it.
