It so happened that IVAN HORRIBLE, PARTS I and II had entries in Harry Bear's 50 Worst Movies. Now I think that announcing them as one of the worst films in the entire history is an exaggeration, although both of them are still pretty bad films - especially the first one, since it had more of a rolling gaze and “looks with Google” either seen before !! Directed by Eisenstein and a lot of other people thought that it made the film "fanciful and deep" - and, since I am legally sane, I must say that I hated this first film !! The second, although it looks very unfinished, is a huge improvement, since the rotation of the eyes is minimal, although in this film there are replay and long boring scenes, as in the first part! While part 2 looks rather incomplete and requires at least one more hour (especially since it never comes to insane behavior of Ivan in later life - like killing his son and heir in a fit of anger). Since Stalin instructed both parts 1 and 2 to justify his own murderous rule and glorify him, it is not surprising that Ivan’s life story remains very incomplete. Even without all the truly terrible behavior of Ivan, apparently extremely evil, Stalin still did not like the film and would not allow his release during his lifetime. Perhaps he did not allow this, because he was more concerned that people would see a HUGE waste of money and resources, and would not see Stalin as crazy as Ivan! <br /> <br /> By the way, there was one episode of this tiresome film, which was so cool that the film deserves 4 (2 without it) - and this is the scene with Prince Vladimir at the banquet! It is well done and quite funny in the dark. And, the scene was made in the Russian version of the 2-color Technicolor. By the way, this is VERY strange, because by the mid-30s, Technicolor had developed a significantly improved process for producing a true color that no longer made everything look orange-red and greenish-blue. Thus, this film during color sequences is very similar to the quiet or early sound of a color film. Very strange for the 1940s.
