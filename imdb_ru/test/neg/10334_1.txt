But, of course, a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time. <br /> <br /> I got this DVD cheap, with Sandra Bullock headlining the case. This is a false advertisement - it appears on the screen of almost 10 minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this film had no other selling point - the dialogue was awful, the editing was obviously completed. someone who was strung by Quaaludes, the leadership was ... well, let's just say that my 14-year-old daughter could do better, but I hope that she never sees so little praise from me. It is possible that a family cat could cope better. <br /> <br /> Sandra does a decent job for the first film, in a short time she is on the screen - and this is the only quality of this film. Stupid story, poorly written and transferred to the film, since only the 7th grade media class must be able to cope. <br /> <br /> In short, this is terrible.
