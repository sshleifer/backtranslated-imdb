It is assumed that this film is about the disappointment of filmmaking. It definitely upset me with its endless boredom. The setting is an attractive Spanish seaside resort with its usually large cast. The script is written very poorly or, perhaps, the script was not. Only all ads. <br /> <br /> A much more excellent film about the disillusionment of filmmaking is the “Day by Night” by Francois Truffaut, filmed in a 1973 manner. It does not tire the viewer, and you get sympathy for the director, who must somehow finish the film.
