(Some spoilers) Boring, like a dirty water catcher, because of which this mad homeless Harry, Darwin Svalv, killed a real estate agent throughout the city LA because of the high prices they charge for their decency. Looking like Clint Eastwood’s extra spaghetti western, Harry, who lives in abandoned houses and eats dog food, is very upset when his quiet lifestyle, like a squatter, is interrupted. This happens when several real estate agents invaded his premises, trying to sell houses in which he stops for his potential clients. <br /> <br /> Joseph Bottom plays a pivotal role in this lower barrel horror film as a talk show host for Dr. David Kelly, a handsome and popular psychologist who participates in the KDRX survival program. DR. Kelly sued the family of one of his interlocutors, Tracy, who ended up knocking her brains out while on the air with a doctor who could not do anything to help her survive her ordeal associated with him. <br /> <br /> A real estate killer gets the opportunity to talk to Dr. Kelly live about his adventures, and the police are trying to get the doctor to find out his phone number and address, leaving him on the line, but he refuses The order not to damage his rating, if potential subscribers will not call because of fear that LADP controls it. <br /> <br /> Kelly also developed a hot relationship with the property manager and agent — busty Lisa Grant, Adrienne Barbo, whose sales offices are Harry’s main victims in the film. Harry also kills Liza's main competitor in the housing business - the plump and outrageous Barney Resnick, Barry Hope, who threatened to prevent Lisa from being able to do it in any way, even if he had to kill her. <br /> <br /> Leaving Bernie alone and lowering his pants, Harry chops off his head while he is entertained by one of his clients, a prostitute, whom he leaves dead and hangs with headless Barney. The film ends with the crazy Harry taking Lisa hostage and forcing Dr. Kelly to try to come to her aid only for Det. Shapiro (Robert Miano), it seems that he did not sleep for a week, gets out of nowhere and knocks out Harry's brains. Harry quickly returns to life without homosexual matter between his ears and is killed for the second time in the film after being thrown from a balcony and landed on the ground when a dozen LAPD members, M16 is cocked and ready, come on Scene. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie "Opean House" worked with such ridiculous tension that almost did not exist. Even the hot sex scenes between Dr. Kelly and Lisa did not save the film because there were too few of them, only two of them, and sexy Adrienne Barbo was a little underexposed, there was not enough light and too much clothing in all of them. <br /> <br /> Harry the killer in the film was also a bit ridiculous to be taken seriously, trying to express his opinion, with Dr. Kelly on the phone and in person, about the high rent and real estate prices in the country and how people like him find it almost impossible to find a decent place to live. You may sympathize with Harry's concern about the high cost of living, but be very critical about how insanely he went to correct this.
