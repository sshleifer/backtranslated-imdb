Basic summary: Ipswitch used to be a witch community and avoided the witch hunt in Salem by entering into a secrecy agreement. Firstborn males from these families have supernatural abilities and must come to terms with the seductive, addictive nature of using these abilities. <br /> <br /> Well, I usually give films the advantage of doubts and start with 5, from there: <br /> <br /> Production: -1 for a very obvious unsynchronized sound, +1 for well-done special effects, blackout actually It gave me a chill, +0.5 for a good coloring (I like dim blue), -0.5 for a stupid audio track, +0.5 for the initial sequence - I love the stylish composition and catchy headline design. <br /> <br /> History / scenario: +1 for a decent basic idea, -0.5 for DBZ / Matrix / Street Fighter ripoff / pastiche, -1 for not very well explaining some of the subject threads (spiders, darkness), -1 for a boring, predictable ending, -1 for a gratuitous exposure, both as words on the screen and as a soft monologue <br /> <br /> Acting / Feature: -0.5 for a bad bad game, although by the film gets a little better, -1 for character development lacquer k, especially among all women <br /> <br /> Other: +1 for unreasonable nudity of the male and female sex it's clear to watch, and +0.5 for the absence of sex scenes, which is usually done very badly for this genre, and as a result it turns out to be boring, not hot, +1 for having hit its target audience, teenage fans of fiction / horror thriller, although this film is not exclusively one of these genres. <br /> <br /> Conclusion This is not a film, this is a film. There really is nothing to analyze, it's just good, (relatively) pure fun. Many really attractive actors and actresses. Many boys fight in the style of DBZ and Street Fighter. If you like cute actors and actresses, supernatural special effects and / or insanely funny scenes, this film is for you. If you prefer Oscar-winning, elegantly produced masterpieces of films with tons of multi-layered, allegorical plot threads and revolutionary visualization techniques, you probably won't like this movie. <br /> <br /> Using my perverted logic, the film gets 4/10.
