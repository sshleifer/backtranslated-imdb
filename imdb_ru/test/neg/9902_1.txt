I can not believe that I actually spent almost three hours of my life watching it. This must be one of the most incredible, predictable and fun TV movies I've seen in a long time. I was hoping for good special effects and action, instead I spent all the time rolling my eyes and shouting “HE COME !!!” to the screen. The dialogue is shallow and obvious, from time to time a tense game, and as the plot develops, isn't it funny how EVERYTHING happens at the same time ... Not to mention the obvious and disgusting ending ... Now I See More than my share of disaster films I'm actually a big fan, and I think that often they can do absolutely unreal things if this is done in a funny way, but this is definitely not the case. This is just an insult to smart viewers all over the world. What did they think when they made this film?
