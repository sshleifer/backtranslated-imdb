In his recent slanderous reality show, Mr. Shore acknowledged that his cinematographic work is best used as a thrill. No, he must have said "looked best." While a healthy talk can see you through the end credits, find a little pleasure, with the exception of some sporadic laughter over the image, and not with it. The lack of title transfer - the least offense. Another hyphen, useful by Tiffany-Amber Thiessen (I dare to erase you that the patina of purity is “Saved by a bell”) is mistakenly considered a rural vampire; she is too round face for betrayal. Mr. Shore himself sometimes demonstrates a strange talent for facial expressions (I thought I recognized Jimmy Stewart there), but he was never used successfully. The banal formula of fish from the water still needs to be presented with less finesse. Our hero, Crole, has invaluable wit to quickly explain his agrarian opponents. In the end, I had to announce that it turned out: the worst film ever. Postscript Like other fish, Adam Sandler coped better with Mr. Deals. Beach may be required to evaluate Sandler.
