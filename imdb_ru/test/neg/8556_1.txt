As any of you can call this propaganda a family film. This is nothing more than a personal computer, an insensitive insult to the parishioners in a small town. The film depicts a woman as the great white savior of a small town in the Midwest, and all the others in the city (mostly men) are just unhappy girls, unable to honor, who cannot stand up for themselves and have to rely on the Main character for ransom . This film is just a love affair, which the producer experiences with some undisciplined, arrogant, assertive squirt, which he expects the audience to admire. <br /> <br /> The man who made this film probably spent his whole life sensitive to the seeker church, and had the freedom to throw garbage on the little members of the church as if they were crazy madmen, and not the majority. The same people who donate money to the Salvation Army for Christmas collect donations to help the missionaries, the poor and the homeless, sing, transport friends and are friends with each other. What is wrong with this humble group that insults these complacent traitors? Most Christians in this world would stand in front of the train and give their lives to anyone in distress, even if they disagree with him. Most Christians would not have objected if a pastor or some church minister of some church took his or her coat (or top shirt). They will not condemn her. This movie is funny!
