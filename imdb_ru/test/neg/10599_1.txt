I heard what people said, but I ignored them. When I was thrown into a blockbuster, I grabbed a copy of this film and ran out. <br /> <br /> 45 minutes I struggled not to fall asleep. There is an attempt to make the film interesting, but it was just bad. There is some kind of chase, but it was long and protracted - the perfect time to eat. When the film ended, I didn’t care how it ended, I just wanted it to end. Going in and out of my room, I check to see if this is not over. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a cliché, characters and their relationship. The plot twists are predictable, as is the ending. The actors made the best of the truly awful roles. All that can be said is: their clothes were good, but the film was just bad.
