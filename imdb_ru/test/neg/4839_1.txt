Dead Man's Bounty (American movie title) has the look and style of a classic Italian western. Cinematography, costumes and scenery look great. The cast is a rough, not pretty face among them. In the beginning I was preparing for a pretty awesome film, but what I finally saw was an absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The script was absolutely terrible. There was no expectation and very little action or decent drama. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the actors looked great, the actors spoke (in English) with heavy European accents, which were often incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Final The nail in the coffin was a wide band of pretentiousness, which paints most of the picture, focusing on the character of the bartender, which appears in a pair of very awkward sex scenes. In addition, her speech towards the end was pretty disgusting! <br /> <br /> The only innovation is Val Kilmer's trick as a dead man, continuing his recent series of DOA appearances!
