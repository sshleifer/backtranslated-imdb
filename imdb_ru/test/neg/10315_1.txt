This film stinks more than limburger cheese! If you find it in a garage sale, leave it there! I love Sandra Bullock and yet HATE THIS FILM ... Despite the fact that I am ashamed, I have a copy, and the studio changed the cover to play because Sandra Bullock is involved in this. They put it up to be the "Sandra Bullock Film". She has only a small role in the entire film, and she does her best with this, but she is young and has not yet learned her talent. Well, everyone should start somewhere ...
