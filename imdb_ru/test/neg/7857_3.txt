Some of us, directed by Ernst Lubich, adored for his boldness and ironic comic touches, were quite humid when it came to collecting material. The point is not that Lyubich is overestimated - on the contrary, he was probably ahead of his time in terms of visual narration - but the projects to which he became attached (or appointed) are not exactly the milestones of his comedy. fans love to label them. With “Heaven you can wait”, Lazlo Bus-Fekete’s play “Birthday”, Lubicz is burdened with a sleepy Don Ameche at the head — and a combination of an anemic plot, a colorless star and a stagnant memory — the director blocks the film. An evil man at the turn of the century “falls asleep without realizing it,” presenting the facts of his life before entering hell. Ameche ... wicked? This was problem number one. The promising initial sequence (set in the lobby of Aida) is quickly replaced by a dreary whim, and the auxiliary staff does not help much. * 1/2 of ****
