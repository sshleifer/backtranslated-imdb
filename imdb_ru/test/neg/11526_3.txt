The Russian Avna space station with a crew of four Russians and two Americans threatens to return to Earth’s atmosphere in a matter of days. Russia is asking for help from NASA in rescuing the stranded crew, and NASA is dismantling the Atlantis spacecraft. The NSA also has an interest in Prometheus, a prototype of the microwave energy source that is being tested on board the Avna, and organizes the deployment of one of its people on a mission. <br /> <br /> This is the plot. On less important things. The space station and the shuttle are the same, apparently obvious models that were used in Fallout, Memorial Day and Dark Breed (and, I suspect, in several other films). The effects of the model are so obvious throughout the entire film and make the film look very 1960s. The kits are a little better, but too far in the 80s for what is supposedly a new station built by an American company (which later conspired to destroy Avna and Prometheus and demand insurance). There are a few good moments in the script (including Yuri's farewell and a small hairpin at the end), but otherwise it’s rather mild and of poor quality. The game is fine, the only real outstanding performance is Alex Weadov, who offers some of the films the best dialogue. Michael Dudikoff, surprisingly, is one of the best parts of this film. Ice-T is Ice-T. “- said Nuff. The film offers several surprises that I don’t want to spoil. /> <br /> Of course, one of the best low-quality modern science fiction films of the last six years, but not the best. The film can be seen, but the special effects and the plot are likely to please many viewers. Rent another sci-fi movie "Stranded".
