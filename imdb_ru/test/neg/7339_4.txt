I love the book. He is full of passion, romance, tension ... and the film stretches along with two steep stars. Kylie Minogue was already the main star in Australia, starred in "Neighbors" and released her first single. The decision to drop her at The Delinquents was undoubtedly a marketing ploy. For me it did not pay off. <br /> <br /> Kylie may have been gorgeous in Neighbors, but she was too sweet and innocent to play the furious Lola ... and she wasn't Asian Descent how Lola was. Charlie Schlatter was an excellent Brownie, but there was no chemistry between him and Kylie. <br /> <br /> In general, the film was boring. She stretched, she lacked passion for the book, she was very focused on Kylie and in general was completely disappointing.
