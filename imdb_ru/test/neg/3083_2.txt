I saw this movie because Calexico made the bill. A real disappointment. Irritating, trendy scenes, with urban hipsters and their lifestyle clich√© hips. Cheesy stereotypical Mexican culture of the border (mystic grandfather with a rattlesnake and potions, granddaughter at her restaurant in the style of mariachi). He laughs a little, but he is taller than you, and he really lacks the vision and the main talent in the cinema.
