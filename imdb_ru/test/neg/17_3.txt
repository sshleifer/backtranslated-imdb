Perhaps this will be the biggest disappointment I see in 2009. I seem to be a rare person who didn’t like Oldboy Park, but I think that his “Lady Vengeance” and “Empathy for Mr. Avenger” are some of the best films I’ve seen in the decade of the 2000s. So I’m really I was looking forward to it, especially because I received such positive reviews. Instead, I found that the film was clichéd, and changed little, if at all, there was a new genre of vampires. Park did it at a very inappropriate time. <br /> <br /> THER compared / contrasted this "Let the Right", and I must say that «Let the Right One In» was far superior to this one, and had a new look on the vampire genre. Unfortunately, Pak double was tired.
