Of all the rave reviews, we could not wait to see this show. We like wacky humor and creative stuff, especially from Australia and New Zealand. <br /> <br /> I admit that this may not be entirely fair, since we only saw the first 15 minutes. But we just could not endure more suffering - it was definitely the most boring and painful 15 minutes that we have ever experienced when watching a TV show - it was like 15 hours. Songs can be (softly) interesting in themselves, but inserted for an infinite 3 minutes each in the middle of the storyline simply does not work. <br /> <br /> We are now trying very hard to erase the memory. If you want amazing humor in a delightful and fascinating film, watch Dish.
