Bette Midler is the best thing in this movie. This is a bad second to the 1962 original with Natalie Wood as a gypsy. The songs were made much better in the original, and the costumes were better. Bette's voice was great and she looked better in most suits compared to Cynthia Gibb. Only those who have not seen the original would have thought that this is a good film. <br /> <br /> It was not enough to move from an ugly duckling to a beautiful girl. When Natalie Wood was a gypsy, she was beautiful only when she first got into a dress with gloves to perform in a burlesque show. When her hair is cut, and then magically everything is done beautifully and she looks so elegant, this is an important aspect of the film, because it is also the first time that a gypsy sees herself as something special and that she can really be a star not just a bad substitute. her sister And the scenes where she gradually becomes more famous, were rushed. It was an important part of the film, and they killed him. It is extremely important to show her that she is becoming more comfortable with her future stripper, and the costumes are amazing in these original scenes. It was a huge disappointment to watch it in this movie. I was completely disappointed, and if it were not for Bette Middler, I would have turned off the film.
