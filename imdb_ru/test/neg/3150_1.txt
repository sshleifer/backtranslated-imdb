I am not Lynn Bates, my names are Ritiche, but Lynn is my mother, I just use her account! “Barney and Friends” (or “Barney”, as he is called here in England) is the coolest show ever. I never liked it. It was 3 or 4 years since I was born, so there was nothing new about this. My friend, however, loved this dildo show. I was about 6 years old, and once I was at his house, and he had a Barney VHS television tape playing on TV. I turned off the power and he began to cry. GROWTH HIS SPEAKING DINOSAUR FOR RISK! Anyway, in the same year, I accidentally saw a film about Barney on TV, and I really enjoyed it. I got a VHS of this a few months later, and I wore a tape, I loved it so much! I gave this film a few years ago, but at that time I liked it. But the show! Oh my god, the show was bad! Several children were victims of pedophiles because of this traffic jam of so-called entertainment! Never again, never again! Not only do I hate Barney! 85% of all comments on this show are bad, and just look at the number of You Tube Poops and videos that take Barney out of a mess, on You Tube! And don't get me started on Blow Job BJ! What the hell producers dared give the character such a sexy name! Another subliminal message in the children's show! And this baby bop is the worst thing since Osama bin Laden! In general, I give Barney and friends MINUS 1000 out of 10!
