Women's hot numbers on this show are breathtaking. They may also say that there is no tomorrow. Otherwise this show would quickly go to the toilet. How much money they earn on all the people who write, with this hope that they should be called back to win, $ 100 or something else. Boy, now it's a scam !!! Can I buy this stock maker ??? Let's face it, with technology now, thousands of people can call every minute. And with ten thousand channels and worthless crap, thousands of people watch this show. “Oh, I know this answer!” Is probably a super common trait among the listeners. With these super beauties who constantly say that callers are needed in the salon, I think this is a bunch of B.S. Often, someone who really passes seems surprised that they are actually speaking to the host. Many of them seem depressed and emaciated, probably waiting so long and trying to get into the game so many times and win some pocket changes. Wow, the producers must have just fired at him. It is not surprising that advertising is so small. Advertising is only to give time to more (first of all, losers) text messages and wait, and hope, and dream, and dream about --- what? --- win enough money for gas tank and dinner at Mc. I watch him only now and then on my brothers' TV because he likes to watch him when he is on the computer. I will sit for 15-20 minutes and look at Mel (one of the most delicious women on television) and laugh at the fraud that stands before me. Then I have to go; even if I do not! People leading an active life, can take this show only in extreme moderation. Mel, go to the movies, sitcoms or something else. Many of us are in love with you! Even with super ties, I'm amazed that this show is still going on!
