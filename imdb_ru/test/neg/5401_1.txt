I saw it on Sci Fi, and, looking back, I'm not sure how I actually managed to view all of this. This is a complete trash. This is not film B, this is film “D” at best. <br /> <br /> In fact, this grim reaper on a horse (and sometimes not on one) kills everyone in his path somewhere in the Midwest of America. Many people have disappeared (actually killed), and a bunch of inappropriate types of specialty soldiers are looking for them. The best part of this movie, I tell you now, is really cute girls. Let me now spoil it by telling you that everyone except the least handsome ones is chopped off their heads, cut, smashed into pieces, or beaten so hard with a gun, they blew up that the head explodes. This is not a spoiler ... The blood in this film is excessive and truly grotesque. It also serves no real purpose. <br /> <br /> That's what's good: the scenery looks good, the actors sometimes work well, the costumes and props, some of them are decent. <br /> <br /> Everything else you can think of sucks. A lot of bad in editing. Sometimes he just switches from a quick scene to a quiet and inactive scene. Sometimes characters do incomprehensible things, and they always fall apart, but not even as much as the viewer can follow. It seems that they fall apart without realizing it among themselves, but they all seem to know that they fall apart all the time and that’s fine, even if they are in a really dangerous situation, and bodies are everywhere and people die right and left. . There is nothing believable in this film, most of it is inconsistent and confused, and I don’t quite understand how this immortal, indestructible killer of the bad guys managed to be stopped in the end, and, frankly, I don’t care silly, ridiculous and silly nonsense, and I don’t really want to list it all here. And they are all so serious throughout the test, when it’s almost ridiculously bad ... just awful. <br /> <br /> This film is a waste of time. There is no excuse for watching this, if only the only channel you receive is SciFi, and you are not tied to the seat in front of the TV. But if you are not connected, you'd better write a crossword puzzle, throw a frisbee or just think. There are many much better movies B that you can watch. <br /> <br /> My senior year in high school, my friend and I, in visual communication and class, signed a long video for our own movie (There was no full-fledged movie, just a very long trailer), and we did a better job of filming and editing the play with the premiere. It was a better work than this movie. It really says something about it, and I’m puzzled and worried about why Sci Fi showed something like this when there are so many good low-budget films that they can show. <br /> <br /> The only film I've ever experienced was that it's worse than this on Raptor Island (another brilliant work in SciFi) - although it had a smoother and more understandable flow than in this film - but it's very close and definitely the second on my list of worst films I've ever seen,
