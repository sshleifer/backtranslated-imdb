Teenage Exorcist is one of those horrible movies for video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment because of the sexual antics with low brows, youthful humor and empty writing. This film gives exactly what he was trying to deliver. We are talking about a girl who moves to the house where Baron de Sade (hmmm) once lived, and finally turns to him through his own inner demon. Her sister and son-in-law together with the Irish priest, her boyfriend and the pizza delivery man are trying to save her and exorcise her demon. Well, not so much in terms of horror or expectation. In fact, one line from the film pretty much summarizes what to expect. Mike (the girl's son-in-law) tied her up (by the way, her name is Diana, played by Brink Stevens) after trying her sister's chainsaw. He removes the gag from her mouth and says something like, "This is not the last gag we will see tonight." Indeed, it was not. The special effects are stupid and poorly handled, and the film uses it, playing on its comedic appeal. Some lines and situations are fun. Robert Quarry, the old count of Jorg himself, really steals his scenes like an Irish priest. He is rude, yelling about Bible verses and singing Irish songs. However, you know that you are in trouble when Eddie Disin gets the maximum score. Disen has his own jokes, and he also has a couple of pleasant moments, but the material is too worn to be something more than just a teenage sophisticated filler of time. Michael Berryman from The Hills Have Eyes also has a short but interesting cameo in the film. As for the other tragedians, they are all pretty good at the fact that they are rather mediocre. Stevens is good in fishnet stockings and French-cut panties, but don't expect too much from her. Elena Sahagun plays her sister, and she shows a little more than Brinke (by the way, a very nice young lady) and Brinke plays for a few miles. Her husband, played by Jay Richardson, demonstrates his ability to act and be funny among mediocrity. Again, a good movie to spend a little time not to think further. If you are a fan of Robert Quarry, look at least for his performance.
