The only mystery in this film was how it was done. The British film industry must make films that people really want to watch, rather than hoping to get taxpayer money (a'la BBC) to keep the Luvvies in their usual way of life, doing nothing for it. <br /> <In the film “British Films” everything was not as it should be on stereotypes, it had to be about London, where people were either smart and corrupt, or “Gangsters”, “Luvvies” or “damn cold jelly-like acne “The story script was just pathetically weak, to the extent that the policeman pulled out his phone and the ring tone was the subject of Sweeney, I was just expecting it. The whole movie was a happy buyer, Sweety / Minder ripped off. <br /> <br /> the priceless manuscript I noted was several times left behind and lost, and this is something that even with my limited street wisdom I would not carry with me in my breast pocket, anywhere, to the beach, for fights, etc. To say that Vinnie Jones is cute and that is the only thing in the film, poor thing. <br /> <br /> When Derek Jacobi entered the water at the end because he was Dickens, oh my god, what a bunch of crap, and I feel positive here
