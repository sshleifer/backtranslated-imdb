I do not believe that I have seen a horror film so badly since then ... hell, I do not believe that I have ever seen a horror film so badly One acting was enough to make one cowering. A bad game went far beyond a raw horror movie. It was just awful. And did you check these terrible special effects? When the demon (who was more like a cheap doll) came out of the wall, I could not tell if I should get scared or laugh at my ass. As a big fan of the horror genre, this film was more than disappointing. I couldn't help but notice that the director is from Portland, Oregon, which, as it turned out, is my hometown. I have to say that I am very ashamed. If I could, I would give this film a negative 500.
