... than you can easily notice the biggest mistake in the film. What was the motive? The details of the killings were used, but were never explained. I think that the team is too much carried away by the atmosphere, and it's great, but the history is clearly not enough. No subject to follow. I think if this were done correctly, the film would have lasted a little longer, but it would have been worth it, at least for me. <br /> <br /> Casting is very good, I loved Wilson as a vulnerable Vicky. <br /> <br /> Not much to say, really. But I would really like them to concentrate a little more on the less obvious. <br /> <br />
