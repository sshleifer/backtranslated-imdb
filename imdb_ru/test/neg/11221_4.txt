I share the same opinion about the underworld as the previous comment. <br /> <br /> I spent 1.5 hours of this film, wondering what this story was about, and more importantly, why the author and / or director made certain decisions for the plot. In general, I found that the film is not balanced and consists of strange plots that (IMHO) actually have nothing to do with the film. In addition, when I write a thriller, I would say that you want your viewers to wonder about the story, and not about how it is removed ...
