This is a joke, right ?! Lynch could not get it as a TV show. He had no money, so what to do? Well, he somehow got a few dollars and "staffed" the pilot and created this mess, just mixing everything together ... How can anyone see the failed pilot on TV as a cinematic masterpiece ?! <br /> <br /> And now everyone is wondering about a deeper meaning!? Well, wake up, there is no one! As with the other Lynch series, how was the name again? Same procedure there. Create a secret, and then invent nothing. I think Lynch will repeat this concept until people realize that the emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> In Germany there is a comedian named Harpe Kärkerling. He dressed as an opera singer and "sang" several new "artistic songs." I sing complete nonsense like this: <br /> <br /> "Wolf. Lamb. In the meadow. Hurrs!" <br /> <br /> Now this is a classic. <br /> <br /> Anyway, after that he discussed it with the audience. And they seriously talked about the deeper meaning of the wolf / lamb relationship. <br /> <br /> You people rated this movie as 8.0 on imdb.com, you could be one of them. <br /> <br /> So let's all together say: “Hurrs!” <br /> <br /> 0/10 Macaulay J.
