I was very disappointed after watching the Revenge of Pinocchio last night. I had a good feeling that it would be bad, but I did not think it would be as bad as it turned out. The wooden puppet of the murdered boy falls into the hands of an eight-year-old lawyer's daughter. From there, this is a deadly path for anyone who stands in the way between a puppet and a little girl. We have seen similar films before, that is, the series “Children's game”, which, by the way, is much better. Nevertheless, it was nice to see such actors as James V. Quinn and Todd Allen. Both of whom have worked with Kevin Tenney before. In any case, I urge viewers to check out the “Night of the Demons” and the original “Witchboard”. These are names that tend to bring out the best in Kevin C. Tenney.
