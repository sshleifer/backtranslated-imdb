There are certain scenes in this film (for example, the hero's first encounter with Shirley Eaton's supervillage), where he seems to be on the verge of breaking sexual taboos and fulfilling his premise (women want to rule the world, making men slaves), justice, but this is never is decided. The result is a film without sexuality and some manual violence. Despite the changeable plot, the film is not too bad until it reaches its climax when its lack of professionalism is rampant (terrible editing, excessive use of stock material). Worth seeing only as a curiosity. (* 1/2)
