In search of water, a young psychic woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney) stumbles upon something completely different. She discovers a chest that has been buried for centuries on her aunt's ranch. Instead of the treasure her aunt hopes for, the chest contains the head of Gideon Drew, the devil worshiper who was beheaded by Sir Francis Drake. Telepathically controlling the hired hand that opened the chest, Drew's head goes to a killer fun in search of the rest of his body ?? also buried on Aunt Jessica's farm. Although Jessica is sure that she feels the presence of evil, can she put an end to Drew's plans, and will she have time to prevent his cure? <br /> <br /> I thought I was quite familiar with most of the horrors of Universal until 1960, but this is one Universal film from the 50s, which is certainly not mentioned much. Although “That which could not die” is not what I would call a “good” film, it has something for that. Firstly, the film has some interesting ideas, and in fact it is quite ambitious. Directed by Will Cowan, by coincidence or intent, may from time to time give the film a pleasant atmosphere. And the special effects associated with the head, of course, terrible. But the whole project is destroyed by the actor. I am shocked to learn that any of the alleged "actors" in this thing ever appeared in everything. You would think that it was a “one and ready” movie for most of the participants. Kearney is the worst offender. She is terrible. Moreover, “That which could not die” could have been too ambitious for her own good. Given the budget and other restrictions, the film could not claim to higher ideas. Finally, the film ends rather abruptly. Just as things start to get interesting, End. What is it about?
