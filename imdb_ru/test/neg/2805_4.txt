I was expecting a comedy about NVA, but this is a parody. This shows the national army of East Germany in a light that does not fit, and is definitely not true. <br /> <br /> You can make a comedy about everything until the basic facts are changed. Even a comedy about German KZ is possible, as Roberto Benigni showed with the film “LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL”. <br /> <br /> The movie “NBA” will be a good comedy, because the jokes in it are generally normal. Nothing special - not funny, but enough to live with it. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that the movie turns a farce and a parody of NVA. The death machine that was ready to attack the WESTERN EUROPE together with its friend RED ARMY. An institution that used everything to get the most from its soldiers. The army, which entered the CPR in 1968 and was ready to march also in POLAND, to destroy SOLIDARNOSK. You can not make a film without showing the smallest piece of evil, or would you have done a parody of KZ, Guantanamo or 9/11 ??? Shows Osama bin Laden as a funny guy? 90 minutes about funny Osama in the camp of the Afghan Taliban, where he jokes and trains his soldiers, it would be comparable to what this film does with the NVA!
