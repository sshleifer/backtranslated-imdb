This is a documentary about homeless women. It was interesting in the sense that it was focused on women who are socially engaged - have a job and a long friendship - but are in situations where they cannot afford housing. <br /> <br /> I found that some of the women involved were interesting, but there was little attention or progress in the story. The direction and editing could not hold my attention. Of course, there were differences in the stories of these women, but the message was basically the same, and it could be told, focusing on any of them in more detail. <br /> <br /> I got to the end of the movie, but it was a rather boring journey.
