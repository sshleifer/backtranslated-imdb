I really wanted this movie. The previews looked a bit funny, but I figured they put most of the fun stuff in the previews. In this case, they not only did it, but also twisted the clips, so that they turned out to be much funnier than in the real film. I like John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Vince Vaughn, Rock, Cedric Entertainer, and so on. D. So I wanted this film to please me, but it seems he never did anything. <br /> <br /> I saw "Get Shorty" and did not really care about it. Too slow and not funny for me. This film, of course, is no better and, in any case, worse. There were many opportunities for good comedic moments, but this did not take any of them. <br /> <br /> The game was fine, but even John Travolta seemed depressed. Cedric was fine, but he was too right to be really funny. Vince Vaughn and Rock were pretty good and ready to be funny, but they just let it all pass by. I wish they had the opportunity to complete the funny things they had created, but instead just continued to go back to the same old thing and go back to setting up Vaughn and Rock, so they were funny (although they never allowed them to really deliver this highlight or comedy). <br /> <br /> In general, it was a very disappointing film, and I am glad that I only saw it on video. At least it was cheaper than the theater.
