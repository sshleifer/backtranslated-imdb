Some awards must be presented to HellRaisers: Pedigree. This is actually a full moon in a full moon. Does it have all the signs, say, of your series “Demonic toys” or “Master of dolls”, without their crazy, uh, charm? A full moon can get away with a stupid product, because they know it's stupid. These things of Hellraiser, man, they ever take themselves seriously. This increasingly stupid privilege (although not as stupid as I was for watching it) once made up for its low budgets, being stylish. Now it's easy.
