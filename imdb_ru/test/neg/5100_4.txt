River Queen is trying to capture a complex, large-scale historical narrative in just two hours. There are several breathtaking battle scenes, and the landscape of Wanganui is superbly captured. Nevertheless, the film really suffered from some bad roles - Samantha Morton (Sarah) especially seemed unconvincing. There seemed to be indecision about how this role should play - as a helpless wave thrown by fate, or as a strong, decisive character with a clear idea of ​​his fate. Kiefer Sutherland's character — Private Doyle — seemed meaningless and for the most part illegible. Irish Brogh Kaifer needs a little polishing. On the other hand, Cliff Curtis, Temuera Morrison and Raviri Pene (like Sarah's “Boy”) were well rounded and believable. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of River Quinn seemed particularly tight and hurrying. It seemed that they decided to tie all loose ends before the 120 minutes expired. For example. How the hell did Wiremu know how to find Sarah and Doyle? No explanation and very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> I went to this film with an open heart. I have not read or heard anything except its problem production. What I experienced was a jumble of New Zealand history, beautifully photographed, but ultimately disappointing.
