This film reminds me of old B-movies, but not very well. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first scene, I thought it would be a parody of one of those early SF films. The awful effect, the plastic supports and the noticeable visual effects made such an impression on me. <br /> <br /> But no, the film is really so bad. The story is complete nonsense, effects below the level of television production; even editing is a mess. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me in the theater was that I wanted to know the end of the story, although I was almost sure that it would be stupid (and it was). <br /> <br /> There are better ways to spend time and money.
