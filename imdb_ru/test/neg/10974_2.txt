I wonder how FLYNN could fail so much as the release of the film in 1997, when Guy Pearce successfully played the title role. It is not often that casting someone so famous is so correct. FLYNN was stumbling over the box office and did not hit the cinema screens in Australia ... even after LA CONFIDENTIAL ...! From the dazzling naked scene in the first few minutes (presumably Guy Pierce) FLYNN begins a rather strong and interesting beginning. Unfortunately, FLYNN runs out after about the first 35 minutes and with Hammy Steven Berkoff entering the circuit around New Guinea (looks and behaves as if he wanted to play Klaus Kinsky in FITZCARRALDO), the film begins to resemble a TV show and not a big movie biography. Believe it or not, but after about 70 minutes, itâ€™s boring and you are happy to see it again. But such a promise! Pierce Flynn! But the film caused a rebellion at the box office and, unlike Bounty, sank without a trace.
