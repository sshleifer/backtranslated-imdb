Definition of a documentary: A work, such as a film or television program, that presents political, social or historical topics in actual and informative form and often consists of real news films or interviews accompanied by narration. The keyword here is informative. I love “They can be giants,” and almost did not recognize anything about them. <br /> <br /> Interviews with all the celebrities were almost useless. I don't care that Sarah’s vowel thinks of anyone, and Sid Stroh was totally annoying. And do people who read TMBG texts listen as if they were supposed to be fun / interesting? It was neither. I think it was a problem: the film spends time discussing TMBG love of coffee. So what?? Millions of people love coffee. Was the presentation of the material funny? Not! There were hints that both men were married, but this was never discussed. What about the solo material they did? What made them do it? Questions of this type are not considered and do not receive an answer. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on with negatives. I found the Dial-a-Song segment very interesting. If you want to learn about They can be giants, just buy a few CDs and listen. Seriously. This film is a huge disappointment. I can't believe that so many people gave him 10. Incredible.
