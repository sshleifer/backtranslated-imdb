There are NO redemptive qualities in this film. They did not check a single fact - NOT ONE of ... nothing. I'm sorry for Larry Miller and even more sorry for his agent for not being able to find a more suitable place for him. <br /> <br /> All adults are idiots. The effects are gentle and devoid of any sense of reality. Music, frankly, cheesy. The plot is incredible. <br /> <br /> I want to see something good in your family, see something else. Spend some time and check for mold in the attic. My ten-year-old child mocks this film while we watch it. Unfortunately, he realizes that not every movie is worth watching.
