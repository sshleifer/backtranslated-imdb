DEAD MANTIS will certainly not scare anyone, but from a sci-fi programmers point of view, this is better than most. A volcanic eruption at the south pole thaws a giant prehistoric mantis at the north pole. The military go missing. Dr. Ned (William Hopper is the son of Hedda Hopper and best known as Paul Drake in the television series Perry Mason) called on i.d. the creature - but by this time the creature ate up several Eskimos and is on its way to the Washington Monument. <br /> <br /> About a third or more of the film consists of video footage: old government educational films, military men in radar halls, on airplanes - and you believe that the Eskimos are going to sea? Which, of course, explains why the film attacks the Eskimo tribe. ("Hello guys! Do you think we can work with this?") Mix minor special effects, awkward dialogue and some sexist views, and you are ready to go ahead. Not as original as the “Monster that defied the world”, but the lovers of the 1950s Big Beetle will like it - and the children will have a good time throwing popcorn at the screen. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
