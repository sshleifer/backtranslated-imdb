“Thunderbolt” is probably Jackie Chan’s worst film since Защит Defender ’in 1985. Yes, I know that no one watches his films for their stories, but the plot of this film is unusually lame, even by its standards, and while the battle choreography In accordance with its standards, the battle scenes (as many as two of them) are destroyed, as others have mentioned, frantic, distracting camera work. Even the most serious Jackie Chan fans should not worry about this insulting, meaningless trash. Anita Yun's sweet and cheerful performance is one of the few virtues. For a good "serious Jackie," I recommend "Criminal History." (* 1/2)
