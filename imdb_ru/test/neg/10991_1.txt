As stated in other comments, this may surprise those who have not seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica. But you've already seen the delicacies, there is nothing new in this film. I thought Delicacies were great when they came out, but this film arrived too late to be interesting. I don’t think this is a worse movie than Delicacy, but it’s boring to watch it now, as it would probably be possible to watch Delicacy again. There is no point in the film, nothing that really matters or stays with you. There may be a distant resemblance to the films of Kusturica, but he is indeed in a different league, so you better go see his films than spend time on Tuvalu.
