I was shocked, there were 18 pages of good reviews. It must be one of the worst films, especially considering that it was recommended. I have to admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this film made him worse in the sense that he tried so hard to be clever that made me wear out to watch it. <br /> <br /> The concept of the film is comparable to the Week of Listening on American Idol. You look, because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew that there were no bad actors in this movie. So how funny would it be if good singers tried to convince them that they shouldn't come close to the American Idol test? It would be meaningless, because this film was. <br /> <br /> The use of improvisation is overrated. We were all in an environment where a group of friends got to their feet, and all with tears in their eyes. I feel this is improvisation. Improv cannot be turned on just because the camera is rolling, as this film proves. If you like this improvisation show organized by Drew Carey, you will probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> In general, the jokes were bad, the improvisation was sophomore, and the excessive actions of the Guest and the company were polite. ... and these are my compliments of this nonsense. If the guy who plays the trumpet And the kettle on the drum at the same time, you laugh, good. For me, I prefer more rash things, such as “I love Lucy” or “Hee-Hou”. <br /> <br /> But remember, I think SNL lost its humor in the 1980s, so you might like this G humor. I kept waiting for someone to identify himself as the keeper of the zoo, and then tell us that there is no zoo in the city. This is the humor you can expect. <br /> <br /> My only wish was that I could give it a minus rating.
