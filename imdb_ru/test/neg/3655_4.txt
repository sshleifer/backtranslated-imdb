The guy mentioned in the court for 1.5 hours, wasted from his life, I can not disagree with that. The film began as a sort of cool project, and ended in a dark room. whenever girls, where they are completely naked, magically appeared in the light, I know that I will not write a script or say anything about it. But this one sounds like a bad reworked copy of the saw with a bad finish. Thinking about the person who actually wrote this story is nauseous. This is really a shocking film, I can not say that it is terrible, because it does not exist. It is just the cruelty and violence that made me sick. It's really unpleasant to watch a movie without end, it's like a blow, in your face. the film is ready, now you can go home. <br /> <br /> minuses -camera -light (altru, I think it should be so) -controllable-nauseous <br /> <br /> minus -it is real on your face -it was active in my opinion - sucks You are in <br /> <br /> In general, the film is NOT my taste of the film. Weder wanted us to know that such things happen, and this man wrote his little fantasy. If you have ever seen movies seen? they all had a moment of consolation in this, something to hold on to. This ? not. Maybe it's just me, I'm too soft, but this film made me shiver, and the story is very short, the sick man slowly kills the girls. But the actors sucked you in this film every beat, every cry that you could almost feel. <br /> <br /> And honestly, I had to quickly judge it, is it a terrible movie? No, it is not. This is an exaggerated example of reality, it is as real as possible. But do not watch this film if you expect a big secret or a real plot, or even some kind of story. the man starts the girls in the dark room and kills them one by one, that's all.
