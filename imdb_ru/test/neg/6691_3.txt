Stars: Hayden Pantyor. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of films with the same plot, and this film simply paraphrases. A white girl populare enters an ethnic school, does not fit, soon becomes accepted. There is no originality in this, as well as laughter. He uses so many old badly executed jokes, which is annoying. I don’t know why they think it’s a good idea to make a sequel for mediocre movies, but it’s not. With that said, it’s a positive thing that all the people in it are competent enough actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> My rating: * out **** PG-13 for language and sexual humor.
