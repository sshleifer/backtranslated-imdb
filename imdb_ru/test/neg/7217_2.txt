If I had never seen the first Road House, then I think this film could get another star, but even then it makes it 3 star. However, I was very surprised by the relatively high rating that he now has. <br /> <br /> In fact, I could not finish this film because it was painful. Where it went wrong (at least, the most obvious way) is that it largely runs parallel to the original, although the original story is still referred to. It does not make sense and does not work. Besides, acting is weak ... I never felt like I was in a movie, but I felt like I was watching people play. Even good actors like Busey do not work, perhaps because of the script or, perhaps, because of awkward editing. The strangest thing is that the movie is similar to the movie of the mid-90s B, but shot at 06. I'm not sure why, but again, for some reason, this often happens with sequels. The music, the appearance and the overall feeling remind me of films that you saw 10 years ago on Cinemax late at night. The strangest thing is that I also expect Ja Rul to come at some point ... often this reminds me of more modern films with rappers as actors. <br /> <br /> The most annoying is the love interest of the girl, whose character looks like a complete breakdown from the character Lois Lane in Smallville, which is also quite annoying. And let's not forget the most bizarre sounding “southern accents” that I have heard since the Walk the Line. I understand that this is a common phenomenon in the cinema, but no emphasis at all will work better than trying to sound as if you are from that universal hit parade on television, where any of any southern state (or KY and WV) sounds exactly like that same Of course, people in desert cities in AZ sound the same as people in the southeastern states that are more than 2000 miles away. It was graceful 10 years ago in films B, whence came the technique. Why do writers / directors make such decisions? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: I really would not recommend it if you are a Road House fan or if you like good movies. In addition, if you have not seen it, do not spoil it by seeing this version in the first place. The original Road House was one of those random classic things that people love and watch over and over. It was an unexpected success, such as “American graffiti”, “Stunned and confused”, and more recently “Office space”, “Quickly and violently” (only the first!) And “Napoleonic dynamite”. Why did they spoil it !!! ??? <br /> <br /> They should not have made a sequel to Road House, except for the high-budget version with suitable actors / director. Of course, you can never surpass the original (for example, “Bad News”, “The Longest Yard”, etc.), But at least, if you do it right, it will be presentable, as in the case of examples, which I mentioned. But doing a low-budget, non-networked, self-sufficient release of Road House is a crime.
