This film does not respect the time of the viewer. It takes 15 minutes of history and stretches it for 95 minutes. To achieve this, they must use a very slow narration and make everyone run around with some kind of incredible insane longing. By the time this film showed something interesting in the plot, I didnâ€™t care. The problem is not in action, but in stimulation. The story is just weak. Jim Carrey is a capable actor, but his attempts to introduce light humor into a serious role are simply irrelevant. His style of humor is not general, so he looks like a diluted version of himself. The number 23 causes deep grief and disappointment for people in history, but justification for this is never logical. At best, it's just a little interesting. Jim Carrey has much more ability in a serious role than in this film. Do not waste your money seeing it in the theater. Rent this movie if you have trouble sleeping. If after 10 minutes you are still awake, then you like it more than me. I was not interested in the lighting and artistic aspects of film making. A lot of passive visual charm was thrown at the viewer with lighting or effects, and this slightly improved the already weak story.
