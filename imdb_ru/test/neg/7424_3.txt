The plane with employees of a large biotech firm, including the daughter of a CEO, falls in a dense forest in the northwest Pacific. When the search and rescue mission is canceled, CEO Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) gathers a small disparate group to carry out his own search and rescue mission. But what is Knowles looking for and trying to save, and what follows them and watches them in the forest? <br /> <br /> Oh, what a mess in this movie! It was a shame, because, on the one hand, Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favorite actors of the modern genre, starred in it, and on the other, it could be a good movie. He suffers from two major flaws, and they are probably both to blame for the writer / director Jonas Quastela - this film (which I will call nicknamed “Sasquatch”) is perhaps the worst montage I've ever seen next to Alone. in the dark (2005), and Castell’s standing advice to the actors was: “Okay, let's try it again, but this time I want everyone to talk to each other, improvise non-sectarian and generally try to be as annoying as possible.” <br /> <br /> The potential was there. Despite the plundering aspects (any material related to the plane crash clearly attempted to crack The Blair Witch Project (1999), and any material related to the title monster is Predator Predator (1987)) , Ed Wood's exposition and ridiculous dialogue. The plot had promising and potential thin and mountains much less saccharine overtones. The monster costume, as soon as we see it, was more than enough for my tastes. A mixture of character types wandering through the forest could be great if Quastel and his colleague Chris Lanning abandoned the stereotypical mark from 11 to at least 5 and would spend more time exploring their relationship.The monster's “lair” had a good production design, in particular, decorating a corpse ala more primitive Jeepers Creepers (2001). If it were edited well, then there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could be easily effective. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about Sasquatch is the number of mistakes made: for some reason, Quastel thinks it's a good idea to separate the dialogue scenes that occur within a few minutes of each other, in real time, so that instead we see a few lines of scene A, then several lines of scene B, then again A, back B and so on. . <br /> <br /> For some reason, he considers it appropriate to use frequently used black screens between dialog fragments, regardless of whether we need the idea of ​​an indefinite period of time between irrelevant comments or irrelevant comments, it seems, anyway, appear one after another in time. <br /> <br /> For some reason, he doesn’t care if the scenes are shot in the morning, in the afternoon, in the middle of the night, etc. He just cuts. them at random. In this regard, the scenes we show seem randomly selected. Important events either never or barely appear, and we are stuck on too many meaningless scenes. <br /> <br /> For some reason, he left the cave art scene in a film where he either needed more exposure to justify getting there, or just cut it out because it’s not so important (intelligence the monster and “humanity” could easily be shown differently). <br /> <br /> For some reason, the whole character exists - Mary Mancini - remains in the script, even if she is redundant <br /> <br /> for some reason, we suddenly go to an extremely soft core porn scene , although the motive is never repeated again <.. br / <br /> For some reason, the characters continue to call Harlan Knowles "Mr. H", as if they were stereotypes of Asian servants. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Kvastel insists on using the Blur Cam and Distorto-Cam for monster attack scenes, although the costume doesn’t look that bad and it would be much more effective to put fog in a fine filter or something else other than bad cinematography. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but you understood. <br /> <br /> I really wanted me to like this movie more than I did. ?? I am a fan of Henriksen, I am intrigued by the subject, I liked the situation, I like to travel on foot, and this is basically a film about tourism at the same level - but I just can’t . Every time I thought that "from now until the end will be better," Kvastel made another terrible step. As a result, my score was 3 of 10.
