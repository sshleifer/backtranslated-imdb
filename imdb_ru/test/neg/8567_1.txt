The film is not unusual. In fact, this is an insult to the horror genre. Nothing in this is horrible ... even close to the terrible threshold ... <br /> <br /> This is just another case of "another teen horror movie" - one of them, and you saw them all. The first few minutes in the film, and you will know what will happen next. Worst of all, the script is more crude than the last part of a scary movie. It would be better if it was written in Spanish. And do not make me start with internal jokes and raisins. <br /> <br /> Although I will make a little gratitude for the special effects. But believe me, like in any other horror movie filmed in Hollywood, CGI and special effects have little effect on the ability of a horror movie to scare. In fact, this only exacerbates the situation. <br /> <br /> There is little to see between the recently appeared Anita Brim and the eerie location in this film.
