I attended the screening of the film “Cooler” at the Toronto Film Festival this year. While the other reviews I read seem generally (and mysteriously) positive, I have to tell you, without any offense, to grind that this film is inconceivable, unspeakably bad. William H. Macy and Maria Bello's very bold and frank speeches were terribly omitted in what is probably the least sharp, most clichéd scenario that has received the green light in recent years. I don’t know how bad the Brown Rabbit was, but I’m sure he couldn’t have reached the depth of Dante’s style like this one. No matter how courageous their performances may be, perhaps the bravest that these otherwise brilliant actors have done is entrusting themselves to such a horrible director and horrible script. <br /> <br /> He must be very good in the meeting room, because he should never have been allowed to be within a hundred yards of the camera. The dialogue is so embarrassingly contrived and clumsy that I really turned red during the show. I am saddened that Macy's talents were completely squandered in the hands of someone whose leadership is as incompetent as his writing. <br /> <br /> Watching such talented actors like Alec Baldwin working in Cramer’s horrific screenplay and in the same vein. it felt like a seal was beaten to death - I felt anger, helplessness and nausea at the same time. Although I am always glad that there are investors and industry people who are ready to take risks with fancy scenarios with interesting prerequisites, this picture was a complete fiasco. Kramer could not be more cruel to these actors, if he himself took the steel pipe on his knees. I hope that for the sake of all of them, it will be possible to avoid such humiliations in the future. Macy wisely dived through the side door and didn’t even look around. Unfortunately, it seems that the bad luck of the protagonist was wiped from the face in the worst way. Anyone who is used to quality independent people is likely to find it completely unbearable.
