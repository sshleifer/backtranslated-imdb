And I am afraid that I can not imagine why. This is really a terrible and extremely boring movie. In a sense, this is reminiscent of early science fiction, when each set was cut down at a Hollywood party from what lay around. From a tiny and unconvincing set (snipers, it seems, at a distance of about ten meters), apparently made of plaster, to actors who are also obviously made from plaster with “funny” stereotypes, drawn thinly from above, to a strangely warm pool in a frozen cave to the survival of actors , not affected when medium-sized artillery shells exploded a few meters in an open area, and finally, a terrible scenario that looks more like a study guide than a film ... I really can't say how of boring. Even being able to see if young James Dean survived was not enough to keep me under observation for more than an hour. It really should be avoided at all costs.
