When someone thinks that Carson McCullers is one of the outstanding literary figures of the 20th century, it seems that she lacks the talent to destroy one of her stories, but this film shows that it can be done! How do actors embed their way into directors? Wooden, tasteless, not sympathetic, completely at odds with the poetic sympathy for McCuller's writings, my jaw dropped in horror and disbelief that such confusion in the film could ever find finances and patrons. The only distinguishing features are moderately good acting (although this suggests that Vanessa Redgrave seems to constantly reproduce almost the same performance regardless of what character she plays), and some good cinematography in some places, but otherwise it's a bitter bitter disappointment. and could and really should have become a modern masterpiece. Simon Callow must shamefully hang his head and act!
