Please, why should Bava have to add insult to the wound, making this pathetic piece of subsequent shit? <br /> <br /> Let's start with the fact that we, the “spectators” at home, refer to the story from some unknown ding - but telling us about the consequences of the previous episode, testifying to the victory of humanity over demons, (yes, right) . <br /> <br /> I can tell you "right now" that in any case it is not so - to ever have anything to do with demons, since this is a completely new story with a completely different background. Bava, as usual, looks random, which does not even fit into the main context of the story. To act in this beyond the limits of horror and the whole concept of demons appearing through television, oh God, I do not intend to continue. See for yourself. <br /> <br /> As usual, you will be treated to ridiculous dubbing scenarios, shit that have no meaning, and, above all, unanswered questions. As is typical of a sequel that released the first batch of crap. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are one of those collectors of DVD argentophiles, then you might want to try, otherwise avoid the plague, this is not the first, so you can avoid the plague.
