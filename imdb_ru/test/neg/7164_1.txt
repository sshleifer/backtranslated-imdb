Such films infuriate me simply because they do not deserve the funding that allows them to be in my DVD player. This film is ambiguous in its jacket and even more impenetrable in the choice of actors (why does Miss Song cause a romantic interest? Do they just want an Asian there, or her unconvincingly wise character actually gives a fresh look to the story of this “message” of the film)? Approaching this film is very small, and even less when the story unfolds. But a good hour in the process, I realized that boring casting is all that an agent could find, inconclusive character research is the result of mental farting of writers, and history is amorphous and suffers from flimsy references to grief capitalism, materialism and progress in the postmodern world. By the end of this film, shortly before I nodded and missed the last two minutes, I had the feeling that “Everything turned green” is the result of “connections” in the movie world - someone with a very small talent knew someone with very few directing skills, knew someone who had absolutely no marketing sense (but with a lot of one-time ego), and jumped out of this boring and ineffective attempt at whims and stupidity with conscience. And this is what drives you the most - how many infinitely better scenarios were transferred to this almost imperceptible joke? Skip this movie and feel good for it.
