The Polar Express was a terrible movie. What makes this film worse is hypocrisy to present itself as an innocent, sweet and harmless fairy tale for children about the “true” meaning of Christmas. I never read the book of Chris Van Allsburg in the form in which she was inspired, but the most disappointing that she was filmed by Robert Zemeckis, by the same person who shot the great film “Who Framed Roger Rabbit?”, An excellent film in which he It proves that animation can be appreciated both for children and for adults alike, although in this film it seems that he was a victim of his own ambitions and attaches too much importance to creating an impressive level of detail than an interesting story. I am sorry to say this, but the Polar Express has as much artistic level as a video game or toy advertising campaign. Everything in this film seems so lifeless: the characters may look like people, but they have nothing to do with life, and they have an evil touch in their eyes. <br /> <br /> But the worst ... is the “message” in this film. You could see it in some parts of the film, and believe me, it was disgusting. Take, for example, one scene where one child refuses to enter the Polar Express. Notice that a character like Tom Hanks makes a gesture as if he says: "You are stupid for not accepting my offer." Secondly, when a girl says that the toys are so “warm” and similar things. All these damned movies that kids keep talking about how big the gifts will be, which Santa Claus will give them. There is even a song about gifts! The tramp is an irrelevant and weak character. And in the last scene, the character seems to “discover” the true meaning of Christmas: what will happen? what do you think ? the gifts ! Many Christmas films are close to saying something similar, but the Polar Express is an ode to materialism and greed. Seriously, I refuse to call it a “children's film,” because if this is what children learn, I don’t want to think what our future will be.
