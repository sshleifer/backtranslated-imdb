To call this film a complete waste of celluloid would be an understatement. <br /> <br /> The action was unconvincing, to say the least, especially from actor Craig Fong, who could not act more harshly. As for the story ... well ... what a story ?! The “film” is nominally about Harry Lee, a Malaysian of Chinese descent, who returns home after deviating from each course he has taken and trying to create a group. <br /> <br /> In a movie there is always a cliche. You can think about sex, tension among the band members and a small amount of racial tension. <br /> <br /> The problem is that even with a theme that was adequately covered even by the most amateur directors, this film is everywhere, and it seems that all this was invented with parts that would make the hair of even the most seasoned reviewers stand on end . <br /> <br />
