I read all the novels of Dave Robishau and I believe that James Lee Burke is my favorite modern science fiction writer. I also visited New Iberia and most of Acadian to better present the situation in most of these books. Needless to say, I was really looking forward to seeing “In an Electric Fog,” especially since I thought that Tommy Lee Jones would be as stunning as Robishaw. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed. The story was very changeable; the interaction with the "ghosts of the dead of the Confederation" was superficial and lost the influence and nobility that it added to the book; and Tommy Lee Jones was depressed, indifferent and difficult to understand as DR. The best way to describe this forgettable movie is to add my “same” to the previous user comment that this movie looked like one of those old movies made for television. I expected Jill St. John or Cameron Mitchell to appear at any time. <br /> <br /> Location settings were accurate, and the snapshots from time to time captured the essence of paired, violent, smoky jokes and creepy speeches over the ground graveyards of South Louisiana. It is unfortunate that the scattered presentation of the story and the performance of Tommy Lee does not correspond to the unique mood and sharp zest of the region. <br /> <br /> Next to the last comment: in the novels, Dave Robishau's nickname is called “Stripe” because of the distinct strip of silver-gray hair on one side of his head. (Just as a soprano Pauley Walnut would have looked if it had only been seen in profile.) Tommy Lee didn’t have that band in this film, probably because the editors are fans of James Lee Burke and they airbrushed the show after how witnessed the movie of Mr. Jones. bad imitation of Dave Robishau. <br /> <br /> Final Comment: Although I usually find Alec Baldwin pompous and unpleasant in most roles, he was a much better Robishaw in Heavenly Prisoners than Tommy Lee in Electric Fog. “In addition, Heaven's Prisoners is much more interesting and exciting, with evenly believable performances and a more memorable atmosphere than this new film. <br /> <br />“ In the electric fog ”is normal to watch when you feel“ growing ”and There is nothing better on TV. But then, also commercials.
