Dustin Hoffman's debut feature is not as bad as thought; a joint Spanish-Italian production, shot in Italy with a director using the pseudonym “Dan Ash” (!), is uneven, but generally entertaining and talks about a lot of dark characters looking for $ 1,000,000 hidden by gangster Cesar Romero (who, despite that a third invoice was issued to him - after Elsa Martinelli and Hoffman himself - expire before the credit sequence even swept!). <br /> <br /> Hoffman’s game is obviously far from being nuanced as in later films, but it manages to dodge embarrassment by playing what is basically equivalent to a friendly crack — an accident-prone Sicilian-American agent ( his name is Puzza, which no one seems to be able to fix) sent out by his firm to take money and say remain "invisible", but instead get into trouble forever - although in the end it turns out to be surprisingly invented revealing, finding the loot, preventing the fraudsters and winning the girl (Martinelli - Romero's daughter, who was somewhat wasted) !! <br /> <br /> However, the best moments of the film are provided by suave gangster Riccardo Garrone: apart from his potential hard-boiled persona and the cheerful use of the dialect, he is surrounded by a trio of crazy people who most often don’t prove interference with his various ideas! In addition, given the history taking place in Rome, it is strange that the policeman investigating this case is a Spaniard (undoubtedly an urgent need for a joint production transaction)! <br /> <br /> Over the years, I missed Hoffmann's other Italian comedy several times - ALFREDO, ALFREDO (1972) - I think, mainly because Leonard Maltin only assesses it * 1/2 in his “Cinematographic and video guide "... but MILLION MADIGAN gets a BOMB!); With Pietro Dzhermi, director and co-author of juicy Stephanie Sandrelli, the powers of this film are definitely more respectable, and I really hope that he will soon appear on Italian television again ...
