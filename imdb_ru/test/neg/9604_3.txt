Good! Sci-fi / horror-action movie thriller directed by Jim Winsorski, and in the final scenes we will see a cyborg with a metal head, devoid of hair, killing many people! As with any film Vinorsky, he adds a whole bunch of crazy ideas and scenes, which in most cases do not lead to anything. But "Stormtrooper" is more like a deal "two films for the price of one." On the one hand, we got the role of a drama / thriller (the film opens as such) with Carol Alt, who kills her incredibly annoying and ungrateful husband (a plot that just leads to nowhere). On the other hand, we got a part of the “runaway cyborg in a rage,” the style of “Night of the Living Dead”. With Carol and Cyborg trapped inside the house, and a bunch of special OP / bounty hunters playing the role of zombies trying to sneak into the house. Needless to say, this film is not the best. Zach Galligan (from The Gremlins) is particularly painfully ill, and Corey Feldman (in a small cast of support) is again completely lost in this film. Vinorsky even shoots one of his own films here, since I am 99% sure that he used some footage from his previous film “976 EVIL II” (scene with an exploding truck and motorcycle). Yes, it is not so good and so fun. This is only for Vinorsky fans. And I'm one of them, if you didn't know yet.
