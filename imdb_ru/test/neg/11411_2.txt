Wow. I just saw Demon Wind a while ago and I don’t think I’ll ever be the same. He is able to cause nightmares, but in fact for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> Never before has mankind seen such unreasonable changes in makeup without any reason. Or, in the same way, so many bad zombies (?) Makeup that makes you go hungry for these green marshmallows for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Or so much naked old lady, for that matter. But then there was the Shine. <br /> <br /> The plot here is so amateur that in fact it is almost as charming as the dialogues. The last shot of the film is so stupid that defies description. This is similar to how some drunken college student got together with friends and decided to give up a dialogue like Bruce Willis with (I guess?) The dialogue of the teenager from the movie Elm Street. As a result, you get an amazing sound, and it would be really funny if it were so intended. <br /> <br /> Oh, what the hey? I will still laugh. <br /> <br /> Damn, get together with your friends and look at it. But first make sure you are drunk. Or you can go crazy. Especially if you are a college student. <br /> <br /> Cheers.
