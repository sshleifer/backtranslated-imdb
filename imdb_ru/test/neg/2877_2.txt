The main plot of Marigold boasts a romantic comedy in which the film industry remains the background. American actress Marigold, played by Ali Carter, gets stuck in India. Worse, she has no money. She then decides to play a small role in a Bollywood musical so she can earn enough money to return to her country. Here she meets Indian choreographer Prem performed by Salman Khan. In essence, the film fails at the script level. Hollywood enterprise can not guarantee the quality of the movie. Marigold stands out as the best example. The artistic direction is weak and outdated. Musically Marigold turns out to be stupid. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's is far from being recognized as a worthy ear. In fact, Salman delivers his most amateur performances to date. Ali Larter is good and has a huge screen presence. Performance is also good, it is good. <br /> <br /> Good reviews of this film can be found at http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=36310.
