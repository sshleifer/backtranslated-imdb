NBC should be embarrassed. I would not let my children see it. I will definitely tell my church to stay away. This film is proof of why NBC has always been a third-level network. Producers, actors and writers have to kneel down and ask God for forgiveness for doing this fantastic job. There were no pirates. Noah's wife did not march along the deck of the ark. The ark did not have a deck. Lot was not even born when this event occurred. Have any of the participants in this project tried to read the Bible? More than two animals of each type were taken. Read the story in Genesis. How can you bring it to any screen, small or large!
