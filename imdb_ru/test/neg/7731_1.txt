Sorry, I saw this movie in the cinema when it first came out, and it was one of the few films I've ever wanted to leave early. I had no problems with the content of the drug, and I could see how this precautionary story could be strong. The problem was that the director, who worked with James Woods and Sean Young, painted the two least attractive characters I've ever seen in a movie. I hated this couple, and I wouldn't care if they plunged right into the inevitable bottom. They were not a surprise in this film. Each turn of events was so painfully obvious that I felt that I could write the script myself; although I like to think that I would do a better job. Subsequently, I heard horrible stories about incidents on the set between Shaun Young and James Woods, some kind of haunting events. It made me wonder if a terrible game had arisen due to some bad feelings and dysfunction. In any case, I call The Rise, the worst movie I've ever been paid for.
