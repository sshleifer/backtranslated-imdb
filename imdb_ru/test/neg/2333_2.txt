Well, we have a film that some people call one of the best films ever made ... but Iâ€™m sitting here and I think, damn it, crazy stories (no story), the dioulement is pretty simple, artistic nothing good! And there is nothing special in action, so if you want to pretend to be skilful, say that you like it, but if you have a real point of view, say that you do not like it, or if you explained why!
