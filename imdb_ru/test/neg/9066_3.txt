This film is not as good as I thought. There is no story at all, no characters and some kind of dialogue would be good. The effects of blood are good, and from time to time it gets pretty bloody, but nothing more than that. The opening of the man begins, and when everything ends, the girl begins. The music is a classical score and is very well suited for a film. They had to make a 90-minute version in which they could have time for character development so that we could regret the person at the opening table. And a little more information about the undertakers would make this film much worse than it is. Do not expect a scary movie, but a good, terrible movie special effects.
