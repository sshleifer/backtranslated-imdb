This is another pseudo-intellectual film "Let's make the Nazis look very bad." No doubt the Nazis were pretty bad - most of them already know that. However, this does not necessarily make every movie a good one. The presentation of the Discovery Channel "Wannsee Conference" would be much more interesting. <br /> <br /> "Conspiracy" falls into the ass between two categories: documentary and dramatic. This is not like a documentary, the film is too "staged" and the presentation is too "ordinary." This is not like a drama, the characters are too small and the conflicts are too easily "revealed." <br /> <br /> Another slogan: “One of the greatest crimes against humanity was committed a little more.” An hour. the decision was already made by the SS. The sole purpose of the meeting was to force all important stakeholders to commit themselves to the already established plan. At the Wannsee Conference, no decisions or plans were made. There were only threats and coercions (some need less than others). <br /> <br /> Finally: the film shows (though not in an exceptional form) that a person is inclined to turn to culture and aesthetics in an attempt to hide for himself the fact that he makes terrible atrocities. This is evident in most powerful "leaders" and politicians.
