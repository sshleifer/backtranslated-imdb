From 1936 to 1939, Peter Lorre shot a series of very successful films by Mr. Moto. Although technically B-movies, they were made much better than typical movies of the genre. However, Lorre was tired of making these very repetitive films, and he told his friends that he wanted to leave the series. When it was canceled in 1939, Lorre was excited, but his plans to get more complex and satisfying roles did not materialize when he moved to Columbia Pictures. ISLAND OF DOOMED MEN is one of these films, and it’s quite obvious that the studio doesn’t make much effort for the film, as I think the plot was written by penguins. Perhaps talented penguins ... but the film still doesn't make much sense. <br /> <br /> It starts with the fact that the guy agrees to be an undercover government agent. He has to penetrate the island in the USA, where something strange is wrong. Now they could easily get a search warrant. But, given that the penguins wrote the film, the agent makes a decision for the murder, which he did not commit, and spends a year in prison. He obviously hopes that he will be conditionally released on this island, since many conditionally released are sent there when they finish the term. <br /> <br /> There are a few more serious problems with this idea. First, he needed to serve him only one year before parole, but he was convicted of KILLING and refused to disclose who he really was. They would never free anyone in that case. Secondly, what if he was not conditionally released on the island? He would have spent a whole year in prison for nothing! Thirdly, why not just invite scuba divers, paratroopers or policemen in boats to the island ?! Let's talk about the contrived story! <br /> <br /> Once on the island, the agent discovers that evil Peter Lorre has created his own private prison and staffed it with boys for release on parole as slave labor. What about men who must inform their parole officers? This was never explained, but Lorre used them to mine diamonds, and they were treated abominably. Now another question that I had was that if Lorre discovered huge diamonds there, he was a very rich man. So why not just pay people for diamonds? Why create your own version of Devil's Island and brutally beat and kill people ?! <br /> <br /> In the end, Lorre gets what he, and free the slaves of the island. Unfortunately, by that time I didn’t care. In general, watchable, but rather stupid. Lorra’s career only changed for the better when he joined Warner Brothers the following year. With films like The Island of Doomed Men, I could understand why his stay in Colombia was short.
