Roomies is a story about a guy who loses everything except his incredible girlfriend and ideas about a corn dog he plans to patent and sell. Immediately, his uncle dies and leaves him with a house and a car, and he leads several roommates to help pay the rent, and gets a job. Then his girlfriend gets drunk and deceives him, so he goes and writes a book about roommates and becomes famous. <br /> <br /> 88 minutes. None of these plot details is revealed in any detail; what you read above is more or less interesting, like a movie. When his uncle dies, some sort of chest appears on the screen, and one of the potential roommates with whom he talks is quite funny for 40 seconds. The end is literally the worst I've ever seen. I want the rest of the 87 minutes of my life back! <br /> <br /> I didnâ€™t think anyone would be able to make a film with so little merit. Of course, there are rules prohibiting such things from reaching the public? The script can not be longer than twenty pages, and the budget must have been tiny, because the entire film has about 3 seats and a car. In my opinion, the only possible use for Roomies is if you are holding someone hostage and want to upset him beyond human thought. If so, turn it on again, and during the day you will have a finished disastrous crash. <br /> <br /> One and a half out of ten
