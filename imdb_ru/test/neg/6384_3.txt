I saw this film and, frankly, was completely disappointed. And in my opinion, this film lacks a heart. Honestly, I didnâ€™t care what happened to the characters by the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> There were so many things that they could have done with the film that they did not, because they were either so excited, trying to be unclear and commenting on life, or trying their best not to that the characters and the story were completely lost in all of this. I saw another picture of this director, and I liked it. But I felt that in this film there is no whim and insanity of the other, and I was wondering what the meaning, or the meaning of the film, is that there is no meaning to it. Honestly, although I did not want to tear my hair during the film, I regretted my lost time because of the sad little movie. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that some people will like this film, but to be honest, I did not.
