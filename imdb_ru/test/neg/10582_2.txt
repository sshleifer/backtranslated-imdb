The film "Superhero" (2008) - the latest in a long line over the films about the "parody", which I so despise. I wish that this film could be the death of the genre, but I know that it is not terrible enough to put the last nail in the coffin. <br /> <br /> If “Meet the Spartans” is considered the bottom of the barrel As for Hollywood films, the film “Superhero” is probably on top. Unfortunately, “Meeting with the Spartans” was actually a few miles below the trunk, and this film barely had time to see it. <br /> <br /> In the film “Superhero” a decent list of celebrities from the C-list. There are Drake Bell (a child from Disney Drake and Josh), Leslie Nilson (Airplane!), Tracy Morgan (SNL and 30 Rock) and several others scattered around. Despite the fact that he has a star power to light a 40 W light bulb, the film lacks humor. <br /> <br /> This film lasts about 80 minutes, most of which is devoted to following the conspiracy of Spider-Man, and no joke is funny. I did not laugh, did not laugh, and did not grin at all the time. <br /> <br /> I don’t watch this movie. Do not even think about it. For the love of the movie, just skip it, and maybe they won't come out with the other. <br /> <br /> ... oh, who am I kidding? They are likely to come out with another fall.
