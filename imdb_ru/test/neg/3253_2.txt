Have you heard the theory of cloning redundancy when the copy is worse than the original? Caddyshack 2 is a great example of this. They are trying to duplicate everything from the first movie. Now in several cases it works. Robert Stack is actually a little better than Ted Knight when they play essentially the same character. I really like Randy Quaid, who is no more or less abusive than Bill Murray in the original. But Jackie Mason is not Rodney Dangerfield, and worst of all, C2 demonstrated once and for all that Dan Ackroyd is one of the worst comedians of all time. I like very little in it, and C2 nailed the coffin to close its “comedic” career, as I understand it. He seems to feel the same way, sticking to a greater degree of shoe, like driving Miss Daisy and accepting the Psi factor. Other than that, it was basically “been there, made it” for Caddyshack 2. Look at the original twice, not every version once, and you get more for your money for rent.
