Sorry, but was disappointed in the film. It was very, very fast, because, I believe, you understand that it will be a long version of Pride and Prejudice, and I felt that many of the main scenes were shaded to scroll through the story. Unfortunately, the film is in such a hurry that, unfortunately, you don’t know at all and you don’t feel each character. <br /> <br /> Moreover, this film is boring. I say that with a capital 1/3 of the way, I began to yawn and could not wait for the end of the film. When I read the book and watched the BBC version, I knew how many scenes had to go before I could finally leave the movie. Mr. Darcy, whoever he is in this film, definitely cannot play. He looks too young to play Mr. Darcy. Every word that comes out of his mouth is in a hurry, as if he needs to go through a script or something like that. Where is the building located? At first he seems confused with everything. He's just weird! Everything looks worn. <br /> <br /> I tried not to compare it with the version of Colin Firth, but if you liked this version, you will most likely still be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Costumes are absolutely shocking. Where are the corsets? I know that Elizabeth is poor, but I think that she still knows how to dress like some kind of female fashion, and was not brought up in poverty. Her dresses indicate that she may be the poorest peasant in all of England. <br /> <br /> I didn’t agree with a couple of scenes in the film that I don’t think it would be considered right in that society so that men could do such things, to be honest, Mr. Bingley, who has wealth should know about it better. There are some things that say they sound too modern for the period in which this film begins, and not at all like Jane Austen. The character Bingley is shocking, for me he behaves like a simpleton, and not like a character you can love and respect. How about this laugh of him !!! I, Wickham, have almost no presence, and Mr. and Mrs. Hearst and several other characters do not exist at all. Cyrus is fine, but it is not the same.
