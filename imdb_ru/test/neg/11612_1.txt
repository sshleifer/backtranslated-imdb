The storyline seemed good, the actors were good, the film was supposed to be fine. But it definitely wasn’t - it didn’t lead us to anything, <br /> <br /> the scenes are strange. Perhaps this was to create something new to make us think <br /> <br />. At least he did: where is the rest of this movie? For me, this <br /> <br /> is a waste of money, time and talent. Someone may want to see this <br /> <br /> for curiosity, to see if they can understand it. Another one that I personally <br /> <br /> would not recommend to anyone.
