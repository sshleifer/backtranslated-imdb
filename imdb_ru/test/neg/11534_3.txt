As a fan of Henriksen (I liked him on the Millennium series) and, of course, Lamenso “The Apostate” Lam, I expected at least SOMETHING from this film. Unfortunately, the plot is predictable, the game is bad, and the computer graphics used for most tricks do not work. Sometimes it even seems that they shot several shots from the Microsoft Flight Simulator. <br /> <br /> Cinematography also sucks. Unnecessary flashy camera work at the beginning only detracts (from the cheese dialogue) and gives the film a cheap, made-for-video look. He works in hip-hop films and films of Jet Li, but in this film he seems out of place. <br /> <br /> I would have liked this movie 10 years ago. I was 11 then.
