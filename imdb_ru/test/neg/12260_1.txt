I do not understand why this film was released, it was like what you show your friends after you borrowed the video camera she bought in 1987 from her mother. I work in Australia and work in a video store in the UK and I thought that if an Australian film came to our store, everything could not be bad ... boy, I was wrong! <br /> <br /> If someone writes a good comment about this film, he either lies, or the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The picture was bad, the sound was HORRIBLE, and the acting, oh, the acting, was the MOST ARTISTIC, acting in the HISTORY OF THE FILM. <br /> <br /> I am embarrassed and offended by the fact that they used the word “Australian” in the title, because I am proud to be Australian, and this film can be seen in other countries, and it can give people the wrong idea . <br /> <br /> Please, everyone who reads this and saw this film, take the time to find other Australian films to watch, because you can choose any of them, and it will be better than this one. <br /> <br /> I could have made a better film if I took the camera, made my own, but for an hour I ate the movie, waited for it to pass through my body, and then threw what appeared on television. .. no offense. <Br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK THIS FILM !!!!!!!!!!
