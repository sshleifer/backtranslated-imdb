I am a big fan of the Doctor Who series until now, but I was very disappointed when I started watching this new series. <br /> <br /> Children under the age of 15 or even better under age 10 will probably enjoy the most, and perhaps new fans who have not seen any of the original series, but as far as fans of the original series, will find that this series misses most of the charm made by the original series. So great that David Tennant made me evaluate how much Christopher Excellestion was a doctor in the 1st season. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this series only to those people who have not seen much of the Original series, people under 15 years old, and EXTREMELY DEADLY fans, everyone else will just laugh and swear words about Russell T. Davis spoiled one of our favorite TV shows.
