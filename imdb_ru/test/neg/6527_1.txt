Let's do one thing straight; That was bad! So Rottenness is not captured in anyone's memories. <br /> <br /> Constantly repeating storyline (which constantly recycles not only jokes, but also storylines and characters.) A typical storyline looks like this. ; Sue (mother) opens the episode with reference to how she loves her little son, but it smells awful (as if THAT is not getting old! Har-de-bloody har!) , says she thinks she’s awesome because she is Aussie, while everything / everything else that does not suck before disappearing before the end of the episode. (little mercy) <br /> <br /> The rest of the plot revolves around how the father (Gary) entered into some disagreement with Sue and the fact that he talked to members of his group for advice on how to figure this out. <br /> <br /> The phrase “words fail me” is an old one, but this is the most truthful word. This is so incredibly bad! So terrible that I would like all traces of its existence to go to the lowest depths of the North Sea, and life could go on. <br /> <br /> Although I’m sad to see someone as good as Sally Bretton (good actress, I like her) makes a parody of herself, Ardal O Hanlon (My Hero aside) has the ability to be quite funny - but not here - and Ben Elton, distinguished by so many good things, somehow manages to come up with this ... thing, then comedy is in very serious trouble!
