American Graffiti is one of the best films ever made. I have seen it at least 30 times, and every time I see it, I have an emotional impact. (I graduated from high school in 1962.) <br /> <br /> However, “More American Graffiti” is one of the worst films ever made. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe in this than everyone who is associated with a great original film has been associated with this terrible sequel. Part of the film in Vietnam was very inaccurate. (I served in Vietnam for 18 months in the 101st airborne division.) <br /> <br /> There was nothing worthwhile about this film. <br /> <br /> If someone wants to declare himself against creating sequels to great films, More American Graffiti would be a prime example of what could go wrong.
