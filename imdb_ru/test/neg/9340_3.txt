I found the movie a bit predictable and boring, but I'm 14. <br /> <br /> I was really annoyed by my little cousin because she was very hyper that day, so I watched the movie on Disney and put it on and said she watch it. <br /> <br /> she is 6 years old and she liked the film, she didn’t like some bits, but I still didn’t understand that you were Eddie too, the star of the video shoot I thought it was Jordan's video ?! but she really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I noticed that in the end Jordan did not play the guitar, but never. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a movie if you are seriously bored or you are 10 or less. <br /> <br /> this calmed my cousin. <br /> <br /> although she's all I sang until the end of the day.
