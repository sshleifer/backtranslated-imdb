I came out of this film, and I did it only once with the Australian film Sweetie about 20 years ago. After about three minutes, I felt that I had killed the operator and simply could not believe that this film was really shown somewhere and - guess what - was nominated for two independent Spirit awards. What kind???? Regardless of how realistic the dialogue can be (I will NEVER use the word "dude" again!) - who wants to listen to these conversations? I don't go to the movies to get annoyed, but that's all I have. The only good thing I encountered was the realization that if this film could go to Sundance and other festivals, anyone could. Well, wait, this may not be a good thing after all ...
