Star Trek V definitely deserves the dubious recognition of the weakest Star Trek movie. Despite the actors' good acting efforts, he suffered from a general lack of funding from Paramount Pictures. Paramount Pictures was not thrilled with this movie at the very beginning. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the film crew of the Enterprise enjoying its long beach holiday as a word to save the Earth from a complete ecological catastrophe. Their access to the shore ends when the excitement occurs on the Nimbus III, the Planet of the Intergalactic World. Captain Kirk and the Enterprise arrive at the Nimbus III only for their ship to be captured by Sibok, Spock's half brother. Sybok is brainwashing the crew of the Enterprise and has set itself the task of suicide to meet with "God" right behind the Great Barrier in the center of our galaxy. Then Captain Kirk must find a way to regain control of his ship and repel the pursuers of the Enterprise from the Enterprise. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in the film is action and director. William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelly, Lawrence Lakinbill and other actors give good results. William Shatner is also doing a good job with the film. <br /> <br /> However, the film suffers from a general lack of enthusiasm and funding. At first, part of Shibok was originally offered to Sean Connery, but he refused. So Lawrence Lackinbill got the part. Secondly, many of the special effects were severely reduced ... reducing the entertainment potential of films. Thirdly, the scene depicting the arrival of the Great Barrier, left much to be desired. Finally, the romance between Scotty and Uhura didnâ€™t make much sense at all in this film ... considering that up to this point there had never been such a novel in the Star Trek universe, and it was never explained how such a novel could materialize suddenly between Star Treks IV and V. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very weak film. Maybe you should just skip this movie and go to Star Trek VI. In the end, the actors and the team forced Star Trek VI to partially help themselves out after their defeat with Star Trek V.
