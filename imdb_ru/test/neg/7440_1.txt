It's a shame that they did not trust the original enough to rely on it. <br /> <br /> But RoboCop 2 takes great ideas, imagination and character of the original and replaces them with all the stereotypes that sequels offer. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the advertisement was nice and so was the scene that follows (like the beginning in “Guys and Dolls”!), but apart from the flash of thought here and there, this is one film that is slow, dirty fatigue down going nowhere. br /> <br /> Ideas are introduced and then discarded, interesting characters from the original hardly get any time on the screen here, most of the new characters (Cain, Juliette Fax) are so boring that they do not stand, no matter what. film and then there is a tone. <br /> <br /> In The Blessed Original, Paul Verhoeven knew how to deal with this attitude, where, if you check the attitude and sensitivity of a good comic, even the most repressive violence would be interesting. Kershner (although he filmed the sequel to Star Wars) does not. And scene after scene makes you cringe, look away, or just turn it off. <br /> <br /> And what about RoboCop ?? He should be in charge here, right? But there are whole scenes in which he does not even appear, and in which scenes he is so half thought out and awkwardly written that you don’t know or don’t worry that he is partially human or partially cyborg - because he is boring. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a rapid fall from grace. Why does Hollywood make such bad sequels? Purposely? What for; filmmakers bet? <br /> <br /> Only one star for "RoboCop 2"; FX are good, but the story doesn't even try to match them.
