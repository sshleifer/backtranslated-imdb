I always say: "There is nothing better than a good movie." And I must say that it was not like a good movie! Dirty, boring and tedious. It was like one of those bad dreams that never seem to end, no matter how hard you wake up. I do not object to the concept of a film without words (i.e., entering a world of fantasy or dreams), but there must be something that captures your imagination, and not just the empty images that this film is. It seemed that there was no character development, and he jumped so quickly from stage to stage that it was difficult to make out any story. (Was there even a story?) You could say that the actors tried their best, but unfortunately bad management sabotaged all the work of the actors. It really looks like cinematic masturbation ... existing only for the pleasure of the director and no one else. A big waste of time.
