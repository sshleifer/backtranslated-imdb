A few videos in recent history have been so amateurly made like this one - at least not one that was released by such a respected distributor. Each frame of this film is a plagiarism of the best films of the past. The word “cliché” acquires a new meaning from a mediocre writer / director who must reserve his imagination for lesser masturbation efforts that do not pursue movie viewers. Helping amateur nightmare “horrors” is a whole range of inadequately capable technicians who contribute to bad cinematography, ludicrous makeup, and special effects. Unfortunately, one or two amateur actors in the film demonstrate a hint of talent that will go unnoticed because of the reputation this atrocity will produce.
