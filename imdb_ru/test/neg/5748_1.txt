First of all, I would like to make it clear that I voluntarily subject myself to watching horrible movies. I saw what I thought was the worst of the worst. In my opinion, films could not become worse than such films as D.E.B.S., Leprechaun 6: Back 2 Tha Hood and Terror Storm. Until I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> “Pirate Cinema”, without exaggeration, is the MOST ARTISTIC CINEMA IN THE WORLD. I was informed before watching that the film was really terrible, but I did not believe the statements. Believe me when I tell you that this film is just an abomination to the film. <br /> <br /> It starts with a 3-minute clip with a pirate boat, apparently in the middle of a battle with himself. “End” splashes across the screen. Unfortunately, this is not the actual end of the film. The film tells about the unpopular, awkwardly boring girl named Mabel, who carries a ghetto blaster with her and attracts ambiguous homosexual pirate boys. She is drowning and has an overly prolonged hallucination, in which she plays a poorly dressed skin that falls in love with Frederick, who, as it turned out, has just crawled out of the ocean. He may be homosexual. The king of pirates has a goose ruby ​​and a diamond. He buzzes and squeaks when he squeezes him. <br /> <br /> In this film they sing. You may get the impression that this is a funny musical. This is not true. Trust me. These are the worst songs you've ever heard, and by the end of the first original melody you will be looking for objects to break through the eardrums. <br /> <br /> Other movies have “links” here. By reference, of course, I mean "obvious robberies." The inclusion of Indiana Jones, Inspector Kluzo and the lightsaber was actually opposing. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in the best moments is painful to hear. The direction is terribly smooth, and at some point you can see a cascade in a scene that is not very well hidden. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if there is even a shadow of curiosity in your mind about this film, get rid of it. There are times when people want to see how bad something really is, but this film is not worth it. Throw it out of your head and never think about it again. If you value your mental abilities, then I beg you, NEVER WATCH THIS MOVIE.
