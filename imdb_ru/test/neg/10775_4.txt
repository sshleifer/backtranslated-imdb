As we well know, films are not staged as a direct inclusion of the story, but it is a shame when a film is created in which there is practically no correlation. I would like the director and / or screenwriter to do his research on this topic. All that makes this film, it creates a forum for hatred between people, at the same time causing alienation, which should not be. In this film, Sikhs and Muslims are depicted in a very negative estate, and the third group (Hindus) looks as if they were not in the brutal killings of people of both nations. Inaccuracies combined with a whisper of disregard for one's faith, presented by Gian Singh, were a shame for the highest format. Although on a more positive note, the actors did a great job performing their roles. Both Kristen K and Neve S played their shots exclusively. I hope that those who watch this film do not see or use it as a template for an actual historical event.
