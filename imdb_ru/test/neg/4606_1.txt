The idea of ​​this film was great. The story of a little girl facing violence (both emotional and physical) trying to cope with it and survive. What makes a movie falling apart is the terrible use of voice-over commentary and banal dialogue. Actors need to point out the most obvious things over and over. In addition, there is a very tedious, almost funny, excessive use of metaphors in voice-overs. The culmination is the play of a little girl. Nice try, but this nasty.
