When this episode was aired, I watched most of it. I think it was supposed to be a long series in the spirit of "The Fugitive" and "The Incredible Hulk", where the main character is pursued throughout the country in search of solutions to their problems. In this case, the problem of the hero lies in its progressive aging in the opposite direction. I liked what I saw from these shows. The game was good, especially the sad relationship between the main character and his wife. The problem is that they canceled it before it was finished. (or this, or I missed the latest episodes). <br /> <br /> They never had the opportunity to finish the story, knowing that it was canceled. Pof it's just gone. However, as I said, I could skip the last episodes. But my proof of the opposite is as follows: I rented the tape. Where I stopped in the series. The protagonist's wife dies in a fire initiated by the pursuit involving the famous organization Kinga Store. During the departure of the hero kidnapped. It ends with his friends, understanding that they have to go to save him from the Store. The end. The last episode. In the video: his wife does not die, but leaves the fire with him. Just at that moment, when he must be captured by the Store, he and his wife are going through a strange moment and are gradually disappearing. Cool, stupid and cheap to the extreme. They just wanted to release this video and decided to mark the ending without worrying about how bad it is. With the same success, they could show some shots of the first atomic bomb explosions. Almost Pythonesque. <br /> <br /> In the series there was a cool intro with a song of the same name by David Bowie.
