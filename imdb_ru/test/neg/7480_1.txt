Before “Last Call” with Carson Daly, my local NBC affiliate broadcast much more useful programs after “Late Night” with Conan, such as the second television show, the third “Rocks from the Sun and Carline in the City” and some comedies. There’s nothing to watch these days, because I only see Carson Daly and his terrible show. He is not a comedian, he is not an actor, he does not deserve to be famous, because he is not a good speaker or comedian. <br /> <br /> On his show on June 21, he tried to use an Internet meme called “Ricroll” on his show. He failed badly. This event confirms that Carson Daily is terrible.
