Comments posted on IMDB prompted me to watch Shark Hunter. The film was bad, but the shark was cool blah blah blah. Therefore, I rented it. Bad idea. This film was bad on many levels, and I am glad that I had the opportunity to rewind ahead. The shark itself is fine. His appearance is decent, and this is the only thing that saved this film from getting 1 (I gave 2). The game is incredibly bad, and the dialogue is just as pitiable. I did not expect much, but I was constantly surprised by this sucks. Antonio Sabato Jr. - this is some kind of biologist or scientist or something like that, I didn’t pay much attention to this. He goes down with the crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this submarine station, which the shark, of course, took out. By the way, all the scenes where someone works under water are not underwater. First of all, if they just go down to find out what happened to this station, that with all the huge tranquilizer darts, harpoons and other things. These are the things that you usually carry with you when investigating an accident? The shark theory was advanced by Antonio when they were on the road, so they did not know what they were facing. Antonio and this young college student, by the way, a terrible actress, just jump to the controls of the submarine when the submarine is in trouble. What's up with that? If everyone doesn’t undergo any additional training before graduation, I find it a bit silly. It seems that the director thinks that if the crew members work in the background, it would be nice to have someone welder in the background. I think that making metal is very important when you're on a submarine. In any case, I could go on, but I have already said too much. Bottom line: go to your local video store, rent this video, and then destroy it. Then send an email asking IMDB to delete all the recordings of this movie from your site. All memory and evidence of this film must be destroyed. We can do this if we work together.
