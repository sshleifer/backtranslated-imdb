Horrible movie. Awful game, cheesy, absolutely unreal, embarrassing anyone who played the game. For a start, this guy is not a prostitute, he would have been broken in two. As for "I score, this is my job," well, no, it is not. For an uneducated American audience, this may seem like a good movie. For me, well, it's a few hours of my life, I will never come back. I read reviews and came across one where the guy sounded like he knew what he was talking about. Then I read - <br /> <br /> “And although American rugby can never reach such a level of talent as in New Zealand or South Africa, the third in the world also has nothing to hang their heads about” <br /> <br / > All I can say is LMFAO! <br /> <br /> Continue to play American football and baseball, leave real sports to older boys.
