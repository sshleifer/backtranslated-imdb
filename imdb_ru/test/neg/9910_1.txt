This movie should be the worst movie I've ever seen. There is a reason this was done to become MOW (movie of the week). The continuity was completely wrong (palm trees in a Chicago setting, although it was filmed in Toronto, Canada), the effects left much to be desired in 2004 HEY. The Lord of the Rings had a better CGI than this. But I think they also had money for it. The budget will certainly affect the result, but anyone who calls it MORE than 2 should return to the school of film and television. Next time, remember that care and time make the classics not rush into the box office tornado or television hit. <br /> <br /> In addition, I know that networks can reuse frames from old networks or branches, but using frames from the 80s for 2004? It's hard for me to buy it.
