August 25, 2003. The League of Outstanding Gentlemen: <br /> <br /> Sean Connery has been one of the great men of all time, and I have been a fan of him since the 1950s. I went to this movie because Sean Connery was the main actor. I did not read reviews or had any prior knowledge of the film. The film surprised me a little. The scenery and sights were spectacular, but the plot was unreal to such an extent that it was funny. In my opinion, it was not one of his best films, he could be the worst. Why he decided to be in this film remains a mystery. For me, visiting this movie was a waste of time. I will continue to go to his films and add his films to my video collection. But I donâ€™t see to spend money to put this film in my collection
