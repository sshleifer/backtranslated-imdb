Uncle Fred Olen Ray once again gives us a bit of his “kindness” from Retromedia in the form of this soft Cinemax core. through a swirling whirlwind of "black hole", as clever fools put it. Pretty soon, an attractive cave girl who lived a million years ago falls within the time frame, and she makes her way to the future. Pretty soon her second half, too, sneaks into the future and paves the way through the bed of the future. <br /> <br /> Ray again arranges a tolerable (but hardly) noisy holiday, in which there is a terrible game, but some decent skin. Yes, it is hardly, but heh! If worse gets worse, it will cure you of insomnia. <br /> <br /> Reviews for S10: 1/5 or 3/10
