Mom starts at night in the middle of nowhere, like something like a wooden building in the desert. A pickup truck drives up and the evil father throws out his dissolute daughter Virginia Monroe (Claudia Christian) and leaves her there, but she is not alone because Nastor Duvalier's dark figure (Brion James) is watching her from a short distance, Virginia tries to speak, but when she smokes a cigarette under a leopard print, boots on a high thigh, high heels, Nestor grabs her by the throat and drags her into the dark. Then Nestor opens his top, turns into a monster and starts eating its insides. Virginia is the latest serial killer victim, with Lt. Carlo Hendrix (Art Evans) and LAPD confused, or at least a local television news reporter named Clay Dwyer (Marc Thomas Miller) reports. Clay lives happily with her pregnant friend Alice (Mary Beth MacDono), so his mother Emily (Gene Bates) has a spare room that she decides to rent out to blind blind sunglasses in Nestor's costume. Unfortunately for Emily, she accidentally knocks Nestor's sunglasses off, revealing that he has strange colored eyes, then Nestor turns back into a monster and bites Emily, turning her into a flesh-eating monster like himself. Nestor takes Emily to train her, they find a suitable homeless ass (Rory VanSaint), kill him and eat his courage, but Emily Clay's son witnessed all of this, and he must choose between what is right and his love for his Mother which is now just a grotesque bloodsucking and flesh-eating monster! <br /> <br /> Edited, written and directed by Patrick Rand, I thought that mom was a pretty awful movie. Looking at some of the other comments on IMDb and the list of genres that he gave, it seems many people think that mom is a comedic horror. Well, I can tell you now that I have never seen comedic elements in my mother, because there are none, unless they are very thin. The only thing I can imagine is that people see comedy in a real situation that mom represents: it turns into an old woman, turns into a monster eating flesh, and into predictable problems and emotional experiences that it causes to her son, who will find out. In the film itself, there are no jokes (other than naming a Beverly Hills prostitute (Stella Stevens)), a sense of farce, or anything even remotely funny, and, as far as I could tell, it has all been played completely straight for 90 minutes. So there is no comedy in mom, which should mean that there are a lot of horrors there, right? Wrong, mom sucks and painfully slowly looks, especially after the first thirty-odd minutes, which consist of Nestor turning into a monster a couple of times, biting Emily and showing her how to hunt for food and find out how Clay finds out. Up to this point, mom was moving at a fairly decent pace, she had some special special effects for makeup, and I was interested in it, unfortunately, mom runs for another hour, which, in fact, is emotional nonsense from which Emily’s son suffers of marriage and his being torn between the love of his Mother and the fact that she is a flesh-eating monster. This part of the film is incredibly slow, boring and boring, like dirty water, even having the courage to resort to a clichéd role changing scenario where Clay tells her mom to go to her room and stay there, locking the door behind her, telling her about herself and set the grid above window so she could not leave her room. Mom's script completely ignores the origin of the monsters and asks us to simply accept that this thing exists, without giving a single reason why we should, no matter how stupid the explanation might be, I think that some background for the monster would help. From a technical point of view, my mother is modest and cheap to look at, although I cannot say that she is poorly done, these are very average things, and nothing that is not particularly impressive, or anything with which I could laugh, to pass the time. The special effects of the makeup on the monster are fine, but they are used very quickly, they blink, and you miss them. Do not be deceived by any fancy images in the video box like mine, the monster is only three times larger in it, and all of them are at the pace of the first thirty minutes. There’s also not much blood, a severed arm, a short bowel feeding, a burned body and a hole in someone’s hand - all we get is OK, but please, Mr. Brion James, what the hell is that accent !? At least, James had the common sense to know that he was in shit and reasonably decided to be killed early in the trial, everyone else was none other than the black lieutenant, who was also a black police officer in Fear Night (1985), but you can recognize him by Die Hard 2 (1990), he did Mom & Die Hard 2 that same year ?! Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! In general, I can not recommend my mother as a horror film, and this, of course, is not a comedy, as I understand it. Very poor, very disappointing, and again, I was struck by the bizarre images in the video box with lots of pictures of cool monsters. Definitely to avoid.
