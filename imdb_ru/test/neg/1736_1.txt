The only people to whom I would recommend this film are both blind and deaf, although I am sure that the sadomasochist will like it. There was nothing in this movie; no acting, terrible music, terrible script - only power to suck any happiness out of your soul. Perhaps you are already wondering why or even how I managed to sit for an entire hour and a half of pure madness, and this, frankly, is a difficult concept even for me. First, I had to step up and down as the movie progressed, since it was very difficult for me to feel comfortable. Secondly, I just did it, without chewing on my own hand, to have something to beat myself to death by calling friends for moral support, when the plot became especially slow. The problem was that it was a matter of pride for me to finish it after the first thirty minutes, and it was a fatal mistake for me. I usually like movies to leave you with something to the end, but all you had to do was take ..... For the sake of your common sense, don't watch this movie.
