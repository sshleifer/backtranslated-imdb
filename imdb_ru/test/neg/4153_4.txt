“Beautiful Country” - a big disappointment. This does not meet my expectations. Bean, a tall, muscular guy, the son of an American soldier and a Vietnamese woman during the Vietnam War. We were told that in the early 90s in Vietnam, he was treated "less than with dust", so he fled to America in search of his American father. <br /> <br /> Looks like a brokenhearted material? Perhaps, but the show in this film. I have difficulty with the emotional connection with Bean, because the film is full of clichés, and I just don’t understand it and don’t believe it. Writing this film is a complete failure. The plot is full of holes. It captures some events on a necessary basis, struggling to evoke the emotions of the audience. We are not so stupid, and it does not work that way. Let's see what the movie is trying to do. So, you don't feel that a boat trip on Bina (yes, he was on a boat!) Is difficult enough, let's arrange a storm overnight and let the ship tremble a little. Still not touched? Fine! Make a small child suffer from heat, hunger, disease, violence with adults on the boat, I hope this will help to touch the audience. Still not touched? You are a heartless sober, let's ... Well, I do not want to give a film spoiler, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> The film is really long and slow. It never tells us why Bin didn’t go looking for his moms and dads until, in the movie, he left to look for mom and dad. What did he do 20 years before he went to Saigon to look for his mother? And guess what? He is lucky and everyone will tell him where to find the person he is looking for, and he will find someone without a scratch. I really think the Department of Homeland Security should hire those Vietnamese who helped Bean. Beautiful country? Which one of? Both Vietnam and America seem to be Bin hell.
