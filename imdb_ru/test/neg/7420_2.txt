The development of films based on real events related to cryptozoology or supernatural, has always been a challenge for directors and screenwriters. You must basically coordinate testimony, conflicting sources of information, and the creative potential of Hollywood to create something that an audience can fall into. Unfortunately, for SASQUATCH, it seems that none of this happens. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a typical film noir when the crash of a research team lands somewhere in the Cascades on a plane. From there, the research team disappears, and despite attempts by law enforcement officials and local rescue teams, they go missing for a while. While one of the passengers is walking, images similar to infrared (a la Predator) appear on the screen, which hint that the legendary Sasquatch is the cause of the passengers' fate. <br /> <br /> Kew Harlan Knowles (Henriksen), CEO of BioComp Industries and the father of one of the victims of the accident. Knowles unites his own search and rescue team with an explicit mission to find his daughter and the rest of the research team, as well as the invaluable technology lost during the accident. <br /> <br /> After Knowles' individual rescue The team is assembled, the entire film goes along the path of unpainted characters, dizzying cinema and a completely non-original storyline. I literally had to keep myself awake during this movie, as he tried to scare me to madness. The only cast member that held him was Henriksen, who doesn’t compensate for the lack of depth presented in all the other characters. The reworked sound effects were also annoying; in fact, I did not know whether I was watching a bigfoot film or grizzly bears. <br /> <br /> No storyline was so great. He was too underdeveloped, because the viewer is mostly prone to typical frightened music found in something similar to the genre. Obviously, you didn’t have to be a genius to figure out who would be taking off all his clothes by the middle of the film, or who would be the first unhappy soul that Mr. Sasquatch would spoil. As for the good moments, they are not there, and therefore I gave this film 2 out of 10.
