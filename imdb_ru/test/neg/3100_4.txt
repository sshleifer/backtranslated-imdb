Some directors are said to make small budget films look like blockbusters. Albert Pune makes small budget shots look like school A / V projects. This film was almost not enough in all departments. Virtually every scene is overreacted, “experimental” lighting and cinematography is terrible, Rob Lowe seems to equate to carelessness in acting, and the bad, crazy European-style figures stop the film at a dead end. On the positive side, Burt Reynolds copes well with what is given to him (which is not so much), Mario Van Peebles is surprisingly decent, and Ice-T adds another recent B-movie gangster. Not Pyuna's worst work (“Urban Threat”), but certainly not his best (“Evil Weapon”).
