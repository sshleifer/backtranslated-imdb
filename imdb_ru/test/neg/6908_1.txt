Hello - I usually love movies. I am 19, I have seen a lot and do not like only one or two. But this, the second one, when he finished, I had to pull my sister (who wanted to see it) by the hand, and I burst into tears of laughter as soon as I left, because it was such a ridiculously awful movie. <br /> <br /> Why it was terrible: - all cows had udders, MALE MANs with udders were especially annoying - none of the characters were unique or attractive, except perhaps the main Coyote Doug - the idea of ​​keeping cows against coyotes it’s just funny - the “funny” moments repeat and become just a sequence in order to surpass the latter - the themes of teamwork that should have been present at the end did not exist. Instead, people have the impression: well, I will take it all on myself, and in this case I was lucky that my friends decided to support me without my knowledge - all moments resembling the king of lions (as mentioned below) were beyond horror, even for a children's movie <br /> <br /> and ... worst of all ... THIS IS PARALLELED, THE KING OF THE LEFT IN EVERY ONE WAY Hyenas with Doug, the leading coyote, the equivalent of the scar) The farm goes into chaos, Odis ( the cow, although mostly Simba) wants to play, and shocked that his father is dead, believes that it is his fault (although f it was his fault), he confronts the coyotes and gets his ass, after which Doug tells him to leave, and on the verge of leaving Odis for some reason decides to go and save some chickens and his friends back up (to the surprise, of course, he leaves, not knowing that they will come to his aid). <br /> <br /> Other things taken from the Lion King: stars moving as signs, father figures related to the stars / signs in a mystical love way, the apparent circularity of how Father Ben found Odis and took care of him, and in the end, the love interest of Odis gives rise to the same experience. Birth at the end? GOOD GOD, what the hell ... and even this kind of music, which seems to be fully ingrained in the end, because it is completely different from all previous music. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is the first film that I have ever seen where I really supported the bad guys - I have never understood what other people have said so far. <br /> <br /> LOWER LINE: Don't waste your time to see this. Convince the children not to see this and look at the Lion King again. Either that, or take them to see the Ant Bully who was creative and artistic.
