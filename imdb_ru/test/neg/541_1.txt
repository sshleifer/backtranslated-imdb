This ultra low budget kitchen sink blunder is a kind of film that can only be made in the UK, because anywhere in the world the fact of the existence of a market must exist before the green light is given. Most likely, self-financing is obviously an attempt to correct important problems, but ultimately undermines the essence of its existence in that you need to ask the question: who will ever invest money in its distribution, and, secondly, if the marketâ€™s audience does not will watch buy or rent this film, why bother anyone at all? My opinion may seem unfairly harsh on a director who is working with a director for the first time, but this type of film only undermines the commercial viability and quality standards that only supported the British film industry.
