SPOILER WARNING !!!! <br /> <br /> I don’t go to high-tech films, expecting them to be 100% accurate in all things related to computers. But for some reason, even the average user “I have a computer” must assume that: <br /> <br /> 1) a computer professional with top-secret special data <br /> <br /> 2) save the primary copy of the specified data to 1.44 floppy disk <br /> <br /> 3) and do not make WITHOUT BACK-UP backups of these special secret data. <br /> <br /> Even high school students save their homework Thank God. <br /> <br /> Also, this is the worst representation of computer nerd. Despite the fact that she is very cute, we must believe that she has no friends, neighbors, a large family or colleagues who could identify her. Even the unabomber had a family that could pass it. <br /> <br /> END SPOILER <br /> <br /> These are not just minor errors that were not related to the film - these are the main plot points that feed the storyline. The characteristic was terrible, the plot is absolutely incredible, and if you have not seen it, do not worry.
