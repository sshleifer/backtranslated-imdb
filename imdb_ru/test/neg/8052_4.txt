I first watched the Kindred in 1987 along with another film called "Devouring Waves." I remember, then I hated them both, and I never bothered to look at them again. <br /> <br /> However, recently I started a crusade to collect as many horror titles of the 80s as possible in their original box form. removed for a while. I have a rather proud collection with a lot of titles on my list! <br /> <br /> Kindred, although I haven’t received a copy yet, has a high priority, because all the old films that I didn’t like then I now own and now reviewed and think that they are great and the bits I remember about the Kindred, now they make me want to get a copy ASAP AS WELL </ i> <br /> <br /> Cheers for the 80s and long live the horror!
