I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the film. <br /> <br /> This is something that I have not done since then - I never fell asleep in the movies. <br /> <br /> I LOVE the original and have seen it several times and recommend it to everyone. Perhaps it was a problem, but I don’t think so, because there were a few bright spots that showed that if done correctly, they could make this film work. <br /> <br /> Bette was underutilized, and Ann was out of use and missed. <br /> <br /> I don’t know why English or anyone in this regard allowed it to go out like this. <br /> <br /> They declared it like sex in the city, but better? It was not by chance that I really liked Sex in the City, and I was disappointed with this film. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on this movie - look for something besides this!
