And now for another point of view: I did not like it. I have not finished it really. I know that the "Unforgiven" is considered one of the greatest westerns ever created. I know that these are stars and director Clint Eastwood, one of the icons of American cinema. I know he won a bunch of Oscars. However, I did not like it. I do not like westerns, and this is clearly a matter of taste, but I also do not admire Eastwood's game. He is not and never was a leading man. He is not Burt Lancaster, not Paul Newman, not John Wayne. In this film alone, he is eclipsed by Richard Harris and Gene Hackman; they are both actors. No, Eastwood is a tall guy with a shrill voice that usually plays tough guys. Here he plays a retired tough guy. When I see him on the screen, I see a man working on his game. Then there is the anti-Western conspiracy. It’s too obvious that he is meant to bring modern values ​​in - respect for the roles of women, blacks, Native Americans and single parents; disrespect for violence and drunkenness; the integrity that comes with marriage, including interracial marriage and small adorable children - in an age in which these values ​​were not necessarily adopted, at least in this way. Encouraging these values, the film looks like educated, if not preaching. Then there are stereotypes about gray-haired films - prostitutes with golden hearts, a child who cannot shoot straight, a city new to the wild West, sage of a sage, shimmering on a summer day with musical accompaniment in major chords. Finally Eastwood goes in the direction. I gave up after an hour. Eastwood was still driving north, talking to Morgan Freeman and a guy who could not shoot straight sixty minutes after the start of the conspiracy caused by the beating of a prostitute. It was too slow. Someone should have found these elements unconvincing. I'm afraid it was me.
