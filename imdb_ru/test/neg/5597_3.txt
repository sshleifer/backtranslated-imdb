After watching a movie in my classroom and talking to the director, I found out why the movie exploded the way he did. The filmmakers were not going to call the film "8 mm 2". The film was originally called “The Velvet Side of Hell,” but at the last moment Sony Pictures changed it to 8 mm 2, without giving the filmmakers any opinion on this issue. By doing this, he knocked them out of theatrical releases and doomed the video with a direct advertisement to direct output. <br /> <br /> Again, this is from the director’s mouth, not because of me, so I really can’t Tell me what is true and what is deception. <br /> <br /> If you look at the film as “The Velvet Side of Hell”, then this is not so bad. This is not great, but this is not terrible. It would be just a B-movie that loves to show boobs. But as the continuation of "8MM", the film fails terribly.
