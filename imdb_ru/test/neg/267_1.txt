What can I say about the Twelve Oceans? Who thought it would ever come to this? A giant mess that loses itself halfway and cannot return. I was amazed at how bad it is. Indeed! I have never seen the ending correctly, because this film is simply unbearable. I am a big fan of the first, but this is an unfortunate excuse to continue. <br /> <br /> What's the point in a robbery, if they are going to return the money? The film is just boring and so addictive that I can't accept it. This is really bad. Just stay as far as possible, repeat as far as possible from this movie. It costs nothing.
