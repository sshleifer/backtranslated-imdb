When the paleontologist Donald Sutherland arrives at the house of the Argyll family at the very beginning of the film and it turns out that he is the undisputed alibi of a member who was executed for killing his mother two years ago, you have the feeling that you are going to watch the top thriller; the innocent man was convicted, and the murderer is still there. But with the continuation of the film, your disappointment inevitably increases. <br /> <br /> “Test by Innocence” is a boring, and sometimes even a boring film that does not rise at any moment. Nothing interesting happens from the very beginning, and even for the final disclosure of facts, there is not enough surprise and intensity (regardless of whether you guessed or not). <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, Christopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway and Sarah Miles (far from her good results in “Daughter of Ryan”) just go through their roles and not very enthusiastically. <br /> <br /> You will not miss much if you miss this one.
