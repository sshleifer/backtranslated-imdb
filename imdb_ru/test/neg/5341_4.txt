“Black Friday” made this story much better, so he is remembered, and “The Man with Two Lives” is just a forgotten bowler. "Shed No Tears" is his working title, and it would be better, since he was a completely evil character for most of the film. <br /> <br /> Phillip Bennett is betrothed again when he is involved in the accident movement. Dr. Clark (Edward Kean) participated in some experimental animal operations — returning them from the dead. His colleagues urge him to try his operation on Philip, who died. While he is working, a dangerous criminal, Wolf Panino, goes to the electric chair, and the soul moves. When Philip wakes up from the operation, he has the soul of Panino. He is a changed man, he is rude to his family and begins to roam around the old refuges of Panino. He takes on Wolf's old gang - named Philip Bennett, he is also a former Wolf romantic - who smells like a rat. Bennett, like Wolf, is determined to even the score and begins to destroy his enemies. The bodies accumulate, including a girlfriend and a policeman, then his own family begins to become a victim. <br /> <br /> But - I HATE these bad dream films - you always feel overwhelmed. This film would be better if he stayed in the role of Panino and got the last shot. Eleanor, his bride, would be sadder, but wiser with her brother. <br /> <br /> Edward Norris, the star, made a great career mainly in B. movies. <br /> <br /> Not very recommended.
