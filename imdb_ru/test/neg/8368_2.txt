I'm a big fan of HP Lovecraft’s books, and Von Mythos has spawned pretty good other stories and the like. And in recent years there have been guys who made films about the work of HP, for most of the low-quality clicks? and showed them to the public in places such as the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival. Now, as I have already said, most of them do not have big changes, but at least they know the heart and "soul" of Lovecraft's works and films such as Cool Air or Call of Cthulhu - this is what I I would like to think - gifts for fans and other psychos who like the creation of HP. <br /> <br /> And then there are people like Ivan Zukkon, who simply tears off the title and creates a film that would be interesting to see if I myself shot it and shot it with friends on the beach. This is what Mr. Zukcon did as it seems ... but, although the guys, like in the earlier films of Aaron Vanek or Brian Moore, may not have had more shifts, they still had something else, like the story , real characters and some connection with Lovecraft! The simple use of names like Nyarlathotep or the Necronomicon makes the film not an adaptation of Lovecraft. <br /> <br /> In any case, this click will not only make Mythos fans shudder and hide, but will not please people who 1. like good movies, 2. laugh at bad movies, 3. love good movies. -popular films or 4. watch everything that is written in a horror movie on the cover of a DVD. I will not go into the “conspiracy” of this waste of time, as it has already been discussed by others here on this page, but as I said, “Unknown Outside” is like a film that I would shoot with some disgusting friends ... In addition, he lacks ideas for any storytelling, and he turns into a ridiculous "stupid nonsense, but he is an art." Self-made films of this “quality” are interesting to watch, if you know all the guys in it and haha, look at how XY coughs with false blood that we made from old tomato sauce and other things? but, hey, you don't put it in the dvd case, declare it a real movie and want to get money for it ?? <br /> <br /> I give it 2/10 because I don’t know ?? effort or something like that
