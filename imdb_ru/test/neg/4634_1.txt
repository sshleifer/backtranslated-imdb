I saw this movie and I was bored! I am a fan of peanuts, but I can not understand why Charles Schulz allowed this catastrophe! Spoilers ahead. <br /> <br /> I canâ€™t believe that Snoopy would let his friends sleep in a dangerous situation on the ground, go to the bar and drink a few cold ones without any help! The story was complete nonsense even for comic book characters. They get to France for too long, plus as soon as they get to France, I had a feeling that the writer (I still can't believe that it was Schultz) did not know what to do when they got there. <br /> Peanuts are best shot in 30-minute episodes, not in 80-minute films. <br /> <br /> Go home, Charlie Brown, you're at your best. <br /> <br />
