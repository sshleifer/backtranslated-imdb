Can this film be considered a film? Imagine a situation: someone puts a comfortable tripod over a tripod in front of the seafront and removes people walking or running along it. Then he puts the camera on the beach, buys the ducks at the pet store, opens their cages and allows them to run in front of the camera. Later, he simply removes the surface of the water and the sounds of birds and insects in absolute darkness. Is this an experiment or just an insult to the audience? What would happen if some unknown director made such a film? Would we mark his work with 10? I always disappoint directors who believe they can do whatever they want when they become famous.
