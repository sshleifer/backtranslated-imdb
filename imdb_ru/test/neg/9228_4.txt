That's what this movie actually takes. A big piece of cheese. This film is about a duet of sister and brother Bonnie and Clyde, who creates his own party line to trap his victims and kill them. But for what reason? Just for the pleasure of getting away with it? Richard Hatch arrives, who looks like a weary lady. This BAD version of the ladies. And he is working on finding out who is behind all the murders in Los Angeles. Finally, he meets a teenager who helps him find the killer, and the rest is for your pleasure and entertainment. But there are parts in this film that really make me walk like a scene with Life Garret, dressed in his mother's wedding dress, acting like a sister in front of his sister, telling her that she needs her and cannot live without her and looking she slaps him across the face that dominates him. I can't believe this is a lief! Well, I think I could. But worth a look, but only to see one of the worst films Garrets has ever made.
