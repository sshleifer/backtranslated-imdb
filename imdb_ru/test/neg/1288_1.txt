My wife rented this film and then never saw it. If I ever want to torture her, I will make her watch this movie. I watched a lot of movies with my 4 year old kid and I can take almost everything. Barney freshens up after a Quigley shot. <br /> <br /> The plot, the dialogue, the cinematography, and the action were one step above (or equally) cheap porn movie. I feel deceived from the $ 3.69 we paid to rent it, and then 90 minutes of my life, I will never come back. I will say that my 4-year-old liked it, fortunately, it was a rental, which we had to return immediately. <br /> <br /> I just hope that the career of a young actor has not deteriorated due to the fact that he starred in this film.
