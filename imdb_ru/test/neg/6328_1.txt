I caught this movie on nightly television. Honestly, I have seen most of them, and all this time I sat in complete and complete disbelief. <br /> <br /> Is there a genre that is more meaningless than soft-core porn? If there is, I do not want to know about it. Softcore porn combines all the horrors of porn (the values ​​of lousy production, disgusting action, cheesy scripts) with sex modesty scenes in regular movies. Thus, the end result does not cause any interest. This film also has a rather strange science fiction approach, and it works terribly. All sex is performed in a kind of virtual reality, where a team from the future learns about physical love. And yes, it's about as embarrassed and stupid as it seems. <br /> <br /> But there must be positive moments, right? Well, there is one ... Krista Allen is incredibly hot. This is the only thing that was less terrible in this film. I don't know what's wrong with her, but she has amazing sex appeal. The rest of the actors look like standard porn actors, though. Rather unattractive women with poorly made fake breasts, and men who have spent too much time in the gym, set themselves up for the grotesque. Probably a gym in Germany, judging by haircuts and clothes. <br /> <br /> Summing up. If you like the presence of Christa Allens on the screen, you can watch it for short moments when she demonstrates some of her seductive potential (although in most cases she tries to formulate trashy lines of dialogue). If you do not like Krista Allen, then you can generally stay away. <br /> <br /> I rate this 10/10 for the sex appeal of Krista Allens, 1/10 for everything else and 2/10 for entertainment value. since this is a unique crappy porn / fiction hybrid that doesn't really like what I've ever seen.
