Again, we get a mix of themes that are well covered in many previous films. Good and bad story with a son, kindly provided by the East of Eden. The story of the American sea hero, who does not consider himself as such because of the fact that he knows. And a grieving wife could potentially fall in love with another male story. <br /> <br /> The mere fact that these stories are ubiquitous is not a big problem. Because theoretically they could be better represented and deal with each time. However, this time there was no luck, since all these three threads did not work in the end. <br /> <br /> Because a bad son never manages to talk to his father, the conflict is never properly resolved. In addition, the father begins to appreciate the bad son due to the fact that the latter repairs the kitchen of the grieving wife. Now, how nice it is. <br /> <br /> Next, a surprisingly returning marine, suspecting his wife of an infidelity conflict, is not solved. Because he never talks to the suspect, namely his own brother. So, once again we got a free end here. <br /> <br /> Finally, the theme of American hypocrisy of military heroism, where the marine is publicly considered a hero, when due to the mud of the war he survived, he should not be called whole by his own standards, this third theme unchanged. Because the film ends immediately when he can talk to his wife for the first time about what he went through. Where the real story actually begins at this very moment, namely, from his recovery process, how it will look and how he will finally face the family, in which he will be recognized. All this, all really interesting fragments are skipped and ignored. <br /> <br /> So, despite the storyline, this film is serious, and I mean serious disappointment, I will still give him points for an impressive throw. Although no film should use Maguire for voice, because it is owned by Spiderman. Especially an adult, Gyllenhaal, seems to live up to all the expectations that he raised when he was a young and budding actor. So much so that I would really like him to be entrusted with a really deep and demanding main role of a proper profile. <br /> <br /> So, although the actors really seem to do what they can, I think this film is completely forgotten otherwise. Indeed, a shallow and ultimately pretentious, extremely unsatisfactory sleazotvodchik. Message to journalists: we already know about wounds, we will watch films about Vietnam. Do you want to earn a loan, show us the plausible healing.
