* The ELITE sniper team, which put in 24 hours or so earlier, instead of digging and making itself invisible, decided to hide behind a big stone in one of the first scenes. * When a hero “runs” to save his wife, he actually jogs. * Being inside the building and aiming at a target of only 20-30 meters, the hero USES THEIR SPHERE. In addition to the fact that most non-elite soldiers fired this shot from the hip and were still beating, there is also the fact that the scope probably won't be able to focus so closely. * There is a satellite that can look at buildings horizontally. <br /> <br /> The list is endless ... and the movie is the biggest pile of crap I've ever put on my DVD player.
