This is quite typical for a sci-fi channel: one-dimensional characters, ridiculous plot and terrible special effects. We have a few alien puppets in a sock, and Lou Diamond Phillips is trying his best with the little he is given to win the show. And save the day. All the others are completely optional; the former wife, who goes through a time-tested clich√©, does not love Lou first, and then, of course, loves him again at the end. Hateful state senator, who chew up early, and a pack of stupid guards who run a lot. In addition, there is an eco-terrorist who participates in this film for absolutely no reason, except that he gives us another 3% running around. He spends the entire middle section of the film hiding in a box. <br /> <br /> Special effects really deserve a separate paragraph. We start with a meteorite that flies through the air and reaches for it at a speed of about 100 miles per hour. According to the physics of this film, if you exceed the speed limit in your car, atmospheric friction can cause an explosion in a fire. Then it lands on the hood of a car entering horizontally. Kind of like a sticky velcro ball, I guess. It doesn't really hurt the car much, just bends the hood a little. Later, Lou gets into the helicopter and chases the train. Despite the fact that the train had only a two-minute start, it takes half an hour to catch it. CGI is so bad that a helicopter looks as if it is as big as the hills over which it flies. Then he flies toward the mountain - this effect must be seen to be believed. It seems that they took a can of gasoline and threw it at the wall, and then put a flame effect on the helicopter. About 10 times more. It is not surprising that the helicopter could not arrive in time, it was five tons of nitroglycerin. Then the eco-terrorist eventually explodes himself, but instead of exploding in all directions, as most explosions do, he explodes upwards, like a cannon aimed at the air. Then there is a whole deal with the inability to stop the train, because it would allow the little aliens to get off, but it seems that the aliens can really fly faster than the train, so why would it keep them on the train? I have no idea. <br /> <br /> In general, if you have a couple of hours that absolutely need to be killed, and this is related to this film or repetitions in the Food Network, well, if you think about it, some of those chefs are cute. Usually in these films there are at least one or two things that allow you to look through them; maybe there is a sexy girl, some kind of T & A, or a character who actually has some kind of individuality, or some kind of expectation, or, well, something else. I really did not see anything of this here.
