I recently rented this promising mini-series, I did not even know that they adapted it for television. I was really looking forward to it, since the Icon Book is one of the best spyware thrillers I've ever read. What a disappointment it was. The plot only faintly resembles the one in the book, the characters are completely wrong, and there is some horrible game. It's a shame, really. The Icon story is perfect for a silver screen, but I think television budgets are not big enough for a decent adaptation of this exciting book. <br /> <br /> Forsyth deserves much, much better than this. Avoid and stick to the book you need to read.
