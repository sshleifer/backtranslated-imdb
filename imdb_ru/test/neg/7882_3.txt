Although it is true that the film is somewhat interesting, the performance leaves much to be desired (much like the bloody orgy of the Leather Girls, I spit on your grave and Born in the fire, everything is excellent) if it functions like porn for someone, who am I to say that he / she is wrong? I was rather puzzled by the statement in the generally thoughtful review of Winkimation ("Such a Shame") that "this time we really see the faces of men when they come." Several years ago, I occasionally did independent reviews for an adult magazine, and I remember seeing many male faces when they came. I think this is probably more common when the movie is shown on the few porn stars "men" (and especially when this man is the director). Although it is not surprising that I cannot refer to any specific names, I know that there are several examples in the work of Ron Jeremy. I also do not know if I agree that a man necessarily shows vulnerability on his face when he comes.
