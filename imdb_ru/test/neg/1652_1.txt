Oh, how I laughed .... this is all ... Asian / white family, Asian disabled boy ... everything that a healthy person needs to see in the eyes of BBC. <br /> <br /> What tribe: It was a complete insult to my eyes, who viewed this garbage for only one episode and ONLY ONE EPISODE. <br /> <br /> When you think about some of the qualities that the BBC has released over the years (Falti Towers, for example), and then it starts to roll ... It's a disgusting shame. <br /> <br /> All of this is aimed at political correctness and is devoid of any humor. <br /> <br /> This is straight from the depths of hell: but what would you expect from an ultra-left BOC ... I mean the BBC.
