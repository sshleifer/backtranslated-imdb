(Contains really bad spoilers) So what can I say about this ... This is a really HORRIBLE and HORRIBLE movie !!. Too much CGI and special effects .... You could tell how fake a funny kid is !! at least watch "Dungeons and Dragons", which is another terrible bunch of TRASH. Mask's son makes Dungeons and Dragons much better !!! Uggg !!!!!!!!!!!! Pure crap !!!!!!!!!!!! I hate this trash! I would also like to say that “Superbabies: BabyGeniuses 2” was also a really stupid movie. Probably as stupid as the "Son of the Mask." “BabyGeniuses 2 was just as fake as Son of the Mask, and also contained way too much CGI !!” <br /> <br /> Anyway, yes ... it was a BAD BAD REALLY BAD film ... just please avoid it .... DO NOT recommend it to anyone ... please, its just too funny. ... there is no sense and a really bad plot. The baby who urinated on his father was just lame!
