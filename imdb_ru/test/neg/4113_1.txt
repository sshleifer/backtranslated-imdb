Dude, I went to this movie because of the great preview. Looks like he had a great story and good special effects. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. I wanted to leave the theater because of these terrible special effects. A cartoon dinosaur made of cardboard will make this work even better. The story was good if it took the producer. Who would have spent some more money to make the effect more like life. The only thing I liked about this film is where plants grow everywhere. <br /> <br /> Even worse, where the cars, in one scene, 2 characters are walking along the street. If you look at these cars, you will see the following: Taxi, car, motorcycle, tripod, big bus. And about 4 times in a row! <br /> <br /> And then - “the death of a butterfly”, which would set in motion all the “evolutionary changes”. If this guy hadn't stepped on a butterfly, the next dinosaur would have eaten it anyway! So this is an absolute bull. Then, if you change something in the past, the future will be different at the same moment. Not in the "waves of time" they did. But hey, if the future had changed in a split second, the film would have been worse, but still more realistic. This is just one of those films that you should see when you want to laugh well. I spend a lot of money on this film in the theater. And then they tell me that this film had a budget of 80 million dollars. WHERE EVERYTHING THAT MONEY GOES ???
