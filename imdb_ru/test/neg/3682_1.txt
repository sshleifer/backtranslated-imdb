Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back! This is a horror movie, not a thriller, not a waiting, horror movie. Yes, this movie is terrifying. Terribly bad. After many years of being here on IMDb, I actually proceeded to create an account so that I (like another reviewer here) could warn people DO NOT LOOK TO THIS FILM! It will steal your soul, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes films so bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life, if you are not wise enough to press the fast-forward button. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I would like to hear the director's voice on an “improved” DVD (there is another terrifying thought) to see what the hell they think. The producers had to assume that there were enough suckers to fall in love with the name of Val Kilmer so that this film would at least break even in international distribution. <br /> <br /> I really had the misfortune to choose this to watch on-demand movies that did not provide any subtitles for Russian dialogue. Not that it was a big deal. Straining to hear the Russian language, translate it in your head (if you can) just to find out how boring it is, it just adds insult to injury. <br /> <br /> I’ll give this movie “1” because I can’t give it a lower rating, and because it really accomplished one great thing. It somehow made the almost completely underground film NOT claustrophobic. Now this is a dubious achievement. <br /> <br /> HERE YOUR SPOILER: And the end, holy mother (not a pun), as if they ran out of money and they just decided to stop shooting. The “climax” of the film literally takes place a second before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen in the film. Use your simple escape mechanism if you find yourself watching this — the off button.
