Well, please believe me when I say this is a horrible, scary, sci-fi movie. This is done so badly that most of the film is played as unintended surrealism, and it is absolutely a waste of time. Awful, but somehow also deeply unfunny. I saw it as a double feature with “Recon 2020: The Caprini Massacre,” and although “Battlespace” was an incredibly excellent film, it does not say much. The plot of "Battlespace" is so confused that it can not be traced. The narrative is mysterious, often meaningless, seemingly endless and completely tedious. Literally half of the film is duplicating scenes of the female heroine, similar to Brian Bosworth walking through the desert. The film actually starts pretty cool, but then it penetrates into the cordons and for some reason continues to deteriorate, every minute. Absolutely terrible and truly absurd endurance test. Zero stars. --- | --- Reviews by Flak Magnet
