This film was not the best ... but there were good actors in it. Isaiah Washington was pretty good as a homeless guy, Guy Torrey was good as his disabled brother, Ice-T was humorous as a host and surprisingly ... actress Tami Roman was good as Judge in the film. I did not even know that it was her, and I am a solid fan of the Real World. She was absolutely believable. I hope this film does not hinder the development of these actors. I know that Isaiah left this film far behind with Gray's Anatomy success, Ice-T with his regular role in the New York Police Special Unit, and Tami Roman got a permanent role in Sex and Love Secrets (new soap opera UPN ). I wish the same for other actors, because one bad movie does not make a bad actor.
