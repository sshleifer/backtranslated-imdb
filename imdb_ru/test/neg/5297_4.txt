Despite the statements of John Travolta in an interview that this was his favorite role in his career, “Be Cool” turns out to be a disappointing continuation of the 1995 witty and clever “Get Shorty”. <br /> <br /> Travolta demonstrates a rather pleasant performance in this soft entertainment film, but ultimately the film collapses due to an underdeveloped plot, incredible characters and an amazing lack of chemistry between the leading Travolta and Uma Thurman. Although there is some laughter, this unfunny example of dialogue (which often appeared in trailers) speaks for itself: Thurman: Do you dance? Travolta: Hi, I'm from Brooklyn. <br /> <br /> The film says that everyone who is involved in the entertainment industry is gangsters, or is striving to become one, likening them to organized crime. In “Get Shorty,” the premise that the gangster “would become legitimate,” when entering a movie, was a clever idea of ​​catching water, but in “Be Cool” it seems that since then the business has been completely distorted. /> <br /> The film is interestingly shown, and the absolute highlight is the “monolga”, staged by “Rock”, whose character is both a novice actor and a villain, where he reproduces the scene between Gabriel Union and Kirsten Dunst from “Come on.” Vince Vaughan thinks he is black, and he is often seen dressed as a pimp - it was pretty funny in the first scene, which introduces him, tires and embarrasses almost immediately afterwards. <br /> <br /> In general, "Be cool "It may be worth the hire of avid defenders John Travolta (of which I am alone), but you can keep your finger close to the fast forward button to get through without feeling too much time. Get Shorty fans can actually avoid it, because the sequel is deprived of most of the things that made it a winner. I rate this movie on the general recognition sharp 4/10.
