I took this film from the local Family Video on sale for $ 1.50, which was probably the first sign that it would not be good. Watching it with two friends, neither of them even wanted to finish it because of how terrible this film is. I, oddly enough, could not stop watching this. But this film is definitely an example of how not to make a film. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple and sounds great: Chuck Norris has nightmares about the serial killer he put behind bars. The serial killer escapes, and his nightmares become reality again. Serial kill, Norris, reversals ... it sounds like a great movie. <br /> <br /> And some of them are pretty good. The flash of a flashback scene, when a person breaks a ladder with his teeth, a scene when a van escapes from a cliff and breaks, is amazing - and I learned how to break out of prison, using only lipstick, a cannon and a toothpick. But in this film a lot of bad things. <br /> <br /> First, the editor is a moron. When you shoot an action or an unknown film, you must support the movement of energy. Too many scenes that are not decisive for the plot left in this film slow it down and distract from the overall story. At least 10 minutes could be shortened, and the pacemaker would improve, and the film would be a little better. Two: the sound engineer is an idiot. Obviously, someone tried to shoot most of this film in an area where you can't get a decent sound, so most of the dialogue is voiced by killing a stereo and not lining up in your mouth. In addition, the music is too dramatic in some scenes. Three: idiot casting director. They chose Billy Drago as a psychiatrist. Billy Drago is a great cult actor (from Briscoe County, the Hills have eyes, etc.), He could have become a real serial killer or some kind of villain. His character is so vanilla that Drago’s skills are in vain. Fourth: idiot writer. In this film, two stories - the hunt for a serial killer and romance between Norris and his pregnant girlfriend. Every time I saw this woman on the screen, I wanted to pry out my eyes. And, of course, she never came up with another story, making her story completely meaningless. <br /> <br /> Will I ever see this again? May be. But if they don’t redo this movie at least a dozen times, you should never. Not recommended.
