This film is miserable, not because it is poorly directed, filmed, sung, danced, filmed, etc. The musical performances in the SouthPark film were much better than in Mama Mia. Directed by Mama Mia is proof that you don't need talent to be a director - all you need is ABBA songs. <br /> <br /> Just to give a horror pattern: an aging Meryl Streep shoots close-ups in bright sunlight and just smashes the song with all the distracting wrinkles on her face. Why is it with one of the most talented actresses out there?
