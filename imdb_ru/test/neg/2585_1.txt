Well, of course, everyone has the right to have an opinion about something ... about everything. The presentation was interesting: black and white cinema, 1968, student performances, general strike, youth, ideals, love ....., etc. Sorry, but I did not feel LOVE, ROMANCE. Lover, with whom everything is in order, that his girlfriend is sleeping with whoever it is? This is Love ? But not only that, the film is very long, and for no reason I had to stop watching the film several times, because I just lost interest. I waited for something to happen, but ... NOTHING. The only thing that impressed me during the film: the gypsy violinist playing in the streets, yes, it was nice. I do not think that art should be complex, encrypted, hidden in secret meanings, confusing. A big disappointment and a waste of time!
