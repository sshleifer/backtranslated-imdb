I rented this movie thanks to Netflix, thinking that I would get the 1972 version. I sat silently watching this new version, thinking: “Gee, the production values ​​were exciting! I was convinced that the soundtrack had the sound of the 70s. I was even more convinced that it was a 70s film, when it occurred to me (almost every five seconds) that the only thing missing between Gene and Finney was a strong hug, a tense look, a passionate kiss. <br /> <br /> Sorry, although John Knowles himself indicated that it was not a homosexual relationship, it is painfully obvious that yes, this is exactly what it was. When people (usually teenagers) of the same sex have “intensive” friendly relations, this means that all these aspirations for love, togetherness, the desire to express themselves sexually, all flow out. These boys needed to be connected, but they were never allowed. <br /> <br /> Also, despite Toby Moore’s energetic performance, I never felt that any emotions were real. I never communicated with any of the boys, for the reason that their relationship was not truly honest. <br /> <br /> People want to live in fantasy and think that this happened in the 1940s, that these boys could not have these sexual feelings for each other. But I say what they did - at least in the book they did, and in this film, Finney was, almost painfully, for Gene. The “intensity” that, according to John Knowles, has existed between them, was hidden homosexuality, hero worship, idolatry, which under normal circumstances would be expressed sexually. Even if these guys put it down, it should have been crystal clear, but this film doesn't even hint at it. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is an incredibly weird moment when Finney, who broke his leg, playfully bounces around with all the other guys while playing ball games. If they were not just a bunch of Nin Compos, they would know that they will not be able to throw their bodies against him. Obviously, this amazing moment was lost by both the director and the producer.
