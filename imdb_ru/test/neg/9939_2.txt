Creepy face masks and cutting films went along like cheese and green onions throughout the long life of the cycle. People often assume that it was John Carpenter who initiated this trend, but, as is the case with many of the genre cliches, the Italians were the first to do so. Films like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the creators of the hooded maniac in the secret of murder. There was also a pair of American Halloween slashers that deserve a mention. Classroom Massacre, “Keep My Grave Open,” and “Wild Weekend,” clearly precede 1978, while “City in which the scary sunsets” are considered one of the first films about the killing of teenagers. <br /> <br /> Carpenter’s original film may not have been a masked maiden’s nightmare, but he certainly started a competitive race between directors to introduce the most intimidating disguise for his ghosts. Over the years, we saw several memorable rivals, but my favorites were to be: the manic miner My Bloody Valentine, the sadistic soldier The Prowler and the copper killer Wicked Games. I am also interested in many killer clowns that have appeared in the entire category. The final scene in “House on Sororiti Street” should be called one of the best, and “Midnight Clown” is also one of the best costumes for the crazy. <br /> <br /> The leather mask was probably the last used in the slasher film, probably because they are widely associated with sexual perversion, which, of course, does not make a terrible disguise. But in subsequent years, both Blackout and this obscurity decided that fear could certainly be combined with a gilt suit. Here's how later from the two lived? <br /> <br /> The screen lights up with sirens when police rush to the hostage scene. It seems that a tired gentleman may already have enough of the fact that he was thrown as an extra in coarse turkeys with a low eyebrow, so he decided to keep his wife and child at gunpoint. Detective Schein (David Clover) manages to fight the fighter, but unfortunately for him he loses the battle to grab a free pistol, and it looks like this is the end of the road for the gray-haired officer. Fortunately, at the very last moment he was saved by accurate marksmanship from Lisa Ryder (Donna Adams), the hottest policewoman from the California Police Department. <br /> <br /> Her heroic clash deserved the promotion of a brunette to a detective. class, and this is a feat that is greatly envied by her male colleagues. Meanwhile, a leather-clad maniac wanders around the city, killing prostitutes and dumping his bloody corpses in the corners of streets. Ryder and Schein are accused of a murderous freak, and their first challenge for interrogation is a sleazy photographer on the street, whose name is Michael Walker (John Mandell). Lisa is such a high-class inspector that a normal police ruling does not seem to apply to her, so she soon meets with the operator, although he suspects his number one. When the bodies continue to pile up around the city, she decides to go under cover in an attempt to save the crazy S & M ?? <br /> <br /> Anyway, Zipperface easily sums up everything that went wrong with the slasher genre, by the end of the reins. What began as a great rung for beginning filmmakers and fans turned into a sewage drain of cinema with the help of films with a flat direction, zero expectation or upheaval and inept mediocre actors. Years of surge in the early eighties managed to hide the lack of strong dramatic compositions with sticky special effects and exciting directing effects. Unfortunately, at this point in title cycles, such as Rush Week, Deadly Dreams and Majorettes, seemed to be created in a conspiracy to place a category in which many of the characters of the above function were involved. In an early grave. <br /> <br /> Donna Adams is not even vaguely convincing as an officer of the law, and her inexplicably idiotic behavior, which includes a striptease for the main suspect in the nationwide homicide investigation, is more mind-boggling than you might expect. Mansur Purman could not lead the movement, and the overwhelming majority of the actors would have struggled to get a second reading to advertise on radio. I searched and searched, but did not find anything worthy of note or comment here. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you manage to keep the TV on until the end, you can be quite surprised by the identity of the killer. Honestly, I doubt that by that time you even care. And one more plus? Well, well ... the disk is perfectly symmetrical, which means that you can use it as a mat to put a cup of tea ?? In addition, there is no other reason to go and buy a Zipperface. Bad bad, bad and not in a good way, these are 90 minutes of my life, which I could spend more constructively pinching my chest hair. Fierce.
