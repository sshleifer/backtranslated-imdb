Not only is “Big Rock and Roll Cheating” completely inaccurate, but when it comes to it, there is little that is interesting or even interesting. Malcolm McLaren seems to have squandered most of the Sex Pistols revenues on this waste of the film, which makes it far more unpleasant. From the very beginning, the goal was to create a monument to the “genius” of McLaren, who still fully trusts the creation of punk music, the creation of the Sex Pistols, and sometimes even the writing of all the songs. The audience watches McLaren in different situations, where he tells his story to his girlfriend, a female gnome, and simply takes credit for one by one. One of the most annoying scenes is McLaren in an abandoned aircraft hangar, waiting for an airplane, chased by journalists and telling them a “big story”. The most interesting elements of the film are animated short plays; however, even these smells of McLaren’s self-worthy self-assessment. <br /> <br /> Even as a farce, this film does not work. A little interesting about this, with the exception of Steve Jones, who is surprisingly decent as a pseudo-detective type of person. Twenty years later, Julien Temple, who wrote and filmed this film, also filmed “The Filth and Rage” documentary about the Sex Pistols. Although this film is much better and more interesting than “Fraud”, it is still full of “artistic flourishes” of Temple who simply do not work, for example, interviewing band members in the shadows, as if they are some kind of witness to the crime personality. An interesting trifle: film critic Roger Ebert was one of the authors of the script for the film “Who killed Bambi?”, Which eventually became “Fraud”.
