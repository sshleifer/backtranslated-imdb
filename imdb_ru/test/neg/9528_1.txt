Lois Weber's film "Hypocrites" was and remains a kind of very brave and courageous film. I enjoyed it and was very impressed with the shooting and the story. The priest sees the hypocrisy of people in his church and tries to show them the "naked" truth. People are horrified when he shows a naked statue depicting the truth, failing to bring them to this, and the few who have helped help along the way. People do not want to admit the truth that they are doing something wrong, but it shows them that they put things before God, go to beach parties, behaving in an inappropriate way, their materialistic ways and other things in which our people the world tend to do that. don't be morally right. In the end, without receiving any followers, he must enter the heavenly gates alone. This film seems to me very bold, because it shows a naked woman, especially given the period of time in which this film was shot. The images and symbols depicted in this film seemed incredible to me. The way they made a naked woman translucent, and using a naked woman to symbolize the naked truth, shows great creativity and art. Showing the different sins of people as they walked the road and refused to follow the path, each with different excuses, setbacks and / or higher priorities, was a great way to introduce the people of today. This film very well helps to convey the moral message to its audience. Lois Weber has a terrific way to capture the attention of viewers with her creativity, symbolism, visual effects and auditory audiences. Even the piano music in this film is very beautiful and fits the whole theme.
