This film gives a new meaning to the term “uneven”, giving us some intriguing characteristics, compensated by an awkwardly implemented plot that relies on several well-positioned stings to achieve the most thrill. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy concerns a group of men who hide a secret that caused a curse that visited them in the form of a ghostly female face that causes death. She may also be seducing their sons. <br /> <br /> This is quite spectacular when all the famous veteran actors get together in one movie, but unfortunately they are not very convincing, especially the scene where Melvin Douglas leaves the deep end, imploring the rest to listen to him. Then it is not surprising that the actors who play these very characters in their youth are terrible, especially the giggling Ricky. They put the worst scene "we are not all drunk" that I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film has several saving graces, namely Dick Smith’s gorgeous make-up (no matter how irrelevant they were in this film), and Alice Krieg’s fascinating performance as Alma / Eva. I have never read the novel from which this film was taken, but I am going to read some other reviews on this page. However, you do not need to read a book to understand that this is just a shadow of the original story. There is a good story here, but it seems to be lost somewhere, among the exposition, which shows men nightmares and again and again, and they delicately refer to the secret that they all share. <br /> <br /> In its current form, it seems that about half an hour was taken from this print, especially near the climax. In the end ... how is it that Fred Aster so quickly manages to dig up a pond? What does Gregory Beit and the child with Eve have to do with it? And while we're at it ... what the hell was she? Why did leaving the car lead to the disappearance of the phenomenon? If it was a ghost, how could he have sex with two men if they didn't know? <br /> <br /> No one will answer these and other questions, at least in this film. If the recovered video is not found anywhere, it will probably always remain curiosity with some oozing makeup, bizarre scenes of sex and nude, as well as a few attractive looks.
