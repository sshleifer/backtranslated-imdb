The fact that someone could come up with this nonsense, and then get it, is incredible. The fact that it was actually broadcast on television, and advertisers paid to be associated with it, is simply overwhelming. This grueling excuse for children's programming is almost too mean to comment. I burned — yes, burned — any Barney records that people gave to my son. Finding this horrible programming in my library was a nasty surprise. And where, tell me where, do they get those smart little actors? Does their parents make no sense? These children will take drugs before they become teenagers. Geez. The last insult is that I need to add this extra line to the review to get it on IMDb.
