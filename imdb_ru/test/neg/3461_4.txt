This is a demonstrative DVD movie rental. I am a big fan of actors, but the storyline has never captured me. Don't expect, "Oh, brother, where are you," in any way. The funny thing, in my opinion, is when a war hero explains what is happening in Argon. Looks like they tried to copy some of the funny face expressions of Clooney from “Oh brother where you are,” but you could say that they tried to do it. John Krasinski was a bright spot and was hard everywhere. Renee Zellweger plays the role of a zealous reporter, ready to do everything for this story. In general, this is a movie that is worth watching at home.
