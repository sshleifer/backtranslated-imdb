I'm a big fan of Emily Watson (Breaking The Waves) and Tom Wilkinson (Normal), and was surprised to see them in the role of Rupert Everett (Dellamorte Dellamore) in this shockingly rather minor film that had all the ingredients to be so More. Too short scenes in which he portrays the languid, infinitely entitled, worthless son of a rich Lord are very interesting. But for the love triangle between someone there was a remarkably little chemistry. The music was a horrible quality movie of the week, and the voiceover sounded completely useless. Obviously, the work of a novice director with a small budget, which either lacked or did not listen well to good advice. Very sorry. <br /> <br /> I can appreciate how the people you hate in the beginning are the ones you like at the end, and vice versa, so there is some kind of character arc in the least in terms of perception. For example, the character of Watson, being sincerely honest with her husband regarding her feelings towards another man, began to annoy me towards the end, especially when she announced to her husband that she simply had no control over her actions, and later, when she simply stated that she would return to their family apartment, without asking permission and without apologizing. And I moved from dislike to the ugly / moral relativistic character of Wilkinson to understand him and not want him to change (unlike his wife). <br /> <br /> This film has clumsily turned from a detective story to A Love Story. “Or the drama about the Steel Magnolia disease without informing me enough about this fact, so I remained indifferently guessing what the next plot could be after a long time after they were all revealed (was it the Lord behind the wheel of a car? Dog of the Lord ?) The scene where the Lord visits Wilkinson and talks about how brave Watson, the best nurse, ever asked by a dying guy, Florence Nightingale, etc., was fine until he started sobbing like child. Oh god If you ask me, she’s just another carefree rich man who has too much time on her hands, and so she’s crazy about her hard work, providing the crazy spouse with unnecessary drama. Her wreck was just another way to take her empty life; The dying guy's thing was an added bonus for her, as she somehow made her previous actions completely flawless. <br /> <br /> Listen, everyone would be better off if Wilkinson had just left her for his secretary, who seemed to appreciate him for who he was. Instead, he behaved like an offended dog, his open craving for affection of his wife increased with every blow she gave him. I am not against a PC or something like that, it just didn't sound believable, even after taking into account all the harsh realities of middle age with which we all tend to face. The end for me was (and not the intention of the director, I'm sure) depressing. The film spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people simply do not belong to each other, so I did not find joy in the promise to continue their relationship. I do not want my emotions to be governed by history, it should be somewhat believable, not beaten. It's too much? <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
