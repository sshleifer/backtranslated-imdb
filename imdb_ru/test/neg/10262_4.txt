I saw it last night and, being a fan of the first Demons, I was hoping that the sequel would have the same cheerful, creepy spirit as its predecessor. This, unfortunately, is not the case. The script is similar to the first, in which a horde of flesh-eating demons burst into reality, being released from a horror movie that was played ... (The first was a cinema, this one happens in a residential building and on TV.) madness and mass slaughter. This is pretty much all that concerns the development of the plot. In the first part, it worked well because of the disgusting make-up of FX, the fast pace and unpredictability. The sequel, however, does not cut it. The first problem seems to be that there are too many characters that we don’t really care about anyway. If they were annoying or idiots, then at least there would be some kind of reward when they were inevitably killed / demonized / eaten alive ... but these people just kind of expect there to be killed. In addition, the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of an apartment building (and outside it), they constantly intersect between them, which constantly draws me out of the story. There are some fun bits, shard FX courtesy and courtesy. Such as a constant stream of dripping blood, eating through a one-story building after another, as if it was an alien acid ... The first possession of a curly girl birthday girl by a demon leads to the destruction of her entire group, and a terrible demonic child who clings to his path pregnant with a child. However, this sequence turns into a ridiculous-looking rubber doll demon toy that breaks out of the chest of a human child who constantly flies across the room to its intended victim. I pulled a couple of laughs out of this scene, but I don't think that was Bava’s intention. The scene probably would have worked better if they just kept the demon child close by to attack the woman, but hey ... Other trifles, such as the excessive zeal of most of the characters and poor dubbing, do not help. To summarize, I was able to see the version without DVD on DVD, and I can't imagine that I need to go all the way to the previously available version with an R rating, because FX makeup and blood were the only thing I got from it. It is also worth noting the early role of the future daughter of the beautiful producer Argento, Asia. In fact, she probably gives the best performance of the entire cast, and she is barely on the screen. Argento / Bava fans may want to check it out, just to see them, but will probably find themselves looking at their watches like me. Gore fans can enjoy some games, but they will laugh at their seats over the most dull-looking evil doll from the time of Little Selwyn of Dead / Alive. You could have done worse, but this, of course, does not match the original.
