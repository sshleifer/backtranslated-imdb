Wow, it's pretty amazing that you can actually do something bad. I give this film 2 because it is so bad that it has a certain car-crash-like appeal. It's so bad, it's funny, and it has a certain entertainment value. In addition, there is some gratuitous nudity, and it is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> So where do I start. Acting is terrible, as if you were watching a school play. Theresa Russell must have done something really bad to be forced to star in this film, and her acting reflects how happy she is to be in the midst of this mess. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is just stupid Casting Dan Cortese as an FBI agent - a cherry on top of that shit. His acting really made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> As for the script and director S. Courtney Joyner and Mark L. Lester, they just need to be removed back and shot.
