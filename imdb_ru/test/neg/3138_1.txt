I saw it at the Fantasy Filmfest in Cologne and left the movie halfway through this “movie” (with a bunch of other people), so maybe I'm not the one who comments on it, but I think the fact of leaving “SC” is sufficient reason for this. "S.C." this is another movie. People who need a consistent story, characters, or storyline will not find anything in it. This is supposed to be an experimental film based on the power of images. But these images have no power. They are so forced to simply harass people that they have nothing more to say. The narrator's gibberish is just boring, visual effects are cheap. Well, the effects are good, but if this is the only thing, why care? Hussein's film wants to be shocking and thought-provoking - instead, it is boring and annoying with its uncreative work. Note: not every film without history is an art, and there is absolutely no creative approach to overcoming taboos, especially if things are not as bad as in SS. I would advise director Hussein to visit a psychiatrist or film school before he again takes shit for art. Note: I never want to see the baby suffer again during the birth.
