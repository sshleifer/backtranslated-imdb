This film is the worst I've ever seen. You might think that you saw bad movies at one time, but if you have not seen this one, you donâ€™t know how horrible a movie can be. But wait, there is worse news! The studio will soon re-release this masterpiece (I ironically) for all to see! The only thing that is worse than the plot of this film is the effects, action, direction and production. Bill Rebein, Ed Wood for the poor man (not that Ed Wood is for the rich man) (although I like Ed Wood films), knows how to keep things at a snail's pace throughout the film. It begins with the capture of a snowman baby (Littlefoot? Sorry, could not help him) with a pair of unsightly hunters who are killed by a parent. This forces the entire city where the hunters lived to go on a hunt for a snowman. This is pretty much it for the plot. Nothing even remotely interesting happens, and we, the audience, can never take care of any characters. If someone is interested in films about Rebana, I would recommend almost any others about it. However, as I said, he will soon be reissued by Troma in order to tire out a new generation of viewers.
