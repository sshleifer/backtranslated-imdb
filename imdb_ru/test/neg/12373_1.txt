This is really a horrible 1957 sci-fi horror film. In fact, despite the fact that Ed Wood Jr. and his terrible films are widely publicized, this turkey is no worse than the worst of the Woods. Now the game is slightly better than in the epic about Wood (for example, PLAN 9 and MOVENTER'S NEVEST), but the special effects turned out to be much worse than that of Wood! However, bad movie fans will be glad to hear that this is so bad that it is still a great preview. Like Wood, it's great to watch this crappy holiday and laugh with friends. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the fact that the scientist flies, conducting some tests on his plane. However, a UFO rushes out of nowhere, and his message about it on the radio causes panic from the air force. However, later they realized that the UFO did not appear on the radio, and they think that the scientist is crazy! But, when soon after these planes start to disappear, they understand that something must be in his observation. <br /> <br /> So far the film is not great, but you can watch it. However, by the time a terrible flying monster appears, you already know that you are looking at a turkey. Firstly, because of the terrible use of serial film and crappy models, the aircraft are constantly changing in flight. It may not bother some of them, but with such aircraft lovers as I, the look of the F-80, turning into an F-86 into an F-102 fighter, drove me crazy - especially since the planes do not look alike. Secondly, thanks to smart cinematography, all you really see in the monster is a bundle of fluff for half the film! It is frustrating, and you hope that when you finally see it clearly, it will be worth the wait. Well, no such luck! "Monster" looks less realistic or frightening than the duck from the series "You Bet Your Life" Groucho! In fact, it is significantly less realistic than any of the Japanese giant monsters! In fact, Big Bird from “Sesame Street” is even a bit worse and more realistic !!! It's just terrible in all respects and can be the dumbest monster in cinema history - about as bad (or worse) as the monsters in ROBOT MONSTER or TEENAGERS OF OUTER SPACE !!! The bottom line is that this is an absolutely awful movie that people who are sane will not like it. Fans of bad movies like me (who are just crazy) will surely enjoy it! All the rest ... be afraid .... VERY be afraid !! <br /> <br /> For your information - you may notice that some of the videos in this film are taken from other science fiction films !! I am sure that the broken scene of the Washington Monument was stolen from EARTH VS. Flying saucers, but I also saw a couple of other scenes that, I swear, are from other films. What a hacker job!
