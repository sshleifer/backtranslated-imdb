Julien Hernandez is definitely an attractive and cute character on the screen. In fact, his character pretty much carries the whole movie, or what's in it. The problem is that with the exception of his boyfriend (who is played by Maris Petroro) and Paul Lecakis (as a trick / date / boyfriend for some of the characters), no one else is even close. Hernandez plays a 30-year-old director of Cuban heritage and unknown sexuality, who arrives in Los Angeles and gets a job shooting a gay documentary. In the process of meeting with a group of gays during a hidden object search, he comes out ... but very disappointing. Even in the 88th minute, the film was obviously stretched and supplemented by various film school devices, most of which end in a meaningless interruption of the narrative (which is not too much to begin with) or an indication of the general amateur nature of the film. filmmaking <br /> <br /> What a shame, because somewhere there is a love story, and the last three minutes, when Sebastien Hernandez finally clicks the rich West Hollywood party instigator (pleasantly underestimated by Lonnie Henderson), and they share some sexual soul kisses, it works, despite everything that was before. But we don’t really care about other characters or their situations: why did handsome Dante get Eurotracks for his boyfriend? He will not. And don't even get me on the "rules" of dating Sebastian Paulie's friend - not a single gay friend, hell, not a single sane person, period, will not impose such restrictions on himself or others. And please tell me how Sebastian gets the peeled banana (which is usually pretty shmushi, right?), Stuck in his ass and should go to the doctor to remove it? <br /> <br /> I noticed that Hernandez won the award for this film as “short” - he probably should have stayed that way. All this says - I look forward to seeing Hernandez again on the screen, in a better comedy scenario with more confident guidance.
