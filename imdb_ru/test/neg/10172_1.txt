This film was the biggest trash I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It is sold as science fiction, although in reality it is just a tool for recruiting Christians. <br /> <br /> He tells you quite a bit about the state of the Christian church when they have to resort to deception so that they can listen to their advertising materials. But again, what do you expect from an organization that would go through so much effort to help protect such a huge number of child molesters in their organization. <br /> <br /> Religion is full of only sexual perverts, hypocrites, and military merchants. Let's not forget, our clumsy former president actually came out and said that “God told him” to invade Iraq. And no one asked, did he hear voices or see things? <br /> <br /> Anyway, here goes about the subject. No, this film has nothing to do with UFOs, it’s just a religious production.
