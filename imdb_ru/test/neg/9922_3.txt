Let's get to the bottom of this ... This is a terrible movie. The story is confusing, the cast is ridiculous, and the main actors look as if they were forced to be in it. This story asks us to believe that there is an underground cult of lesbian sex, whose members kill their psychiatrist, who simply turned out to be a transvestite. Ellen Barkin investigates crimes and adores Peta Wilson, whose job it seems is to be a cult recruiter. Sex scenes are equivalent to bad porn and when Barkin and Wilson kiss, Poor Ellen looks like she is in pain. Barkin's talent is completely wasted on this piece of class B sex trash, and I hope she gave her agent a rosy mistake after landing her in this film.
