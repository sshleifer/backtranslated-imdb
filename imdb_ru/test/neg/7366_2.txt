It was really the most painful experience I ever experienced in a movie theater. I will reject such superficial criticisms as “insult” or “historically inaccurate” or “bullshit”, because then our sympathies will immediately manifest to these words. If the director wants to make a grandiose grandiose love epic, for God's sake, MAKE A REAL DRAWING EMPLOYEE EPIC LOVE OF THE GRANDIOSE! Why bother about such ridiculously inconclusive second-rate novels of harlequins and about such boring exchanges between characters that we don't give a damn about when the most decisive battle on Canadian soil takes place? And for pompous people who think: “Well, this story should focus on the characters!” Well, you are mistaken, absolutely wrong.
