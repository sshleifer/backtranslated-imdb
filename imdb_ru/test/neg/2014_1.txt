Dracula 3000 or Van Helsing “Revenge of Dracula” (Cheap earnings on another unsuccessful film about vampires), since I saw that this was a master class on how not to make a film. Rag collection of villains rescuers aboard the previously lost cargo ship "Demeter" in the (coughing) Carpathian system (which was later upgraded to the Carpathian galaxy) and awakens a merciless evil (in this case scenario). This film is the oddest Event Horizon meanness, and whichever the worst vampire film of all time. <br /> <br /> **** Spoliers Follow **** After the many logos of manufacturing companies and the credit sequence, which most of the budget must have spent, we start with a silly speech like exposure from Casper (stupid name ), which is played by captain Abraham Van Helsing (a more stupid name) and instead of actual character development continues to describe the distorted, unintelligible strangeness of which his team consists. Van Helsing himself splashes the stubble and wears a warmer, 80s retro style figure dedicated to Han Solo (I guess). From time to time "Captain Demeter" appears in some crazy video diary, to say nothing about the consequences with a pronounced German accent (unfortunately, the subtitles are not included). Crew member Mina sits on an abandoned ship (alone ???), armed only with a pistol-shaped torch and a thick Eastern European accent, talking to Van Helsing on his ship's bridge (which is basically a single shiny wall). Mina, wearing a gas mask with rubber hoses, glued to the front, meets what can only be described as a skateboarder in a black raincoat who constantly slides past the camera. Why this happens when the vampire has not yet become flesh is never explained. This leads to a shaky cell chasing Mina through the corridors until she encounters Humvee. It is quite possible that Will Smith could be called upon to write the Humvee lines, since most of them consist of Humvees reminding us that he is black every ten seconds and pronouncing the word “ass” is enough to write to the Guinness Book of Records when delivering all this to “From DA hood 'accent (this is the 3000th year, is there a“ DA hood ”at all?) One of the main problems with this film is that he is trying insanely to pretend to be his set in 3000. Unfortunately, anyone with healthy eyes won. "This is not so, because Demeter looks suspiciously like a Soviet tanker. Perhaps the film crew thought it would be good to leave the sickle and hammer symbols and Lenin's sexy poster next to a bunch of lockers and explain it as a kind of futuristic return of the Communists. The crew’s clothes look as if they were attacked from the Oxfam collection box (sealed since 1993), and they are armed to the teeth with the latest automatic weapons of the 20th century (with 3000 added shooting th when shooting), which, of course, absolutely useless vampires. Health care is in the past (in the future), because the simplified professor not only has glasses, but also a wheelchair ??? My God, what happened to all these genetically engineered things . <br /> <br /> The professor is an interesting character, as he is a direct excerpt from Alien Resurrection, who had his own team for choosing a rag tag with a guy in a wheelchair (who oddly was not killed). The fans did not accept Prof, because he seems to be scared in many scenes. If I had been immersed in a Soviet ship without a wheelchair, pursued by bad acting vampires, and everyone left me, because I was such a aching weakling, I would also be scared. <br /> <br /> A professor tells us (with feeling) that during the dramatic scene of Mina’s persecution at the UN, “this is confusing.” The rest of his lines also confuse the “rogue” and “We will all die” X 100. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak appears as vice-captain (what happened to the 1st officer?) In that I thought it would be a tired, standard question, with a hard nose, without any nonsense, “don't look at me until I tell you too”, beat 10 stuntmen at a time, super-babe, but it's a Z-click so she's Mostly wears a tight top and low leather pants. The productivity of Kulio increases the coefficient of ham by 90% and it is more than a number of tents, but, fortunately for us, he will die soon. Although he seems to keep his heart on the right side of his body. <br /> <br /> After long runs along the same corridor, using clumsy Soviet-style controls and sitting in the Soviet-style dressing rooms, the crew finds themselves in a quandary when their own ship stumbles to find a more interesting crew ( probably). Why Dracula is even mentioned is unknown, since the main bad guy is Orlok, nicknamed Cosmic Transylvanian for "crimes against fashion", as he drags in a big lush, frilly shirt and an even starched collar, which is why the "Hammer of Terror" vampires "Look smooth in comparison. Orlock stops to explain all his background (off-screen) to Erica Eleniak, but cannot kill her in the next vicious turn of the “Resurrection of the Aliens”. His background is such a pile of minced meat that it is not worth repeating. Since the budget cannot afford the coordinators of the battle, special effects, original music, the script (not written by chimpanzees), and even the correct final titles (the first list of actors I saw were the same characters, but completely different Italian names), destroy any sanity with which you started. The crew, fortunately, can fight back with the help of a ship's computer, which contains little-known millennial references on how to kill fictional creatures, and some handy tips for a 20th century pool they find in a rest room on a ship (up to your cold pads "). The end is terrible and a bit suspicious, either they ran out of money, or the former Soviet authorities demanded their ship back. I entered this film, knowing that it is bad, but did not pay attention to how bad it really is.
