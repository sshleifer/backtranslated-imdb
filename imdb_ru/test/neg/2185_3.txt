This film begins in A and never reaches B. Its name promises much more than the film gives. This is superficial and filled with the usual clichés of a story in which a guy questions his sexuality. The people are pleasant, even the obligatory bright type. Leadership (Kevin McKidd) replays as he has reason to act at all. Simon Callow, who plays on stage, is always worth a look, and he is definitely the only reason to stay with the film. However, the rubbish about his male group "meditations" or about anything else, becomes very tedious in a short time. They seem to have been thrown into a soft mix of the film in an erroneous attempt to change the setting and nonstop inaction. The same comment applies to a really strange and unconvincing trip to the hike. Do not worry about pausing the ribbon so you can have a snack. Let the thing work; You do not miss anything. The character of Hugo Weaving is superfluous. He appears in sequence with one of the smaller leads and does not even meet the others. The result of this sequence is not explained, and Hugo’s real estate transactions have nothing to do with history. In the end, the film is a complete disappointment, because there is no permission. Everything just disappears, and we go to the closing credits. This is an interlude without structure.
