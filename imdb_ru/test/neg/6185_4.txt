Does anyone remember BRAVEHEART? It starred Mel Gibson, who also directed and was the screenwriter Randall Wallace. The film contains more than 200 errors. Does anyone remember GREEN BEARINGS? This is the western part of John Wayne, where the duke rescues a mansion called Vietnam from a group of inuns from the kommi tribe. If you watch "We were soldiers", you can not remember these two films. <br /> <br /> First of all, what about this Scottish cry that played three times in the film, four, if you count the final credits? I mean, what is the connection between Scotland and Nem? Maybe Wallace is using this in the vain hope that because BRAVEHEART has been bombarded - I may add that deservedly by several Oscars, this film too? Whatever the reason it turned on, it is really annoying. Gibson plays Hal Moore as a cross between William Wallace and John Wayne, and I expected him to say something like “They will never take our freedom — damn it, they will,” and it’s impossible not to notice other similarities with GREEN BEER for example , the story of how a journalist takes a weapon and turns into a warrior, and Moore tells the journalist about the guilt in a scene almost identical to that seen in the film Wayne. <br /> <br /> Not reminding the audience about other WWS films also cannot stand on their own feet, they are based on real events of 1965, but they seem to lack the integrity necessary for the fairness of the story, it never feels like 1965 year and not enough sense of time and place, probably because it was shot in America, not in Asia. Hal Moore may have familiarized himself with the French experience in Indochina, but if so, he was unique because the US military tried their best not to read the French war in Indochina, even when asked about the previous conflict, Westmoreland replied that there is nothing to learn from the French "Who has not won the war since the time of Napoleon", so I was puzzled by the image of the NCA in this film, when in 1965 the American high command, overwhelmed with pride, despises North Vietnamese and venture capitalists. It looks like the story was rewritten to show that rice farmers in Vietnam are excellent warriors. Yes, but very few Americans believed this in the mid-1960s. <br /> <br /> I was embarrassed by a couple more things, for example, how wives returning home receive telegrams that their husbands are dead? No bodies were brought back to the base, and no one on the screen could see who was killed in the La Drang valley. Similarly, we did not see reinforcements appearing on the screen, so how can we suddenly see Americans among the NVA? I explained this to the blunders of the director and editor from Wallace, who did not strike me as a director, and his biggest problem seems to be to convey the horror of the battle. Take the scene where the American burned to a crisp, shouting "Tell my wife that I love her." This should have an emotional impact, similar to the scene of death in PLATOON, but there is no effect here. In fact, I found the scene as clichéd and patronizing, and he is not the only character who utters the words "Tell my wife ...", while mutilated or dying, I figured that at least two other characters use this phrase. Did the characters really say that in battle? I have no idea, but since Randall Wallace wrote the script, I have doubts. <br /> <br /> I was shocked by the fear of watching APOKALIPS NOW, PLOT AND KILLING FIELDS make my eyes get wet, I laughed at the FULL METAL JACKET I continued to look at my watch with the HART HUNTER, and after saw that we were soldiers, I felt completely patronized
