Just saw this movie last night. I remember the hype about his release and, to be honest, if I watched it then, I would not be so generous. I hate the hype, it can ruin the movie. I think the film obscures the characters and pays too much attention to Woody. He was also good - although he continued to wonder if he was stoned all the time. It never went too deep. Redford was dark, but not too dark, and his character let me down in the end. For me, he had to be more confrontational with Demi — kick her out or tell her that she was paid. In the end, he would have investigated them before he made the offer — this is not shown in the film, but no one in his intended position would have made the offer to anyone. He was cruel to such an extent that he broke them, and the last straw was the house, and yet Demi fell in love with him? The passages giving an understanding of the relationship of Demi and Woody were the best part of the film. There was a deep depth that eclipsed the superficiality of the character of John Gages. He really could have been much stronger, and, as other people hinted, I think the draw in the movie was Redford and they didn’t want to tarnish his “image.” I say, what the hell was Robert old in this movie! The characters of Woody and Demi were in a sense naive, but I think it was very deliberate to draw you into their plight and to defend their decision. But the reality is that they lost their dream home and where did they go? Las Vegas? gambling what they have left, and then accept the offer from the insanely rich billionaire. I discovered their naivety when Redford seduced them too unreal. Cinema could have been a lot more, and other actors would have mattered, but saying that it was nice on TV late at night was pleasant, and if you don’t think too much, it’s also acceptable
