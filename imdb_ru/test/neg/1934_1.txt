This is probably a cultural thing - anyway, the natives of this country were deemed ridiculous. I experienced this phenomenon first-hand, during an open-air film screening, where this film was shown before the film was shown. Most of the local audience laughed, and no, it was not in a sanatorium or clinic for backward children, it was in a prosperous area, and the audience consisted mainly of educated adults. <br /> <br /> So, it must somehow be possible to find it funny, but, to be honest, I don’t know what is needed for this — maybe air or water, the long-term effect of which causes this condition . Something must cause this, obviously, the only thing I can say is that I am quite sure that it does not cause this: the film itself. <br /> <br /> This is no joke. This brain is dead, stupid, meaningless, unfunny, lame. In short, it is a waste of time. Any Tom and Jerry funnier, damn it, even a funeral is funnier. <br /> <br /> In case you are lucky that you didn’t see any of Stozhay’s performances: these are three guys who behave, run, even talk like backward children, causing all kinds of unfunny lawlessness without real purpose and without real conclusion. It's like ugly teletubbies without cute costumes. <br /> <br /> Sitting in a crowd watching this garbage in this country can be quite annoying because you feel that you are at a party with a bunch of stupid people, and you are only the one who did not smoke anything. <br /> <br /> So if you are not ready to intoxicate yourself to make it tolerant, or do not arm yourself with something that makes people think that the three ugly old men act like morons, Funny, my advice about this: stay that way. Long away.
