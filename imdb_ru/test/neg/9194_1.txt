Is there a fireman cliche that is NOT used in this movie? From the initial film “I'm getting old for this” through the “pranks” of firefighters, to the “disturbing wife”, the loss of his best friend at the fire station, to the final funeral of the dead brothers, this film looks and sounds like it was written by Disney (“Our research shows that the audience really likes it when ...” and then they put it in). <br /> <br /> There is nothing original here. Any emotions that we have for these guys cause our admiration and feelings for firefighters. <br /> <br /> Go and see “Save me” if you want to see real heroes: ordinary guys with flaws who don’t think of running into a burning building to save strangers.
