It was a terribly bad movie! Ashley Rose Orr was terrible, she had no charm to Shirley Temple EVERYTHING! Those horrible smiles she would make when she narrowed her piglets with small eyes so that I think it “should” be nice and make the audience move - “aaaaa, bless!” It just made me want to hit her. She must have brewed "oh my goodness!" about a hundred times throughout the film. She also could barely utter a sentence without accompanying him with a fake laugh. A horrible horrible movie .. If I could rate it minus 10, I would. Do not waste your money on this piece of garbage, go out and buy a genuine Shirley Temple movie!
