My Wife and Children were announced as their own Cosby 00's show, but, unlike the last one, it was unfunny and unsightly. In fact, this is so poorly written, and some of the jokes revolve around Michael Mickey, perceiving the dumbness of Michael Jr. and the fact that he is such a loser who became more and more tiresome and annoying when the show went on. <br /> What was supposed to be a promising hit eventually turned into a stupid, stupid idea of ​​where ideas have become so OTT and ridiculous. As for the second Claire, in the end I did not like this character so much: she became a spoiled, childish and moaning teenage boy in most of the later episodes. <br /> <br /> MWAK was not the legislator of the show at Cosby, rather, it was just a bad black comedy series by general standards.
