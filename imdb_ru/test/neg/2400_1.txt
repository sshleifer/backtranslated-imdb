The filmmakers forgot to link the dots - that is, the sequence of events and choices that led from Charlie Wilson and the anti-Soviet Mujahideen to Al-Qaida and Usama bin Laden and eventually to September 11th. The filmmakers, of course, forget to tell us the background - why were the Soviets in Afghanistan? strengthened the hand of anti-Western forces and became a big factor contributing to the confusion that we face today (the events of September 11, terrorist networks, the protracted ground war in Afghanistan, etc.). Since these consequences are not spelled out, the film makes the viewer feel sympathy for Mr. Wilson (hey, see his latest projects on the Internet) instead of seeing him as a person whose actions are contrary to the interests of his country and the West as a whole.
