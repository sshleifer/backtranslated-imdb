Calling it a Sunday School film can be generous because, even as a Christian, I found the religious message so one-dimensional that I would not like to see it in my church. The message reads: “Read your Bible, go to church and sign up for fire insurance so that you don't get left behind with admiration.” There was no love. I guess that when you get right to this, I don’t believe in the god depicted in this film. The guy who was supposed to receive all the spiritual answers came across as Count Dracula. <br /> <br /> In addition to the spiritual / religious element, the script was tedious - repeating the same thing over and over again. This could fill in some actions that could not be persuaded the first time, so they simply repeated the same thing over and over again. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the final scenes, I thought that this made sense without hitting someone on the head and not leaning over the Sunday School formula. The film was not entirely bad, only most of it. <br /> <br /> I am for cleaner films that are well-made and that represent the truth without preaching. Unfortunately, it was not one of them. I took my family to this film, wanting to support such a film. Now I want my money back.
