I was bored with this film, melodramatic for no apparent reason. Every thing becomes so serious, and people swear at really stupid expressions. Then there is the serial killer, who obviously can kill one person to get the title of a serial killer. Well, the series "The Murderer" loves butterflies and is illustrated with sound effects that can be heard in the sequence of dreams of most modern films; <br /> <br /> why? I have no idea. It really wants to be scary, but I think that in this universe, scary equals say a whole bunch and add dark ambient noises. Just for the record, this is by no means a horror movie, its most definitely a thriller (barely). In fact, filmmakers should now do their homework before making horror films or at least calling a horror movie. it makes me say (ironically) "helpers, you take forever to say nothing."
