I have to say that this is better than most SyFy walks, but that says little. <br /> <br /> The plot is that someone buys a game created from the bones and skin of a dead witch from the Spanish Inquisition (and no one ever expects the Spanish Inquisition!) He and his friends play the game, only to be interrupted halfway when a friend who went for a run with a beer was killed as the game predicted. <br /> This is followed by a series of murders, typical of a movie like this, or any of the movies "Final Destination." He has a riddle at the end and an interesting plot with a policeman who wants the game to return his family ... but otherwise itâ€™s just a mess.
