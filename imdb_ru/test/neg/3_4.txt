Wow, another movie of Kevin Costner's hero. Postman, Tin Cup, Waterworld, Bodyguard, Wyatt Earp, Robin Hood, even this baseball movie. He seems to be making films specifically to be the center of attention. Characters are almost always the same ... heroism, shortcomings, greatness, fall, redemption. Yes, during the first 5 minutes of the film, we should all be delighted with his character, and from there he will accumulate more and more. <br /> <br /> And this time the story ... the story? ... this is just a collage of different films. You do not need a spoiler; You have seen this film several times, although it had different names. You will know what will happen before it happens. Itâ€™s like mixing Officer and Gentleman with Backdraft, but both of these films are easier. Look at Backdraft to see how this film should be made ... and also to see how a good but slightly underrated actor, Russell, plays a hero.
