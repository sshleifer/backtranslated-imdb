This movie should be one of the most boring and stupid films Perrugorria has ever made. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s like a commercial from start to finish. "Director" all the time spent on a tripod, he has no pace, rhythm. This is illogical. what a mess you can tell what will happen from the first 15 minutes to the end ... Wow <br /> <br /> ------ spoiler Jesus God, how the hell did Perrugoria be shot dead? Are you serious? The worst scene when someone was shot! <br /> <br /> ------ The end of the spoiler ----- <br /> <br /> Bad direction, bad script, bad game ... Really bad in general. I would not recommend this film at all. This is a waste of money and time.
