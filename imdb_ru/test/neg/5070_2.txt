Another example of the "women in prison" genre. This is not exactly a genre known for the quality of films, but it is a step below the majority. A group of women are taken from brothels where they work to a prison on a rocky island. Once there, they are exposed to a large number of ill-directed sex and brutal "dialogue." For a film with an amazing amount of sex and nudity, there is nothing erotic about it. Sex scenes are awkwardly played out, and some scenes, such as a scene in the shower, seem to drag on and grow. However, there are at least some minimum production values. On a W-i-P scale, I would put it above the Frauen Zellenblock's Noyn's fur, but below the Chain Heat.
