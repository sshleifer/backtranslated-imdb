When I first saw “Race Against Fear” (don't you like the names of LMN films?), I had to scratch my head all the time. Should it be serious? Why can't the main character run like an ordinary running man, and even more so, like a star runner? How did I know that the coach was angry only 1 minute after the movie began? All these questions and no answers. Then I just let the meaningless script and horrible direction just take me with me ... it was easier not to resist ... then the film became more and more ridiculous with every minute, and now I rank it among my ten most unnecessary films from LMN, Some said here that Ariana Richards is really talented, but the material was spoiled - I sincerely disagree. Not only can she not convince me that she is an athlete, she walks with wide eyes, as if she has just landed on the ground. Maybe the coach got out of jail and finished her off ... at least I hope so.
