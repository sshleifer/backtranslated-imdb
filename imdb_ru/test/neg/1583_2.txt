Well, what is this story about again? I'm afraid I never read a book, and, frankly, it was one of the most convoluted films I've ever tried to watch in a long time. I'm a little confused about the number of memories between a nurse, a patient, and a person with no thumbs. The film did not even explain what they were looking for in the desert until he found it; or even how in the world they all knew each other to unite. <br /> <br /> After recently watching the movie “Pride and Prejudice” with Colin Firth, I tried to explore his film career. watching his other films, and right, except for “What does a girl want,” I do not find much, where he played, that would be good. I definitely do not say that he was not good. He is actually one of the best actors I have seen in contemporary films, but the content and quality of the films in which he plays have a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> “The English Patient” is another great example of how a director, a writer and a film crew are too close to their subject to see that the viewer is not getting the picture ?? literally. The whole film seemed to show Ralph Fiennes as a dramatic actor with long periods of emotion, which was boring. In fact, nothing is explained, and every subject requires a psychoanalytic assessment from the very beginning! <br /> <br /> The character Kristin Scott Thomas seems to like to describe erotic stories facing a completely male audience and teasing other men besides her husband; Does Colin Firth, who plays her husband, not necessarily have all his balls in place and must be a secret agent ?? Seem to be; and Ralph Fiennes is walking like a roman mr. Darcy (sorry Colin!), who thinks he knows all this. The rest of the cast is played out (pun intended) for the four winds while the plot wanders. <br /> <br /> The story about the psychic stability of a nurse (Juliette Binoche) and her motives and involvement with Naveen Andrews is another confusing element that leaves the viewer with an unpleasant taste. But, of course, the viewer is still shocking how, in the world, the first two characters (Thomas and Fiennes) ended up having sex for the first time anyway. What was the appeal? There was no chemistry and no build-up. Just a slap in the face, BAM, thanks! <br /> <br /> And isn't it romantic that Fiennes ended up by helping the Germans by betraying the cards to the desert? (sarcasm) <br /> <br /> To describe this film, I just need to say: “How to hit your gynecologist with a mammogram and deceive your sweet, charming husband who loves you”. <br /> <br /> The last incredible section of this story is to understand how someone would choose Ralph Fiennes instead of Colin Firth. Fert had very few opportunities to demonstrate any of his acting talents. in fact, when I watched the movie, I thought that he was one of the first. The scene where he had been waiting for his wife all night was perhaps the only two-second clip worth seeing in the film. At the same time I am not interested to watch it again. <br /> <br /> The best scene I liked was a plane crash in which Firth tries to destroy them all. Too bad he missed! That would save an extra twenty minutes of an even more barren movie. The aerial desert scenes were pretty neat.
