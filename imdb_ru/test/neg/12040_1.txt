The first scene really made me watch a movie. However, no more than 5 minutes later I put out my eyes. Not only did I not understand the spoken word, acting could be better for a group of mentally handicapped. One of the highlights of this film was that it was a punk white dwarf. However, I did not quite understand how a white dwarf was a child of two blacks. But I think everything is possible. Also, what the hell is Robin in the movie? I'm not sure it added anything artistic. In general, I strongly recommend that you jump off a cliff before making this movie.
