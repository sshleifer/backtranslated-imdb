I remember seeing it a few years ago, it had a rather promising start, with an interesting premise, but then it quickly turned into nonsense. Uninteresting characters, failed attempts to add drama and tension, and a bit of simplified philosophy added as well, everything ends with a terrible ending. <br /> <br /> It's just rubbish. <br /> <br /> Before I watched this television film, I didn’t think that someday I would have any film that, in my opinion, was the “worst” I’ve seen, but after I finished watching this movie, I understood it. If anyone asked me which movie was the worst film I've ever seen, I could say without hesitation, "The Second Coming." <br /> <br /> Avoid.
