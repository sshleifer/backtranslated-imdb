Another pretentious film from Vicente Aranda. If Juana la loca was the same, at least its quality was excellent (mainly due to the excellent performances of Pilar Lopez de Ayala), but Carmen is boring and full of themes (hot brunette with a dagger in stocking) - for passion, gangs of Sierra Nevada, "torero", ...) <br /> <br /> Obviously, Paz Vega is a pretty woman, but there are more doubts in her talent, and Swaraglia. incredible. The screenplay is weak, and Arandaâ€™s presumptuous character influences the entire film. With these ingredients, the result can not be good. <br /> <br /> Not the worst film I've ever seen, but a complete failure, in my opinion.
