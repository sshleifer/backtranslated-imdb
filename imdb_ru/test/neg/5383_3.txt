I like films of different types and qualities. Whether it’s your typical standard Hollywood action movie or the tear-down Oscar, films that meet certain standards will almost always be pleasant to me. <br /> <br /> In “Soap Girl” I got only confusion. First we meet with Maya, a massage parlor worker who seems to attract all the clients in the salon. One day a poet-maiden named Harry comes and they fall in love. After that, the plot gets a variety of turns, which, it seems, lead nowhere. <br /> <br /> While many have commented on the controversial issue of an Asian prostitute exploited by a white man, keep in mind that this film was shot by an Asian director who wanted to shed light on this problem. But it does not matter whether he succeeds or not, because at hand is the question of whether the film will be pleasant or not. <br /> <br /> For me, Soap Girl does not meet the standard I expect from movies. It was difficult for me to participate emotionally in this film, given the free plot and mediocre game. Worse, it seems that the director wanted to do drama when the tone becomes more and more comedic. <br /> <br /> A film like “The Soap Girl,” which cannot lure me into the magic of cinema, will always leave me alone. is boring. Throughout the film, I could not help but think: “What is it really about?” The film must answer this question before it is made. If not, you will get an empty push to captivate the audience. <br /> <br /> Rating: D + <br /> <br />
