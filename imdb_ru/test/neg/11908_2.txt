The Canterville Ghost (1996). The director made it too juicy performance. Maybe this is a generation, but I really liked the version of Charles Lawton. There is a time and a place for "emotions", and this production is not very well translated. Patrick Stewart, who spoke Shakespeare, was very good, but still inappropriate. I do not recommend and do not look again. Close-ups and amended text and subtitles were lost for me. Adding extraneous materials and scenes takes away really great work. The screenwriter should find another profession in which he could lose his talent, maybe soap operas would be the best places. Check out the really good version and pass this.
