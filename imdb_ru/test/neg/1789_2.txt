A handful of young college sisters decide to go camping with a professor. Giant druids want to sacrifice them to prevent the onset of the Apocalypse in 2000, they also have to fight off bikers, Indians and monsters like Loch Nes. It is worth looking only for 3 reasons, George 'Buck' Flower (sadly unsung the main character of B-films) is in his hands like a tramp, and the other two belong to the terrific Savannah (in one of 3 roles she did not have). Both have very small roles. It is a pity that everything else in the film is terribly bad. <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD Extras: Original trailer Eye candy: 4 pairs of breasts, 2 donkeys
