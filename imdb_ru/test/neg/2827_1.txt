You know, I don’t know what the teenage life of everyone else was like, but it doesn’t reflect the people I knew and talked to, not to mention myself. And just in case, if you are interested ... NO .. we were not first-class / purebred teenagers like Pat Boone. (If ever there was such a thing !!!!) <br /> <br /> Listen, I am NOT saying that being a teenager is easy. The best, in fact, the BEST teen movie of this time is “Fast Times in Ridgemont High.” Now those children whom I knew and were as realistic as they were then (and, maybe, now). <br /> <br /> That was crap. It was the low-rent version of the Fast Times, and even then it gave me little. I had a few moments, but I didn’t have enough to recommend it or even state that “this was the case with teenagers in 1982”. I could not communicate. The lead girl (girls) did nothing for me, and please, if they really wanted to preserve their virginity, they would do it, in this case this film would not be made. Pure shit and a bad product that needs to be left as a cinema with time capsules for teens and young people in the early 80s.
