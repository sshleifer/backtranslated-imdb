Miranda Cosgrove is known for her debut in the "School of Rock" with Jack Black and her role as Megan in the Drake and Josh show, and she became a favorite among Nickelodeon fans, so it’s not surprising that Dan Schneider would create a show just for her. Unfortunately, the result is as bad as if the Amanda Show were not. <br /> <br /> “iCarly” is three friends, Carly, Sam and Freddie, who became idols in the Higher Youth Community through a web show called “iCarly”. Carly and Sam are the hosts, and Freddie shoots and uploads it on the Internet. Carly also has an older brother named Spencer, played by the jolly Jerry Traynor, who is known for his work in Drake and Josh as Mad Steve. <br /> <br /> Ok, let me tell you this. Do not believe 8.3 out of 10 of this show, received because it is pitiful in almost all respects, Dan Schneider probably passed about 5 minutes of studying teenage interests, because all I see is what he says : “IPod? IPhone? Ihome? Aha Teens love everything that starts with “I”! ”And most of the concerts that were used in“ Drake and Josh ”, if not, they are just very dry and violent jokes that don’t even count on a generous chuckle, such as“ You want so I turn on the air conditioner at 60 degrees? "" No. We want you to turn on up to 60 pickles! " Not only that, but if you look carefully, almost all the sets in the show were used in Drake and Josh and Declassified Ned, which were simply polished with random things to try to make them look different. br /> <br /> The scenes where the show shows the iCarly network broadcast are as terrible as the entire series. The dialogue in them is terribly bad, which can be accepted by some, because they are just two friends playing in front of the camera, but what about the really strange, not funny tricks they do, like “Random dances!”? And this only gets worse. <br /> <br /> In terms of acting, Miranda and Jennett are far from the best. Nathan Kress, who played Freddie, is hard to believe at times, but he does an excellent job. The man who really steals the show is the humorous master Jerry Trainor, who fits very well into the role of his “defensive older brother”, and his playing with wide eyes and loud lips can play a rather amusing role. It is a pity that they are not frequent, because it could give the show an extra star, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Dan Schneider must have made this show for the sole purpose of giving Miranda Cosgrove her own telegraph. a playground where you can jump and spew jokes and ridiculous jokes in all directions, because everyone else has an exceptional talent, buried under a poorly made script and weightless game. Dan Schneider did a great job with Drake and Josh, so it's a real disappointment that iCarly is such a failure. Jerry Trainor’s acting skills saved this show from a rating of 1 out of 10, but he alone cannot save iCarly from being terrible.
