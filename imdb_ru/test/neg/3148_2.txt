As a child of the 1980s, I grew up with numerous educational as well as distracting programs (or both), and I continue to learn from them so much now that I admire the wisdom of those who worked on them. Learning that Sesame Street, to name the best example, was not the only one responsible for the fact that I could read at an adult level before I could walk, she only intensified the disgust that I feel not only towards Lyon Corporation and its product. But those who protect them, too. As if I believed in those we nominate to protect us or our children from the very beginning, the fact that Barney & Friends still pollutes our radio waves after more than ten years is a discredit not only for the FCC, American commerce and its manufacturers. This is the discredit of all mankind. In a world where the police, social welfare services and child protection agencies can pursue me without prosecution, simply because I was not born to those in power, but broadcasters are allowed to pour this nonsense into my home with impunity, you should ask is it? something is wrong with people. <br /> <br /> You see, in a world where people expect us to behave like adults and consider ourselves, what we say to our sons and daughters is important because often has consequences after we left Not only our attempts to make our children more normal, more similar, more thinking, potentially destructive, but what we ultimately teach them to be normal also plays a big role. So the question becomes one of the things that Barney teaches our children to be normal. In addition to such lessons, like what we are not very good, if we do not have good feelings, or that someone will change the rules to make us happy when we come shortly, to other shocking things that we are shown on Barneyâ€™s show, Barney's pestering of children is related. The problem of child abduction and child abuse is a big problem in our society, and since we started trying to pretend that this is not the case, this could be qualified as one of the most inappropriate ways of presenting the topic. /> <br /> So far, I have only mentioned the inappropriate and emotionally destructive lessons that Barney himself presents. To the problem are added the children shown on the show. Here I use the word "children" freely, as the age shown varies from three to fourteen years. However, no difference in the emotional response is manifested in any of the manifestations. Fourteen-year-olds react to Barney and the situations proposed to him in the same way as five-year ones. Specialists in child and adolescent autism especially consider this an incredibly dirty thing that children are exposed to. Adults from the autism spectrum who faced growing problems, as their needs were not only not met, but ignored, tend to watch and feel like doing things with Barney that would make fourteen-year-olds cry. Being disrespectful and sick, like the market-oriented shows for older children, such as "You Can't Do It on Television," they capture Barney, demonstrating that different ages not only react differently to the same thing, but and different people. <br /> <br /> In response to mdmireles1295, I must say that, hell, I hope that they have no children. Every time when I see one of the parents show this nonsense to his child, I have an overwhelming desire to report them to the police for the cruel treatment of children. And I speak as a person whose upbringing was at the mercy of violence. They can sing about manners, love, care or intercourse, but the examples they show are not only one-sided that they are the opposite of educational, they are so devoid of realism that they become dangerous, as the Light Newt has already indicated. The lessons that children learn from Barney are that people do not change, feelings must be suppressed at all costs, and the rules are completely arbitrary. Compared with the lessons, variations are what makes the world go round, and even the most bitter feelings have a goal that television taught me as a child, it still amazes that the authorities have yet to intervene and tear this garbage out of the air. If the parent did what his child was doing all over the world to Barney, they would be charged with criminal charges. <br /> <br /> So I gave Barney my favorite two out of ten points, which I give to all trash, absolutely without redemption. value. In the world of adults who know how to properly respond to their children, he has no place.
