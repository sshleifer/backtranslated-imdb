If you haven't seen War at Home, let me tell you what you missed. This is a show about ethnic diversity and sexuality, which could be sharp and funny only in the 60s. Where America grew up in accepting race, sexual preferences, religion, etc. ... this show seems to be arguing with this progress. This is the reverse step in the evolution of America. <br /> <br /> For example, one of the series’s constant jokes is that WHITE’s daughter meets a BLACK kid from school. This is obviously a funny vision of how you cannot see such relationships in any mall in America. I lived in both small and big cities, so do not excuse me for the red state. This is not only a joke, but also a father who, presumably, is not a racist, finds this anxious and asks his daughter to part with her boyfriend several times, which contradicts his “he may sound like a racist, but he’s just stupid” character. <br /> <br /> If this is not enough, the second joke is that one of the sons, who will soon become metrosexual, is ambiguous in his sexual orientation. The public again and again learns that he is not gay, but the father is not convinced, so he constantly avoids his son, fearing that his son will strike him, since all gays are wild nymphomaniac who can control his will. The father always comes to some recognition of his son, once on the show, but usually continues to avoid him in the next episode. <br /> <br /> The only way this show can cure itself in my eyes is if there is a continuous impact on these "unnatural life events", open your father's eyes a little, but this may be too much to ask - and besides, with such jokes, I am sure we will have gaiety in the episodes that will come, as - Episode 13 “Father votes against women voters” and the 14th series “My Muslim neighbor is a terrorist”. <br /> <br /> Please throw this show, FOX. We live in a world different from the one in which your leaders grew up.
