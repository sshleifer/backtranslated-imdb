IMDb lists this film as a comedy. I have no idea what genre this film belongs to, but this is definitely not a comedy. Maybe a tragedy. <br /> <br /> I won’t say whether this is a good film or not. All I know is not a comedy. Tonight I wanted to laugh, and I had a strange idea that someone was attached to an ugly chair. <br /> <br /> This film is not what is advertised. This is a film school, which, as I can imagine, is designed to “make people think”. I would not recommend this film to anyone I know or do not even know. This is ridiculous nonsense, which makes no sense. <br /> <br /> It made me think well. It made me think: “I wish I could return these ninety minutes of my life.” <br /> <br /> I am sure that the world is full of critics in the chairs, liberal-minded in their worldview, which will make In this film worth watching them. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of them.
