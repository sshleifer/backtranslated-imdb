Well, I thought the movie was bla 1/10. <br /> <br /> In any case, the best part is the first 5 minutes of a movie with a nerd or some other girl, this is the part that you guys expect. a casual actor? Hell no, it wasn't really a model named Larisa McComas, but you already knew that it was <br /> <br /> So it made sense, but that's the whole movie (which I saw anyway) ) I didn’t care about 4, and didn’t bother to look at the rest. That's all I need for C to be satisfied, so 2 of you who just care about that well, you go enjoy
