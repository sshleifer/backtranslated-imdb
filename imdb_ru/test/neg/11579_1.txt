**** SPOILER WARNING **** My boyfriend, a few friends and I shot this film as part of a marathon of really bad movies. We kind of knew what we got into. But the lack of plot, direction and special effects actually made us hope for an excellent (or passable) battle scene between the two main characters ... poorly drawn floating cobra and super strong giant komodo (which ate people like scooping ice cream) ... we sort of Got it in the end, but had to be interrupted due to a possible budget or time constraints? One of his qualities is that he is ridiculously bad, with many significant details pointed out by other readers. I recommend this movie if you cut a bow to make yourself cry.
