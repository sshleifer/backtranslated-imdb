From time to time it is very desirable for the aristocracy to watch some dumb film about the harsh life of ordinary people in order to remind themselves of the privileges and comfortable life that they have enjoyed since the beginning of humanity or even before that ?? compared to the difficult and hard work that ordinary people have to endure every day, since aristocrats rule the world. <br /> <br /> And this is what happens in “The Light of Love”, the first film directed by Dame Frans Marion, who will later become famous in the world of silence and talkativeness thanks to his work as a screenwriter; Of course, better for her, because her career as a director does not impress this German earl. <br /> <br /> The film tells about Lady Angela Carlotti (Dame Mary Pickford), a cheerful Italian who lives surrounded by “picturesque misery” (an important difference in opinion between the upper and lower classes; aristocrats prefer to live in the surroundings of “scenic luxury "??); she has two brothers and a secret admirer, but all that she gives him in return is indifference. Fate begins to work hard, and pretty soon war is declared, and the two brothers of the lady Angela are credited, and on the next drum both are dead. But fate is even tougher, and in the meantime Dame Angela falls in love with ?? German !! And even worse, she does not know that her Teutonic candy is a spy and that the light signals that she sends him every night from the lighthouse, which she supports, thinking that this is a love signal, does not mean “Ich Liebe Dich” sink any damn Italian boat in the sea "? <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Lady Angela, pretty soon her sweet German spy will be found by neighbors in her house, in which she hid it (not really, a strange fact, because the German hard to go unnoticed ??), but the German spy would prefer to die before being captured Starred by these Italians. <br /> <br /> This German love will give birth to a semi-Eutonian child (evil Fate at full speed ??), but an avid neighbor who has a special idea of ​​motherhood will enthrall her son with the consent of the Catholic nun who brought Trent's advice to the extreme is a fact that will put Dame Angela on the brink of madness. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Dame Angela's secret admirer has returned from the war, and you may think that the sad life of Dame Angela will finally improve; a huge mistake, because Destiny had prepared for her that the returned soldier was blind. But, as they say in Germany, this may be a disguised blessing, and, finally, Dame Angela will restore her son and start a new life with her blind candy in a poor Italian village in what should be a happy ending for ordinary people. people. <br /> <br /> As this German artist said earlier, for Lady Francis Marion it was much better for her to continue her career as a screenwriter, because, as can be seen from “The Light of Love”, she had a lot of imagination to come up with incredible stories, i! but a completely different topic - to direct films, and in her silent debut there is a lack of emotion and rhythm, despite the efforts of Lady Pickford to draw viewers to her many shameful things. The non-existent plot of the film causes indifference in the viewer who makes this film, where only Lady Pickford herself, and not her circumstances, is of interest. <br /> <br /> And now, if you let me, I must temporarily take My leave, because this German earl must send Morse signals from the northern tower of Schloss to one of his wealthy Teutonic heirs.
