Seriously, this movie is not. Steve Guttenburg constantly imposes his cool dialogue, and then constantly gives everyone the evil eye. He just wasn't believable, he seems to be trying to be cool, and he sucks at it. I just remember him as a millionaire dad with Olsen twins in the movie It Takes Two ... so this is a BIG change. I made this film for Sean Bean, and he dies (as usual). Only this time he was not pierced at the anchor of the boat (Patriot Games), broken by a giant satellite dish (Goldeneye) or killed by cows (The Field). He was just shot, very quickly and civilly, and that was all I got from this film, that they didn't kill him in an extremely grotesque and painful way. How sad is that? I just watched it for the 3 seconds that Sean was in, and then everything else was rubbish. I really tried to see and understand the plot, but in fact it was not there. It looked like Mission Impossible with a hole: â€œOooooh! There is a mole! This is the leader of the group, and NO ONE EXPECTED IT! Exhausted and tired, this film was a waste of time.
