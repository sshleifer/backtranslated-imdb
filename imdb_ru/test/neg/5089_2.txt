wow, i just looked it up. <br /> <br /> Like the post-production CRAPPY in this film. <br /> <br /> I’m not joking, I literally could cope better myself. <br /> <br /> All post-production has flaws, all of it. Whoever cuts this film should be banned in the film industry. <br /> <br /> In addition, the script was a train wreck. Absolute trash. <br /> <br /> Not to mention Jack Bauer and his "Spotted Pirate" with the accent "Sponge Bob". Wtf his character does there? But for me the biggest drawback was the development of character, interaction, dynamics, dialogue. BLIMEY. I can not believe how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I give this film 2 out of 10. 1 for Samantha, who is a great actress, is too bad that everyone made everyone look like lovers. <Br /> <br /> another is in cinematography, which was really good. <br /> <br /> Also, my friend, this is one bad movie. <br /> <br /> I don’t even want to make a difficult post about this, it was just a terrible production. Poor actors did not know what they got into ...
