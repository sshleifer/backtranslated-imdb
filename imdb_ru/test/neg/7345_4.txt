Briefly describes a priest who lacks faith, Daniel Clemens (Christian Slater), who is considering a case when they suspect the murder of another priest. The priest denies his guilt, but at the same time he can not discuss this issue due to confidentiality. Enter Daniel Clemens, who starts playing policeman ... <br /> <br /> Although the plot is not funny, everything else is there. Let's start with the visual side, cinematography is boring, more like a TV series than a movie. The corners of the camera are boring, in fact, in the whole film there is not a single memorable angle of the camera. There are no interesting close-ups to the details. And the transitions between scenes, well, there's nothing much to say about them, they are far from smooth, it seems that there is no connection between the scenes, except for the real plot. Well, they used a transition with music between the two scenes, but there were no interesting visual transitions throughout the film, the decay time was used, there was no visual connection between the scenes. <br /> <br /> The dull visual part can be forgiven if the film offers something else. Unfortunately, the film offers only a forced wooden game and awkward dialogue without a blow. In addition, the film suffers from problems with sound, the sound volume in the film decreases several times, as if the microphones were too far away. <br /> <br /> I did not predict the decision of the film. This may be because the film never gave me such an opportunity, or it could be related to a presentation that was so boring that I didn’t even try to figure it out. <br /> <br /> Connect two plus two together, and this equals B-film, where “B” means boring.
