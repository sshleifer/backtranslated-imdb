Although this is one of two films "Tales of Voodoo", volume 1, there is neither voodoo nor anything supernatural in it! The box is labeled “Hellhole”, but the title of the screen is “Escape from Hellhole”. The name is embarrassingly similar to Hell Hole (1978), known as Escape from the Women's Hell Hole. A group of women are swimming in the river, and it seems that the worst thing they have to worry about is a peeping volume that they easily overcome. However, in this or any other scene there is no nudity. <br /> <br /> A woman named Carden arrives at the car and it seems that all women know and love her. She invites Indri to come and live in the city with her and her uncle MG As soon as they get there, it becomes clear that M.G. Indri wants to take a virginity. M.G. manages some house of prostitution, and he is either in charge of a corrupt military unit, or he leads a paramilitary unit, or prefers his guards to wear military uniforms. <br /> <br /> Women who refuse him or in any other way create problems go to prison. Indri goes there. Women are tortured, and sometimes, possibly, raped by guards. <br /> <br /> Various unsuccessful attempts at escape or rescue are made, but they inevitably turn out to be unsuccessful, despite the obvious advantages that women have: they are far superior to the guards, and relatively few guards have automatic weapons - most have semi-automatic rifles or pistols. <br /> <br /> Lovers of the WIP genre may like this, and the fact that it was made in the Philippines gives it some novelty, but otherwise .. oh
