I watched movies on demand and saw Underdog for free, and it was only 82 minutes, so I decided to watch it. I did not expect much, but it exceeded all my expectations of being terrible. Everything in the film was terribly worthy. The dialogue was terrible, including many terrible puns. The jokes were terrible too. I caught myself shouting and turning off the TV screen while I was suffering because of this garbage. He hit his target audience very well, but I don't understand how anyone else could enjoy this movie. It really pissed me off and almost cried over all the terrible things this movie had for him. <br /> <br /> The only nice thing about this movie was the ability to give it 1/10 after watching. I ask you to avoid this at all costs. I understand the fact that it is made for children, but there is nothing pleasant about it.
