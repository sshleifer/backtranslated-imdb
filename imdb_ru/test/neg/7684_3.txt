Well, I will go clean and admit that, as part of my degree in history, I was forced to watch this film and then write a short review of the film as part of my assessment. <br /> <br /> But even if I watched one movie, on my own, I found it very boring and absurd. The style is dated not by years, and the acting is farcical. Instead of using dialogue, they instead exchange stunning looks at each other, and sometimes in the air. For me, such an excessive acting game does not convey any great emotions, and after I saw the close proximity of Ivanâ€™s face for the hundredth time, I prayed for the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing is the wrong character of Ivan. This man was disgusted, the killers and his bodyguards are cowardly. For me, the film was nothing more than a part of Stalinist propaganda, inaccurate and boring.
