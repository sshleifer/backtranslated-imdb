Most movies are crap with high production values, this one is crap without high production values. What distinguishes it from a lot of horrible movies. No matter how bad this film may be, I have to pay tribute to Catherine Aselton, which, I believe, with the right script, could play a pretty good role. She plays Emily, the friend of eternal fool Josh, who often calls her "Dude" or "Man" in a non-ironic tone. <br /> <br /> But what is important is Emily is a semi-believable character. This means that Rett will soon need to be added to the cast to counteract this almost believable character with a guy even more ridiculous than Josh. When we first meet Rett, we find out that he is “deep” because he shoots a video of a lizard, which is EVIDENT that he sees the world “uniquely!” Then Rett shows the film to Emily, and in one of the few incredible moments Emily amazes this amateur lizard record. I believe that this is how she reacts again, without any irony of sarcasm, even slightly hidden. <br /> <br /> In the scene that opens, you are warned that working with the camera will be shitty, we are opening on a shaky close-up of Josh when he is trying to win over the audience, acting GOOD! Oh, how not to worry about this main character, that he will act well! haha This film can be practically an example of how BAD films can be (and in this respect, how bad FAR films can get into the festival circuit, I mean, when comparing most of the crappy films, this film probably looked pretty cool). br /> <br /> I believe that SXSW awarded this film a small reward (oh, south of south-west, why do you encourage them, it’s just cruel). But that's where I give this film a compliment, it is the best of the mumbler movement. Recall that all other films about mumblecore are sucked beyond belief and usually include grotesque nudity and inconceivably bad play, but still, it is good to be the best in it. <br /> <br /> I haven’t seen the bags yet, but it looks like they may have taken a few steps forward, the preview, at least, made it bearable, although even the preview of the “Puffy Chair” could not hide the fact that it will suck. Here I went away from the topic, in any case, Rhett, most likely, is not depicted at all as a professional actor, much like Josh, most likely not an actor, but rather a director (or the director's brother, there are several mixed messages). I think Rhett was someone's friend, and they said, hey, why don't you play this guy named Rhett in the film, the fact that Rhett is the name of the actor, and the character probably means that the actor and the character is the same if I'm not mistaken. I'm not like that. <br /> <br /> If Rhett had shaved the raccoon off his face, you would probably say that he is attractive. Either way, Rhett, Emily and Josh come together to bring Puffy-Chair to Father Rhett and Josh. Along the way, some things happen, bad acting, bad supporting actors, crappy camera work, an attempt at significance. This film would not be bad if it were not so shamelessly pursuing a deep self-esteem. <br /> <br /> It's all amateur if you can watch this movie without paying for it, such as on TV or for rent in the library, and then consider looking to see if you like this super cheap style of filmmaking. I like what they are doing in general, making a film without a concept, but I would like them to make a film that someone would like to see.
