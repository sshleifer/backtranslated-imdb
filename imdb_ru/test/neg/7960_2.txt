The water shows the plight of Indian widows in the late 1930s, after all, says that the problem still exists mainly, providing statistics at the end, refers to Gandhi in the film several times before finally getting a scene with his and does not usually do anything innovative. or new in the film. Yes, the cinema is quite impressive, but this cannot be the soul of any film for me. <br /> <br /> India had several problems, like many other countries, but it got rid of many of these problems in general. What if in America a film about racism was made in a particular year, which ends with the fact that "the number of Americans is still experiencing racism today." <br /> <br /> a) How would it be appropriate, and, b) How would it be so unusual when you are portrayed in a movie. <br /> <br /> I read from Deepa Mehta. The interview was that this film was interpreted as a voice for the marginalized everywhere. From the reviews that I read everywhere, I often hear about how the director did a great job and showed courage in putting the problem to the world. The film is more about a specific problem that society faced (and which it got rid of thanks to reforms in general). <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t see anything terrible in the film. Moreover, the film did not have enough soul and shifted between the stories of Chuya and Kalyani. Sarala, a young Sri Lankan actress, beautifully portrayed the role of Chui, and this was the only thing that impressed me in the film, unfortunately.
