Well, they did it again with the new pumpkin head movie, the first pumpkin head movie was perfect for its time, dumb, bloody and cliche monster. This is how it happens, someone loses her beloved, goes to the witch in the forest, makes her raise the pumpkin's head and kill all the guilty. unfortunately, the filmmakers considered it inappropriate to try to do anything other than that for the fourth release of the film, believing that it would be much more appropriate to add a little unconvincing romeo and Juliet's plot, which includes idiotic family enmity and surprise surprises with the bloody murders of pumpkin heads, so far it is so formal, but this does not stop the acting talent in this film is terrible ... oh, so bad that half of them cannot even support the southern accent without slipping into their relatives and poshernye hundred accents. Lance Henriksen is on board, so he will surely bring some seriousness to the movies ... but no spear will just roam the screen, letting the words fall out of your mouth without any emotion or seemingly direction, and leaves again, I honestly , I think that he just came for the money, then went to his trailer to get drunk and remember the aliens. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this film, except that there is a redemptive trait in it, except for the endings of the captions, which signal its end. /> <br /> despite the shortcomings of ph: bf ... if you want an easy approach that will make you laugh for all the wrong reasons, watch this. <br /> <br /> if you want something with abit more meat and originality, avoid.
