I deliberately did not read a single review of this movie on IMDb before I watched it, because I really wanted to watch it and make a decision. I was a big fan of QT in the past, I think we can all agree that he made some great films, but lately he seems to have been defeated by his own mystery and disappeared from his own foundations. This “movie” proves it. It consists of several scenes of work bastards. Instead, it consists mainly of long, tedious and boring conversations between people, which after a while you realize that you just don’t say anything. It has been created for a long time, and there is no remarkable dialogue in it for which QT was responsible in the past. The whole film is anti-climatic. There is no tension - what should happen in each scene is so clearly marked by the telegraph that by the time this happens you don’t care. Honestly, people, do not believe deception. This is a very boring movie, and you don’t miss anything if you don’t see it.
