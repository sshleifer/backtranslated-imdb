First, let me start by saying that this film sounds very interesting: a serial killer, copying the works of Edgar Allan Poe (who is one of my writers of all time). Sounds cool, right? Yes, definitely not. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever And this is not an exaggeration. I have seen a lot of very, very bad movies. This one takes the cake. And I even got ready for a bad film before going into it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the writer should have studied some law enforcement procedure: if you have the name of the killer, the story of his life, the criminal record, and HIS ADDRESS, where should you look first? Hm , , possibly. , , his house? What kind?! NOT! This is a ridiculous idea, Anthony! How could you offer something so obvious and balanced than go bowling? * end of spoiler * To be honest, sometimes I can forgive a movie if the script is good, but the acting is bad, or vice versa. but this was just not how you could find it. <br /> <br /> I think my biggest trouble was how the police acted / FBI. <br /> <br /> For example: FBI Black Agent: “Okay, endangered woman, just sit here in this car in an empty parking lot while I go inside and inspect the potential crime scene where there should be a serial killer. Sounds good to you? ”Idiot FBI agent:“ Yes, that sounds normal to me. Go straight. I will definitely not focus on my surroundings or at least check the perimeter. ” Black FBI agent: “Fine, I would do that!” Honestly, if you want to be in law enforcement, rent this movie so you can learn not to act. , or if you are a person and want to learn the same. <br /> <br /> 0.5 / 10: half a point only for film production and in stores. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
