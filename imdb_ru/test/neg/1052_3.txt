“Physical evidence” is one of those films that you like, but in fact they should be much better than they actually are. Designed as a sequel to Jagged Edge for Glenn Close and Robert Loggia, it seems that all participants did this only in anticipation of something better. The room is ideal for maintenance, it is basically technically effective, if it is not terribly inspired by even the incredibly pleasant notes of Henry Mancini, but you can't help but feel that everything would turn out better if one of the reasons turned out to be a murderer ( happening). As shown by the initial scene of his little-known, personally disastrous Heat (1986), Reynolds has all the ideas of the great villain on the screen. As it is, there are some surprises and a feeling of indecisive shooting by numbers, as this creates an interception head, as it selflessly strolls to a less great will-it-do? The final. <br /> <br /> Reynolds is fine, sailing on charisma in a clearly star-shaped car. Unfortunately, this cannot be said about Teresa Russell. An impressive and fearless actress in the films of Nick Roag's husband, which allows her to plunge into the dark side of human nature, she fell into a trap in parts that require stellar quality, not depth, and she did not get him to spikes. She does not indulge in her own lines and does not come across other actors, but this is all that can be said in favor of her surprisingly elevated and often amateur game that badly fails the film. In addition to Attorney Ned Beatty, the cast adds a slightly surreal presence in Boston, where everyone seems to have a disguised Canadian accent, and the streets have a striking resemblance to Toronto and Montreal. <br /> <br /> Similarly, director Michael Crichton, who at Westworld, Coma and The First Great Train Robbery showed that he knew how to tilt the audience to the edge of his seats, seems to be coping with the action purely superficially - indeed, one short pursuit of frames does not even coincide and seems almost arbitrary. The climax itself has no talent and is completely free from threat or danger, and many scenes are played out much cheaper than they are worth it. It is not surprising that, apart from the uncredited re-filming of the “13th Warrior”, Crichton has not filmed since then. <br /> <br /> It's enough to watch it in an 80s TV movie, even if it never falls short of the promise of opening it. Whether there are enough reasons to see this depends on the individual taste.
