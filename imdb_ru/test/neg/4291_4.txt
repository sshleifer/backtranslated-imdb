First, I must point out that the role played by Wendell Cory was exceptional. Usually, Corey was assigned minor roles, but it was he who helped shoot this very weak film. Without him and the character he played, the film would have been much worse - hardly deserved 2 or 3. <br /> <br /> So why did I hate the rest of the movie so much? Well, one of my favorite corns is when characters act "too stupid to live." You cannot base the plot points on the assumption that your main characters are completely stupid (unless, of course, brain damage is part of the plot). But this is exactly what happens in this movie. Wendell Corey is a crazy man who killed three innocent people, and they know that his next target is Joseph Cotten's wife. So what do they do? Yes, they do provide really inadequate protection to the police and a plan that doesn’t make any sense at all (there’s no gunner and guys with shotguns who are so far away, they probably won’t stop this madman) And if it's not so bad, the tagged woman inexplicably escapes from her shelter and goes straight to the worst place she could be! Is anyone THAT stupid?!?! Arrrggghhhh --- I hate it when there are such stupid characters in the movies. In fact, I supported Cory, because I felt that idiots deserve death for their behavior! In addition to these character cliches, there was also a player who lost consciousness. Of course, the vision of how your husband shot, CAN cause someone to faint, but in real life it is a rare phenomenon - people rarely faint if there is no medical reason. Thus, the combination of these problems with the characters is a real nightmare for people who are looking for realism - something that MUST have Movie Noir films. <br /> <br /> All of these serious problems are even more infuriating because Wendell Corey’s character is surprisingly well written and conceived. This was his chance to prove himself as an actor - too bad that the rest of the film was so weak that Corey and the main idea of ​​the plot were sunk. This is one movie that can really use a remake, but this time without brainless characters.
