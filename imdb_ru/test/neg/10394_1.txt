The film started very well .. until now, one could believe in the expulsion of Isabelle .... but later, damn it! I didn’t know if it was a horror movie, a drama or a movie that cannot be seen! The obsessive creature attacking the sheriff had nothing to do with the film ... makeup !! At first it looked quite real, but at the end, in the last part of the film, the makeup (especially the teeth and eyes) was greatly exaggerated. If you want to watch a good movie “Exorcism” “Exorcism of Emily Rose”. <br /> <br /> Together with Candy Candy (a completely boring, pitiful story and finale), these two films are the worst of all seen from Lionsgate !! But it's good that the film company gave horror films fans great movies, but with this you will want to never shoot it !! Fans of exorcism, just stay with two "Exorcist" and "Emily Rose Exorcism"
