Wow !! I didn’t even know about this movie until I looked for the name of another classic Mark Hamill (Time Runner). Some things are best left unknown. The role of Mark Hamill is pretty ... limited. I would compare his appearance in this film with all these appearances of Vincent Price and Christopher Lee in those terrible bi-horror films of the 60s and 70s. In those films, they appeared in the first and last 5 minutes of the film. Mark's memorable game with such wonderful lines as “Don't try to run. You are arrested. ” I mentioned that he says the EXACT thing more than once. Bill Paxton fell into a spiral of drugs like Uzumaki and drank after “Aliens”, because he ended up in this film after he woke up on the set after rampant. HAIR .. HAIR !!! .. Priceless Bill. Truly, there had to be a "GAME OVER" for Bill .. but somehow .. he got treatment .. and continued better ??? films. This film is blowing. It's duller and duller than The Crazies. At least this movie was crazy ... it's just boring. DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE FILM.
