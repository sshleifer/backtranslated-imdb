I watched it last night for the first time in 40 years. This is bad. Really bad. But he has enough funny and terrible moments that are worth seeing. First of all, was it intentional to make the boy completely effeminate? He even says to Costello a la Mae West: “You enchant me!” As Costello makes a double take. God only knows what would happen if the nanny were a slice. This child would have seduced him in an instant! Then there is the main dancer. He is completely inept. A roar of laughter when he jumps and jumps without talent to the giant's grave during "He never looked better in his life." Two romantic reasons - zeros, a waste of time. Abbott gets to sing a single line, and this has been dubbed by another singer. God, I think he could not even carry a tune! Costello can really be charming in his room “I'm not afraid of anything,” and I think that very young children might like it, but not so much to recommend it. But oh this seductive effeminate boy! THAT one aspect struck me! Plus the fact that the family took someone from the street without mentioning to look after the child! Today, they take away a little female boy!
