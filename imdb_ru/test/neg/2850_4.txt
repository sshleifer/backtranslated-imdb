Well, it was not a complete waste. Armand, as usual, was very good at the film ,, all the Turks against the Germans were a bit strange, because I remember seeing Bulgaria at the beginning of the movie ... do not bother to go back and check ... the central theme of serial killings woven the whole gang war. I have never seen a film in which the characters looked Italian, presumably Turks, with English (American accent and euphemism) in German words. The climax was the most intriguing part, and there are parts that still had no meaning for me. In any case, if you have nothing more to do, you can watch this movie ..
