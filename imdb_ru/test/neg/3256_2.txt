When a hardworking entrepreneur refuses to participate in a prestigious country club, he begins a battle between members and ultimately buys it from T. Webb (Chevy Chase) and turns it into a theme park / golf course that everyone can join. <br /> <br /> This is by no means a good movie, but sometimes it's still a bit funny. Almost all comedy is a cheap farce and bad jokes, with the exception of the Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase, for the second time, plays one of his greatest roles in T. Webb and plays it magnificently. He is not only the funniest character in the film, he is the only funny character in the film. Even Dan Aroyd does not bring humor to this film, which aims to be an excellent continuation of the classic comedy, but is falling apart, shown on Comedy Central. The film could be better if Tai Webb (Chase) played a more important role, but instead he turned into a minor character, and Jackie Mason (Who?) Became the star. They had to return all the actors and make the continuation of the film. right! This is an excellent example of what should not be done, filming the sequel to the already great film. Overall, Caddyshack II is a joke, but a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
