As you can read, the only good comment about this film is made by someone who actually watches it in his church! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film had a good start to science fiction, everything was done to make a good entertaining, easy-to-see film, and then everything was felt in this religious brainwashing mode “Jesus will save all ". <br /> <br /> The story begins with 2 main characters, 2 reporters, but it quickly gives the first role to the freak of Jesus, who is here to save everyone’s soul with this attitude to descendants. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: this film goes from entertainment to brainwashing in about 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> A waste of time, a waste of money ... AVOID IT
