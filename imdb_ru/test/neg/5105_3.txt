I was prepared for a bad film, and for a bad film it is, so I shouldn’t complain Twenty-year-old Tom (gay boy Robert Stadlober) has so many problems that he doesn’t know if he is going or leaving. I would not have stayed if it were not for pretty girls: Serious Mevey (Anna Bruggemann); Nonsense Angie (Emma Doubas); Sarah Baumann is like a movie star in a movie. And still there is Tom's soul mate, Margaret with wild eyes (Jan Pallaske). She reminds me of Beatrice Dalle and Gene Gershon. If you have to remember, these are wonderful memories. She looks good even in the most ridiculous outfits, and I mean funny even by Berlin standards. I wonder if I would have liked this movie when I was at the age of heroes. I think I would not. Beware of indie idols Oli Schultz and Max Schroeder from "Der Hund Marie" acting as street musicians without feeling pain.
