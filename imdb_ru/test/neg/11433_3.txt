In my opinion, a good documentary film - especially one that deals with controversial political issues - should be informative and as objective as possible. The point must be in disclosing the truth. This means, in particular, the presence of experts on the topic and representatives of all parties among the respondents. This film is a failure in this regard. Most of the interviews included in this film consist of “people from the street,” which detail the issue of peace in the Holy Land. The wall itself, the intended theme of the film, does not undergo any serious treatment. In most interviews, the interviewer simply waits for being approached and asks general questions such as “what do you think of the wall?”. - It does not fit random people near the wall and asks them how they directly suffered from this. With the exception of the interviewee, the Israeli general in charge of building the wall, we do not have “experts” on this issue who could give us the context of the wall (for example, how and when the project started, was it successful, which groups for and what is against the project, etc.) <br /> <br /> Outside the interview, a very large part of the film consists of lengthy shots without incidents, such as frontal shots of the wall, building a wall, and people getting off the bus. These pictures take too much time, in my opinion. It's nice to see what the wall looks like, but 20-30 minutes of frontal shooting of the wall (and only the walls) are excessive. It is clear that these shots (accompanied by Arabic music, which conveys a feeling of mourning) are included for the sole purpose of evoking a feeling of aversion to the wall in the audience.
