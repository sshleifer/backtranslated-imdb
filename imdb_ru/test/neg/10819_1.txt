Dire! Gloomy! Awful Funny! Disappointment! <br /> <br /> Yes, you hit the “Cave” with a few “hard” men and a woman or two, you are systematically killed by “Something”, and you DO NOT hear ANY naughty Growth words !!! 15th Cert 'here in England and you could say! <br /> <br /> Ego "macho" was too much, pass by me, I'm going to get sick. <br /> <This film should never be exposed to the light of day and, ironically, kept in the darkest, deepest hole in the ground and be forgotten forever. I have the feeling that this description is not the first time that his head jumps out of a hole in the ground. <br /> <br /> Like the movie “Cube”, it looked like a good concept, but it was just released. down in the last post, well, by itself. <br /> <br /> This comment well contains spoilers, it's called The Cave. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Bruce.
