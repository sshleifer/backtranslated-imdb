STARS RATING: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> David (Jonathon Schach) and Tish (Lori Heuring) - couple in Budapest, on business commitments and accommodation in a luxury hotel. One night, they meet an attractive woman in a nightclub and invite her back to her place, where they find themselves threesome. All is well, until David received a few negatives in the mail, and he and Tish ended up blackmailing them. But when some people involved in the hoax are found dead, they get confused and they have to go into the seedy underworld of pornography and hardcore bondage to find a woman who can hold the key to everything. <br /> <br /> Taking into account that the original film dealt with the concept of snuff films, this sequel deals directly with the DVD about the more useful (!!!) theme of the triple and dirty sex. He plays like a porn film, an inexpensive tickle piece with a lot of hot T / A. The action takes place. If this sounds like your idea of ​​a good movie, you will probably like it, but you will probably be more at home in the porn store than a video store. <br /> <br /> It is a dark and voyeur film trying to copy the original, but although it copes well with this task, it still does not stand up to the original. It has an apathetic story, with a quirky flow of narration. And compared to Cage, Schaech looks infinitely wooden. <br /> <br /> Better than I thought it would be, I suppose, and better than average, one of these direct DVD sequels that seem to be coming out of a lot these days, but aren't we have seen enough? **
