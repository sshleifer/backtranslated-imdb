This is the worst movie I've ever seen. 85 minutes of completely bad play (half the actors seem to suffer from Asperger syndrome), terrible wigs, weird makeup (including tidal lines around the wigs area) and holier than characters with holier than your dialogue that makes you vomit, One The comical aspect of this film, if you have the patience to watch it, is a huge amount of costume changes, in which there is an unfortunate composition from scene to scene â€” was this film supported by the catalog producer in desperately tricky pastel everyday clothes? Did the actors pay clothes for their efforts? They certainly did not deserve to pay anything else! This horrific film effort gives a rambling storyline in the first half, merging into an equally entangled arched Christian bible festival in the second. The whole team of actors and producers should be burned at the stake or at least crucified!
