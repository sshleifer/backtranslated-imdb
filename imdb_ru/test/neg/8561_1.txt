I can only say this: ee03128 from Portugal, I could not say it better. Worst movie I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot of crap! When I read your comment, I only thought about what thoughts I had while watching a movie. When I saw who was one of the screenwriters, I realized that. Balaguero uses the same tricks in all his films. And his scripts are not much better either. And, of course, in Barcelona we have many temples and churches throughout the city, so we can keep cursed nuns to frighten young Americans who are coming for the holidays. Please be serious! And I do not want to talk about the quality of the actors ... There is something wonderful. It is fair to admit. Compared to normal level, all Spanish actors use fairly good English.
