This film is a cinematic collage of gangster clichés. The letter is a grade of z, and the plot and story are built without care or logic. This is a jumble of stereotypical gangsters (remember the Bugs Bunny cartoons) and silly support characters (lady-doctor and writer). There are much better Bogart films out there. In fact, Bogart looks like he slept in this performance. He puts very little effort into this character. I think the director's advice he received was something like: “He’s a bad guy. Act bad. This guy is the era of the equivalent of Darth Vader; obvious, angry and anti-hero. Do not waste your time on this.
