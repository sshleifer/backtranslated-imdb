I just watched this movie, and all I can say is where the road is right now. It looks like it would be a great second feature in 1977 (maybe playing with one of those films by Joan Collins), but you should only watch now if you are nostalgic for the 70th Stupid story, full of holes, but it resembles the era in which he was involved. It is interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Ann Lockhart, who is quite attractive, although not so good for an actress. In fact, thereâ€™s not much action in this movie. This is something like the adventures of the Dukes of Hazzard without a dive or a 1969 Dodge charger that jumps over a forest in the forest. But there is Mecrury Comet in it, jumping over the garbage dump!
