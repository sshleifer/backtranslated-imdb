The Adventures of Hercules must be one of the most inappropriate excuses for the film, which I have yet come across. You would have to look far and wide to find anything that comes close to the ineptitude shown in this film. The acting ?? Bad. Editing ?? Bad. Direction ?? Bad. Special effects ?? Bad and ridiculous. Plot ?? Bad. Lighting ?? Bad. Cinematography Bad. Costume design ?? Bad and stupid Everything else ?? Bad. Watch The Adventures of Hercules is about as pleasant as the root canal. Even for fans of bad movies, this is a real test of endurance. This is for masochists or for Lou Ferrigno (if any). <br /> <br /> Eight things I learned from watching Hercules Adventures: <br /> <br /> 1. If you donâ€™t have the budget for real-world special effects, rotate the scene from the previous movie. It will look great - believe me. <br /> <br /> 2. While searching for the restoration of Zeus' lightning, do not rush to frequent stops to lubricate your body. It worked for Ferrigno and his two satellites on Amazon. <br /> <br /> 3. Any sword fight, use of magic and almost all other daily activities in ancient Greece created a sound very similar to a game in Pac Man or Asteroids. <br /> <br /> 4. Some of the ancient Greek gods are dressed as extras from Star Wars. <br /> <br /> 5. If you need to supplement the time you play your crappy movie, increase the sequence of headlines by adding Star Trek-style titles and add overly ambitious music. Also useful if you have a previous movie to take scenes from. <br /> <br /> 6. The fighting scenes move much more smoothly if the villains attack Hercules one by one. <br /> <br /> 7. William Berger did everything for the money. <br /> <br /> 8. I did not think it was possible, but The Adventures of Hercules makes the first film Hercules (1983) look like an Oscar winner.
