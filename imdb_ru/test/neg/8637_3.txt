When George Sluizer was told that he could direct the American version of Het Gouden Ei / Spoorloos (outside Holland, this film is also called Disappearing), he was told that this would happen only if the ending had changed - he was told that the "American audience" will not approve the original ending. Of course, the original ending is much better, and without it the film loses its influence. Since I have already placed this in the trivia section, I will not give the original ending and leave my comment without a spoiler. If you want to know the original ending, see Spoorloos or read a book. This film is absolute nonsense, and I do not like the first Kiefer Sutherland film. Watch the original Dutch film, which is one of the best thrillers in the world.
