I saw the “Greek Tycoon” when it first came out in 1978. I was very bored. I thought it was no better than a journey, except for one thing: for the first time in my life, I understood why it would be nice to be rich. The view of the landscape from the yacht of Aristotle Onassis and my first glance at the life of rich and famous people opened my eyes. To paraphrase Martha Stewart: it was good. Funny, I don't remember the sex scene. I have not seen the film since it was on the big screen, and this time I remember the love session with my mistress. Maybe because I was younger and unmarried, then it was not scary.
