My first post on IMDb should (unfortunately) warn others not to waste their time on The Cavern! There is no story, no character development, no panic, and no good coverage. It makes no sense. If you like a bad game, people running around small parts of caves, jumping cameras located at a bad angle, and people screaming when the screen is in complete darkness, you will like this movie. I could turn off the lights in my house and scream too, and I wouldn't have to pay the rent. The only thing that scared me was that someone shot this movie terribly. <br /> <br /> ... one of the worst movies I've ever made.
