Take a bad script, a lousy game and add a politically incorrect moral story, and what do you get? Something that should pass for high-quality family viewing. <br /> <br /> Seven Alone is the story of a 19th-century family who travels around America in a carriage, hoping for a new life in Oregon. In the film, seven children (three boys, three girls and a child whose sex I'm not quite sure). Hence the name of the film. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the fact that the family lives, it would seem, a normal nineteenth. A century of life on a farm in the wilderness. The eldest son, John, is a premature teenager, "lazy and good for nothing," because his father constantly reminds him. We immediately see that he has a penchant for practical jokes when he ties the rope to the hair of his sleeping sisters and connects it with the nearest mule. Of course, when the mule moves, poor girls are knocked out of bed. John was caught by his father and immediately punished with a belt. <br /> <br /> The same day, the train passes. Pa is tempted to join because he promises a new life in the wild, wild west. Therefore, the family collects their belongings and leaves. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, the film seems weak and amateurish. Acting is below grade, as if from one of those films shown in the school about pioneers. However, I cannot blame the actors, because the lines in this film are stupid and too disgustingly sweet and optimistic. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you that I caught this movie by switching channels one bored Saturday afternoon on a Christian television station. I am not a religious person, I watched in horror as the "Seven One" made moral statements that were not only outdated, but also completely offensive! If I were a good Christian, I would hope that I would have good sense to complain to a television station for showing such garbage. However, since I am cynical, an unbeliever with an evil sense of humor, I decided to sit back and laugh silly. <br /> <br /> In one of the first scenes, the role of the father as the strict ruler of the house is established when he suggests that his wife go to Oregon. Her answer is hotter "Over my dead body." We're supposed to laugh as the film moves on to the next scene when Pa and Ma smile when he drives the van over the prairies. Oh, I believe that even the most resilient feminists would have to admit that such a “father knows what is better” attitude was the norm in those days, and one could argue about the need for such a dictatorial rule when living conditions were difficult, but I somehow got the feeling that this film supports this concept, even today. A sweet message from a Christian TV channel. <br /> <br /> In any case, the family is getting worse, and the moral integrity of the films deteriorates even further. An Indian (or Native American) robs John when he sleeps in the field. As an ordinary savage, the Indian takes the clothes and belongings of John. Fortunately, Pa, with the help of passer-by Keith Carson, can kill an Indian, as well as a pair of his transgressors. Keith Carson tells John that his father is a true hero. <br /> <br /> The family is accompanied by a permanent doctor from the carriage, Dr. Dutch (played by Aldo Rey). He shares Pa's feelings about John, stating that he is a useless child. Perhaps so, but he is also the best in this film. Dr. Aldo Ray is a jester who seems unable to tie his own shoes, let alone treat one of the girls for a broken leg. Fortunately, the little child didn’t cry when the van moved and broke its leg in two, because Dr. Dutchman didn’t seem to have a suitable bedside style. We know the drawbacks of constantly lowering a child. Here is a film that promotes this behavior. <br /> <br /> Pa later develops food poisoning or something like that, I didn’t pay much attention and he dies. His death scene is what makes a great acting game. Honestly, the man did not even look sick. <br /> <br /> Soon my mother died too. Children are left to fend for themselves. And here begins the real adventure. Punching him through the rapids, meeting more Indians (although they are good) and risking the snow-covered terrain, these children do it all. And I was left thinking: “What a bunch of rubbish!” <br /> <br /> Sorry, but there was nothing redemptive in this film. This low-budget little house on the prairie is a shameful waste of time and an insult to “families” everywhere. I am surprised that in 1975, at the very end of the feminist movement, and at the time when attention was paid to the treatment of Native Americans, something similar could be done. <br /> <br />
