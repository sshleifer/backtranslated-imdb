“Dov” is an exciting thriller from directors Rocky Morton and Annabelle <br /> <br /> Yankel. Acting is fine, and the script is pretty bad. There are also a few moments in this film that make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violence are. <br /> <br /> For example, someone was shot near the window. Then we see a building outside <br /> <br /> that looks like the person who jumped. I laughed when it happened. This film tries hard, but ultimately fails. View this movie only when you have no other choice. <br /> <br /> My criticism: ** <br /> <br /> Rating: [R] <br /> Rating reasons: Violence and language. * <br /> <br /> * No rating reasons were available due to its age.
