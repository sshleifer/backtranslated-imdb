I could not help laughing when I saw that the public might think that the email was in 1996. Obviously, e-mail is an interactive discussion (similar to a chat) with a synthesis of an unpersuasive voice reading every comment out loud. And some other "technical" aspects are also ridiculous. I would swear that she has several Commodore 64 monitors in the high-tech communication center. I think itâ€™s almost like the Hackers movie is being watched. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the leading actress creates the illusion of disability for most of the film, the last part of the film uses the unexplainable legs, which for some reason I cannot ignore. I mean, why include something so stupid? <br /> <br /> In any case, to summarize: the plot is quite predictable, bad behavior, the killer is quite predictable. But I think it can be fun in Mystery Science Theater 3000.
