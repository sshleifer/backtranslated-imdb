Comedy is hard to beat. Ishimoto fails in all respects as a writer and director. Some things, like funny movies, just need to be left to the professionals. 1 out of 10. Awful. It was not funny. I tried to laugh, but it was not funny. I was not the only one; nobody at the Chicago festival was laughing either, at least at the show I saw. Just really bad, sorry :(
