Reputation "RVAM" preceded this. I first heard about it in one of those books about movies in the style of the Bear, "The 50 worst films in history" or "Golden Turkey Award", or something like that. Each review of the film basically said that this film was so bad that it would make you bleed before your eyes to watch it. Therefore, when the “Exposed Film Society” finally got to its show, I was anticipating the catharsis that only a real cinematographer can give. <br /> <br /> However, “Robot” is not so bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, this is definitely a movie "Z" through and through. Some of the voicing (as is usually the case with the import of C. Gordon Murray) is terribly trashy, and the film itself seems structurally like Frankenstein, since a large part of it seems to have been filmed from the previous Aztec movie frame leading man. Dead sale: any time the question "Then what happened?" in the dialog box is set more than twice, you look at the reassembled frames, taken together, without regard to the sequence or impulse of the plot. In RVAM "Then what happened?" or "What happened next?" pronounced at least four times in 1 hour. <br /> <br /> Even without structural problems, the plot and the dialogue are not well suited for older American audiences. For example, as the hero explains (and explains and explains) the prehistory. it includes a remark about Dr. Krupp, "a doctor who suddenly turned into an evil chief criminal," and began a search for the treasure that the Aztec mummy guards. Without a background, without explanation, he simply "suddenly turned into evil." Obviously, this was aimed at a rather discerning audience. <br /> <br /> The key point is the “robot”, the supposed “showcase” of this film. This robot - the worst special effect of the robot since the "Underwater kingdom" or even "Santa Claus against the Martians." Compared to this junk, Iron Man from The Wizard of Oz looked like a Terminator chassis that chased Linda Connor through a foundry at T2. The Aztec mummy itself is well designed and executed; he is a recognizable undead, familiar enough to look like a mummy, but different from the “Boris Karloff” bandage collection, familiar to most American audiences. But the one who designed the Robot in this sequel did not feel the concept ... or any budget. For God's sake, they could at least give him a few tribes. <br /> <br /> In addition, the title fight is awfully executed and lasts less than 60 seconds. (I have seen more convincing pulling matches on high playgrounds.) Then the film basically just stops. It looks a bit pitiful, considering how much time the film spends on the battle itself. <br /> <br /> Despite all these problems, the film is not so terrible and incompetent as Coleman. Francis film or Larry Buchanan film was. Compared to "Monster A-Go-Go" or "Attack of the Eye Creatures", "RVTAM" is like a Coppola movie. It's just boring, boring and stupid. The actors are competent (in the manner of the B-film) and quite photogenic; In particular, Dr. Krupp seems to have a wonderful time looking and playing scenes and capers in his cloak and phantom of the Opera. I often rooted for him, despite the fact that he was a villain. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I have seen much, much worse. Submit it to Samson vs. Vampire Women, under "interesting Mexican youthful weirdness."
