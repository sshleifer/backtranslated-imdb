The great Yul Brynner, who won an Oscar and starred in blockbusters such as the Ten Commandments, among many others, ended his remarkable career with cheap films such as Sartana and the like. Really regrettable. You need to have pity on seeing that he is doing everything possible to make this stupid thing stand. Gone are the days when he was surrounded by Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Eli Wallach in The Magnificent Seven and walked under the famous Elmer Bernstein soundtrack. It's hard to make a living being an actor sometimes.
