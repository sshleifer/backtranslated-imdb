This film was not like a book. <br /> <br /> Everything was messed up or changed. Most of the film was things that were not even in the book. <br /> <br /> This movie should never have been watched. It was a big disappointment for me when I enjoyed the book so much, and then I watched this movie crush it all. <br /> <br /> I would never recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Nora Roberts or J.D. Robb. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this film is not worth watching, in fact, how far from the book.
