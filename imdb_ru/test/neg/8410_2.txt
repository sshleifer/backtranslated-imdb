With his little surrealism, LWHTRB works like a horror of poor quality, but as the main follow-up statement to the original, it fails miserably. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, television films are beginning to look quite promising. We see and hear several interesting shots and sounds: a black baby bed with a hanging inverted cross; Rosemary's kitchen knife brought Castevett to the apartment and fell in shock (the dishes seemed sticking out of the wooden floor); and the emptiness of Bramford himself, without tenants or furniture (voice-over can be heard here from the dialogue of the previous film). Also interesting is the hunt for an Easter egg, in which the title child participates (eggs and baskets are also black). As soon as the story is gaining momentum, it really never “rolls” ... And what happens to Rosemary when she gets on this bus without a driver and goes to “God knows where”? <br /> <br /> Patty Duke (a poor replacement for Mia Farrow), Ray Milland and Tina Louise (as the southwest whore who brings up the child, Adrian / Andrew) lead this almost star cast with Ruth Gordon. repeating her role as "Minnie". <br /> <br /> Although this is not a complete failure, this sequel should have been released first as a book, then perhaps we could all be a little better informed ... and did not leave completely in the dark. The recently released novel Son of Rosemary (1999?) Is a legitimate continuation of Ira Levin himself. <br /> <br />
