I generally love this type of movie. However, this time I wanted to kick the screen. Since I cannot do this, I will simply complain about it. It was absolutely idiotic. What happens to dead children is very cool, but living people are absolute idiots. I am an adult, quite large, and I can well defend myself. However, I would not do half of what the little girl does in this film. In addition, the mother in this film is reckless with her children, even neglect. I wish I was not so angry with her and her actions, because otherwise I would have liked the movie. Whatever it is, listen to my advice and rewind everything you see, what it does to the end. In addition, someone is tired of watching movies made in the dark. No longer seen what is removed. As an audience, we are incredibly connected to the actions on the screen. So why the hell can't we have night vision?
