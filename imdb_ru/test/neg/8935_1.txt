In Beaverview Cheerleading Camp, two good shows show that the Lucky Ducks support team must collude with the “tough” cheerleading team “Bad Girl” from “Demons” to defeat the dastardly Falcon team that always seems to win this camp. This is a typical 80s-cliche teenage (lame) comedy, who do you think will win? But the fact that the film lacks originality more than compensates for the pure bloody horror. Oh, and insanely bad dance numbers and mandatory Japanese businessmen who want to buy a camp (assuming that the male fan, Tommy Hamilton, stays in the camp, of course). Just awful, forgetful, and, unfortunately, surprisingly not enough nudity. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: HBO Comedy <br /> <br /> My rating: F (yes, I really gave it to them)
