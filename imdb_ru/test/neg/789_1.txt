I like movies, but I haven't found anything like it in The Box. I was interested in the “hook” of the plot, but, unfortunately, he did not go anywhere, and it was impossible to follow. Anyone who claims that he understands this film probably fakes it so they can feel that they are part of something, well, I have news for them, the emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> The only subtext in this film is that women are to blame for original sin and the corruption of humanity. I have heard this story before, and each time it becomes less and less meaning. It is true that this film is different from many films that are now shown in cinemas, but it’s not worth the ticket.
