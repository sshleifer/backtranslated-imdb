I bought this movie at a thrift shop. A few months ago, a friend of mine told me about this when we talked about the silly movies we saw. As soon as I noticed the tape, I realized that I need it. I watched it that night. I could tell it would be very stupid and cheaply made. That's what attracted me to this. I turned it on, and I laughed all the way through. I recognized Gregory (“Ice Cream”), but I did not recognize his name and could not remember where I saw him. Later, while watching Andy Griffith’s show, Clint Howard (Ice Cream) became optional, as he is Ron Howard’s brother (Opie Taylor). I saw loans and gasped. I turned to my mother, who was also watching the show, and said: “This is Ice Cream!” She also choked. This film is great, but only for laughter and criticism. This is a great example of a horrible horror movie. If you want to laugh and also make fun of low-budget films, rent this video.
