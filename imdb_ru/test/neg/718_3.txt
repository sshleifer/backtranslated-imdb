This film was recommended to me by some scientists. I had rather high expectations from their comments. But this film was nothing more than a disappointment. The directorâ€™s goal is obvious - to use the intertwining of speeches / poems as a way to argue against the Bush doctrine. But the director fails miserably. I also seriously doubt the choice of the director of the protagonist. This is an ass that is definitely not worthy of being heard. Raising the power of the corporation, so what? Most importantly, this film receives an unsatisfactory rating in its convincing strength; It is clearly intended for those who have already formed an opinion. It is true that the aesthetics of the film is quite pleasant. But almost everything else in the film just sucks.
