Let's get one thing out of the way. I am a HUGE fan of Bruce Campbell, I have the series “Evil Dead”, I have action movies and I saw Bubba Ho-Tep. I am a fan of funny, funny horror films and I know how to appreciate the whole deal "it's so bad, it's good." <br /> <br /> I would like to say the same about this movie. I watched this film with high expectations, I wanted it to be a good, homely, something from British Columbia, which we all learned and loved. It all started quite promising, but after the first 20 minutes I didn’t stop watching the rest of this sad excuse of the film, as if I had just been shot with darts with a tranquilizer. <br /> <br /> The idea itself is not bad; two men do not get along, both are killed by the same psychotic, half the brain of one man is transplanted into the head of the other, they argue, disagree, and the comedy begins. <br /> <br /> What killed me was that it was extremely disorganized and boring! It had the potential, even as a click of a camp, to be much better than it was. The plot was boring, even Bruce's crazy slap could not make it work. <br /> <br /> Word cannot even correctly express a ridiculous robot, which eventually ends up with the brain of Bruce’s wife. This is the worst robot I've ever seen (even for the movie "B"). The whole idea is stupid. <br /> <br /> What the hell was going on in Bruce's head when he was doing this steaming pile, behind me. Why Ted Raimi did not run to his elder brother, asking him to give Bruce a little sense and not to mention some lessons on how to make a pleasant film with a limited budget, I can’t do. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Bruce !!!
