The film is broadcast on television when I write. <br /> <br /> I just forgot how terrible the experience was when I watched it in a movie. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​the film is wrong. The fact that sensible Europeans and Americans who find themselves in the desert forget the whole concept of morality and civilization for a few days causes laughter. Madness Lord of the Flies was longer. <br /> <br /> Details that are annoying, abound. One of them is the only god-like African character who mysteriously survives in a terrible climate and makes it for ages without losing his mind, and he also seems to have no problems with supplies. Funny. As well as an attempt to rescue from a tourist guide, similar to Indiana Jones, whose rescue attempt ends in tragedy and death 5 minutes walk from the hut. Then there is the choice of Lear, superimposed on a group by a guru-like artist joke. He reminded me of my hippie art teacher in high school. <br /> <br /> The worst is the choice of Learring from Lear. Obviously, the intellectual brain is a fart. How it should have gone is never clear to me. <br /> <br /> Positives are few and far between. This is a beautiful film, but it is never important. <br /> <br /> Graduate School of Intellectualism. Strange for the weird. It’s a waste of time if you don’t like useless feature films.
