My first very disappointing BBC / Jane Austen. The tone is off, the costumes are off, the hair is off, the music is from space, and Robert Hardy, bless him, looks like he is very annoyed at being in such a stench. Even some castings are turned off. No, I am picking it up; a good director can make, so to speak, a silk purse from a sow's ear. The performances in this film are so exaggerated and melodramatic that it is almost a farce of Jane Austenâ€™s story, the irony is that Northanger Abbey is a kind of tribute to early Gothic novels. I wanted to hit the female leadership after a while; Who made the decision that she should be such a nanny? I had to watch Pride & Prejudice ('95) immediately to get rid of unpleasant taste. Phew!
