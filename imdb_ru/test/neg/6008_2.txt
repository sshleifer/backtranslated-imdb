Being a big fan of Laura Gemser, I took it for hire to watch another film, Emanuel. Boy, I was wrong! <br /> <br /> EMANUELLE IN EGYPT has nothing to do with Emanuelle. Laura Gemser with her husband Gabriel Tinti, but this is the only connection with Emanuel. Here, Laura plays "Laura" (original, yes?) A beautiful supermodel who goes to visit her rich friend Pia (Annie Belle) in Egypt. In tow - her ** photographer with a hole of Carlo (exhausted by Gabriel Tinti) and some kind of blond woman who is never called. Also in the mansion of Pia lives Horatio (sexy but dumb Al Kliver), a mystic who says only nonsense. For the weekend, two daughters of Pia come, one with a short haircut and the other brunette. A lot of sex is implied, but hardly shown. One handsome actor plays Ali, an Egyptian servant who carries three women in a mansion. Laura has sex with a lesbian, a lesbian has sex with Horatio, Pia and blonde have sex with Horatio in an Egyptian orgy, Laura drinks the blood of goats and is obsessed during the Egyptian ceremony, Carlo rape Laura. Everything is so weak that EMANUELLE IN EGYPT is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Far from being erotic, even the actors themselves look bored during their sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Given that there were two famous couples in this film (Laura and Gabriele, Al and Annie), the number of sex scenes available is incalculable. Instead, the film offers a first-class Euroculture cast and never delivers the goods, annoy every viewer, with the exception of Laura Gemzer, the hardcore trailer. Otherwise, stay away from EMANUELLE IN EGYPT!
