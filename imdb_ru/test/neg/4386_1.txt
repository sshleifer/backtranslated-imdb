This film was like a collection of people who were in other films, and they decided to make a really bad movie. He had a dude from Detroit Rock City, a girl from The Cosby Show, that idiot who kissed a chick and bought this sausage at Sorority Boys, and that's not all. Well, that doesn't make a bad movie in itself, it was just something that I noticed. All of this with a prostitute and a French girl with the same name was stupid, with 37 people writing these notes, and if you think they are confusing ..... quite shocking ....... you called it And the wallet is it was just stupid. It was so bad that I watched the movie in two parts and reached the 50 minutes mark. If you watch it and expect “Van Wilder” or such a film ... No, don't.
