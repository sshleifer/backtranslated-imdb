After a blizzard, the roads overlap, and Jason (Adam Beach) road patrol comes to his friend Fritz’s diner (Jürgen Prochnow) and informs his customers that they can only watch their trips the next day. Among the strange strangers, Jason meets his former lover Nancy (Rose McGowan), who has just left her husband in Los Angeles. At night, without contact with his base, Jason encounters unpleasant and suspicious situations with clients and finds several corpses, pointing out that there is a killer among them. <br /> <br /> “Last Stop” may be an average thriller, but the script is just awful. Most of the characters are vile people, and the motives of an amazing serial killer are never revealed, and viewers have no further explanation as to why the killer decided to kill the guests. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Encurralados” (“Trapped”)
