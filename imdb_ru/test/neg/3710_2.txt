Awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive. I urge anyone who is a fan of Aliens (James Cameron, 1986), to count how many times the lines or almost entire sequences from the first two Alien films have been broken to make this classic piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> Actors such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only actors with any talent, and the main actor, Jack Scalia, was really absolutely terrible. I think they threw him over his massive chin crevice. I was also annoyed by stereotypes about the only black man on the set of John Tuls-Bey, who should watch this movie and just be surprised. Watch it sometime, because he made a lot of interesting films. <br /> <br /> But in this film: the script, as I said earlier, was an alien robbery, rigged and turned into an underwater "thriller." It included such lines as “I have a bad feeling” and “Kill me”, because one of the crew members is infected with one of the mutants, and his stomach begins to make an “alien jump” just before he jumps out of his stomach. . There is also the robbery of the classic "get a little!" via Bill Paxton. We also have a group of naval infantrymen running through caves with creepy crawlers protruding from walls. Even the explosions of modified creatures are very similar to the appearance of aliens when they shoot the marines in the movie "Aliens." And most importantly, some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to the presence of acid in the blood). There are many more important examples. Therefore, if you want this scenario to be well executed, look at the first two classics “Alien” and “Aliens” (with Sigourney Weaver). You will have a more pleasant time. <br /> <br /> The plot could be interesting and made better if it were not for the tangled sequences at the beginning of the movie and bad editing in general. Shooting from the camera was pretty boring, and, frankly, it was not difficult to stop looking at it and walk around the room for a snack or check email. Many of the interactions between the characters had no meaning or no meaning at all and most often did not disappear. The entire command structure between the crew and the captain was poorly made. I'm not even sure if there are captains in the army who fully control nuclear submarines. In general, it simply shows that not enough research has been done for reference, so that the film looks at least a little respectable, and there are many other similar examples (for example, the depth of the dive, etc.). <br /> <br /> If you are like horrible films or a big fan of Aliens and Aliens who just want to laugh and shake their heads, then this film may be for you. As for me, this one is back on the shelf ... forever.
