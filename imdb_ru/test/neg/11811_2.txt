Well, that was how it should have been called. Mainly due to the ridiculous, senseless use of the director of what can hardly be called symbolism. I wouldn’t be surprised if I found out that this is A) one of the earliest works of Leah Pool and B) at least semi-autobiographical. It turns out that A is mistaken, although I do not know about B. I am willing to bet that she attended a boarding school, and she had rather terrible same-sex relationships of a SOME kind. This is the message that passed this film to our throats, and the short film that precedes it, the name of which I no longer remember. <br /> <br /> In any case, character development was awkward (Who imagines herself saying what her name means? Nobody.) The characters were about as thin as a glass elevator full of adolescent girls losing cable and falling on eighty stories. All over the loudspeaker. Honestly, the falcon's cry when Perabo announced that she was a predator and jumped off the table? It was funny before the parody. And it was only one of too many characters, intended to show even the most stupid viewers, what is its meaning. And it was that she had a shitty childhood, and she feels the need to make films about it, ala Vincent Gallo, instead of seeing a therapist, as well as all of us who live our lives. There was nothing tender, nothing sweet and nothing special about this movie. It was poorly developed trash, and the actors could not save Brett Ratneresk due to the fact that “THIS IS MY POINT IN THIS FILM” using cinematic methods, scripts and acting skills. Sorry, but it was terrible.
