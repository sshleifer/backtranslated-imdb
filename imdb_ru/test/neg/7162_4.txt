This is a great conceptual thing, and the Brando game is a great job. Dean Martin is not bad, and Montgomery Clift is also not bad. Unfortunately, this is a very incoherent, very long part that really needed to be edited up to about 2 hours (this is almost 3 hours). <br /> <br /> We are following the lives of 3 men from 1938 until the end of World War II and see how they know who they are and what they can be, revealing both the world around them and what they are made. For some, it is the women in their life that lead to this understanding, for others, it is the more general circumstances. Too often, however, I asked myself what had just happened or what meaning the particular scene had.
