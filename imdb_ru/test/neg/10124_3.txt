When the naive young Eddie Hatch, the chest of drawers in the Savory department store, falls on the statue of Venus and chastely kisses her, Venus comes off the pedestal and gives Eddie more than he expected. This squeaky example of what Hollywood can do with a Broadway musical allows you to highlight a silly story and eliminate most top-notch songs. The goal was to make a safe, popular film with little investment, while benefiting from Ava Gardner’s upward mobility in a superstar. Robert Walker in the role of Eddie is lost in the ungrateful role. Eddie is not just naive, but loose and unhappy. Gardner is great, but the only things that give the film any life are Olga San Juan as a loving, but jealous girlfriend Eddie, Tom Conway as the courteous owner Savori and Eva Arden as the long-time wise secretary Savori and she's good at it. <br /> <br /> The musical opened on Broadway in 1943 and made Maria Martin a celebrity. The only meaning of the musical is music. As the One Touch of Venus was conceived as a kind of social satire, Kurt Weil, writing music, and Ogden Nash, writing lyrics, came up with a series of stylish, witty songs and one masterpiece. Without satire, clever songs or Martin (or a similar show show), the film becomes just a weak comedic fantasy, where most of the comedy is predictable, and the fantasy works to death. <br /> <br /> The film's producers not only threw away almost all of the Vale / Nash songs, but also invited the film's film director Ann Ronell to write a new lyrics for one of the surviving songs, turning to her. keen observation of a love-blue romance. Ronell was not a cracker; she wrote "Willow is crying for me." I wonder what she thought about when she replaced or corrected the smart work of Ogden Nash. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in the film is the masterpiece of Weil and Nash. "Speak Low" is the same love song that anyone has ever written. Eileen Wilson, one of those ultra-professional and lifeless treatments, duplicates Gardner. Dick Haymes contributes the chorus. <br /> <br /> As for Ann Ronell, she was one of the few women in Hollywood who became a major music director, as well as a composer and lyricist. Your song: “Women on Tin Pan Alley” is a fascinating documentary about some of the women who have done it in business, including Ronell, Kay Swift, Dorothy Fields, and Danu Suess. And for those who would like to hear how much of the Weil / Nash score was recorded in the original Broadway cast, you can find the One Touch Of Venus (1943 Original Cast) / Lute Song (1946 Original Cast) CD. Music paired with Lute Song, another Broadway show in which Martin starred.
