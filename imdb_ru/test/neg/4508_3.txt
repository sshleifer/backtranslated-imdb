Victor Buono how the devil? Surely someone was drunk when this decision was made. This is not the worst part of this stupid jumble of various home devices, but she got my vote for the fact that I was the funniest part of it. While the film is by no means terrible, it doesn't even come close to other 1970s "haunted house" films, such as The Amityville Horror, The Changeling and the House of Legend of Hell. Evil can entertain in some places, but do not expect to be scared. It is better to approach him than what he is: a stupid horror film made it all the more stupid because of its too serious approach.
