I write this when watching a DVD. I grabbed a laptop and went to IMDb during the first song. I did not know anything about the film, except that a friend said that the show should be good. He also has a good Netflix rating, so I'm here. <br /> <br /> It may have worked on the scene. But I have to say that the kind of chorus boys dancing and singing completely naked just seems silly. And lip syncing with a pre-recorded score adds weirdness. <br /> <br /> Most of the songs and exercises are about the nude aspects of a man. This is my idea nothing, sorry. Today it is common music for show tunes. Nothing memorable or especially melodic. Everything should serve the lyrics. Which, I must say, sounds like they were written by a committee. Each song is, in fact, one extended joke. If the jokes were ten seconds, they could work. These single jokes a few minutes long are not. <br /> <br /> Now I am watching a movie by chapter - a few minutes, until I understand the essence. Kind of in the hope that one of them will be different, or interesting enough to keep me from going to the next scene. Not. <br /> <br /> Good. I'm exhausted. So that's what I think. If you have experience or a long-term appreciation of musical theater, avoid it - this is simply not quality. However, if you are gay twenty with something and have never seen or heard a musical comedy, you can be entertained. Or maybe it would interest you if you have never seen many attractive naked men. <br /> <br /> I have.
