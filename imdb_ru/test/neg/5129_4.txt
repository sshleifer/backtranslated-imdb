SPOILERS, ATTENTION !!! Flashdance is an honest film, in my opinion. Some things confuse me (for example, Gini asks Alex how long it took her to become so good at dancing; Alex responds: “About 25 years old”, shouldn't Alex be 18 years old?) And some things I am fascinated by this (I loved the backs!). Overall, however, it intrigued me. When this film was made, I was not even born. I really did not experience the eighties (I was born in the 85th), and I have to wonder: sometimes Alex just ran on the spot or rushed, not really dancing, just knocking on subjects, throwing her back and waving her arms - it was then "dancing"? If this were the case, I’m not sure if I could do it. Rotations, coup, smooth movements were great, but some of them - my neighbor's baby could do better! In addition, if Alex worked as a welder during the day, wouldn't she be tired after a hard day at work? When she doesn't go to work for almost a week, won't she be fired? Living in a warehouse - I almost see it, but not quite. It is wrong that she is a welder, owns a warehouse and is trying to get into ballet. None of this makes sense. I should not be too judgmental considering my past, but please. Maybe Jennifer Beals is too feminine for me to see her as a welder, I don't know. But in any case, they could choose the best actress. The actors were fine. I even liked the novel. You make the decision. But mine - rent it once, you can’t see it anymore - it's not worth it.
