I can not explain what is garbage in this film. As a matter of fact, I can not. it's just so bad. <br /> <br /> plot = crap action = crap budget = so low his laugh was pretty hot. <br /> <br /> I think this film is good only for those who took part in the film. I am sure that they were not the ones who financed it, because there was no money invested in it. (HAHA haha, where they shave their heads) <br /> <br /> This film has already spent too much of my life, so Iâ€™m not going to spend any more time writing my review.
