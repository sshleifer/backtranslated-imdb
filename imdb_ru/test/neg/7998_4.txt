This is a very famous film about the ninja, but it is not a very good movie. If you want to see several ninjas and several figures, you want to learn something about ninjas, watch this movie. This film is only for ninja fans and those who want to cause nostalgia. <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of the film are the best. You can simply see the ninja figures and fight in these scenes. Between them is below average, almost like a movie. Act badly. Sho (black ninja) - the best actor in this film. Frank Nero is a good actor and charismatic, but he does not know how to fight. The script is also not good. It is so simple. Franco Nero is approaching his best, old friend from the army and the war. He also protects him from the mafia, but he has sex (goes to bed) with his wife, and his friend knows this, but says nothing to Nero negatively. Is it possible in life? What a friendship! <br /> <br /> Finally this film began the genre; Ninja movies. There is also a master ninja Sho Kasuga, but some battle scenes are not realistic and not fast even with Shoo. This film is below average, even if it is a classic.
