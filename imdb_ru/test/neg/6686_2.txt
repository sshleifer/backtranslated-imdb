There was a lot of excitement in this film, and the commercials created the impression that it would be great. Unfortunately, like Bring It On 2, Bring It On 3 is the infamous glory of the original Bring It On. There are shameless stereotypes in the film. The lines given to the actors were humiliating for all the races participating in the film. Speech by Hayden Panattiere was at the level, both in terms of acting and in terms of support. There were several scenes in which I literally cringed, because I was ashamed of the cast, because the scene (lines, plot, etc.) was just so stupid. I recommend the creators of any future Bring It films: hire good cheerleaders and teach them how to act, because the cast of the actors was terrible, and the lack of cheerleading makes them totally useless for the film. Only a great character: Kirresh.
