The dog can act ... unfortunately, no one else can play in this movie of the opponent. A stray, but very intelligent dog sneaks into the lives of two rootless children, much to the chagrin of their bitter and cold-blooded father. In that which can only be described as Dickenzian, an evil widower forbids her children — who may or may not be mentally retarded — to play with Benji. Neither the children nor Benji obey. Soon, the children are abducted, and Benji must help the police find them. Only then the old man realizes that Benji is good, not bad. <br /> <br /> Tom Lester, whose only previous acting experience seems to have played the stupid Eba in Green Acres, plays one of the kidnappers. Like the overwhelmingly overworked Deborah Wally. Wally's previous screen triumphs include BEACH BLANKET BINGO and the dismal IT bikini world. In the past, she also played with Gidget and Tammy, and here she is trying to destroy her reputation as a good girl by playing her poorly! <br /> <br /> Stay away from Benji ... he is a dog, and this film is a dog!
