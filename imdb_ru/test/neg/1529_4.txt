First of all, season 1 is unbearably bad. The prison is ridiculously unreal, the characters are so two-dimensional that they are almost transparent, and the direction is terrible. It looks like a bad video about a performance for younger students, the characters wander past the camera and say very timely and rehearsed lines, posing as random prison conversations. Soon the show is getting better, but not by much. Returning from a commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue of August Hill, confined to a wheelchair, which Harold Perrino impressively plays. The only time his character is constantly bad is a monologue about poor performance, most of which occur in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and, as a rule, have nothing to do with what happens in the show. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, bad ideas in Öze can fill in an encyclopedia of several volumes. Consider the whole situation first. Prisoners can hang out in public, get drunk, use drugs, and they have not only CD players (CDs, they can also give out steak knives), but all incoming mail is carefully checked by RECOGNIKERS. God, this place is like a male club with security. Security guards who do little. <br /> <br /> Toward the end of the second season, an elderly prisoner’s grandson is diagnosed with leukemia, and all prisoners pass him on in thick bundles of $ 20 and $ 50 to help send him to Disneyworld to fulfill his dying wish. It must be the richest prisoners in the world. Every prisoner in Oz suddenly became a caring, loving guy, with the exception of Kenny Wangler, an annoying character, but one of those who are invariably persuasive. Even Adibisi wanted to be nice. But this is normal because there is no order or meaning in the series, so even this is not very distracting. <br /> <br /> Shockingly, there is a boxing scene in which one prisoner wears an "I love the cops" t-shirt. In prison!! Can you imagine?? I have a cousin who was in prison several years ago. I sent him an old photo of us with friends in high school, and in the photo one of my friends was holding a bumper sticker “I love the cops” and one of the “forests” (the guys who were in prison for years and years) saw the picture, but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds. My cousin was lucky. <br /> <br /> Kenny Wangler also constantly scolds guards and even more senior officers for not calling him Bricks. One of them even tried to bribe him to go to an English class. You may lose track of who is responsible, prisoners or guards. For example, more than one investigator enters a prison under cover and kills trying to stop the drug trade. Personally, I would just stop letting inmates check incoming mail, and not risk the lives of investigators. <br /> <br /> Let's see what else? Schillinger's son is alone, and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs. He just ... got them, I think. And be sure to pay attention, otherwise you will miss the reason why prisoners have enough money to be able to afford cellular skin grafts when they have bad gums. I did not know that guests in high-security prisons were provided with such luxurious treatment options. How about this, when Robson asks about Dr. Faraj's work schedule so that he can ask what race of gums he was given, Faraj is so scared that he goes to the warden and gives up his work on the spot. Do not doctors and dentists have the right to ask not to see certain prisoners? After the Poet and O'Reilly announced this to the entire prison, Robson asks to meet with Dr. Faraj, and he is escorted to his office, brought without knocking, and the guard quickly leaves without saying a word. They might as well give him a gun. <br /> <br /> I don’t have to talk about the stupid ideas on this show, but it’s like a flood, I can’t stop it. Who thought about the Chinese refugees who do not speak Chinese and who disappear en masse if they are not needed? Who was thinking about the stupid religious wars and all the honorable prisoners? Anyone from Robson's gum transplant? How are things with Busmalis and Agamemnon? Agamemnon, because he obviously does not belong to the prison, but Busmalis because of all this with his grandson. Macbeth, because it was just a ridiculous means to achieve the goal. <br /> <br /> But what are the worst ideas? Things that are not going anywhere, which are permanent. Irishman comes to prison and builds a bomb. He threatens to blow up the entire prison, the bomb is rendered useless, and the episode ends in being led away by a squad of bombers after the evacuation of the entire prison. Nothing is heard from him or from the whole situation. As if that never happened. In one episode, prisoners are given dogs for training. What the hell?? If this was not enough, during one of the workouts, the guard shoots a pistol at the prison as a training exercise. No one seems to mind. <br /> <br /> I also like how a quarrel breaks out at any time, the criminals step back, they don’t say anything, and the guards, or the warder, or Pete's sister, or whoever always says, " I hope you do not think that I will let it go !! ”And then they leave and let it go. The audience will not remember. <br /> <br /> I may be spoiled by Prison Break, but Oz is just a stupid prison drama that could be better in a play. Short. At least a low-budget movie. It is simply not enough to withstand the multi-season TV show. On the other hand, I watched six seasons on DVD. Sometimes I do not understand myself ...
