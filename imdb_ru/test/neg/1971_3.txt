There were so many reasons why this movie could be great. I'll give you three. <br /> <br /> 1. Sienna Guillory. She is very hot in this film, and that is why I decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> 2. Tim Curry. Awesome bad guy, and I always worry, seeing him in the movie (even alone 2). <br /> <br /> 3. Jason Donovan. For all of you, the Australians and the British, this is a rare treat. The heartbeat of the former star of the neighbors of the 80s, dressed in drug trafficking. <br /> <br /> However, neither the one nor the other, and the fact that the film tells about the culture of drugs / rave, could not make this film even remotely interesting. The script was boring, the performances are ordinary, and despite the scenes with J.D and any scene with Sienna, I found everything about this film rather obsolete. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
