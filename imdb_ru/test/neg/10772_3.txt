After reading the books and seeing the version of Anthony Andrews / Jane in 1982, <br /> <br /> of Seymour, I must say that this is not at all good. <br /> <br /> According to the books, Percy is supposed to be a <br /> <br /> stupid aristocrat when he is Percy, and witty and clever <br /> <br /> when he is Pimpernel, but here it looks boring, like <br /> Percy and I mean Pine. Margarita should be <br /> <br /> the most beautiful woman in Europe, not a tired and pale mother (she looks middle-aged, probably because of bad makeup <br /> <br />). Richard Grant did a lot better, and <br /> <br /> Elizabeth McGovern acts dull and boring. Wit and the <br /> <br /> book and Andrews / Seymour film are replaced by <br /> <br /> muscular and flashy editing, which simply does not make the cut. <br /> <br /> I could add this to a person who hasnâ€™t seen a single previous version <br /> <br /> or read a book, it would probably look good.
