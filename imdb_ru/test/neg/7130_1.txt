This "remake" is a complete disgrace: so mediocre, cheap and prosaic that it does not deserve more than a couple of angry lines. <br /> <br /> This is also a hoax, with a ridiculous scenario filed by such a flimsy and amateur “game”, you always know that there is a set, camera, fake, no direction, no suspended reality to allow you to dive into the story . <br /> <br /> Claustrophobic, suffocating tension, small spaces and rooms in original Japanese masterpieces (Ju-On 1 & 2) are almost lost here in bloated scenery and spaces. <br /> <br /> But, worst of all, the moral enormity and the unbearable suffering that both transmitted the ruthless logic of the original mother, and the child victims turned into ruthlessly vengeful ghouls, completely destroyed by utter senseless and empty panic manners. <br /> <br /> If the American audience does not want to read the subtitles and rise above the lowest common denominator, preferring instead to swallow this kind of patronizing garbage, they ultimately deserve this pitiful curse: the film itself.
