I don't understand. I just don't understand. Barney and Friends have been criticized by millions of people for many years, and I admit that I was one of those sheep. Any child who watches this show does not understand that what he is watching is just a piece of garbage. Barney is very annoying and very selfish. Add Baby Bop and it will get worse. Add B.J., then you will have a very creepy television nightmare. Then you get the kids. They are old enough to know what Barney is trying to teach them! What are they doing there first? It would be fun if Barney and his friends appeared on the Jerry Springer show. This will certainly be one of the wildest moments in the history of television! Even more significant is the fact that this show marked the beginning of the end of public television in the form in which we knew it, because we saw less and less information and interesting programs of public television that were broadcast in the 1970s and 1980s. What a big difference the arms selfish son has. When this show comes out of PBS, millions of people will feel a big sigh of relief, but there will be a huge dent in the annals of television history. Message to Barney himself: You may not realize this, but YOUR DAYS ARE READ. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, there are other options. The best choice.
