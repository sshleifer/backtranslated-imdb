Please do not go watch this. In this film, I had a few laughs, but they were all caused by an unintended comedy. <br /> <br /> There were only three characters in this film, so it was amazing how badly the characterâ€™s development developed. Pacino played again in Pacino and worsened most of the time. The scenes in this film look as if they were made up of 20 other bad films by a really bad editor. There is no continuity in this, and I wondered why I did not leave 15 minutes on this. <br /> <br /> I would advise you never to watch a film directed by DJ. Caruso. It really was awful.
