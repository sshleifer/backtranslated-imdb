Contrary to my own common sense, today I went to see this film, and, God, if I had not done that. Awful. The first AvP movie looks classically compared to this, it is very bad. These guys really make Paula VS Anderson is like a storyteller. In fact, this is what I would expect to see a film about Alien and / or Predator, if it had been shot by Uwe Boll! This film really offended me, and the Lord knows what will happen if Ridley Scott or HR Giger ever have to watch this piece of shit. I can't figure out how this movie could appeal to any fan of the franchise. <br /> <br /> Actually, I don’t know where to start. I mean, the first AvP was a shit, but at least it was a semi-interesting story and setting, and sometimes some genuine tension. It did not take itself too seriously, and, at least, it could only be semi-enjoyed based on “leave your brain at home”. But this time it seemed to me that the people behind him think that they are making the next masterpiece of horror. One after another, there was an imaginary “waiting” scene in a dark room or a corridor with eerie music, in essence, beating you on the head with the words “Fear NOW”. As James Cameron once said, you should not be afraid, you can only strengthen your own feelings. The guys who made this film obviously didn’t pay attention, because they tried everything in the book to make you frightened and not allow yourself to rise to this level on their own. For internet nerds, this is a cliché: “God, I was so bored by this movie, and I felt I was leaving,” well, this is exactly what I felt, even in the middle of the action movie. They took this film very seriously, which excluded any possibility of receiving pleasure. Even the joke that governments do not lie to their people was played without a hint of irony. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, I knew that human characters would be completely meaningless for that. film, but seriously, if they are going to be on the screen, at least, let them do something that is relevant to the story. I don't care if this guy is beaten up by the boyfriend of his dream girl, I don’t care about the mother, who "doesn’t even know her own daughter, wow!" (a couple of night vision goggles for a gift? Give me a break!) Or a released criminal just tries to make a living and sets an example to his brother. Hell, even the obligatory moment of hot chicks in shorts was more contrived than usual. I have a feeling that they expected the audience to be so shocked by the finale, and also see how breast sisters come out of children, rape future mothers, and the like, that this will compensate for everything. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Then we turn to the stars of the film, and again very little to tell about them home. Were the aliens well designed? I don't have a clue, because you will never see these damn things. All you see is one of a mouth, a head, a tail, or a really dodgy sketch of cg climbing a wall and barely enough to really understand that it’s actually an alien before Mr. I cut out Marilyn Manson and NIN clips, I think I’ll do the same here. ”The editor uses the slicing tool. Also, notice how the directors of the hacker action movies always put their films at night and in the rain? Hmmm A predator could fight giant sea monkeys for everything we knew! Yes, the Predator was more impressive this time, and I actually thought that some of the new weapons were cool, but that was about it. Besides, since when did the Predator sound like a dinosaur from the Lost World? There were a few things that I liked. One of them was the use of sound effects and music from the original films (I also giggled a little at “Get to the helicopter!”), Although other links were stupid (the name of the main character is Dallas, let me rest). I also liked the visual effect for the Predator's vision, as well as what the hybrid alien looked like (better, of course, than the one from the Resurrection). But in fact, these are the only positive points. <br /> <br /> In general, I found this film meaningless, senseless, offensive and, above all, offensive to the vision of the original creators of both creatures. The fact that they left the door open for another leaves me almost depressed. <br /> <br /> If they had some kind of decency, they would have removed Dan O'Bannon, Ron Chussett and HR Giger from the credits of this film. They did nothing to deserve it.
