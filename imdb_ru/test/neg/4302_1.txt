As much as we could greet a film that deals with people with various problems in romance, I cannot get rid of the feeling that this film was intended as a direct video of a class-C porn movie, in which either A) actors abandoned overt scenes or B) the producers ran out of money for rent for inserts (amazing thing, if that were true). <br /> <br /> I had to return to Blockbuster to understand why I rented it, which was connected with the generally accepted amateur credulity to the blurriness of the cover, which seemed to imply a seditious humor festival in the style of John Waters with a sexual theme. Well, I laughed a couple of times, and this definitely has a sexual theme (although most of them cannot be described as stimulating). But in some films you can rewind to make sure you heard the dialogue correctly - in this you rewind, because you already know what they are going to say. But there is nothing to rewind ahead, so just transfer to the shelf.
