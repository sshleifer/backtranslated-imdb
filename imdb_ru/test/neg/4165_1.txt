Initially, I was excited about this film and fully expected it to be a combination of Equilibruim and Farenheit 451. Unfortunately, I was constantly disappointed by the lack of depth and interest in the plot and the plots. In the middle of the film, I began to joke on characters and sets so as not to turn it off. I really liked the premise of the future with united cultures and the separation of the haves and the have-nots. What could be a sly and intelligent look into the future turns into a wacky, sciFi semantic film on the midnight channel with a terrible game, cheap sets and the final gratuitous shot of Tim Robbins vagina. Perhaps he should adhere to his socialist political rant - all this has been downhill since the times of Shoushank.
