"Graduation Day" was released in May 1981, at the height of the slasher hobby. At the beginning of the same year, fans were exposed to films such as My Bloody Valentine, Shortly Before Dawn, Friday, 13th Part 2, The Burn and theaters that were still waiting for films such as Halloween II ". Prowler "and" Happy Birthday to me. "I saw all these films, and of all the popular slashers of 1981, Graduation Day is the worst. <br /> <br /> What Graduation Day is, is an exercise in poor, low-budget filmmaking with bad play, bad writing, pointless characters, pointless scenes, unnecessary nudity, cheerful dialogue and editing experiment that didn't work so well. And who could forget the 80's classic disco music that sounds throughout the entire movie (intro music with prices compete only with the music that sounds during the chase scene.) However, when renting such a movie, the person should know that these details will be in this film. So why is the Graduation Day not considered a classic like Halloween, Friday 13th Go "," A Nightmare on Elm Street "," My Bloody Valentine "," Burning "or" Prom Evening "? Why are fans still looking for these films, but ignoring it without concern? Where are the films The slashers must succeed, above all, in tempo. There is nothing worse than a slow-moving slasher, and "Graduate's Day" moves rather slowly. The most aggravating is that there are many opportunities to speed up the process; There are many meaningless characters who are represented and who are never given a chance to be a murder suspect or victim. There is a sloppy teacher, an underlined director, a cunning secretary, a stupefied school guard, an ignorant detective, an alcoholic stepfather, a thoughtless grandmother and the mother of an early victim, still grieving. All of these characters may have a motive for murder or a reason to be killed, but they are all in vain. Worst of all, the story still focuses on them, and sometimes it denotes whole scenes to reveal their character. But for what? <br /> <br /> What surprises me in “The Day of Release” and its little fan base is that people are no longer surprised at death scenes. Fans are crazy about death scenes like raft slaughter in The Burning, the death of a washing machine in My Bloody Valentine, the death of a kabob in Happy Birthday Me, the inverted death in Friday 13th Part 3, and death Jacuzzi in “Halloween II”, and even the death of the hood of a car in “Madman.” But where is the respect for some truly unique (albeit stupid) deaths on “Graduate Day.” One victim was pierced right through the jugular fencing sword, gets this sword like a throwing spear. The best death includes thorns under the landing mat. Why these deaths are not known Are you among the genres like death in more popular slasher films? <br /> <br /> “Graduation Day” is struggling to become a great and unique film, but there is only an element of logic missing from the stimulation that really destroys the whole experience. This is not the worst of its kind (try checking out “Don't walk in the woods ... alone”), and there is a bit of waiting, plus it delivers exactly what the fans are looking for (blood, blood, nudity, sex). and nostalgia), but "Graduate's Day" will not be remembered as one of the greatest films of all time ever made. This is not a question of the budget - almost all slashers have a low-budget budget, but it is a question of ideas, creativity and skill. This is all you need to create any movie ... <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of hardcore slasher. Fans of horror in general can be a bit boring, and people who are not very interested in horror should stay away. This is not the worst slasher movie, but it is far from being the best.
