The film is about a French girl who is raped by street hooligans. The rape scene itself is filmed in all its gloomy details with all the male and female organs and their interactions clearly visible to the camera. In a fit of rage, the victim grabs his friend’s weapon (or was it a brother?), Shoots him and runs off with a weapon. She meets this prostitute, who has just seen her pimp being shot down, they come together and go to Paris. This is followed by a series of insane, senseless and savage murders: the girls seem to enjoy each murder more than the previous one. One poor guy was shot in the hole. Between the numerous murders there are good portions of sex. <br /> <br /> The film is not the worst that I saw, I would say that there was probably more violence in “Saving Private Ryan”. If violence is what you are looking for, then there are a lot of other films. And if you need sex, then I would suggest one of these XXX. <br /> <br /> I went to see the movie because of all the hype that was given in the media. The film itself is not a big deal, just a lot of violence and sex, shot with something like a handheld camera. I was surprised that this film was 15 years old in Sweden, if 15-year-olds can watch this film, they should also be able to watch XXX films.
