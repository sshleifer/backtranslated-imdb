As Americans, we are accustomed to expect "parity for the course" shit when it comes to HORRAY and unknown directors directing unknown actors playing the role of unknown authors. We really expect it to be bad, and when they don’t suck, it will be a success overnight. <br /> <br /> This is not a success overnight, and not a success over a weekend or a month. It blows from beginning to end, and my only recommendation is this: JOIN THIS KNOWLEDGE, THAT IS GOOD, enjoy what you have, what it is not, and if you have something better, leave it on the background. It is spectacular to watch older people cross a busy street during rush hour, but don’t expect much - they almost never get under a real car, it's just a lot of hype.
