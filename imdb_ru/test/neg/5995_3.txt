It was supposed to rock. VH1 departed from the traditional divas (Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, etc.), which made the 2003 show so outdated. Unfortunately, the movement had the opposite effect. The show did not have the MC that held the show together. Queen Latifa did a fantastic show on the 2003 Divas. The show began with the horrific performance of Lady Marmalade with Patti Labelle, Cindy Lauper and Jessica Simpson. Good in the studio with some control, they can all sound great. <br /> <br /> However, when they compete with each other (why?), it just sounds painful! Jessica Simpson has the strangest facial expressions when she sings what I have ever seen! Cindy Lauper also performed Girl Just Wanna Fun. It was not so bad, but it was hardly impressive. The worst is yet to come! Cindy and Patty Label have teamed up to perform Cindy’s hit Time for Time. He was acoustic and did not fit into the rest of the show. However, everything could be fine if both of them did not insist on squealing like mammals. It was just awful. <br /> <br /> Debbie Harry (from Blondie) is always cool. She has her own style, and perhaps she cannot compete vocally with many of the divas, although she can of course sing very well. Debbie came out and performed the # 1 Blondie 'Rapture' hit. With beautiful vocals. She really hit the notes perfectly. She looked amazing. Rapper Eva introduced the new, but unfortunately, the worst rap. It was good. The next performance of Debbie was a team with rookie Joss Stone. They performed the Blondie hit "Anyway." I think Joss misunderstood the style of the song and just called out Debbie. Sadly enough, Debbie tried and failed to match her screaming style, which spoiled him a bit. She should have just allowed Joss to continue her completely inappropriate struggle. All Blondy played this track. The last track Debbie performed was Blondie's huge hit "Call Me". It was rather poor. Not the fault of Debbie, because you just could not hear her. Throughout the show, the sound was terrible. <br /> <br /> Joss Stone also sang a few songs. They were pretty well made. Ashanti also appeared to perform two unexplainable cover versions. First, she sang “I'm coming” by Diana Ross, and then “There was no one” by Chuck Khan. She is not a diva! She can sing to such a degree, but she is not present at all. Why not just invite real singers. Chuck even gave an interview on the show .... <br /> <br /> Gladys Knight appeared and made a potpour. It was very good. She was probably the best part of the show. I don't know much about her, except that she is an experienced Las Vegas performer, and her experience and class really shine. This time Patti Labelle played another role - her hit of the 80s “New Attitude”. It was a finale, and everything was fine, but it was too late. It was one big failure. Good luck next time VH1. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a heavily edited 55 minute version that was shown on VH1 in the UK. If it were the best bits .....
