Road House was originally a classic 80s wacky movie that, although it had almost no reward-winning script or acting, was a very enjoyable and popular film, thanks in large part to the presence of star Patrick Swayze and some great actors. Battle and candy to the eye. <br /> <br /> 16 years later MGM / Sony is trying to recreate the magic that made us all quote one liner and repeat the three rules of jumping up ... a film that quotes all the best scenes of the original and gives three rules. <br /> <br /> If this was a film made by amateur fans, it would be perceived as a homage to one of Swayze’s most popular films. Like a professionally made film, it looks right on the front of the DVD as “Bargin Bin” with constant reuse of lines and plot from the original film, becoming more an annoying sign of lack of originality than cool links to the original. br /> <br /> Having said this, with new lines, such as "I will kill you just like I killed your father," it is not surprising that the writers decided to paraphrase most of the original script. <br /> <br /> I knew that this would never be something special, being a continuation of Straight to DVD, but I at least hoped that there could be a couple of new ideas and fresh things included to fit the name Road House, but what you get is just a remake of 2006 of the same film with the addition of a small amount of drugs. <br /> <br /> If I were the director, I would delete all the links to the first film so as not to taint the original. and these are characters. In fact, we got the character Patrick Swayze, who now had to die (killed off-screen Jake Busy), and his brother and son became the main characters, who, oddly enough, have completely different surnames. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was that the “son” of Dalton was driving the same car as his father, a really cool tribute, although later he was destroyed by the fact that the car met its end EXACTLY exactly the same as its predecessor. This is a good example of how this film goes too far, including episodes and ideas from the film of the 89th year. <br /> <br /> Also, of course, who can forget the legendary moment when Wild Bill promises to kill Shane, “like I killed your father,” and then proceeds to try to send him in a completely different way. Amazing spelling there. I see that Schaech is listed as co-author of the script. Stick to acting or, preferably, nothing. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good film if you have nothing to watch and you want to turn off your brain for an hour and a half or if you don’t have it. I haven’t seen the first Road House, but hardcore fans of Swayze’s classics will be almost completely disappointed to such an extent that they feel offensive because this film was the first. As someone once suggested as an alternative subtitle for this film: “Even Jeff Healey is glad he won't see this film!” Stick to the original Road House and experience the good old days of Swayze!
