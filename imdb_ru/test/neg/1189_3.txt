If you watched the show and love the league as I do, then get ready to give up. I went to the movies with a group of fans of the league, and we all agreed that this film was not as funny or dismal as the three previous shows. In my personal opinion, it was a money spinner. The letter was invented, and the plot is confused - no, do not confuse, just confused with what he was trying to do. Authors who are much more talented than my pathetic critic have indulged themselves to the worst. I hope that the league, at least, can be fairly honest with itself and recognize that this film is inferior to the excellent three episodes. I will not buy it, despite the fact that I own most of the league memorabilia.
