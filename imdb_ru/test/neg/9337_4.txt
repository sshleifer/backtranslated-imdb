At this moment I am watching this movie on TV here in Tokyo. Beautiful landscapes, beautiful sets of biblical proportions, beautiful costumes, beautiful color, beautiful Gina. A magnificent climatic scene when God destroys the idol of Sheban and much more with de Millin's lightning strikes at the moment when Yule and Gina are about to complete their love. Yul does a decent job of delivering his lines, although he is very similar to Yul, acting as Ramses or Taras Bulba. George Sanders sounds like George Sanders playing George Sanders. Given the limited range of actions that she is asked to show in this role, Gina does an excellent job with her work, although by the end of the film she completely turns into a modest repentant girl and looks as if she plays in Mother’s biography. Theresa. I think that the lightning will do it with you, but it is almost breathtaking how quickly she rejects her own beliefs for her new religion. Supporting players are mostly terrible, they lack credible emotions and time. The usual big battle scenes, what sounded like lustful dances in 1959, and the orchestra blowing up a lot of trumpet calls for a huge choir singing a lot of “ah”, but none of them was completely Hollywood. The final sword battle between Brynner and Sanders takes place at a ridiculously low level of skill in a high school game. The film is one big piece of eye candy, but not much more.
