I only watched it because I saw a couple of good reviews of it, so I was expecting at least half a cheese film. Toybox doesn't even deliver it. There are so many problems with this click that I don’t even know where to start, so I’ll list a few basic problems (Once again, a warning about the spoiler. Just read them, it will save you from having to watch it later). <br /> <br /> First, this film begins and often mentions mythical folklore as Celeste Noir (the witch whose main character claims to be reincarnated), and in the middle of Volker (or something like that , an evil man with a wide smile who cuts people into hooks and sells their insides with cakes). I liked it, it was a nice concept, everything related to pies is just nice. But then you watch the film, and it tells about this idiot and her boyfriend (and what happened to him? Was he a psychic? Did he have the strength? Why did he continue to see visions that even the so-called “witch” didn't do) notice ??), and they meet their crazy family. Not really mad, they just argue a lot. This is what much of this film is arguing about, and they barely touch the alleged myth, with the exception of a few tangled scenes from which it is impossible to make heads or tails. <br /> <br /> In one scene, Berenice (the main character associated with the witch) leaves and performs some kind of candlelit ritual. It seemed rather important, but absolutely NOTHING happened after she did it, it just wasted more than my time. <br /> <br /> And who the hell is this guy with his dog? Do you see him going to the house from the very beginning of the movie with this evil red-eyed dog, and then he finally gets there and is killed? What the hell?? Was he the middle peasant? Was his dog obsessed? Did someone kill the dog? They never showed it. In addition, any scene involving the vicar was absolutely meaningless and only weakly explained the unfortunate ending. As if they had all these interesting characters ideas, and they all had not gone away! A guy who clearly possessed some abilities, but never explained them. Grandmother, who seemed to have some magical powers too, but never used them. The vicar, who ... OK, never mind, in fact there was no point in his existence at all. And then there was Berenice and her stupid amulet. Could she really work wonders or did she just use it to reflect light and blind people? It was a waste of time, and the only reason I give him two stars is that a) Berenice is pretty sweet, and b) cakes were mentioned in her. Save money on renting it, and, dear god, don't even think about buying it, if only spending money is a new fad.
