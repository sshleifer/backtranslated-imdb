The original "Psycho" (1960) is widely considered the best work of Alfred Hitchcock and, of course, in my opinion, is one of the best films of all time. Therefore, the decision to shoot a frame with the help of a remake is a little puzzling. <br /> <br /> The cast of the original was flawless, so the cast of this remake had a lot to justify. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates was not a good choice for a leader. He is too cute and not as convincing as Bates. I can imagine that actors like Mark Wahlberg or John Turturro do much better in this role. Anne Heche as Marion Crane does a decent job, but she is mentally compared to Janet Lee. Julianne Moore is a much better actress than she shows here, and Viggio Mortenson just goes through her role. The best of this new actor is William H. Macy as a private detective. <br /> <br /> Although director Guus Van Sant does a good job, he cannot create a tense situation like Hitchcock. And why did he change the scene in the basement of the house? In the original, the atmosphere is dark, humid and closed, whereas in this version it occurs in a brightly lit laboratory environment. And I think that a black and white photograph of the original has a definite advantage over the color version. <br /> <br /> Perhaps another drawback may be the fact that most moviegoers have seen the original and know what will happen and when. <br /> <br /> All I can say is, if not broken, do not fix it. <br /> <br />
