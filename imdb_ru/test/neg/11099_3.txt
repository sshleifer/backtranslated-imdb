Apparently, the film is based on the popular French horror story by Arthur Berned in 1927. Not that I've ever heard of this before, but Belphegor used to be a popular storyline for films and mini-series. The first film was released back in 1927, simultaneously with the novel. Arthur Berned was part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels at the same time. The character Belph√©gor is one of his most famous creations. <br /> <br /> Once, Sophie Marceau was a promising new European actress who would conquer Hollywood. However, now she has returned to films like this. There is nothing wrong with playing French quality films, as this is the country from which it hails, but this film just makes fun of it. <br /> <br /> The problem is mainly that the film relies on special effects to make the film good and scary. Well, horror and special effects were never a good combination, with some exceptions. Not that the special effects were bad at it. Especially for a European film, this is simply good, but it is simply inappropriate, since the film gave the feeling that it could easily have been made without effect. It would actually make the film better and worse for watching, no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> The film is not tense or exciting to watch, including the fact that the film seems to have difficulty choosing the right approach. Sometimes the film chooses an easy and less serious approach, while in others it is clearly trying to become a good scary horror movie. Basically, this is the reason why the film simply does not work at any level. We can say that the film is even a bit boring. All this also definitely worsens towards the end. After a while, you simply stop caring about this film and its history and begin to wish that you decided instead to watch something else. <br /> <br /> Editing seems to be completely disabled. He uses too fast frames, without much of a style, while quick editing was obviously intended to give the film a good, modern style. In addition, the timeline is sometimes just confused, as if some sequences were edited in the wrong order. <br /> <br /> The musical score is also very annoying, and at times it doesn't even sound to fit the film, as if it had all been clogged for a long time before the film finished shooting. I cannot believe that composer Bruno Kulei is an Oscar-nominated composer. The musical accompaniment is almost as annoying as the film, its sound effects. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with many characters, which, however, you do not care. It is also very unlikely that a woman like Sophie Marceau will ever fall in love with a man like Frederic Dyfenthal. The film also starred Julie Christie, which is good, but adds little to the film. <br /> <br /> Awful hours. <br /> <br /> 3/10
