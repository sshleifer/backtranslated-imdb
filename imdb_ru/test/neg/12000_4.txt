Wow, what a stupid movie! It all starts with the fact that it will be a slasher, and the camera monitors the dogs running through the forest. Then it gets a little boring and follows the story of how some girls move to some house, pursued by Indian spirits. Then we get a lot of shots of one partially dressed girl and another naked girl in the bathroom. Suddenly it becomes very stupid when "zombie Indians" rise from the ground and begin to terrorize the girls. We even have a samurai Indian. <br /> <br /> This film starts quite boring, although the story of four Indians who had buried themselves alive seemed quite interesting to me. As soon as Indian zombies (or whatever you want to call them, they are not technically zombies) start terrorizing girls when the fun begins. This is not a special film, and it should not be taken seriously, it's just something funny when you miss or drink with friends. I can not help thinking that it would work better than the story, because the first half is tediously boring.
