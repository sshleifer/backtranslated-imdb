In the Muslim country, Khalid (fictional), her benevolent leader / dictator Reed Hadley in the role of Amir dies from cancer. Amir dies and a desperate conspiracy unfolds. His body is wrapped in aluminum foil and taken into an underground operation (the population does not know about his death), consisting of his doctor (Nigseriana) and Mohammed, from the country to perform a risky brain transplant. The operation is conducted by the disgraced Dr. Kent Taylor, who believes that there is no chance of failure, and he has two assistants. One of them is about 3 feet high (the master Blaster really ruled the city of Barter), and the other is a disfigured and injured 7-foot giant named Gore. What could go wrong? <br /> <br /> I forgot to mention American Amir’s deathbed, blonde Barbie’s wife, Tracy, or that Dr. Kent has a dungeon with experimental female slaves and delusions of grandeur? How about a brain transplant that didn't take? There are a lot of stupid things to do, and people are being killed, but I will no longer lie to you: THE MISSION IS COMPLETED. Goals justify the means. If you can take it, you do not have to spend 80 minutes. Hope this is enough. Do not say that I did not warn you. If you must watch, do not look alone and stock up on a lot of medication. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
