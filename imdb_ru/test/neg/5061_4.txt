Angel-A is the change in tempo for Besson; monochrome, makvisty and rather mediocre. This is a well-photographed on-site in Paris, although subtitle readers should note: fast fire and good cinematography can help to upset viewing. <br /> <br /> This film is not Wings of Desire or Wonderful Life. ". Despite the common themes (heavenly intervention prevents suicide, an angel and mortal relationship arise), Besson does nothing to enlighten or inspire us. Even well-played, tearful moments quickly sink into the sentimentality of curling. <br /> <br /> The wrong ideology of the film is annoying; Angel, whose message of love and self-respect is constantly undermined by her cruel and erratic behavior; "Happy ending", which negates the hero's intended journey from helplessness to self-esteem and independence. <br /> <br /> Verdict: itâ€™s quite pleasant to watch, but the tangled moral and philosophical messages cast a shadow on the film exactly where it should shine. 4/10
