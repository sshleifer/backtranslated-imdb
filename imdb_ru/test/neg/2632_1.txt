This film is sooo bad, I could not even watch the final. Milo's voice was too low, and I could not understand what he said, as well as some of Kendra's words. In addition, from where he took all these wedding dresses; it was very impractical. The film failed to describe Miloâ€™s drowning in detail and how it made people make fun of Dr. Jeter and his practice. In general, I was disappointed that I could not give this film a zero rating, because, considering this film as one, I felt that I deserved its well-deserved praise.
