I watched this movie by mistake, thinking it was another zombie radio station movie. Short production values ​​and low rents soon made it clear that it was another one of those cheap fakes in the style of a sci-fi channel. <br /> <br /> Bill Moseley’s central performance is initially quite attractive, because it’s a dubious radiokind, but as the film continues, it becomes less and less convincing, because he is really obliged to act. The rest of the actors have nothing in common except how they look worried and have no depth. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is boring, flat and completely uninspiring, like many other films of this kind. He does not even cope with decent blood, and the zombie make-up is literally pathetic, except for one noticeable exception at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The film tries to bring originality and a message into this mixture of half-baked and detached ideas, somehow equating this outburst with intolerance to Islam and the war on terror. The whole intellectual influence of a 6-year-old child copes with this. As characters and, apparently, the authors are not able to distinguish the difference between race and religion, describing all people of a certain color as "Muslims." It is most noticeable that one character is a Muslim only by skin color. At the same time, “Muslim” terrorists who cause an outbreak are a common psychopathic stereotype. <br /> <br /> Presumably, the far superior Pontypool had the same budget as Dead Air, but it shines everywhere where this film fails with a bang.
