Not only did I get the original name, but I came to the conclusion that “Terror Hospital” is another one of seven pseudonyms. This is a real cheat. Such films can usually be forgiven for a number of reasons, mainly the unintended consequences of this function at all levels of production, which result in at least a slight form of entertainment, mainly entertainment. It has none of this. Instead, the viewer becomes a witness to unnecessary and unnecessary and too convenient for the situation of presentation and stretching scenes of characters, carefully moving from room to room, and all this - half of the film. Forget, trying to figure out where someone (or who he is) is during dark or night scenes; you probably don't care. There is also a random sequence of chasing a car that seems rather boring compared to some of the old driver films that I slept ... I mean, I sat and watched in high school. In fact, here we are talking about mysticism, obsession, and a murderer at large — a good recipe for a junk movie. Unfortunately, there is nothing here to make it even "good" garbage; in combination with the above, bad actions and not very special effects are just bad actions and not such special effects. It's just trash, clean and simple. Leave it on the counter in the pawnshop or in this box on sale. There is a reason for him there ...
