I rarely give ratings below 5, but in this case I have to weigh it. Elmore Leonard is a great writer with many wonderful, complex books, original characters, a clear dialogue, invigorating plot twists. Films based on his books go back to Hombre (Paul Newman), Mr. Majestyk (Bronson) and others (Clooney / Lopez) among others. Even when this is done, films, at least, have some measure of the essence of the plot. This .... is just not a worthy addition to the catalog. <br /> <br /> The game is bad (I donâ€™t know why, because there are very capable people here), and the story is decided with stupidity. Characters are rearranged, chemistry is absent, actors and actresses are mistakenly chosen. <br /> <br /> Since Elmore Leonard is a truly wonderful storyteller, I hope that anyone who does not know his work will be discouraged from reading his books, because they have seen this disappointing performance of one of his stories. <br /> <br /> This story is a continuation of the movie "Get a Shorty." If you have not seen this movie, do not watch it. If you have seen Get Shorty, do not go to this. <br /> <br /> I saw Be Cool a few years ago, and I visited the video again tonight. The first time must have not made such a negative impression, because I forgot how gloomy this sequel was. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I think about those who appeared in this film, no less. They probably expected something more. Getting a short one was original and very fun. I almost always like Travolta, but he is much better in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and in the previous Get Shorty. He clearly could not enjoy what is happening here. <br /> <br /> And I heard that Freaky Deaky, another book by Elmore Leonard, is being prepared for release in 2008. I hope they cope. <br /> <br /> Read books. They are almost all gorgeous.
