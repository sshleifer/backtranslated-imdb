This should be renamed "Everybody Loves Sebastian". The village high school student in the countryside in 1983 (or the older one?) They seemed to flop on the tuff) with strange hair, and the “leopod” appearance had a big plate full of problems. His stepfather announces certain plans for a gender reassignment surgery, after which his mother calls the marriage dissolved; Everyone and their mother call Sebastian the word “f”, all the while “kissing” with different girls, getting the most from Ready-Whip in the supermarket and saving the strawberry prostitute from the clutches of her ruthless pimp. <br /> <br /> Sebastian’s "Friends" make Eddie Haskal look like a choir boy; bad association doesn't get much worse. Sebastian seems to be recording the suicide attempts of Harold (although he will not allow suicidal tendentious incidents). For some reason, the genius SAT, who scored Sebastian, MUST finish his studies a year earlier, although he has no idea about the future and does not want to go to college (what does this nonsense mean?). <br /> <br /> This film is a look at a few weeks from the life of a person who is REALLY MADE. The final scene assumes that everything will be fine, although the HOW remains entirely with the viewer. <br /> <br /> The creators of this film seem to rely exclusively on the undoubted attractiveness of a very attractive male role. "History" leaves much to be desired. Look for "what will this gorgeous baby do next ...?" not quite satisfying. Weak production values ​​simply do not correspond to other films, independently or otherwise. A low budget and a weak story need something more than a pretty face to bring it to the end. The “results” of this project are easily forgotten and are an insult to smart movie fans.
