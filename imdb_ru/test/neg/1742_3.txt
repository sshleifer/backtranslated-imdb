I thought it was weird and just awful, not scary. I saw a couple of Japanese horror films, Ringu and Juon, and loved them; but this film was a disappointment. He didn’t even explain anything about the curse. I just did not see any horror ... I was not at all scary. As I watched, I waited for Kyrie to reveal the secret of the curse and why it was happening now. If it was some ancient curse, then why didn’t it happen before Father Shuichi? And he never told us what happened to her father. I kept waiting for someone to tell us the meaning or cause of this curse, and then it just ended. I was very disappointed.
