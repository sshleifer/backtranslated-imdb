I watched a sci-fi channel when this steaming pile of crap appeared. Although it’s not as bad as Vinsky’s “Komodo Curse”, it’s still crap ... BAD. Vinorsky uses the same island as in The Curse of Komodo, as well as the same actors and house. The effects are top notch (amazing), but that's all ........ I don't know what else to say about this movie ....... oh yeah! As in the Komodo Curse, the government intervenes and decides to bomb the island! Also ... when I saw this part, I laughed hysterically ... KOMANBRA !!! (part of man, komodo and cobra!). In general, this film is complete nonsense even by poor movie standards. Just remember if Jim Vinorsky had anything to do with the movie ... stay away ... not to fall asleep, repeat: "It's almost over ... it's almost over ..."
