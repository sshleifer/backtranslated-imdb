TART is the worst film I have seen this year, and it includes both the GIGLI bomb Affleck / J. Lo and the most boring Robot Zombie ZONE HOUSE of 1000 corpses. I don’t know if this comparison is fair, considering that TART was made two years earlier and probably has a budget that is half the size of even a low-budget 1000 building. Despite this, all three films suffer from the same flaws: a terrible scenario, a terrible game, a terrible direction. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** (although I honestly don’t think I have something to spoil) <br /> <br /> TART is about a group of very spoiled children from a private school. Most of them live in spacious suites on super-expensive New York Park Avenue, thanks to the finances of their careless parents. The film demonstrates the aimless life of one of the students (Kat), as she throws away her only true friend (as frivolous as she was) in pursuit of a “good life” with the crowd. This, of course, leads to sex, drugs and music, which is significantly worse than rock and roll. Everything is overly dramatized as it usually happens in really bad movies. Kat's first sexual experience leads her to be stigmatized and ostracized by her recently acquired circle of friends; her first encounter with drugs leads her almost to be dumped in the garbage disposal after her cohorts consider her dead from an overdose. No hard messages there, he said sarcastically. <br /> <br /> This is basically what the plot “saw him before 100 times” entails. Other minor and even less interesting plot details include one friend who steals jewelry and knick-knacks from everyone else, a wild child who lives life on the edge (and finally falls out of it one night in EAST Hamptons) , who ends her close friendship with Kat, as soon as she learns that Kat has a Jewish father, and Kat’s strained relationship with her single mother, who unsuccessfully tries to make Kat appreciate her privileged life. The thief turns out to be unfit for life. “Wild Child” is played as a relaxed version of one of the Hilton sisters. British girl disappears from the movie after breaking up. The relationship between mother and daughter is considered completely unimportant until the final scene of the film, where she and her besieged mother achieved a kind of reconciliation. * yawn * <br /> <br /> *** END OF SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> About the cast and crew ... Dominic Swain came on the scene with her strong role as a minor seductress in 1997 and FACE / OFF look great. Her performances were strong enough to include in her several lists for viewing at that time. She was at that time 17 years old, and I hope that they will not be the best roles in her career. If she takes on a few more roles, like the one she plays in Tart, it may well be. <br /> <br /> I saw Biju Phillips in just one other movie (BULLY), and I swear that her performance alone was almost identical to the one she gave here. I'm not sure that she is not able to give different performances or it was just a coincidence that her roles in the two films were very similar. I assume the first is true. I feel that this woman has a very small talent in terms of acting. Here she is an actress, played to portray the exhausted sister Hilton. The fact that she demonstrates such a weak performance is surprising, given that she grew up and remains friends with the real Hilton sisters. In fact, she plays her version in this film and damn poorly copes with it. <br /> <br /> As for writer / director Christina Wayne ... I don’t know anything about her, except Tart, who was her first, and only film project for today. With such first efforts, it is not surprising that her career in show business was short.
