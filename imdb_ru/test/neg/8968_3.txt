Katherine Hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking - and locals consider her a witch. Kate works too hard, trying to convince us that she is a bully (named Trigger Hicks!), But you can see that she doesnâ€™t even believe in this unintentionally comical script. Constantly smiling Robert Young plays a brigadier working on the construction of a mountain dam, who becomes Trigger's first passion ... but, alas, he is married! No amount of white magic can reanimate this formula, based on the play and displayed on the RKO screen. with too wide a bloom. It is godless and simply unobservable. * 1/2 of ****
