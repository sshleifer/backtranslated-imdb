I really wanted to love this film for various reasons - the subject is intrinsically interesting and probably the main problem facing the world today, and causes amazing work (for example, “When I Lived in Modernity” by Linda Grant), usually from Israeli side of the fence. In addition, the guy I like told me that he thinks it was the best film he had seen in the whole year, so with this recommendation ... <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, I really found that nod in some points! Admittedly, I was tired and the seats in the cinema were comfortable, but I found it was too much hard work, trying to identify with the characters. As soon as I had the idea that it was a series of vignettes, I went with this, but it made him disappointing, like a sketch, and not a movie. I liked the concept of a low-key, almost silent mise-en-scene contrasting with these utopian moments - a sexy girl, a red ball and a ninja Muslim fighter. But personally, I think the film was over-promoted. I'm not saying that the story and the plot are all (this is definitely not the case), but even a little more dialogue would help.
