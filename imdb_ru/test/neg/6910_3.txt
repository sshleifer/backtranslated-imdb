This series does not represent the British view of the revolutionary war, but rather the anti-American view of it. The main theme of the series is the silent majority of the colonists enjoyed British rule; that the founding fathers were manipulative schemers whose sole purpose was to involve Britain in a brutal civil war; that the American revolutionaries and militias were racist, cruel hooligans, deceived in the fight. It is obvious that the goal of the author, Richard Holmes, is to have the spectator extrapolate these characteristics from the American population of 1775 to the present in a straight line. <br /> <br /> For example, in the episode "The World Heard the Shots" Holmes digs an obscure imprint of the Boston Massacre, in which he claims that the skin of Crisp Attaks, a black man and the first man killed in the revolution, was intentionally "Knocked out." Holmes argues that portraying Attax as a black man would be bad propaganda for a revolutionary cause. Holmes never reveals how he knows that. And that is not all. Holmes goes to great lengths to work in a single, unwarranted crime: the desecration of the body of a British soldier. He compares the American militia with the Viet Cong and the Mujahideen, without mentioning any differences in the goals of these groups. The list goes on. <br /> <br /> Presumably, this series was made in response to Mel Gibson's “Patriot”. This says a lot when an academician feels the need to respond to Mel Gibson on any topic. Instead of presenting the British point of view, it seems that Holmes really wanted to give a sensational anti-American point of view, and in the process he made himself a historian of Roger Corman - strictly the third grade of slok.
