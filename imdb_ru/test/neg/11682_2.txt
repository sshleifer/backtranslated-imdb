Hmm, not a patch on the original from the Shaw Brothers. The fight is average and looks very awkward. The storyline, as one would expect from a 70s Kung Fu movie, is tangled and stupid. Silly voices for women, voiced in elegant English accents for men. I turned it off early and I love martial arts. Get the original, it is much better than this regular film, do not be fooled, I bought the wrong movie that I wanted, this is the film of the Shaw brothers. I just started to comment, I just make films on foreign and martial arts, this is only the beginning of my collection of films, I personally own most of the modern martial arts. I hope you do not waste time watching this, it is intended only for Kung Fu fans of the 70s.
