An “independent” film that promises turns, adventures and emotional adventures from the back of the box that we will never forget. This film also misleads us, starring Rachel Lee Cook. After the first twenty minutes, you realize that this film will not give you ANYTHING. The story continues aimlessly, without revealing anything new or important to interest us. All three “anxious” characters have only a small part of the story to make us care. As soon as you reach the end, everything in the story will change, and instead of helping the audience catch up, you have no idea and, more importantly, no interest in "why." The director, who also believed that it would be nice to star in one of the main roles, seems to be part of the film without prior experience or knowledge of useful filmmaking. The whole film looks like a feature film created by a novice student trying to hide the lack of real talent.
