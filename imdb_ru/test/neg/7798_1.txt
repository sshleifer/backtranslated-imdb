I watched the preview in Femalien and thought it might be a cool movie. Turns out it's a terrible rubbish. The film is not so much nudity, not to mention not having sex. There were only some silly and banal dialogues along with an uninteresting dance that you usually expect to see while listening. In our case, you can even see it in real movies. Conclusion: I have no one for that. Just leave it alone.
