When I watched this film three years ago, I thought that it was an example of many features found in Singapore's movies: slow, with a minimal plot and dialogue, depending on the composition of the film that makes it work. <Br /> <br /> At that time, among local filmmakers, the inability to rate “Be with me” is tantamount to panning “Citizen Kane” or any of Ozu's later films. I have no idea how “Being with me” reached such sacred heights in the cinematic consciousness of Singapore, but I always felt that “12 floors” of Khu is the best film, although the last film cannot boast such a good cinematographer like Adrian Tan . , DP Khoo for "Be with me." "12 floors" has a story that is better suited to most Singaporeans, and also bites, which is not in the exhausting reverie of "Be with me." <br /> <br /> “Being with me” is basically a barely interconnected narrative trio joined in the film by Hu and his screenwriter Wong Kim Ho. This concerns a guard who falls in love with a girl who only sees from a distance; two girls in a romantic relationship; and the story of the deaf-and-dumb Theresa Chan. <br /> <br /> Tanya “Being with me” is very well shot with the help of the camera Varicam. The compositions of the film workshops. The film, almost completely silent, has almost no dialogue. Characters do not move realistically, but almost as if they are models as directed by the director, almost always looking at the screen and experiencing emotions: loneliness or sadness. Unfortunately, the characters do not act against each other. This type of film was seen many times: in the films of Tsai Minglian, in the protégé of Hu Royston Tan “4:30” and in other places. Unfortunately, his ultra-sluggishness (in fact, less plot) and the use of the piano soundtrack to the lento simply do not appeal to me. <br /> <br /> The criticism of "Be With Me" seems to almost nullify the inspirational story behind it. Teresa Chan, blind and deaf, who, despite all this, lives a full life, but I'm afraid this film means little to me. I am ready to applaud Chan's persistent and courageous march in life and Tan's astounding cinema, but for a better perception of the same subject with lots of meat (without the other two tedious and distracting stories), try Werner Herzog "Land of Silence." and darkness "(1971).
