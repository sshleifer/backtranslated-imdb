Scary Movie 1-4, Epic Movie, Movie with Date, Meet the Spartans, None of the films for teens and Another gay movie. The creation of "Superhero Movie" eleventh in the series, which easily destroyed the parody genre. Now, I admit that I have a weakness for the classics, such as “Airplane” and “Naked Gun”, but you know that you have milked the franchise so badly when you can see the plugs a mile from them. In fact, the only thing that can really motivate you to see this disaster is the incredibly funny, but massive, sell-out of Leslie Nilson. <br /> <br /> You can say that he needs money, or he intends to leave the ship, like a good captain. He does not in any way destroy this genre, but, damn it, he does not help him. But if I feel sorry for anyone in this film, then its worthy actor Drake Bell, who is experiencing great embarrassment. Nevertheless, the people who are subjected to the greatest amount of torture today are the audience, forced to sit for 90 minutes of silent bile, no funnier than herpes. <br /> <br /> After tampering with films about crashes on the plane!, the police show in Naked Gun and the Hollywood horrors in Scary Movies 3 and 4, produced by David Zucker, put satirical views on the superhero genre using this anarchic comedy that covers everything: from Spider-Man to X-Men and Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> Shortly after being bitten by a genetically engineered dragonfly, outcast from high school Rick Riker (Drake Bell) begins to experience a striking transformation. Now Rick's skin is as strong as steel, and he has the strength of ten people. Deciding to use his newfound abilities to fight crime, Rick creates a special suit and takes on the personality of Dragonfly, a fearless crime fighter who is dedicated to providing safe streets for law-abiding citizens. <br /> <br /> But every superhero needs a sworn enemy, and after Lou Landers (Christopher MacDonald) finds himself at the center of an experiment that has become terribly wrong, he develops the ability to draw vitality from everyone he meets and becomes a villainous Hourglass Striving to achieve immortality, the Hourglass is trying to gather as much vitality as possible, since the noble dragonfly is going to destroy its sworn enemy and realize its fate as a true hero. Craig Mazin writes and sends this lousy parody. <br /> <br /> Tracy Morgan, Pamela Anderson, Leslie Nielsen, Marion Ross, Jeffrey Tambor and Regina Hall. <br /> <br /> The movie “Hellish Superhero” can earn some merit in being so damn better than Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie. But with great responsibility comes one of the worst events of 2008 to date. Laughter, but a little less annoying than Meet the Spartans. And in the same sense, it is much easier to forget than to meet Spartans. But perhaps this is a good reason. Some of us are still trying to erase the “Meeting with the Spartans” stain. <br /> <br /> My final verdict? Avoid unless you are one of those people who like this movie in a car accident. It's as bad as Date and Scary Movie 2, but not as bad as Meet the Spartans or Epic Movie. Super Villain.
