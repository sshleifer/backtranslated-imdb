This film was really stupid, and I thought that it was not so bad, and I could tolerate a film about how people eat in bed. Then the part near the end, where the guy has skeletal hands, turned out to be cherry on top of a bad movie. I could see screws in plastic skeletal hands for God's sake. The brother was still alive and moving when his arms were bare. The funny thing is that he could still move his arms, which was just wrong. Without muscles, you really can't move your arms, but he did it. The brother was supposed to bleed to death before he moved his hands. The film was not great, but everything was fine until the scene was heard. I laughed so hard that I do not even remember how it all ended. It was associated with foam or something else.
