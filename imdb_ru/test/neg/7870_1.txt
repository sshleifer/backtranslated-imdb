This movie sucks. The acting game is worse than in the films we shot when we were 10 years old with a video camera, the effects look like a computer game of the 80s, and the plot is worse than terrible. Even the worst films of Van Damme make this look shitty. The accent and speech rhythm of the “bad guys” is so bad that it’s funny .. <br /> <br /> I wouldn’t recommend watching it if you are not a big fan of one of the actors. 1 out of 10
