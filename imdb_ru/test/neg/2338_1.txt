I have a feeling that many people liked this film (not all, but many of them), because they don’t want to admit that they don’t understand it. People of average intelligence, if you will, who pretend to be so avant-garde and fashionable, who consider Lynch to be a genius. <br /> <br /> Lynch, for me, looks like Tarantino. They are both great, but neither is a messiah, as many fans want to believe. No director can change the world, so relax. And both sometimes make shit movies, it just happens. Everybody has a bad day. And, of course, since this film was originally conceived as an experimental one, and then hacked into a feature film, it was not created with all the passion and did not think about inserting it into the film. Let's face it, most of the film is an inaudibility that is impossible to understand. We can all come up with meanings, Lynch may have his own opinion, but all this does not matter. He was scattered across the screen incoherently. Admittedly, the first part had the semblance of a deliberately confusing fleetingly interesting story, but then it fluctuates. <br /> <br /> A cowboy, a mysterious organization of people with their phone calls, lawyers ... come on. I can almost imagine how David Lynch shouts a punch, forcing the team to gather around him and explaining to them all: “Look how crazy and strange I am! Is not that great? Strange and crazy work, if it is a by-product of your style. However, it is pretentious and tedious when you try your best to do just that. It looks like all those half-perky shots of “Pulp Fiction” that came out after “Pulp Fiction”. It's just not cool.
