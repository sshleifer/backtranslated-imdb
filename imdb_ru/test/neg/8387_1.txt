I had a failure to watch this movie recently, and I had to sit through it. A friend bought it for £ 1 and insisted that we watch it as it sounds good from the story on the back cover. <br /> <br /> After 10 minutes of the film, it became obvious that the actors were amateurs, and this was an extremely low-budget effort. <br /> <br /> The scenes were very bad, the script was stupid, and there were many scenes in the plot that seemed unnecessarily long, just to make the film a reasonable length. <br /> <For example, when the protagonist rents a warehouse, the film spends a ridiculous amount of time on this stage with meaningless dialogue that serves no real purpose or need for a plot. <br /> <br /> The main actor allegedly takes revenge on a woman who sleeps with the guys to give them HIV, he never thinks to be tested. Instead, he turns into a crazy killer who decided to torture her and then kill and cut her into pieces. <br /> <br /> If this sounds good and you think that he will have a lot of blood, think again. There are no real bloody episodes in this film, and it is tame enough for this type of film. <br /> <br /> This is not scary, not thought-provoking, does not offer fast entertainment. It may, however, put you to sleep, it will surely tire you to tears, so please save yourself from despair and follow my instructions. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS FILM 1/2 out of 10 (it doesn’t even deserve 1) <br /> <br /> The film lasted 78 minutes, but it seemed like it was 2.5 hours.
