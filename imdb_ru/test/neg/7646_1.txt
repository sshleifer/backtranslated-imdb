Obviously, the film has a harsh message against Bush ... If this happens (I did not understand), that's all there is. Boring and useless point. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's too serious to be a comedy, too slow to be a thriller, not funny, not exciting, not interesting, not a movie. It's too much to be the opposite, and vice versa. I was amazed at how bad the film can suck. Don't even think about watching it. <br /> <br /> I watched literally hundreds of films and was never so obliged to write a warning on IMDb. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> Even “Creation ...” is painfully boring. It's just people talking nonsense with a lot of internal jokes in front of the camera, like home movies. There is even a part where a guy takes you to the food that the film crew ate. Still, beats the movie, I think ...
