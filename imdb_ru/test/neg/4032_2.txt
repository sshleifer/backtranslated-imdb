For other comments, I can say that NO ONE could actually enjoy this little thing, this is the same thing that I felt. <br /> <br /> All the while I watched it, I was terrified that someone could have made the film stupid! What is the world coming to? I guess it was my fault that I watched the entire movie (ugh!), But it looked like a bad car accident, I couldn't look away. <br /> <br /> If you are a child under the age of 8 you might like this movie. Otherwise, stay away from it at all costs. This is the stupidest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Everything is stupid - the story, the script, and especially the acting, everything! While watching a movie, you either turn off the TV and think “how the movie can be so sadly stupid,” or continue to watch out of curiosity to see if things can become more stupid than this (they cannot). br /> <br /> These filmmakers (if you call them that) need to seriously return to their daily work, not one of them has a bit of talent, and I very much doubt that you can make such terrible useless trash, which no one in their right mind wants to see! <br /> <br /> Just pulled BS Do not waste your time.
