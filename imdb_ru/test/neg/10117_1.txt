This is truly one of the worst films of all time. It's boring, hard, bad, and teeth crawl pretentiously. <br /> <br /> I watched for about an hour, waiting for a drama to unfold, before I realized that it was not there. The hit on the lace budget was especially painful. It should be the worst day for night shots since Planet 9 from space. <br /> <br /> The only feature that almost does not save is ridiculous "demons", roaming the countryside with a plastic basket for cats. How scary is it? And I really like the Muggies used as add-ons, I suppose they are the least cheap. Although it seemed a bit obvious that they were seduced into the chamber by carefully placing some tuna. <br /> <br /> This film is so terrible that it must have a public health warning. When I picked her up, there was a line-up of people at my local video store who demanded their money back. I am not kidding!
