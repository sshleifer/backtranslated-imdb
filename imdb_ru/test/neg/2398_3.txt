3 stars for Philip Seymour Hoffman. Nothing else in this film deserves even a tiny asterisk. Okay, okay, Amy Adams deserves a tiny smile, but it seems that it doesn't work, so I will stick with 3. Tom Hanks ... nothing. Julia Roberts ... nothing. Mike Nichols ... do you already see the trend? Aaron Sorkin ... Oh God, not by chance. <br /> <br /> I could rant a few paragraphs about how Charlie Wilson’s war obscures history, morality, legality, etc., but I don’t think that some such rant could outweigh the flow fans of Aaron Sorkin. The rest, be careful. Spend money on your movies elsewhere. <br /> <br /> However, if you are looking for a meaningful comment, here is mine. You can put hot fudge sauce on a bunch of garbage, but that changes nothing. Rubbish is rubbish, like Charlie Wilson’s war.
