Do not watch this film, go see something else ... I was very disappointed, I can not appreciate this film better than 3. The game was pretty good, and I really liked William Defoe as a villain, but I do not understand why This film made it on the big screen. The story was old and has been featured in more than 100 other films and over 1000 TV shows / films. The main problem was basically: nothing happens. Take the kidnapping, let the villain make the kidnapped wife deliver the money, make the police look stupid and boring, and extend it to 95 minutes, you will get your movie “Cleaning”. The only two reasons for which I did not appreciate this a 1 were a) Defoe and b) "the end of Plan B". There are not many endings you can give to the movie about the kidnapper ... 75% of these completions end with the end A, 20% end with the end B and 1% end with something unexpected. Boring, boring, boring.
