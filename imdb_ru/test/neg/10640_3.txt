*** SPOILERS! *** I sometimes wonder what makes the creators of sequels think that they have to explain (and, therefore, destroy) the riddles behind the cult horror films. The original Hellraiser of 1987 was an absolute masterpiece and perhaps one of the worst films ever made. Continuation of 1988 “Hellbound” was also a fantastic horror film, although I personally did not like the way the viewer received background information about kenobits, one of the worst horror-villains in the entire history of the original. The third part, “Hell on Earth” (1992), was already quite erratic, the creators of which obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the previously incomparably creepy lead-kenobit pinhead (typical nonsense of the 90s) and therefore destroyed most of it roughness. This fourth part of Hellraiser: Genealogy (1996) is slightly more atmospheric than the third, but it reduces this quality by inventing even more stupid and completely unnecessary reference information about tsenobity and opening the gates to hell. br /> <br /> Seriously - did we need to know how mysterious riddles are made that open the gates to hell? I think not, and this is not the only mystery about tsenobitah that stupidly destroyed in this film. The Pedigree setting occurs in three different periods. The film begins on the space station of the 22nd century, when scientist Dr. Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) is trying to close the gates to hell for good. When government soldiers violate his mission, he must explain his reasons. In the 18th century in Paris, the ancestor of the Merchant was a toy maker, to whom an aristocrat obsessed with the occult, commissioned to build a box of puzzles. The summoned demon, the princess of hell, took over the body of the beautiful Angelica (Valentina Vargas). Since the only person capable of destroying the gates of hell is the one who built it, the pedigree of the toy manufacturer will be cursed, and its ancestors will be contaminated with tsenobity for centuries ... The film, which occurs in the 18th century, The current, and the 22nd century really in a mess. I admit that the part that was shot in the 18th century has an eerie atmosphere and, of course, the best part of the film, but also its smallest part. Parts installed in the present and the future are rather weak and filled with silly and unworthy elements. The undoubted strengths of the film are stunning makeup and bloody effects, absolutely amazing Valentina Varagas as a demon, and Pinhead (Doug Bradley), who, despite having lost some of his eeriness, is still a threatening villain. For HellRaisers, this is an almost insulting idea that Pinhead is supposed to be defeated by a ridiculous light show. In general, “Pedigree” is not a complete disaster, but it is certainly an unworthy continuation of the series, which began so brilliantly. Even director Kevin Yager was clearly embarrassed by this, as he preferred to be called Alan Smithy. In general, it is only recommended to the cruel Pinhead fanatics, and most of them are likely to be disgruntled by the other decrease in the eeriness of their beloved demon. Everyone else is advised to stick with the brilliant first and excellent second part of HellRaiser's franchise and skip all the rest. The effects of cosmetics in "Bloodline" are terrible, but almost everything else is disappointing. My rating: 3.5 / 10
