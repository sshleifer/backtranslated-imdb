Honestly, Mr. Talluri ... if you make a dramatic film in high school after a few teenagers during a school day, and if you mix up the time frame and jump back and forth ... if you do it that is, you can't use one and the same visual device for telling stories “Elephant”, which uses a camera that transmits from one character to another and has scenes shown 3 times from different angles. You just can not do it, because it is such a stupid break, it is hard to believe that someone gave him more than 5 ratings. <br /> <br /> Where “Elephant” (which was released 3 years before this film)) uses school shooting (or, to be precise, Columbine shooting) as the main theme for its script. 2:37 uses a teen suicide and, seeing in the reviews, the shocking value of the subject worked. This is the same slow story, a lot of dramatic piano music leading to the finale, which you know from the very beginning. At the very least, the characters look as if they are struggling to be different in this department. So you have an atypical gay guy who looks like a stoner / skater, a hefty lover who can't cope with his merry side, a rich family brother and sister who have their own problems, and then a nose dive appears. <br /> <br /> You also have a spoiled, bullying chicken and one of the most ridiculous characters in the story ... a sick guy who wets his pants because of "2 urethral syndrome" who has never actually heard the invention of diapers, but rather pees pants in the classroom, and then change into new clothes and does it every day! WOW, no matter how hard this film is to be realistic, this is the most absurd thing I've ever heard. He is beaten in the toilet and, obviously, ashamed of him, but he doesn’t wipe blood from his nose when he passes the whole school with wet pants and a bleeding nose. This is new-age realism, directly leading to the “turn” and the final character, who is a victim of suicide ... <br /> <br /> After watching the “very realistic” teenage life (one day, including incest) - pure, teenage pregnancy, bulimia, parental pressure on grades and appearance, as well as the gay theme mentioned above, like your "very realistic" daily soap ... try our best to be) we are watching the girl we met at the beginning of this movie and which has no reason other than that guy n she was in love, out of the room when she was talking to him (in sequence pensive piano, by the way, had seen it somewhere before ??). And it gets even better ... before cutting her wrist in the agonizingly long scene of "Yes" and "No," she asks a guy from two urethras if he is fine, constantly smiling, and then she cuts her wrist with scissors school toilet. <br /> <br /> Now you have a movie that is a complete, mean-spirited elephant, falls through with some really sloppy story (by the way, this whole rape story was pretty incredible), and people call it the Shocker. <br /> <br /> What the hell is going on ?? Is that all you need to take some pseudo-dramatic music, a boring story and add a shocking theme from above, and people think that there is a serious deep message here ?? I think that the Elephant is already too overvalued, but this film was original, while this is an obvious plagiarism falling through on many other levels. I have never seen a more brazen theft of the whole concept of the film in my life ... and believe me, I watched a hundred horror films, so I know how low you can get there. This is a complete disappointment in all departments ... its unreal, stolen, damn slow and incomprehensible, which is even more useless ... another romantic suicide (many give this moment to a film that makes me think, they only watch Romeo + Juliet a whole day, because there are dozens of films that are devoted to this topic is clearly not romantic and MORE REALIST way) or this ridiculous statement ... Come on! I'm still trying to find out if 2-urethra or suicide is more unrealistic and confused.
