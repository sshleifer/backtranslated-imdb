Oh yeah, this one is undoubtedly a strong contender for victory in the dubious award of the "worst slasher of the 80s ever made." In "The Prey" there is everything you usually want to avoid in a horror movie: routine, a derivative plot that you saw a thousand times earlier (and better), intolerable characters and terrible notions, a complete lack of blood and uncertainty, unclear picture and unoriginal locations. and the most annoying of all ?? the greatest number of meaningless frames that you have ever met in your life (and this is not an exaggeration, but a guarantee!). In addition to the seemingly infinite number of National Geographic videos, which I will talk about later, this film is shameful enough to include a full banjo interlude (!) And two cases in which the characters tell funny jokes that are not even remotely funny! The installation is as elementary as possible with an introduction that demonstrates images of a devastating forest fire with OTT behind the scenes. Fast forward almost forty years later, when an elderly couple who set up camp in the same area will be amazed at the fact that she is breathing heavily off-screen. This should be enough for you to know that someone survived the fire all these years ago and has been wandering around since. Enter three unbearable twenty-year-old couples heading into the danger zone with exclusively sex on the mind, of course, unaware that they are sitting ducks for a haunting and gasping killer. "The Prey" is a boring film that cannot be exchanged. Apparently, this was filmed in 1978, but no one wanted to distribute it until 1984, and it is not difficult to understand why. In case you filter out all the content that is really relevant, it will only be a short film with a duration of 30 minutes; maybe even less. There are unimaginably great shots about nature and wildlife, sometimes about animals that I think do not even live in this type of terrain, and they seem to go on forever. In fact, the only thing missing is the typical National Geographic storytelling, which contains educational information about animal habits. The animals in their own natural biotope are undoubtedly a pleasure to watch, but not in the supposedly obscene and funny film of the 80s slasher, because they cry loudly. The last fifteen minutes, finally, are somewhat useful, with some powerful episodes of murder and beautiful makeup effects on the monster (which, it turns out, Lunch from the films of the Addams Family), but still nonsense cancels ?? scene with vultures too stupid ?? and the last shot is just backward laughing. As mentioned above, “The Prey” easily compiles my personal list of the worst slashers of the 80s, along with “Appointment with Fear”, “Berserker”, “Deadly Games”, “Don't Go to the Forest”, “Empty Gate”, “Awakening "And" Curfew ".
