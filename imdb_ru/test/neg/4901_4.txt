Inspired by a true story, it is filled with feelings of the 1970s, but does not tell. This is a story about a black swimmer from college who ends up in Philly in a closed recreation center in a poor area and somehow gathers a swimming team. The film staggers blindly for the first half hour until Terrence Howard, like our hero, takes the children to the pool. At this moment, he becomes more and more fascinating, although he still hesitates. There is a good story in this, and itâ€™s understandable why Howard and Bernie Mac took part in it, but the scenario is bad, and most of the direction seems to be aimed at making him feel something and not make us feel something to this story. /> <br /> It doesn't matter what some of the reviews have said, she suffers from all the recent sports stories - Coach Carter, Invincible, Glory Road, etc., who at least knew that you should at least at least work with the story to make a film, and not just let the audience suffer, because "this is true."
