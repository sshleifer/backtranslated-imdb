This film was so stupid and slow, was it slow. The only good part of the movie was a girl in narrow gold pants. There was no blood, and what kind of horror film of the 80s, without blood. In addition, the killer was neither scary nor murderers. But if you like to watch the worst horror movie in the world, then this is for you. Do not waste your time as I watched it.
