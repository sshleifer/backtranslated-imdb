Andy Milligan, an independent filmmaker from New York, directs this little “treat” as his version of the legend of Sweeney Todd. Sweeney cuts clients' throats at her hair salon, and his cohort Mrs. Lovett turns them into meat pies. Fortunately, I was well informed about the plot before I saw this film about parodies. Milligan, for my money, really has to be the leader of the worst directors of all time. Ed Wood is like Orson Welles in comparison. This film is so bad in many ways. Let's start with the Milligan. The quality of the film is granular. The sound quality is grainy. Many scenes look as if Milligan used a video camera for filming. On the credits is written: "Photographed and filmed by Andy Milligan." Does he want to take credit for ceilings appearing after the scene of death? What about the brutal musical score chosen for the film? The film is cut with one bad transition after another. A bit of logic is used when creating the plot. The story has little to do with the actual legend of Todd. Scenes of murder are numerous, but not terrible. The arms, legs, and other appendages are trimmed using the skill in which the editing was performed: changeable! And let's take the chest in the pie scene. Yes it is there. Cake maker did not know that a whole breast with nipple filled a whole cake crust? Later we hear from our characters that they “were careful not to be caught” for the 200-odd murders they committed. Obviously, they are a pair of boobs that are not able to be aware of what is happening (sorry, it was too tempting). Actors are not so bad to be honest. Some even have glimpses of talent, and all seem to be genuine English articles. Many non-erotic nude scenes are forced everywhere. Milligan seems to have problems with sex. Plots remain unbound. The end is almost imperceptible due to poor camera performance. I could go on and on. Did I like something in the movie? Not much to be truthful. I have a high level of recognition for films of this kind in terms of low budgets and extreme talent, but this film has no real goal other than being rude and sick.
