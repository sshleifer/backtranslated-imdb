I would give less than 1 rating if it were possible. The whole film was to be left on the floor of the cutting room. What a waste of time, money and effort! Let's see ... collect the most beautiful cast that you can find (which, of course, is directly proportional to the number of talents they don’t have) ... put together the most subtle plot you can dig ... and viola! Disgusting piece of garbage, on which the director and / or producer should be ashamed to put his name. How much horror can you get? And don't use “low budget” as an excuse ... I saw a lot of BIG low budget films ... in fact, some of the best classic horror films of all time were low budget. If you do not have the talent and ingenuity to make a good horror film, then for God's sake, do not do it at all !!!
