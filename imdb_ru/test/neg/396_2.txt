Kazuo Komizu, who has not made a decent film, made this “notorious” shocker, and he should be ashamed that he became a hit after his release in Japan. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are scenes of rape, blood and dismemberment, so what? He has the style of a bad American porn movie shot and is badly photographed by Ed Powers (“Dirty Debutantes”) and incredibly slow. <br /> <br /> This seems to have earned its fame based on its list of anti-social acts. <br /> <br /> There is a huge difference between this and horror, which is well thought out. <br /> <br /> The fact that someone likes their movie is a bit wet doesn't mean it will take shit like that. On the contrary, this kind of fan (for example, I) tolerates even less crap than the average player, because he has seen so much and has become too insightful. It is a pity that companies producing shame are not aware of this. <br /> <br /> One reviewer (ZombieKilla81) remarked that “almost obsession with rape in a movie” is one of the factors that killed him. I disagree. Item is never a problem. The question is how this subject is treated. In the “COVERAGE OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN” it is perceived so unimaginably that it is boring. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like the graphic images of psychopathic behavior (with an intriguing context) if the material is well directed, recently photographed, and aesthetically pleasing. This Nikkatsu horror / pink hybrid is terrible.
