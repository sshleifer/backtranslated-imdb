The film has a good storyline, the action is good in some parts, but not in all. Some parts, I just felt that the bad guys would not have refused, based on my experience in the martial arts. Some actions are long, as usual mainly for the boss, but for the least important they were killed or repulsed by several blows, but some were completely unrealistic or could do better. <br /> <br /> The least important actors or stuntmen were the right choices for the film, my girlfriend began to fall in love with them, that she started watching the film more than spending her time with me. <br /> <br /> The film is good, that's all I can say.
