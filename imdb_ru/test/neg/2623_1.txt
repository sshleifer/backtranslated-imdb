Thank God, I did not manage any heavy equipment, it could be even the worst disaster. Frames were slow and very repetitive. Different scenes, same frames, medium shot, medium shot, medium shot, snooze. The storyline was pretty empty. William Hurt was the worst. Where did he get that stupid accent? Random snapshots of scenery, just to include them, actually added little. Her car had more shots of Arbor than anything else. The direction really didn't lead us to any of the scenes, and it also did not make me feel any of the characters. I would rate it at zero if IMDb had the opportunity. An excellent sedative, if you can not sleep. It's been 2 hours of my life, I will never come back.
