This film is just rubbish. I have to say that I am an expert on trash movies. I reserve a rating of "1" for films that are rubbish, but funny, but this film is just tedious and, of course, not stupid in a funny way, but shoddy in a stupid way. He gets a “2” so that those of you can discern those who make you laugh and those who make you fall asleep. In this film, there are scenes in which the actors look at something, their facial expressions are amazing, and wide eyes and relaxed jaws tell viewers that what they are looking at will be amazing, it's just not just a cupboard or even more of a desert. It must be damn awful that I'm leaving, let me tell you that I left, and quite a lot of people did.
