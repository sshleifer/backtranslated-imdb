Compared to other sands and sandals, Egyptian leaves much to be desired. The film is very gracefully based on the well-researched novel of Micah Valtari, which tells about the adventures of the Egyptian doctor Sinhue at the court of Ahnaton, as well as his travels through Canaan, Crete Minoan and Africa. Unfortunately, due to the moral constraints of the time, much of the story of Xinghu (which is replete with romantic and sexual exploits) remains on the floor of the cutting room, and instead, the audience turns to the drums and drums of the wooden game of Victor Matri. Even Gene Tierney ?? Leading lady "main product" of time ?? can neither look nor act best in this film and gives a rather somnambulistic performance, which can only be justified by the fact that the actress had some serious psychiatric problems at the time. There is a lot of rhetoric and theological fraud about the idea of ​​monotheism against polytheism, but Michael Wilding is so tedious as revolutionary Achnaton that someone probably encourages someone from him and restore the old religion to the second drum. My advice: buy a book in E-Bay, rent something more interesting, for example, Solomon and Sheva, and then call it at night!
