Emotionless. Bad music (and I'm a reformed metal guy of the eighties, so I would be vulnerable to some good things). Brother is a parody, we have nothing to hold, except to see what horror from the eighties they will pull out the next time. The tour manager is trying to bring humanity into this business, but he does not have enough time. Wahlberg is fine, and Aniston is snoozing. We know that she does not need money. Is this the only role she could fit into her summer break? Of course, she must slap her forehead every time he appears on VH1 - which is only slightly less frequent than Ozzy. It hardly qualifies as a television movie. It's just hard to believe that he was released theatrically.
