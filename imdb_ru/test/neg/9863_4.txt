I am a chess player, and I wanted this film to be liked. The problem is that the content could be placed in a 30-minute documentary. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of shots in the corridors, and Kasparov looked into the hall, where he won the world championship. There were other shots when Kasparov walked around the venue of the 1997 match and told him where he was sitting and where Deep Blue was. It just looked like a filler. <br /> <br /> In addition, I did not find it interesting to see in detail where the Deep Blue is now and IBM technician, unsuccessfully trying to "open" it. What would we see an interest inside - a small grandmaster? <br /> <br /> In addition, a recent match with Karpov. I no longer follow professional chess to know when and where it was. It would be nice if I was told: it was a one-time "only for the money"? Was this part of the World Cup cycle? What was the final score? A piece of film was the game in the second game. Can IBM let Kasparov see "inside" the machine? That's where the focus was supposed to be.
