I was a serious collector of films related to Christmas, TV shows, festive events, etc. For more than twenty five years. Please listen to my warning and do not mislead sterling reviews and media hype about this film. This is not a Muppet film, as we know it, and, of course, NOT for children. The fact that this was done for large television networks is not surprising, given their current level of work. I find it hard to believe that Jim Hensonâ€™s organization bent so low to participate in this Christmas parody. I would like to have read reviews that would warn me before I spend my hard earned money on this piece of garbage
