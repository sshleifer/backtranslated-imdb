I probably have to blame myself - but I'm sure the hell I expected more from the movie called Black Dragons and revolves around the conspiracies of World War II, Nazi plastic surgeons and revenge. This film is a dumb failure with an incomprehensible structure. The actual plot (which is mostly quite ingenious and intriguing) becomes clear only during explication near the end, but the problem is that you have stopped caring for a long time. We see how the horror icon of Bela Lugosi penetrates into the society of prominent American politicians and kills them one by one. The story is timed right before World War II, and especially after witnessing the ending ?? this is certainly a prerequisite with great potential, so unfortunately it is not developed more correctly. However, there is one wonderful dialogue that I can not resist! A man towards a woman: "Do you want to marry me?" "What for?" "So can I beat you up?" This is the only way to leave this place! ‚ÄùThis is the only highlight in the overall very boring movie. Bela Lugosi is beautiful ?? still ?? but his creepy performance is hardly worth buying this film. If you are interested in watching his other monstrous views (in films with decent scripts), see Invisible Ghost, The Corpse Disappears, White Zombie and, of course, the 1931 version of Dracula
