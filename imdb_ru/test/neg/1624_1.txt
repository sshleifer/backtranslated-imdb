I just read a very long review on the main page of this film on this site, and he explained in detail that this film is worth watching only in the television show "Mystery Science Theater 3000 !!!!! And yes, I find this advice really useful! I mean, the film that tries to be so good, and this exciting one, is actually not at all what this film wants to be !!!!! So yes, watch this movie as shown in this show, and instead of giving this movie one star out of ten stars, you can give it ten out of ten stars! Until then, my one star review is only for the real, clean, untouched version of this film !!!!!! Got it now?
