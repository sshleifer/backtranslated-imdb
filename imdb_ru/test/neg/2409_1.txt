If you tried to make a bad movie, you could not make one worse than this. I can not imagine that someone would pay good money to see such garbage in the theater. What really turns you on is hypnotized when you look at it all just being amazed to see how disgusting it can be. The redemptive facet of this film was the words “The End”
