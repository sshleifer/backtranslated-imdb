I do not know what was worse: the audience made jokes or stars in this film that look like dope. Do I have to believe that this woman raised this child for seven years and never noticed that the child was a little dark? Should I believe that her mother, her father, and her husband never once said: hmmm, this child looks a little dark? Do I have to believe when the courts obliged the mother to look through the records of adoptive parents that Lisa Hartman had such an amazing expression on her face when she told her mother that Christopher is half black! What kind ! Was it really, well, the case, you think so. So grandmother and grandfather not only looked stupid and stupid, never mentioning it, but I think we should have looked surprised and said ... hmmmmm, it's half black! Absolutely stupid film, almost embarrassment, even watch it!
