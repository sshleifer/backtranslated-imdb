So my friend and I are having sex at our local movie rental and are looking for something to go along with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, so why not take the third release in the Effigy Series! Keep in mind that this is not just the Scarecrow Three; this, Scarecrow: Gone Wild. Now we both looked at the first two Scarecrows, so we felt obliged to finish the work. Let's start with the DVD cover first. First we see on the cover a photograph of Ken Shamrock (“The most dangerous man in the world”). Obviously, he was used to advertise the film as a "leading actor." By the way, he has the smallest screen time of all members of the enrolled class. Then we see a photo of a very attractive and very poorly dressed woman in the middle part of the cover. I can assure you that she's not in the film .... at all. During the rental, we assumed that this was to confirm the fact that the scarecrow "went crazy." In the background we noticed a big carnival on an island in the ocean. I can also assure you that the carnival is also not in the film ... in general. Looking back, my friend and I should have known that something had happened. I mean really, who the hell is having a carnival on the island. We now turn to the film itself. We begin when a young man inexplicably merges with a stuffed animal in the middle of a corn field. Do not ask me how they merged, but think about it when Brandon Lee wakes up from the dead in Crow. This is just stupid. But in defense of the stuffed animal, he "went crazy." Anyhoo, the scarecrow, who now lives under the care of a young man, goes on a journey to his local beach to brutally crack down on those who have done him wrong. Because yes, in the world of Scarecrow, beaches are conveniently located in the same common neighborhood as corn fields. In short, the scarecrow kills anyone who stands in its way, without any warning, except for the brand's whistle, stuffed, which signals a reduction. However, this is quite difficult to believe, because the mouth of the stuffed animal is clearly sewn up. Several follow-up shots that would make Kubrick roll over in his grave later, and we have one of the worst third episodes in the series. Well, except that the third Matrix. As Joel Siegel would say: "This Effigy is wildly bad."
