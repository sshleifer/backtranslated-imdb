I do not despair of seeking "redemption of social value." Any book or film that people want to put down, from Huck Finn / Heart of Darkness, I don’t know, Deep Throat or the last beheading of hostages, I sincerely wish they didn’t. I am not a fan of pornography or violence-like-entertainment, but which one I accidentally stumble upon I am inclined to see angles, cuts, pots, lighting, rhythms, almost to the exclusion of fear or tickling, sometimes even lacking the intentions of filmmakers or actors. Even from the material that reasonable people can say has never existed, I always think there is something to learn. Interestingly more about how the film does, than about what it does. Maybe this is wrong with me. Wiser, but harder than deconstructing an unpleasant cinema, you can see cuts, pans, etc. In one and inseparable, no matter what the content. I ask myself what is common between horror filmmakers and church architects. Add to political filmmakers, not fascists. All manipulate light, space and sound to change perception and mood. How different are their goals? How different are the goals of those who shoot real atrocities for use as propaganda? <br /> <br /> When the original All Night Long (ANL) trilogy appeared on my shelf, I left it unattended for almost a year. Curiosity made me buy it. I tried a few “1” minutes on that day, when he arrived, right up to an awkward sonorous blow to a street corner, which, it seems, is really attacking the susceptibility of the film’s audience, found it inept but effective. I should have come back to this, of course, but did not enjoy the prospect. It is clear that this was not the great horror of Cairo, Kyura, Angela Dousta, Lane, the coarser, but still traditionally framed horror of the first Sinister Dead Trap, the openly political work of Koji Wakamatsu or even the brilliant rudeness of early Cronenberg. br /> <br /> Maybe this word "attack" is the key. Matsumura attacks not his characters, but his viewers. I cannot watch them at this stage of the story, not thinking about Abu Gharib (some of which, I think, I remember, was seen in the video), nor about the video with hostages, but also about Godard's tormentors (in Le Petit soldat?), against which atrocities are committed is just a job, part of a person's work day. And there is also a lingering news story about Northern California, the details of which I hardly remember, but I can’t completely forget, because it also entails a “movie”, a serial killer duo, notorious if not an offer to play games with my memory, because they were videotaping themselves torture victims. <br /> <br /> All three ANL recordings are a movie of revenge, a watchfulness teaching, but I’m attaching these notes to ANL3 because this is the most ambitious project that could be a turning point for director Matsumura. (I did not see the records that followed ANL3.) From the first two sentences, I presented a camera that fell into the hands of one of those extreme children from high school or gymnasium who obsessively draw scenes of war or other atrocities. (Or, as if one of Matsumura’s insane characters turned into screenwriter director. Anyone who watches these who haven’t seen Michael Peeking Tom Peering would have seen it well.) The protagonist Matsumura grows carnivorous plants, which allows you to make typical Japanese cool shots at close range. In addition, for the first time in the film "Matsumura" there appears a traditional erotic sequence: the female boss Kikuo sneaks up and starts to caress him while he is spying on the clients of the hotel of love. Kiko finds himself unhappily sandwiched between them. He is a voyeur intermediary. Brief sensations come from layers of voyeurism. There is even a philosophical / poetic garbage man, a trash voyeur who somehow makes me think of a poem repeated in Wakamatsu, “not at all what it sounds like,” go, go, secondary virgin. <br /> <br /> With this, I get nothing, and this prevents me from commenting on other films. I can not avoid the suspicion that in a few years I will go to a retrospective of Matsumura in my local film archive, perhaps visiting some scientific character who caught what I lack. <br /> <br /> How much does it matter, is the director or just “gets” his deadly tangled main characters? Does he even have to understand them? Perhaps the director’s job is simply to spew it out and then let the critics, the sociologists, and the rest of us figure it out. Perhaps directing or artistic responsibility is a fake notion. <br /> <br /> My last struggle with this thing made me think about what the hell a woman thinks while watching these mostly male exercises. We make women go through it again and again, from Star Wars, and so on and so forth, and so on and so forth, but is there something as distorted to men as All Night Longs?
