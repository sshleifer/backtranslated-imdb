This film was completely stale and boring. The main premise of this film was mainly a group of stereotypical black people who sat around the barbershop and exchanged a painfully unfriendly repeater. I did not laugh once for the whole movie. I could sit in any hairdressing salon in America and hear this banal banter, and perhaps even get a haircut. I can not understand why this mess has received any positive feedback, and even more so why so many people spent money on it. None of the characters here were funny or worthy of attention. I really didnâ€™t care if a rival barbershop across the street could lead to Nappy Cutz going bankrupt. Do not waste your money on this guys, as this is the only way to make Hollywood stop scattering these junk pieces. 1 * of 5
