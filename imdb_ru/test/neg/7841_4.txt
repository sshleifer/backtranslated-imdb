Though predictable and far-fetched, the film is not bad. It is entertaining that is all that Van Damme hopes to do. The ubiquitous "dual" device is again used (as in a large number of Van Damme films), but this does not bother, except for long-time fans. Natasha is gorgeous and worth seeing. The action is decent, nothing spectacular for Van Damme, but exciting. I can recommend Van Damme fans and even those who don’t mind, but don’t mind, an action movie with a good looking lead pair. Russian Mob is a good concept, relevant for the whole day. Clearly this is not his best film, but by no means his worst.
