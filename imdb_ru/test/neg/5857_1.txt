I saw this movie last night, a satire from reality-style programs that seem to be making detours at the moment. <br /> <br /> What can I say. I absolutely hated it. It’s about as interesting as looking at how the paint dries up, and maybe with one or two just a little funny moments. <br /> <br /> Maybe it’s somehow related to me, I’m definitely not a fan of “Survivor” and “Big Brother” shows, but if it was video / DVD, or if I watched it myself I definitely could not stand more than the first 5 minutes. <br /> <br />
