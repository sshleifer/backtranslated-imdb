Very disturbing, but skillfully crafted and scripted and wisely directed with a good look at the color and details of Mary Beth Hurt, Sandy Dennis and especially Randy Quaid are unusually good. The story tells of a young boy (Brian Madorsky) who wonders where all the leftovers they eat every night came from. The strange behavior of his parents (Hurt, Quaid) makes the school psychiatrist (Denis) interfere. This is a horrible cannibal film. But this is not bad. If you like Hannibal, you'll like it. If you don't like parents, stay away from the movie. Just giving advice to the Man-Eaters and Haters. <br /> <br /> Rated R for strong themes for adults and graphic violence.
