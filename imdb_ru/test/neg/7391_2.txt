Perhaps this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Can someone explain this plot to me? Yes, I know that the bus ran out of gas in the middle of the desert, after the driver never noticed that his compass was not working, but what then? And how did it end? Maybe I stupidly understand this film, but for me it was an absolute waste of time. <br /> <br /> My recommendation? Do not worry, there are much better films that can be seen. This film is on a par with my low and low time ("Overboard" - Adam Sandler and "Fire on Amazon" - Sandra Bullock)
