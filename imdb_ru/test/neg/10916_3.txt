1983 was a good year for Stephen King’s books on the big screen. Christina, the Dead Zone and Kuj were released within a few months of each other. While the “Dead Zone” was easily chosen from the group, Christina and Kuj were both pretty bad, and the fact is, which one is smaller. If I were to insist on a response, I would say that Cujo - slightly - the weakest. <br /> <br /> Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace, who was just born because of her success as Elliot’s mom in “Extraterrestrial Civilization”) - mother, marriage with husband Vik (Daniel Hugh-Kelly) hangs in a thread. She had an affair with a local worker, and now she is thinking about whether to leave her husband or not. Young Thad Trenton (Danny Pintauro), son of Donna and Vick, and a rather spoiled child with a chronic phobia of darkness, which often leads to serious panic attacks, are drawn into family heartache. Donna and Ted drive the family car to the repair area nearby, but when they arrive, their car falls apart. The situation gets much worse when they discover that the mechanic, Joe Cumber (Ed Lauter), is not there (he was brutally murdered by his beloved dog Cujo, a giant Saint Bernard who was recently bitten and infected by a mad bat.) car and trying everything to get into the car to separate these two unfortunate victims. The weather is stuffy hot; no living soul knows that they are there; the car will not start; and the dog seriously wants their blood ...... <br /> <br /> Kujo can become a really tight siege thriller, but he never turns on. I read the book, and it is disappointing - of course, for King - it is therefore not surprising that the version of the film is so small. On the printed page, King, at least, was able to create a certain degree of tension, but the fact that St. Bernard is simply not very scary is hindering the film. The “visibility” of the film environment serves as a constant reminder that Cujo is a St. Bernard. In the book, this could be forgotten. In the book, Kujё sometimes seemed to assume the appearance of a monster. Even with a relatively short duration of one and a half hours, Kuj становится becomes a tiresome and straining experience, sometimes unintentionally ridiculous and, of course, never as tense as we would like. They even missed the ruthless ending of the book and replaced it with the conclusion “all is well that ends well” so that the audience can go home in a cheerful mood !!! Call it another lower adaptation of the King.
