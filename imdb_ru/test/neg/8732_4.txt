Roca Hudson’s second venture into the science fiction genre after “Seconds” is the film Embryo, in which elements of “The Bride of Frankenstein and Pygmalion” are combined in one rather strange film that, due to the lack of a better word, the test tube baby will grow into Barbara Carrera. br /> <br /> Hudson is a scientist experimenting in the field of organic development, and gets a chance to experiment for the first time on his own Doberman, when he accidentally fell under his car. <br /> <br /> Some secretion of the pituitary from the female is given to a premature puppy, and it grows noticeably into an adult. Exalted by his success, Hudson takes the fruit from the dead victim of the accident and gives him the same thing. <br /> <br /> What he gets is Barbara Carrera. And it develops physically and intellectually with incredible speed. What she doesn't do is develop emotionally. However, Hudson gave her as his new researcher to friends and family, such as daughter-in-law Diana Ladd, son John Elerik and daughter-in-law Anne Shedeen. <br /> <br /> Embryo does not explore some real problems in this kind of science; instead, he uses them. The special effects, as they are, are quite second. It seems that Hudson lost interest in the project about halfway through the film. <br /> <br /> Now it would be really interesting if he got a boy, and he grew up to become the hero of the Harlequin novel. Now this would be what Rock Hudson could sink his teeth into.
