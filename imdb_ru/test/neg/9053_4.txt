“Eaten Alive” is a small film that opens in New York and the Arctic, where men from the tribe shoot snake venom for several people, then the woman goes to the police station, who is trying to find her sister, who disappeared after 6 months, Sheila from Alabama, but her accent sucks, she teamed up with an adventurer who seems to just want her money and seems to be talking a lot about this throughout the film. They risk through the Amazon just to find a community with people, and they find a sister, they are "in the face of a madman who has probably seen too many Jim Jones sermons. He will lead them to a better place, it may be paradise, but no, later Mark and Sheila will find out that this is really a cult of suicide. <br /> <Why do I call Eaten Alive a “little movie?” I tell you, but when I watched it, I was filled with all the cannibals, Robert Kerman plays a different role his professor in the Holocaust Man-Eater. He is a bit annoying when we are We play him at an armwrestling match that looked like Russian roulette, we know that he is one tough guy. Plus, strong misogyny just makes you cringe, and it looked like I saw it somewhere, about animal killing scenes about friend. images of nature with parts of the film But after watching this movie, I realized that most of the movie scenes are taken from other cannibalism films, even the death of two characters, well .. most of the movie is. That's why I call it a small movie, when I found out that the scenes were borrowed, I wanted to throw a disk across the room, this is not a movie, but just a kind of montage.
