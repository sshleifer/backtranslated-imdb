It is a shame when high quality actors and actresses are addicted to sheer nonsense, probably because they were offered a lot of money. Not one of the best career moves by Helen Mirren. The game of "teenagers" is just awful, it does not help the script, which in parts is simply inept. <br /> <br /> Much of Kevin Williamson’s work is above average box office, but it’s really below par. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you watch on TV, when there is nothing better when you drink half a bottle of wine and wait for the pizza to be delivered so that you can drink the other half.
