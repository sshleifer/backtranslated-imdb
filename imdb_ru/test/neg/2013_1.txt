Imagine the worst that human intelligence could ever conceive. Now imagine something infinitely darker - I mean, worse than that. Then multiply this by the amount of fun the Star Wars Special has. This film is much worse than that. <br /> <br /> “Dracula 3000: Endless Darkness”, which featured such prominent and reputable actors as Culio and Langley Kirkwood (as the film’s “terrifying antagonist, Earl Orlock), can only eat its excrement during his life, compressed in about one hour and twenty minutes. Honestly, there is no way to approach the review of this cinematic tragedy - permeated by communist propaganda, propaganda of drug use, futuristic anachronisms, and perhaps the worst special effects since the (original) War of the Worlds. br /> <br /> The hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union can be seen with pride, showing them in the dirty sets that they dare to call a spaceship. Lenin can be seen on several posters throughout the "film". And, of course, by that time religion had been abolished for two centuries. Therefore, they do not know who this “God” is, although they have no doubt that he uses His name in vain. But, of course, in the cosmic Socialist Republic (chaired by interstellar President Baker), deadly drugs like drugs are legalized and fairly common. However, the mobility of people with disabilities seems even worse than today (they don't even have a wheelchair ramp). <br /> <br /> Racial tension still manifests itself across the galaxy in a rather familiar / predictable way. We get wonderful comments on ethnic division through lines like “Is Dracula a brother?”, “We, brothers, need to stick together” and “As soon as you become black, you will not come back.” Speaking about the symbols of black tokens, one plays Culio. Playing in the stereotypical guise, Kulio becomes, perhaps, the most annoying and ridiculous vampire in history. Oh wait, SECOND is the funniest vampire ever. This valuable title goes to our friend COUNT ORLOCK from PLANET TRANSYLVANIA in the CARPATHIAN SYSTEM. These two are quite a strong pair: between Kulio’s attempts to harm paraplegia, strange attempts to emit high sounds of animals, the hair of 1004 years and the GIANT segment of a completely useless dialogue; and twenty-dollar versatile Halloween-style vampire costume for twenty dollars, exploding coffins or a crazy story. <br /> <br /> I wonder if they didn’t just give Kulio a chance to climb a kite? without gravity ”, let it interact with other“ actors ”and just leave it. <br /> <br /> The motivation of Count Orlok is also in doubt. Does he want "infinite darkness", how would you believe the subtitle of the film? Does he want to eat the team? Or does he want Kulio to "kill them all"? Or does he want to give people with disabilities a chance in such a bad future? It really does not matter, because none of the plots of this film in any case does not make sense. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film should be its end. More for the fact that this means that the film is finished than any merit of the sudden train crash of the climax they call before the credits. Instead of fighting with Count Orlok in some duel (the closest we get a shot of Orlok, flying at a furious speed in front of our main character, who soon dies), our heroes beat him, cutting off his hand in the usual door. Then Orlok collapses, screaming in pain at a completely ordinary, but completely painful injury. This is by far the most fun of this movie. Watching the distorted face of a vampire, while he cries in pain, you will find yourself on the edge of your seat with laughter. Almost worth four dollars for it alone. Of course, right after this, we turn to one of the worst one-liners of the film, to the obligatory allusion to sex and, possibly, to the WRONG apologies for the end * EVER *. They fly in the sun, and their ship will literally explode before they even approach the strike. I think they just outdid the Wachowski brothers. in the worst final. <br /> <br /> I can only sleep at night because we know that continuation is impossible. Safe in this fact, we can safely say that this is the worst film ever made and which will never be surpassed in low quality, low budget and the lowest acting talent.
