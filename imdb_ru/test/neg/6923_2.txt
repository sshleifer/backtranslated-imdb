Writer / director Brian Burns has obviously seen several romantic comedies, and he seems to think that he has found a formula for success: a lot of personnel filming in New York (preferably in winter), hints at old Hollywood films (especially musicals), pleasant musical soundtrack Alas, all this is just compensation for Burns’s lack of talent as a writer. (For many authors directing independent films, the mystery is not why they can't get along with large film studios, but how they get support for their films in general.) <br /> <br /> Usually The interest in the romantic comedy is motivated by the leading characters, but the couple in this film simply have no appeal. This is not the fault of David Krumholz or Milla Jovavic; their characters are simply poorly written. What we react to in such classics as “When Harry Met Sally” or “Annie Hall”, or in older films such as “Friday,” are the quirks and weaknesses of the characters in the main characters. Not having the ability to create individuals, Burns gives us after school a special program inspired by "Men from Mars", "Women from Venus." <br /> <br /> Someone might see Burns as the successor to Woody Allen, outside of me. I never laughed once during this film, and the script is full of echo-chamber dialogue (“I want to paint the city red.” “Do you want to paint the city red?”), Which is the most revealing sign of someone who does not have business letter for life. In one of the earlier scenes, we see the girlfriend of actress Krumholtz filming a pointless television comedy series. This is the only moment in the whole film when the dialogue seems to be right; perhaps this indicates what Burns talents really are suitable for.
