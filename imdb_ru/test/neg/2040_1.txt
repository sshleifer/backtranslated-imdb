The artist in Rome is obsessed ... or something like that. She dreams of being nailed to the cross, and Satan himself rapes her. He owns her (I think) and turns her into a sexual addict. That's all I could take, and I turned it off. <br /> <br /> The senseless "exorcist" breaks. I caught it on the cable back in the 80s and was terrified ... and not in a good way! This film should be a horror film, but it turns into nothing more than a sex film disguised as a horror film. There are tons of senseless female nudity, and the actress who plays the main role should humiliate herself more than once. We see Satan raping her (an attractive guy), masturbating, approaching his father ... I must give her points for courage. Add to this the bad rewriting, editing (the rape scene looks like it was cut a bit), a lousy game and a story that does not make sense. One disturbing sequence (it is nailed to the cross) ALMOST works, but lousy “special effects” destroy it. This is one of the few horror films that was so bad that I stopped watching. Skip this.
