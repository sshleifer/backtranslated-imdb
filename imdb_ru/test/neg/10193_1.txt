This film was supposed to come with a disclaimer that it looked like the Left Behind series. I did not know that it would be a biblical film. I expected it to be a really UFO film and alien abduction for fun. As the previous reviewer comments, it would be nice to show in the church, but not in the public theater, at least without prior knowledge of the consumer about what the filmâ€™s premise is. I felt deceived because I spent $$ on this film, since the summary says nothing about its religious tones. If you go to church, it will probably be shown there for free for a while. In addition to hiding his true subject, the film was good, as far as the script worked. But I have to say that I left the film an hour later, when I saw the direction in which he was moving, and that they would not entertain me, but preach.
