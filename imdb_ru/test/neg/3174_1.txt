This movie is terribly bad. You can say that all the actors are embarrassed to be involved with such a really terrible movie. There are obvious budgetary constraints, but with a little attention and attention to detail, the film could be much better. For example: look at the scene where Mickey first goes to the morgue and talks to his friend, a pathologist, and the dead taxi driver lies on the stove. You can really see the breath of a corpse! What, they could not afford to hire a half decent surcharge that could hold their breath for a two-minute scene ?!
