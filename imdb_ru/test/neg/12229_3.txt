A comedy that fakes inspirational sports films, Returns tells the story of an unlucky coach Lambeau Fields, who takes a bunch of losers from college and leads them to the football championship. In the process, this life-long loser discovers that he is, after all, a winner, redeeming himself, keeping his relationship with his family and friends, and finding that there really isn’t "I" in the "team"! <br /> <br /> I decided to watch a version of this movie without stars. It was thirty minutes longer, and I think it could be better than a theatrical release, having heard that people hate this film. In the end, thirty minutes of extra shots can add a lot to the film. Well, I certainly was wrong. It was as bad as the recent “Meet the Spartans,” but it was another thirty minutes of torture! <br /> <br /> Seriously, who makes a fake movie at almost two o'clock ?! A fake movie is short because if it lasts longer, it will be superfluous! Honestly, I like stupid comedies. Gosh, I liked Date Movie, White Chicks, Epic Movie and Little Man! I guess that when it comes to fake movies, this is either a hit or a miss, and this one is definitely missing. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, out of the many jokes in this film, I will say six or seven. made me laugh, even some that made me laugh out loud. But this does not mean much. After these jokes there were more scenes of torture and injustice. <br /> <br /> I don’t understand how people will say that this is not a horrible film about deception. In fact, there are as many products as Meet the Spartans, as many dance episodes and funny jokes. I will say one more thing that I like about this movie is songs. There are some very good songs here. In general, see if you like movies with juggling. Skip this if you like funny movies.
