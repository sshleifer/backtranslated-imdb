in this swamp of mediocrity? You are SO much better than this. <br /> <br /> Simply put, Frostbite does not cost anything. Bad behavior (and I use this term fluently), minimalist “plot”, soft humor and dim snowboarding. There is not even a sufficient manifestation of female fragility to ignite the dangerous interest of socially inept but red-skinned men. <br /> <br /> Top Gun had exciting flight sequences that were amazing. Thunder days were heartbreaking races. Even in Point Break, one could watch skydiving. Frostbite has none of this. This is not worth your time, my time, the time of Lords of Tracy, the time of Carmen Nicole, nor the time of anyone associated with this destruction of celluloid, which would be ideally suited for something worthwhile if it were not spent on this feed for recycling center. <br /> <br /> The world will be better when we forget that frostbite ever existed.
