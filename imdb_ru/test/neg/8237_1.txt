This movie smells. No money, no game, no nothing. I caught it on a late show at 3 am and felt obliged to comment on it. This film has nothing to recommend it. I can not believe that it was ever released on American television! No one in this movie can get out of a paper bag. Unsuccessful attempts at comedy fail, their special effects consist of a worm-like “monster” that looks like a worm ... I can't even tell you how bottomless this production is. It looks like it cost maybe $ 50,000 to shoot, but only because it is 16 mm, and this is probably a generous estimate! In any case, I quickly lost interest and had to agree to watch Matlock's replays instead of ending it. That's how BAD this movie is !!!
