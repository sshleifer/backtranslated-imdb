In the 3rd edition of “Behind the Back,” the creators did not care to put ANY CONTINUITY into the plot. Although all the weapons on the planet were confiscated by the United Nations, the Third World War suddenly begins with a flick of the finger. After a few seconds, the former lover of one of the main characters goes from passionate seduction to outright hatred for a sad declaration of love without a trace of leadership. <br /> <br /> But above all, this film is really a zone without irony. After the president of the United States accepted Jesus as his savior, he immediately became a suicide bomber and blew up a skyscraper in the city center. Osama bin Laden will be very jealous when he sees this movie!
