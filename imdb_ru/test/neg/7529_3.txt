... but I would have lied. The relative was a member of the film crew, and we had to watch the production of this film for several days (and I was optional). I will die and I have a second screen time, not that I plan to move to Hollywood soon. I just thought it was great to see how films are made and to be a part of it. Plus, I received a copy of the film as soon as it was finally released. They did not have studio support for making this film, so he was truly independent. Why the script and acting is so terrible, I don’t understand, but the main character of Cherry is the director’s sister, so this may be part of it. But the cinema was good. :)
