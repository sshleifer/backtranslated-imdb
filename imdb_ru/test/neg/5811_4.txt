I fully agree with the previous reviewer. There is no chemistry between Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr, and the film focuses on their relationship. Hedy Lamarr is not at his best, and Spencer Tracy seems naive, simple, and overly optimistic â€” in love and in life; the idealistic role that best played in the City of the Boys. If you can get through the ridiculous crowd scene at the station ... wow ... this is more like a farce and unworthy of any actor in the cast. Not the best acting game. Error and inconsistency. The story is empty and the various and powerless contributions are obvious. Hedy Lamarr is awesome in itself, and this is really the best part of the movie. Spencer Tracy cannot compare with the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe, and the film does not look so believable, at least for this reason.
