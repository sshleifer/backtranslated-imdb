I really didn’t know what to expect from Future-Kill, but I certainly hoped that it would be a little better than what I received. I knew that the rating was bad, and the reviews were unfavorable, but the illustration on the cover of the Subversive DVD does not look just awesome, and I can't help it. For a very long (in fact, too long) time, this film created the impression of the unofficial continuation of the Porky film with rude, vulgar and offensive fraternity tricks. Five mega-assholes, one of whom resembles exactly the young clone Jim Carrey, desperately want to become members of the fraternal house, but their final dedication can be a bit contrived and dangerous. They are thrown into the city center with provocative marks on their faces simultaneously with the beginning of a brutal gang war. It does not take long before they run into Splatter, apparently half human and half automatic, who heads the gang, from which I did not understand who or what they were. Were they a government experiment? Cyborgs? Terminator role model from the distant future? Does anyone care? “Future Murder” is a strange amateur film with a script that moves from one subject to another without any logical connection or narration. The plot borrows vital elements from great cinematographic cult classic works such as Warriors, Escape from New York and Terminator, but the end result is one giant science fiction monster. The costumes and special effects are pretty pitiable, and there is a bunch of cheap and gratuitous nudity. The game is terrible, but I am ready to blame the delayed dialogue instead of the actors. One, to avoid at all costs, despite the really cool DVD cover. Resist this!
