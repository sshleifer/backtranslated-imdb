Pete Meteor. I saw it called "authentic" and "gemstone." I caught this movie on a Saturday afternoon. I wish I hadn't done that. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this was noted as the first dramatic role played by Mike Myers. Unfortunately this was supposed to be this movie. The first thing that you will notice of what Meteor Pete suffers from is the complete lack of plot. Or rather, a bunch of little stories that are not really connected and never go anywhere. The young orphan Mickey lives with her younger brother and sister with her grandmother. The meteorite lands in their garden and is ultimately assembled by a scientist named Hugh. Despite the title of the film, Mickey is one who claims to be a meteor, and the “storyline” actually has little to do with a meteor in any form or form. From this point on, several other characters and plots are presented. But, as I said, in fact, they are not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Everything goes from a cute family movie to a dark thriller pretty quickly when Pete (Mike Myers) appears and starts playing the role. Mickey blames him for the death of his parents, although we were never told what had happened and why. Hugh has problems with romance, because his girlfriend can't overcome his cosmic passion. And Pete's drug-related past begins to catch up with him and temporarily draws his own girlfriend and the rest of the actors into the mix when the dark characters start trying to kill him. It would seem that this is the main story, until you realize that he doesn’t even have a role until the middle of the film, and everything else seems to be a meaningless filler. Problems with the girl Hugh, Mickey's bad behavior, meteor ... what on EARTH do they have to do with this? Little. <br /> <br /> Thus, the “conspiracy” is incoherent, and half of it is meaningless. But a good character set can save him, right? Keyword: good. Most characters are terribly unpleasant people, most of whom you would like to see terribly dying. At least I know I will. Despite the title, Mickey seems to be the main character, and this is a really bad move when you see him in action. He is one of the worst little kids I have seen in the film, with an extremely bad relationship problem. He “borrows” the car, insults and tells Hugh (an adult) the garbage for taking a meteor, is actually trying to burn this man’s house when he fails, and even tries to hit Pete with a knife. You might think that such a child is on the way to jail. Unfortunately, one of the worst things about this film is that Mickey never realizes what comes to him. I'm not sure at what point you should sympathize with his character, because he is always a nasty little lad. He is a leader for his brother and sister, so they, as one would expect, will end up in the backseat and just follow what he does. Surprisingly, they are so moved away that I can't even remember their names. They might not even be there. <br /> <br /> Their grandmother is pretty much a borderline alcoholic. She is prone to Hugh as disgusted as Mickey, and she likes to push people out of her house and give them angry glances when she does not drink bottles of alcohol and does not drink herself silly. Pretty funny if you consider that she must take care of three children. Her problems with alcohol are never solved, although she occasionally collapses in the film. <br /> <br /> Hugh is one of the few cute characters in the film, but this is only because he is a punching bag for most of the characters and takes his own mess without giving it back. Children are disgusted with him, but he always comes back and tries to teach them and do good things with them. He has a taxi driver who seems to take every aspect of his life as a scientist as a personal insult, trying to leave him several times in the film when he goes into his space jargon or does something to prove that he’s not exactly at the same wavelength as the other characters (fortunately). <br /> <br /> Then, like Mike Myers as Pete. Pete, despite the fact that he has the only solid goal and plot in the film, is extremely undervalued and does not play any role until the second half. Unfortunately, Myers is stuck in this position for a dramatic role. Even when Pete gets screen time, half of them are just Myers running in dark alleys and hiding in small corners. And although he was the only real meaning of this film, when his storyline brings the film to a close, this is a strange, impracticable conclusion that makes all the characters laugh on a good note with a quick and strange explanation called This film makes you wonder if they were in the movie you just watched. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth seeing in Pete's meteor is the role of Mike Myers in the role of Pete, and that is if you can get through this disjointed mess for a long time without attacking another person because of extremely unattractive characters and non-existent storyline. No, sir, I did not like it at all.
