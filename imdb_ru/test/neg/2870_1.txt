I kind of like Bam Margera, so I was curious. <br /> <br /> But watching a home shot with someone who has friends and family, with a decent camera and a great guy is just not good. <br /> <br /> Writing, directing, acting and editing is terrible at best. But I stayed half that. And why? <br /> <br /> This film provides excellent examples of what not to do; it’s a student’s dream of what to avoid at every stage of the process. Shove this into the film school curriculum plans for the entire joint! <br /> <br /> So thank you, Bam! Now I know that Jakass is real - because you don't want to win an Oscar, dude :)
