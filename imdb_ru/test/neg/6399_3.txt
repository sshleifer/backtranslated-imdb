I just finished watching this movie and basically found it a waste of time with little or no redemption factors. I really do not understand where all the positive reviews came from - the animation is clumsy and undetectable, the plot does not make sense at all from an objective point of view, and there is no sense of intrigue or expectation in what it is trying to convey. by itself as an intriguing and intense film. I have never read this book, so I cannot say whether the film was true, but, like in most adaptations to the film, he tries too hard to gather as much information as possible in the shortest possible time. The result is an incoherent and illogical storyline, which in fact does not allow you to understand or relate to the characters or anything at all. Overall, I felt completely cut off from the characters and the plot to such an extent that I couldnâ€™t bring myself to take care of what happened to them, and the only way to understand how this animation can be considered beautiful is if your normal animation standard is This is a cartoon Scooby Doo.
