The concept of this film was pretty good. But somehow the performance failed in many parts. I can't remember horror movies that use dolls that look so realistic. Especially when these dolls start blinking their eyes or moving their hands. So much could be done with this premise. There were many scenes where there was a place for tension and suspense. And I really expected that terrible things would happen. But the film could not be scary. One of the main reasons is that the story is too minimal and predictable. I really thought they did it on purpose, to surprise us with some wonderful twist. Unfortunately, this is not happening. Well, at least not in the way I hoped. The cast also failed to make all this believable. It would be nice if the characters got more background. In the beginning, when we get acquainted with the main character. It seems that she and the other characters are invited by some kind of artist. But it is also obvious that they themselves do not represent why they are invited. Of course, this is part of the puzzle. But it seems incredible. If I had received an invitation without having a clue what the deal was, I would simply not go. Moreover, most characters do not really like the end result, which you never need. Another disadvantage is that the director deviates from the basic premise, which is quite frightening and causes new elements that are never explained and even have no relation to The Mystery of the Puppet Master. Overall, this film was a big disappointment to me. If you want to watch a good horror movie with dolls, see Dead Silence!
