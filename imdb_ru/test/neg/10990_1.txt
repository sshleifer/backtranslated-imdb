I had a different experience with this film - it was never charming, delightful or funny to me. One big clue that this was not your typical movie was that the label did not give instructions on the language spoken in the movie. the other was the lack of a choice of subtitles. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed by the lack of dialogue, especially when it was accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions, as was almost always the case. The wildly inconsistent development of a weak conspiracy was mysterious. Were there characters or only vague gestures? was there any conspiracy? <br /> <br /> on a separate issue, I am offered to correct the spelling of the word “dialogue”, suggesting the replacement of the word “dialogue”. maybe this movie completely, including part of IMDb, is intended to puzzle or surprise, but I get rather annoyed than surprised.
