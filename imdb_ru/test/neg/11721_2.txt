Aah, nothing like a stupid, exploitative, semi-matt, disguised as horror ... This is one of the stars of Jacqueline Lovell (sometimes Sarah St. James), a star-star, also seen in Femalien, Erotic House of Wax, and family favorite "Nude Bowling Party". She is now armature in the surrender of the cinema queue of untalented cuties starring in mindless, soft porn exploitation of flicks. The "head of the family" is really trying to be a real movie. The crook and the tramp are trying to deceive the tramper's husband. They turn to the big brain of an evil genius in a wheelchair and his family are crazy losers who use mind control to send zombies to execute his vile orders. This genius has a gigantic head, hence the clever name of the film: this is about the degree of humor of the film. But basically this is an excuse to boast the broad talents of Lovell and Diane Colazzo (Ernestina). Complicated in some of the strangest conversations can be a herd (what the hell is "plowing oats", anyway ??), and just silly, this title thriller will attract sympathy for lovers of stunning activity in Drive-In Theater, but no one more. MooCow says avoid being deprived, unless you are looking for a rent for a fun T & A / horror night. : = 8P
