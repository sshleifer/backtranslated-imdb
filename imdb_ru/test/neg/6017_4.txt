Christopher Guest is a modeling wizard. Werner Herzog is one of many outstanding documentaries. Zack Penn is not very good at this, but he certainly could have learned a lesson from the other two. Guest often plays with reality and fiction, but the line between them is always clear in his films, something important with support. Penn could also learn a lesson from the Blair Witch Project. Even though you knew that it was a fake documentary, a part of you that was completely bought into the world, created by the creators of the film. It seems to the audience that this is all real, although deep down inside you are watching science fiction. In other words, it was an invention, successfully disguised as truth. In fact, many early viewers watched it, in Sundance and other premieres they thought it was real. Penn, whose strength, by his own admission, is the script, must adhere to this. Making a documentary or a cinema film (and it's hard to say where one begins and the other ends with this film) is obviously not. <br /> <br /> Penn sets the stage for what he is trying to sell, as a legitimate documentary about the filming of a documentary film, a kind of meta-documentary film. Penn, however, confuses the audience and loses their trust from the very beginning when he enters the Duke’s house before shooting the Duke’s Loch Ness Mystery about the Loch Ness Monster Myth (a film that obviously never ended probably due to Penn's intervention). Despite the fact that Penn is obviously the director of the film we are watching, he starts by looking at the cameras and saying, “What is the film crew doing here?” And starts to evade them. He does it a couple more times. He will stop and tell the cameras to stop filming, thereby forcing the operator to hide in the shade to pick up fragments of the dialogue between Herzog and Penn. This seems like a ploy, but it never clears up, and Penn obviously deliberately keeps us in the dark. This makes the viewers scratch their heads, wondering: “Who is in charge here?” If Penn works against his own film crew, what kind of world are we in? This is just one of many examples of how he confuses the line between reality and fiction. <br /> <br /> Penn seems to enter the fictional world completely (I think) only when a team has something like a Loch Ness monster. But by the time the monster first appeared, we had completely left the fictional world Penn was trying to create, so it all seems silly and meaningless. <br /> <br /> This is a potentially fascinating film and a very missed opportunity, since Penn has a chance to document the master at work, but he completely loses focus and becomes a film about Penn and his antics instead of filming. documentary. The presence of Penn begins to penetrate and overshadow everything else in the film. <br /> <br /> The interview with Herzog is convincing, and we truly believe that he is not playing. We even begin to wonder if he and other members of his team are deceived by Penn, much like an audience, but you are never sure. In his interviews in front of the camera, Penn tries to be quirky and unintentionally funny, like the characters interviewed in the guest sample, but he only manages to annoy. In the movie “Guest” this effect is funny, and here it falls, because you never know what Penn is about. As a result, we, the audience, begin to dislike him, just as, obviously, the crew. In addition to the beautiful landscapes and superfluous appearance, from nowhere an excellent model, added to give the cinema a highlight, there is little to recommend. Perhaps its only quality (unintended) is that it is a great example of why the audience is important; and, completely ignoring the conventions of storytelling, you did them a disservice. For this reason alone, I think it would be a good film to show students of the film ?? a kind of movie "what not to do." I have nothing against the film, told in an unconventional way, as long as it is done skillfully, with a thematic basis, to give it meaning. In this film, this is completely missing. <br /> <br /> I would like to call it a valiant effort in something, but I’m not sure what it is except for total confusion and, ultimately, a waste of time. , <br /> <br /> (Note: it seems that bad art always reminds of good. This film made me think about the book “Painting” by Lilian Ross. Ross followed John Houston during the shooting of the film “The Red Sign courage "and brilliantly documented it for a resident of New York. In fact, it would be a great movie. If you want to get a great example of meta-art, read it.)
