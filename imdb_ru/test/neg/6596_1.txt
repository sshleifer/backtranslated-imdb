Well, first of all, I missed the first 15 minutes of the film, so I missed credits and stuff. SO when I finally accomplished this, I was like "Who the hell is this dude?" I learned that it was Flex, like a clock after watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Flex was not like Michael Jackson. Not a single bit. He could not dance like him, or move like him, the only thing that he almost had was a voice. People commented on Elizabeth Taylor, but I cannot comment on this because I know little about her. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was just stupid. The dialogue sucks. Cinematography - if you can call it that - sucks. Soundtrack sucks. Actual sucks. Yes, even Flex ... I'm so upset about it. I didn't want it to suck. I am so sad that Flex was told that he could get away with it. But it all looked like an outfit. You know? It was as if no one looked as he should, except Joseph Jackson. <br /> <br /> Concert sequences just sucks. Sorry, but Flex just can't dance like Michael. I mean, what the hell was VH1 thinking about? The makeup didnâ€™t even match the time Michael went through. For example, in the film, it was still dark when Neverland first raided. In real life, MD was damn white. There was some silly delay in the discoloration of his skin. <br /> <br /> The film was not boring, well, for me it was not. It was really nothing. I was so upset about everything that was wrong with him. I wanted to see how it would turn out and whether Flex would be able to redeem himself. In fact, he did not. The only part that seemed a little interesting to me was the whole thing of Lisa Marie. When they fell in love. It was good. But I had to turn away when they kissed. Heh. And only two parts made me collapse with laughter. The first time they cut out from Michael with short hair, you know the Thriller era, to Michael with long flowing hair from the Danger era, and he was still black! That was funny. The second time I laughed when they showed all the posters and memorabilia of Michael, but instead they had the face of Flex! It was so funny. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was cheap trash. It was just two hours of dressing and could be much better. But no, the VH1 is cheap. See if you want. But this film is not funny, given its absurdity. I came out of it with a feeling of anger. And when I found out that it was Flex, I felt so bad. So ... look if you want.
