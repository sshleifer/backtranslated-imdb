This step is bad on many levels, I don’t even know where to start. Good - good moments - Peebles is handsome as a dirty criminal in black leather. Some of the landscape photos were stunning. That's all. Oh, and it was a pleasant touch — the head of a buffalo over the door of the bar in Freemanville, I suppose, was a homage to the Buffalo soldiers. The film begins to seem normal, but the characters are so flat, so comical, such “many”, the bad guys are just bad, I suffocate, trying to describe them further. The Spanish-Cuban-American war was 1895-1898, when America was involved only from April to August 98. I think the film said it happened in 1893 (I could be wrong, but I don't want to look at it again to check). Most of this film is based on KKK, which kills Jesse's dad. Well, guys, the original KKK was created in 1865 and was destroyed by President Andrew Johnson in 1871. The clan did not even exist during this movie. Of course, in 1915, unpleasant people again engaged in business, and we know everything else. BUT for the purposes of the film this is historically incorrect, and this was the main part of the plot. I think I could make myself crazy by going into this much more, so here are a few shots, and I'm done. I did not know that the New Orleans street singers were inspired by street singers from New Orleans in the 1890s and other similar bands. I also did not know that fetish necklaces were in fashion for Sioux women in the 1890s ... but then I was surprised to see a bar singer performing jazz in acrylic 1 "nails ... We almost died of laughter, and I like a stupid western more than most people. Such a waste of talent and money - it really had the opportunity to show part of American history, which is not very well known. More information. It could have been very good, but it was just .... bad from 1-10, it gets 1 instead of zero, because Mario looks good in his hat, and in Appaluse there was a horse movie.
