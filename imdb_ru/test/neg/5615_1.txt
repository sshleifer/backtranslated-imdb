Despite the magnificent soundtrack and the presence of striking Rappaport and Woods, this is another one of those moronic comedies where New York rushes at the hero, trying to show the writer and / or director what kind of crazy place. Yes, there are other things in the movie that suck too, but that’s what matters. It seems that the trend for independent cinematographers in New York is: “I don’t need to be talented, I have NEW YORK!” Well, frankly, the film has its moments. Remembering why this guy's name is Nutty Jack was pretty funny. The script is not a story or a plot, it is a bunch of bad scenes connected by the same character. <br /> <br /> One of the worst things is that for what the characters do. Uncle Sam forced the child to deliver drugs, why? If this is so important, why didn't Sam do it himself? Then the main character puts his ass on stage behind the scenes, absolutely not winning anything from a lie. The guy falls in love with a stewardess, and none of them have any reason to fall in love. Characters are a bunch of pawns so the writer can move around to see if he can achieve something crazy. <br /> <br /> If you have easy fun or you like to watch bad indie movies, because they make you feel smarter than watch bad mainstream movies, watch it. If you want to see what a GOOD frivolous criminal film looks like, watch Takeshi Kitano's “Brother”. “Kicked In The Head” is a great example of why so many people hate unusual indie films: they suck a lot. And a note for the director: do not be afraid to excite, entertain, educate or entertain the audience from time to time. Boring does not make you a better director than those who may interest me.
