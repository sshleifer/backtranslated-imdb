This is nothing special to say, except that he is probably the worst of the early series of films about zombies (I can watch another one, "Zombie Rise" [1936], until the end of the month). Despite the intention of all the stars of John Carradine to create an army in the service of the Third Reich together with them, they, apparently, do nothing at all! James Baskett (uncle Remus from SONG OF SOUTH [1946]!) Plays their leader, who also serves as a servant of Carradine. The black comedian Mantan Moreland reiterates his role as a cat-predator chauffeur from The Zombie King (1941), like the exotically named Madame Sul-Te-Van as housekeeper Carradine. Sorry for Carradine, his highest achievement ?? zombie his wife ?? brings him all sorts of trouble: not only her relatives appear in his distant abode / laboratory to find out about her sudden death (which means that he must fake the funeral service!), but she actually turns out to be disobedient and outraged, eventually convincing "her zombie comrades rebelled against their master !!" Cowboy star Bob Steele is also involved (still best known for his role in Howard Hawks's Big Dream [1946]), who plays a US secret agent posing as a Nazi posing as a sheriff! Fortunately, Szekely's director would have been lucky with his next genre film DAY OF TRIFFIDES (1962).
