Well, well, I have seen a lot of feedback on this, and a lot of promo, always showing the beheading scene. But this film is complicated. And I mean it by all means. It’s hard to find a copy, because it was a low-budget independent release, and since the MPAA hunted for each copy on VHS, it came out without a rating, but it had to be evaluated for MPAA. Thus, the copies disappeared into the underground scene. All the people involved in this film have never done anything else in the business. So this made this film unique. VHS copies almost never appear on eBay or other sites, and if they do, you will pay more than $ 100 to get them. But thanks to the connection with the USA, I managed to catch a release on a DVD sold worldwide. Limited, but he had to be a kind of official. From time to time there are still some shows of this splatterfest. But is it worth all the hype around it? As mentioned earlier, it is difficult to catch, but to survive. There are bloody murders, there is necrophilia, there is nudity, but there are also many conversations between tinkers. And to be honest, if you want to watch a movie in 5 minutes, watch the final, this is a killer’s memory. The blood flows, and it is really a spray, but not a full 80 minutes, a spray in abundance for 10 minutes. The quality of the film is fine, the sound is fine, there is no hiss, the colors are fine, black is black, not blue, as in many budget projects. It's okay to watch, but you will never get scared, but this is one of them, when your friends drink beer and pizza, I think. 555, naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah 333.
