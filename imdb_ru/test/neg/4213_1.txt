<br /> <br /> Summary: The film is not worth it <br /> <br /> As an avid fan of “Gone With the Wind”, I was disappointed that I watched the original film and saw that many important characters were missing in it. Fortunately, the film itself was a wonderful piece. When Scarlett's book came out, I read it in the hope of following my two favorite literary characters on their journey together. Although the book lacks real quality, it remains a good story, and as long as I managed to separate it from the original, it was and remains pleasant. However, I believe that the six hours I spent watching the Scarlett mini-series were one of the most spent hours of my life. Discrediting any of the original character traits so well formed in the book by Margaret Mitchell, this series also turned the story of a sequel into rape, distrust, murder, and improperly formed relationships, from which even Scarlett’s book was left out. Casting for many characters refused to explore the features that were so well formed both in the original novel and in the film, and even transferred to the second book, and again left at least one incredibly important character. In the novel, Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of an extended family visit. After she has agreed with Rett, she agrees to leave and continues to reunite with her relatives O'Hara in Savannah. In the end, she accompanies her cousin Colum, the passionate leader of the Fenian brotherhood, to Ireland to further explore the “roots of his family,” and in the end they call him O'Hara, the head of the family. While her duties as O'Hara make her participate in her city of Ballyhara, Scarlett goes to the world of English landowners and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. She, being despised by Rhett again and again, finally agrees to marry Luke, Count Fenton, until Rhett comes to the cliche “a night on a white horse” - a type of salvation. Mini-series "Scarlett" can not even cope with this task. Raped by her fiancé and despised by her family, the series shows Scarlett imprisoned after being accused of murder committed by her cousin. <br /> <br /> I heartily advise everyone who is going to spend the day watching this, to rethink this decision. . <br /> <br />
