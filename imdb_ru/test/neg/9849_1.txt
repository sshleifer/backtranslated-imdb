There is so much bad in this movie that I don’t even know where to start. The story is not cohesive. I guarantee that the average viewer will be scratching his head in confusion for five minutes in the film. <br /> <br /> This is what I remember about the film before I was bored: a quasi-abusive dad pursues some Pre-teen sisters go through the house, but in the end they are not so insulting. In the next scene, girls are about 15 years old. They ride with their parents and beat the deer. The deer must have been explosive because their car exploded, one sister dragging the other from the burning debris. Then the girls float around the lake and make a huge plan to go to Kentucky (??) and start a new life. In the very next scene, the girls are hitchhiking to a military base. And what is this military base. In fact, it looks more like a pig farm, turned into a military base with many tangled extras playing in "soldiers." The base commander's office is especially good because there are random things, such as the AK-47, hanging on the wall, and a sergeant's hat attached to a sign (????), so viewers will probably know that this is the office of a military guy. , Then some random dude pushing a motorcycle shows up and the base commander orders him to go "into the city" to buy porn Meg, and make sure that the soldiers do not think that he is on the "pink team." Thus, our character takes a pickup truck turned into an army truck "into the city" and loads a box from a nondescript "bookstore" with an explosive doll at the front door. The girls are hiding in the guy's truck when he stops to refuel, and browse the cache of porn to find items inside, such as the “anal invader”. I think this is enough to scare most people away. The plot aside, the sound quality is terrible, and the film is full of audacious attempts at symbolism, for example, a radio preacher, talking about forbidden fruits during a scene where a “slutty” sister meets the main character for the first time, or how the camera lingers too long trying to convey on certain pictures message". <br /> <br /> If you ever see it for sale or rent or something else, stay away. It is not worth the money anyway.
