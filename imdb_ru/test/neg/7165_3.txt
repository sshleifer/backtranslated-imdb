I liked some of the characters, but our hero relied too much on a charming smile. I didn't give a damn about him. He makes a bad choice, and I really didn’t care, because he seems to be too. He seemed rather unreasonable. There were a few moments that gave a chance for some human insight (the scene with the whale was interesting), but they are lost in the general ailment of the film. Love interest was acceptable, and other characters were slightly interesting, but the plot wanders too much and makes me want many moments in the film. In the end, I wondered why I stayed so long. <br /> <br /> There are some funny moments, but in the end I didn’t care. I can not understand the rating of the film above. - 3 out of 10
