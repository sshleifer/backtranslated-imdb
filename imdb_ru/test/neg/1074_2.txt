I caught 2:37 at the AFI Fest in Los Angeles. This is a very well-shot first film (although the DV format is starting to show itself on the outside scenes), and I’m sure it has good intentions to show us the “dark side” of high school - in other words, every side of high school, But the director has no talent write or lead promise premise. There are several characters, but none of them are more than the plot requires. There is no depth in these cartoons, except for frauds: “I’m concerned, teenager X, I have problem Y”. The perceived roles of men and women in this story are phenomenally problematic. <br /> <br /> Let's start with men. You have a stoner who is gay, a boy who is also gay, a boy who rapes his sister, and Mr. Pipants. As stereotyped, all gay men must be sexually unsatisfied and cruel to women and themselves. Naturally (or unnaturally, as the stereotype suggests), two gay characters beat women, Pepants and themselves. I would completely agree with these characteristics if the stereotypes were turned over on their heads or the characters somehow surpassed them. But neither has happened, and that’s all that is in the stories of these characters. <br /> <br /> Next, ladies. One young woman wants to be a housewife suffering from bulimia, another - pregnant with rape of a brother raping her sister, and there is a girl who kills herself (I will come back to this later). Again, I do not think that there is a requirement of political correctness for directors (I would have been without work in this case), but I think that this is justified only if there is something else for this character or story. If this archetype were used to reveal something different about a character other than “I am a teenager and life sucks,” I would be happy as a clam. But nothing new was found! Nothing undermines, changes or sublimates. <br /> <br /> Finally, a girl who kills herself. This is a stupid and extremely careless narration. We had to sit for 5 minutes, when the girl brutally killed herself, whom we saw, maybe 30 seconds throughout the film? We watched all these other stories for one and a half hours, and now we are invited to torture ourselves for a character who is not part of the story? It is cheap, exploits and careless. Despite the millions of shitty indie films that came before, you have to EARN something like that. You can not just buy it on credit. So this suicide happens, we get dirty tricks from characters that go nowhere, but they fall, and the movie ends. What have I learned? I already knew that high school was sucked - was there, did it. I already knew that people have stereotypical views on gays and young women. I already knew that children with disabilities scoff. <br /> <br /> What else is there? Smoke, mirrors and some really beautiful views of the leaves. Oh, and the nastiest deus ex machina I have ever seen.
