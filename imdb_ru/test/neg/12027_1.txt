I bought this film invisible at the science fiction congress, and I got what I deserved for doing something so stupid. Simply put, this film is implausible, boring and inconspicuous. <br /> <br /> I was so bored and disgusted by the lack of development of the plot that I turned it off to watch the repetition of "Mythbusters". I understand that it was a very low-budget move, or at least it looked like a very low-budget move, but this does not justify a terrible game, a terrible story and even worse camera work. This is similar to what a group of college students did between lessons and got drunk. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the villain was not so ridiculous, and the plot really could happen in real life regarding the law, the coercion could become so bad that it is ridiculous. This film is not funny, just bad.
