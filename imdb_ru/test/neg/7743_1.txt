And the title speaks for itself: a stupid sounding title that is a stupid sounding joke of a film known as “Alien from LA”. Why not just call him "Alien from South Africa", because this film was made here? My advice on watching movies that were shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000: don't watch the original version of the movie at all! Period! Always watch a film with a theatrical shadow at the bottom of the screen, with a man trapped in space with his two funny, wise robot friends sitting in the lower right corner of the screen. Just better. <br /> <br /> The film in the form in which it was originally seen: Awful! The film, as it was seen on MST3K: Genius!
