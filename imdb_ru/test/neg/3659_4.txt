Maybe I saw a cleared version, but apart from a few flashes of the chest, I'm not sure what these other commentators refer to. <br /> <br /> In general, things are not as bad as I expected from previous comments, although the end makes you wonder ... WTF? It was dark, but not so much that you couldnâ€™t make out the scenes, and I think it only added to the eeriness and horror of the situation. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film could have been better, but the acting was quite decent. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a rather creepy (and yes, brutal) film with a disappointing ending.
