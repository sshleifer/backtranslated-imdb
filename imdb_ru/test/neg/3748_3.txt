First of all, if you want to make a good film, do not squeeze your entire exposure in the last 10 minutes. It is expected that the viewer will be confused for almost two hours, only for Father Margot to explain everything to Alex very late in the film. Worse, the screenwriter decided that it was not enough to solve the main riddle, but added a completely unnecessary murder, which we knew nothing about (with the participation of Father Alex!). <br /> <br /> There are some serious motivation issues with characters as well. Margot's choice of father seems to make no sense when the film ends. Why did he not just kill Philip's father and end it? Instead, a complex conspiracy was invented to hide the truth, but one that ensures that everyone will be in physical danger for many years (including an absolutely innocent photographer who is killed by the thugs of Father Philip). Although Alex is a doctor (who can be considered relatively intelligent), he prefers to flee the police, during which he endangers not only his own life, but also those whom he involves in an unpleasant heap on the freeway. Why did Margo's girlfriend try so hard to keep her promise to Margo, as soon as all this nonsense struck Alex's fan? And we have to think that Margo's father will kill himself rather than go to jail? What about his wife? Did he take into account her wishes? These are some of the major issues. <br /> <br /> Then there are some unpleasant details, for example: why was her father there during the night of her fake death? How did he grab the body of a drug addict in such a short time and quickly returned it to bury it along with two others? Alex Bruno’s friend seems eager to become part of the mayhem in which he and his friends have to kill for Alex, despite the fact that he owed Alex for saving his son’s life. What is good about Margo's photos? They do not mean Philip at all. And why would Margo have the key to the safe at hand so that her future kidnappers could take it? Did I miss some other stuff? Probably. Minor irritations of mine include the fact that, although Alex is a doctor, he smokes like a villain. Which makes his marathon run away from the police even more impressive. In addition, when he travels in a cabriolet with his lawyer, not one of them is wearing a seatbelt. How bright can they be?
