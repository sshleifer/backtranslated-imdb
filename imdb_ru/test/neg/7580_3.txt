I decided to watch this movie because it was marked as “the scariest movie in history”, so I expected it. Unfortunately, I found that there was not a single terrible moment in the film (and I am one of those who jump very easily). The film was just awful cliches, and every time a jump occurred, it was incredibly obvious. The advantages of this film are music and a strange scene, which is actually well removed (for example, the very last scene, when she opens the door and you see Tuna in reflection, and when he turns to him, you see a ghost on his shoulders), In general , this film really didn’t add anything new to the J-Horror genre, and there was a lack of creativity and panic everywhere.
