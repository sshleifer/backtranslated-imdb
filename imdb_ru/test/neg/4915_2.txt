What is this movie ??? A terrible film with the old boring concept of infidelity, already achieved by the “Bhatt camp”. The film is filmed EMRAAN HASHMI, UDITA GOSWAMI AND DINO MOREA. In the film "Without a base." Just like that ... Dino and Udita are married and live in a rich mansion. However, Dino does not like Udita to the depths of her soul, since she wants only her wealth. He loves someone else (Tara Sharma). Therefore, he bribes Emraan to deal with Udita so that he can catch them and finally part with Udita ... How boring !! However, Emraan falls in love with Udita and vice versa. Finally, when Udita is sentenced to imprisonment for the murder of Emraan, Dino is falsely trying to save her, showing his false love for her. Udita, on the other hand, does not understand this and feels that he really loves her. Therefore she lends all her wealth to Dino. Finally, Dino leaves the police station and goes with Tara with all the wealth. What a scam !! The songs are good and the only good ones in the film. Now individual grades: (out of 5) Emraan: * * Udita: * 1/2 Dinosaur: * 1/2 Total game: * 1/2 Direction: * * The plot: * Music: * * * 1/2 Final rating: * 1/2 Bad performance and bad cast ....... Music: Good ... I rate the movie: 1.5 / 10 (Don't waste your time !!!!)
