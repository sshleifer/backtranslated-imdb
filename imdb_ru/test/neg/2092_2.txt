“CLOSE FRONT DOOR” I said that when I was told that a new film, Snakes on a Train, had appeared in Blockbuster. Well, maybe this is not exactly what I said, but you understood. I didn't need to know who was in the film or something else. All I knew was that I was shooting this film. <br /> <br /> I should probably ask what he is talking about. Looking back, I don’t know if I really would like to see a film about the Mayan curse that makes a woman give birth to snakes and spit them out of her mouth. Also, I would not like to see a film that shows a guy who looks rather strange, like the pedophile version of Leif Garrett. <br /> <br /> In any case, although the curse may be interesting on some levels (well, maybe not), there was still a promise that these annoying characters would be eaten or at least killed by snakes. So I was ready to sit for the first hour of a very small event, other than the Texas Ranger, forcing the girl to burst into nice little things so that she could keep her cocaine, or a Latin American shaman who likes to strike people from time to time. But then all hell broke loose, and the girl began to spit out more and more snakes. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER WARNING * So at the end everything is going well, and I’m ready to overlook the fact that some of these snakes suddenly turned out to be 25 feet in length. In the end, people eat, so all is well. But all of a sudden, and I'm not going to tell you how, because it will destroy the best part, one of the snakes is about 300 feet long. Then he begins to squeeze and devour the train with all the graphic skill of Serpentavr from old GI cartoons. Joe. Unfortunately, I was not able to connect with the Nemesis Enforcer with this movie. In any case, you might think that it would be quite impossible to stop such a big snake that ate the train. Well, if you don’t know your voodoo Maya stones and are capable of causing tornadoes from heaven. Yes, that's all I say about it. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is bad. Really bad to such an extent that you can become numb after watching it, or your brain can hurt. I did not give it, because, no matter how stupid it was, it was still not as bad as Dat. So if you like camp or poorly designed horror B movies, this is for you. If you think that this will actually be cool, like the larger, more infamous brothers, just step away from the box if you see it. And I will leave you a quote from the film, which should generally sum up. <br /> <br /> "A snake can't get on a train!" Because it's just stupid. Not how they make stops or anything ....
