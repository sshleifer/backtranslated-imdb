Joan Crawford is convincingly disfigured when our story begins, and, of course, she is recovering. But she is a bad egg, exploiting one guy, while at the same time experiencing the antisocial philosophy of another guy. All this is happening in Sweden, which is really strange. This causes everything and everyone to be remembered in visual photographs that do not need to depict Anytown USA, but it makes the viewer wonder why every remake has since been burdened and not determined by the need for Americanization of everything. There is a plot, a plot, a plot so talkative that you can drown in it, and even worse, this is a framing device that adds a movie to a movie. Photography is sometimes good, with rather strange angles and thumbnails. But this is turned upside down, without ever pulling you in.
