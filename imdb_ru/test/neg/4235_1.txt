The director fills this film with false depth, repeating the trick throughout the film. EVERY single frame in this film is 3 times longer than necessary. You can easily cut out 1.5 hours of this painful long 2.5-hour film, not excluding: one word of dialogue, one image, one event or part of a movement. <br /> <br /> It was one of the most useless wastes of a movie I’ve ever seen. Other reviewers called it pretentious, which is an understatement. L'Humanite is a pseudo-intellectual garbage, designed to be anti-Hollywood, so that Cannes judges can defend their independence from Oscar. <br /> <br /> The IMDb Reviewer states: “Unlike Hollywood films, which usually force an audience into overload - this causes the audience to slow down and consider some of the tiniest and most common functions in life in the smallest detail.” You had to be terrified to look at some of these images so slowly and slowly move on these characters. This is not real life, unless you are being treated with heavy medications. <br /> <br /> Finally, I felt that the Shott image was the sad plunder of Peter Sellers' Chauncey Gardner workshop. He uses the same facial expressions and postures. He even has gardens! In many ways, there are parallels between these two films. The main difference is that “Being there” moves and does not rely on shock and tricks to create meaningful experience by asking questions of various things that we take for granted in life.
