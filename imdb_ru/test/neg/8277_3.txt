This film was pure, slow, painful torture. Not being a fan of slasher films and preferring classic horror, I may not be the best judge. Slasher fans can enjoy it as an early entry into the slasher genre. I would really like to spend 90 minutes watching this. The only reasons for viewing this are: 1) Young Bath White (up to “Wheel of Fortune”), which has about 3 minutes of total time on the screen. 2) the early role of the queen of cries Linnie Quigley (with a nude) and the legendary beauty EJ Picker as a school secretary who added a bit of humor and sex appeal. Otherwise, there is a group of the 80s called Felony, which, although interesting, delays WAY for too long. Just like a movie ..... I had to constantly check how much time was left, and I could not wait for “Graduate” to become the best movie.
