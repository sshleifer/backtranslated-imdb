1 Bolo Yeng starred in the film just ten minutes, including when he offers his boss cold drinks. 2 many street thugs, similar to the guardians of the landfills, instantly overwhelm the Asian superhero, who talks like an illegal alien just because of a dung truck. 3 (thug) Give me that - shirt, fun model, like muscle - hee ho! hi-heeew! hap hap! - he is dead on the floor with a broken neck, elbow, chin or eggs - 4 cheap semi-sexual scenes where a white wide figure appears out of nowhere, digs up an Asian superhero. 5 Norton (the former star of the militants of C) pretends to be posing as an eccentric fashion smuggler of arms, who sells white slutty girls that are chosen in a nightclub, where they willingly follow some idiot, posing as a millionaire who breaks off (you reap what you sow) 6 yes, the captain of the local police is involved, and yes, the first killed police officer is a former superhero patrol partner (yawn!). 7 Action scenes are fake, like a) hee-ho! Chinese tries a twisting blow. B) Thin Chinese foot in the throat of the Negro. C) Deadly death is getting too close to his head, like Walker Texas Ranger, fake action. 8 final titles, finally, <br /> <br /> complete nonsense. These people are good enough only to be steadfast or twins in other C films and to be attributed MOST as "a team of stuntmen provided by the county jail."
