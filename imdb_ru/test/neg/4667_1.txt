<br /> <br /> I liked some of the 80s Hollywood action movies. They had icons such as Arnie and Sly, but I think that the thriller of the 90s fell sharply. The worst of them, I believe, was Armageddon. <br /> <br /> The plot is shamelessly invented and throws away the worst clich√©s, as he seeks to excite the audience. The melodrama is so tenacious and terrible that you can't wait for Bruce Willis to disappear from the screen. Liv Tyler, who played superbly in several excellent independent roles of directors of artists such as Bernardo Bertolucci and Robert Altman, decided with regret to jump into a commercial van. This film symbolizes the new Hollywood aesthetics of great special effects and a few good dialogue or a real melodrama. This is the norm nowadays, and I'm starting to wonder if there is a role in Hollywood for writers. It seems that they simply use hacks and committees to write simple scripts. They leave the rest to the technician. In Armageddon there is not a single piece of great, heartfelt human emotions. It just feels empty and soft. I can only recall one good aspect of this film, and this concerns Father Liv Tyler, who does not even appear in the film. Stephen Tyler's Aerosmith group offers a thematic song for the film - a ballad that really flares up and at least twitches hearts a bit when the last credits appear. <br /> <br /> I cry about western civilization if people like this predictable, bulky movie. It stands for superficiality, lethargy, and decay of the human intellect. I would even prefer to watch the eighth Friday of the 13th.
