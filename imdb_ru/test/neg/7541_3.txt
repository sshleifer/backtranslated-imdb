Herman made his northern drama in his own “Little Voice” and “Brassed Off”, but the formula breaks down in this harsh, flat and contrived story of two teenage offenders trying to get season tickets to meet Newcastle. <br /> <br /> Walk, underage smoking and drunkenness, underage sex, teenage abortion, school bullying, drug abuse, substance abuse, depression, child abuse, child sexual abuse, shoplifting, burglary, auto theft , violent assault and armed robbery - all this is manifested here. None of these problems has been investigated, they simply serve to move the story from one incredible situation to another. The film is not as keenly watched as Treinspotting, as sharp as Full Monty, or not as reflective as Wonderland (from which he shamelessly steals music in an overly manipulative way). I suspect that none of the cinematographers are from Newcastle, and, of course, have never encountered the social problems that the film refers to. I'm all for fun, and Herman's record shows that he knows about the need to balance the social message with laughter and tears. Simply put, he is incredibly short here. <br /> <br /> The film has a good ending, but too many flat, banal moments to survive. Well shot, not very well acted, and ultimately fails in three important points: the script, the script, the script.
