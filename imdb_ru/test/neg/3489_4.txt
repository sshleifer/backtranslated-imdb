The “plot” of this film contains several holes through which you could drive a massive truck, but I believe that this is not always the top priority in horror. Two older sisters in rural England have been keeping their brother in the basement for over 30 years. Now he has escaped and started a terrific fun, focusing on the military who are stationed nearby. “We just thought it would be better for him,” do they keep repeating and ?? strange ?? All army officers love these women and do not doubt their sincerity, although 5 of their men died. I do not know whether to find a revelation at the end of the suspension ?? or tiring! In a sense, this film reminded me of "Arsenic and Old Lace." In this classic black comedy, the two half-crazy siblings are also the mother of their stupid younger brother, but they kill there. However, the old woman from the "Beast in the Basement" is no less crazy. The “horror” in this movie of the early 70s is very amateur and cheap, but there are several careful attempts to create tension. Too many "old ladies" talk about the good old days, and this is rarely what you're looking for in a horror movie with such an attractive title. Flora Robson, who can be recognized by lovers of classic cinema, plays one of the sisters. She gave the image of the queen of England to the legendary film Errol Flynn about the counterfeiter "Hawk Sea".
