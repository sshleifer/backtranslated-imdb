This is truly a film that popularized Kung Fu in the 1970s. However, if he ever had some thrilling or even half interesting plot, he didn’t seem to have grown very well. <br /> <br /> In short: an extremely lengthy, slow, intricate plot with mediocre choreography, usually annoying and exaggerated whip sounds with each punch and bang, and constant “plot twists” that never end. By the time the movie reaches its emotional apogee, I’ve been winding out of the rut to take care of it. <br /> <br /> Look at its historical value, which has become a landmark of Chinese kungfu movies - just leave your expectations outside the door, otherwise you will be greatly disappointed. <br /> <br /> Only for hardcore fans.
