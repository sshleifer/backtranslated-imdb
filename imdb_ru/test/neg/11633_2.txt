What a terrible continuation. The reason I give this film two stars instead of zero is because it is a film that has violence, blood and creatures, but it is poorly planned. And this terrible sequel was made by none other than BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM !!!!!!!!! Mick Harris! The bone head that brought you a remake of The Shining One, which almost made Kubrick almost roll over in his grave when he discovered that it was really done. Harris is also the man who brought you the sad continuation of Fly, Fly, which was a wonderful movie, but Harris’s movie almost ruined John Getz’s career. In any case, if you really want to see a trilogy of shitty creatures in order, do not. This is a mistake I made, rent the first or third or even better, but DO NOT STAY AT THIS LEVEL! This movie is so horrible that I can't believe it, please avoid this shit. Shame on you, Mick!
