I can't believe that I actually installed a “seasonal pass” on my TiVo for this, obviously, they had a good preview or something like that ... Although I can't imagine it. After watching about 5 minutes, I thought to myself ... why I watch it .. This is definitely not reality, but some of the worst actions I've ever seen on TV ... I'm a complete reality show junkie, and this is nothing really about that. REALLY .. (if you can call it that) terrible .. The only ones who are almost 5% worthy are the girls who are called to attract viewers to the show ... although they have to be much more beautiful to save this train wreck ... if if they had more lines, they would probably change their mind, since they probably also have no talent. This is obviously a very low-budget production with "actors" who are obviously very cheap. They could not get a job in anything else. Someone should send these people to work in public catering. Maybe they could do it. And, by the way, Parco P.I. no longer takes place in my TiVo or TiVo pass list. Definitely the worst show I've ever seen.
