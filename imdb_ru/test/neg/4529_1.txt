This movie sucks. The problem was not with the actors. I think the cast was great, a lot of good talent, a lot of great acting. But the script was terrible! It seemed that basically it was just a framework in which Steve Carrell could do his improvisation. And this is what he does best, but it just did not work here. The script was difficult to follow, the story was meaningless, and the scenes were random and had no direction. In addition, most of the action was extremely contrived and poorly thought out. It was a good effort, but as Max says, they missed it a LOT! I am shocked to see how many bright reviews of this skunk here on IMDb. Obviously, film producers force people to write a lot of positive reviews about their films and fill out IMDb recordings. If you read the positive reviews and compare them with the negative ones, then it is quite clear which of them are genuine reviews of ordinary users. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of problems and jokes in this film that simply didnâ€™t work. I liked Steve Carrell in Anchor Man, and I like his comedy and style. But I will tell you that I never laughed when I watched this movie. Yes, I had a few easy moments, a couple of chuckles, but no real laughter. Nothing that struck me. <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! One ridiculous scene occurred when Max tied his hands to the plane and went to the bathroom to try to escape. He uses his special Swiss Army Knife ... but instead of simply using the BLADE BLADDER, he tries to REMOVE the binding with his miniature crossbow. And as the crossbow shoots and again and again shoots him with small arrows (almost sticking out the EYE), Max doesn't give up and try the blade instead ... no, he just keeps shooting himself with the crossbow. What did he really expect to do with this crossbow? It seemed like it was the worst option on the knife to try and remove the fasteners. It just didn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> This is a good example of typical circumstances in the scenes of which this film consists. They were ridiculous, poorly thought out, poorly motivated and made of pure nonsense. And it really distracted. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film was a big disappointment, and I recommend that you avoid it. IMDb note: You have to do something with the fake reviews that people leave. This reduces the reliability of the site.
