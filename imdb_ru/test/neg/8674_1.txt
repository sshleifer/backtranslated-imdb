I’m not a poker player Jane Austen, but why make such a film if you have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was so wrong in part that it’s hard to know where to start - the wrong person, the modern make-up, the completely wrong hair and not cropped hair), she didn’t look particularly meek and offended by her family and didn’t understand why everyone seemed to think of her as especially holy or kind. <br /> <br /> The picnic (substitute ball) was so low-budget that it was awkward to watch and completely miss the Portsmouth section. destroyed the essence of the play (and also lost scenes that could add a rude counterpoint to this oh-so claustrophobic pink living room.) imagination) to do something meaningful with adaptation, please do not pretend to be calling Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> It was about 10% of Mansfield Park and almost 90% nothing at all. <br /> <br /> ps edmund was very good
