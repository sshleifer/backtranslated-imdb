A disappointing film with Walter Pijon as a hunter who travels to Germany to kill Hitler. When he is found, he is forced to sign a document confirming that he acted on the orders of England. His refusal to sign the document leads us to the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Pijon is pursued to England by the evil George Sanders and his cohort John Carradine, who speaks little, but again, as always, the personification of evil is personification. <br /> <br /> Along the path of pursuit, Pijon meets with Joan Bennett, the latter demonstrating a wonderful emphasis on cockney. <br /> <br /> History is stuck with something like how love develops between them, but again, as we approach the 11th World War, realism becomes the object of the day. <br /> <br /> The nearest cave scene between Sanders and Pijon is well recognized, but we know where this arrow will go. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting that while Pijon is fleeing Nazi Germany, he meets again with young Roddy MacDowell, one of Pijohnâ€™s many colleagues that same year. unforgettable "How green was my valley." How green was "Hunt for Man"?
