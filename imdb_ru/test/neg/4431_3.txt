When I think Bollywood. I think of the lightened feeling of musical dance numbers, with gorgeous costumes for men and women. And catchy tunes. Horror, Thriller, Mystery and Suspension, do not come to mind, though. And this, in my opinion, seems like an abstract comedy. <br /> <br /> I think there would be a better film, even shorter, if the writer and director made a certain choice. Either went on straight thriller-horror, comedy-mystery, supernatural-suspension or a musical novel, instead of an awkward mixture of them all. <br /> <br /> I have to say that more than once I thought that the director must have seen “I know what you did last summer” and tried to give it a Bollywood character. My first film was Bride and Prejudice. Which I thought acted well. <br /> <br /> It looked like what the western audience would consider the festival with cheese right on the video. <br /> <br /> The game was excessive, at times it seemed that they were deliberately trying to parody the Western thrillers, but when you saw that they were trying to instill dramatic crying, crying or fear, it seemed out of place. <br /> <br /> The viewer was interested when one of the actors winks at the camera. Several times, when the audience was supposed to be horrified, we could only laugh at the absurd. <br /> <br /> I watch a lot of foreign films, and although I don’t know Hindi, I have to say that they didn’t cope well with the film’s subtitles. Sometimes it was difficult to read white inscriptions on a bright background. <br /> <br /> The villain was especially funny, at least for me, because he came with his music of mood. The alleged unexpected turn, actually looked like a policeman. <br /> <br /> The leading pairs were beautiful / quite beautiful, and the musical numbers made it worthy of my rent. I would advise it to someone as a musical comedy, but I would tell them to just rewind the rest of the film, because it was not worth the effort of reading. If you are committed to reading the entire Hindi film with subtitles, check out the excellent romantic drama “Namastei, London”. <br /> <br /> But I wasn’t scared ... unless it’s something that they think is terrible in India. 1 out of 10 for being advertised as. 6 out of 10 for unintended speed and ability to cause a lot of laughter, as well as music / dance numbers. Enjoy :)
