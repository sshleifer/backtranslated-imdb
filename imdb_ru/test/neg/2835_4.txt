The young doctor and his wife unexpectedly expect a child. Both are worried about a two-hour memory error on the night of conception. An interesting twist to the hackneyed story. Very good F / X and interesting editing. Gillian McWirter is an outstanding cast with Arnold Voslu, Wilford Brimley and Brad Dourif Brimley brings normality to a wonder. Glory to director Brian Yuzna.
