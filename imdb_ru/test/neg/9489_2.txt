One evening I saw it at my relative's house when he appeared on television, and my mother-in-law said that this was one of her favorite films. Well, she can get it. <br /> <br /> Listen, I can enjoy watching chicks from time to time, as long as it's good. But this is very juicy, unreal and simply predictable, despite some decent performances of Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman. It is strange how quickly a woman can come to terms with the fact that her vision has been taken away. Oh, well, they say love is blind ... <br /> <br /> A neat and tidy happy ending almost made me also shut up And how often do we need Otto Kruger to repeat the name? It happened not once, not twice, but three times!
