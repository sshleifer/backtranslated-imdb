oh god, where to start ..... <br /> <br /> throwing a pistol to enter the hand-to-hand fight with zombies, holding the bitten soldier in the debate, to shoot at him b4 he turns, then he turns and bites the person holding him, turning his back to the "fallen" zombie, constantly shooting at the chest and seeing that it does not work, so they shoot at the chest a little more, thinking that the child fell at the table with blood coming from his mouth, everything still ok, walking around the football field, as if everything is in order, then suddenly noticing that the football teams and the zombie is doing something in the middle of the field, as if they could not be seen until that moment .... <br /> <br /> I could go for a few more hours, but you understand the essence ..... childish writing and dialogue, bad direction, terrible special effects, a really sad and undeveloped storyline (Campus, infected zombies should get a viral host, and then lose it ... twice), the only plus I can find is that This one does not include real game clips. Call the "battle scenes" .... <br /> <br /> I will say that you do not waste your money, but be more upset because of the waste of time, I saw it by telegram and wanted 2 hours my life back
