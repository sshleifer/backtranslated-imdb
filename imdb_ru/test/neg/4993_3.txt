The Undeath uprising begins with a huge nuclear-type explosion bursting through an unnamed American city, several people survive in the building, leaning on the door so that it remains closed and does not allow dirt (!). They argue among themselves for ages, then a monster appears, seemingly out of nowhere, and starts killing them one by one ... <br /> <br /> Written, directed and directed by Jason Horton and Shannon Hubbell. say Rise of the Undead is terrible. The script takes itself very seriously, but does not make much sense. The first thing I asked myself was: is this huge nuclear blast wave destroying the entire city occurring, why are these people I watch for still alive? Why the building in which they still stand? Then I asked myself when something really should happen, all the first 20 minutes are set in the same room, in fact it is a bit generous, it’s rather a corridor, as the main characters claim. It then turns into a plagiarism called The Return of the Living Dead (1985) with a government-created virus that turns people into zombies in front of one of the most abrupt, senseless, and seemingly random plot twists I have ever seen, which gives Most of what has just happened was a complete waste of time. Then, in the last 30-odd minutes, the “Rise of the Undead” turns into some kind of strange science-fiction thing, like a ball of energy floating around, killing everyone, was I the only one who asked what kind of floating energy ball and where did it come from? Going back to what was happening outside, what was the reason again? Oh, that's right, they never tell us. Rise of the Undead is a mess, the characters are terrible and not even named, turning halfway will make you tear your hair in despair, the dialogue sucks, nothing is explained, and there is practically no story here. The last 10 minutes (maybe a little more) "The Rise of the Undead" do not contain any dialogue, and the film just suddenly ends. <br /> <br /> Directed by Horton and Hubbell, obviously, worked with a small budget, the entire film set about two rooms and three corridors! The photos are terrible, they use annoying color filters, seemingly at random, and sometimes it really looks like the “Uprising Undead” was videotaped. There are no special effects, there is a bit of fake blood, but there are no actual cosmetic effects to talk about. There are several CGI snapshots of a city engulfed in flames that look good, but the floating ball of an energy creature looks terrible. There used to be one confusing shot, when two people were sitting against the wall of the corridor and talking, for some strange reason their heads were cut off at the top of the screen! Only their lower bodies are visible from the neck down, but nothing happens in the frame, they do not move, and there is nothing more, but for some strange reason their heads cut off the upper part of the frame when they are talking to each other! This is actually a rather strange thing. <br /> <br /> With an ultra-low budget of about $ 10,000 and, according to a two-week IMDb snapshot, I have to congratulate the creators on the ending and spreading of the “Uprising Undead”, but on this my congratulations stop because terrible industrial value and are located in about three corridors, which are located somewhere in New Orleans in Louisiana, where the Uprising Undead was shot dead. The action sucks, so I will not stop there. <br /> <br /> Rise of the Undead - sucks, it sounds like a movie about zombies, but, frankly, this is not so, everything is not in it the way I know the directors worked with a small budget, but this is not quite an excuse As far as I understand. Definitely not recommended.
