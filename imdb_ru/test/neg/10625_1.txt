I received this film as a birthday present, because all my friends know that I am a big fan of low-budget horror films. Kaufman Studios have always made lousy bloody clicks that delivered. I loved watching their movies at home on rainy nights with my family ... until I saw the Bugged ... WHAT HAPPENED? <br /> <br /> This film started with a pretty good concept of mutating errors and even added some funny comedy, but overall the script is just bad, and it was number one error. Ronald K. Armstrong must learn to be the best writer before becoming a director. After reading “Credits”, we discover that he has given himself the most important role in the film!?! Two words Mr. Director "Acting" OK? Mr. Armstrong joins the ranks of other writers / directors who star in their own films, and this is number two mistake. <br /> <br /> The only thing that, in my opinion, was saved by this film, is an artistic camera work and musical score (let's hear it for the film crew!). The cast of the other actors, who at the beginning of this performance seemed a bit cold, was really heated to the middle and end of this production. Everyone got together and helped make this film. Ronald Armstrong may lack the talent to ever become a worthy director or actor, but I will say this about him - he seems to know how to organize people so that they all come together and make their productions. <br /> <This film, I must say, can inspire any young director who wants to make his own film, because if Mr. Armstrong could cope with this, any other can do it. If you have the opportunity to watch this film, watch it to be inspired by "Better" in the future. Hollywood needs big and best horror films to get this genre back from the grave.
