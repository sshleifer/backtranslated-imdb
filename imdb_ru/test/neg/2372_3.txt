This is a comedy version of "Strangers on the train." It works quite well. I am a severe grader, so rating 3 is reflected mainly in the characters and the plot. The performances are very good, all of them. Of course, the two stars, DeVito and Crystal, shine the most. Each performer acts well enough to recoup. Comedy works at a level just below the farce. DeVito characters work best when corrupted. His character, portrayed as a writer's hack, would probably have been more real if it had been published and praised just like most hacks. His real-life character would have a great agent and lots of suggestions. Characters are one-dimensional, which is normal in comedy. But the nature of the Crystals is not well written. His desire to kill "Momu" suddenly has no meaning. It looks like a pathetic attempt at humor. Pathetic attempts are not too frequent, and the film proceeds quite well.
