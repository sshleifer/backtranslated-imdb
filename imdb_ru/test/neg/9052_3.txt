An Asian assassin kills victims in Niagara Falls and New York before being hit by a car. Sheila Morris (former Miss Sweden Janet Agren, who received a cheerful double "Southern belle" to show that she is from Alabama) discovers a link between these murders and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatorore) and goes to investigate. This leads her to New Guinea, where she promises a sloppy leadership (Robert Kerman has an American porn star R. Ball) $ 80,000 to help find her sister. Having barely passed through the jungle, full of bloodthirsty cannibals, they finally discover Diana, who is under the control of cult leader Jim Jones, such as Jonas Melvin (Ivan Rassimov). Jonas performs typical insane guru-style acts, such as distributing LSD, initiating group suicide, threatening to kill anyone who disobeys him, and raping Agren with a giant dong soaked in cobra blood. From time to time, the character will look right or left and see a bloody scene shot directly from JUNGLE HOLOCAUST or HUMAN FROM THE DEEP RIVER (both of them were also shot by Lenzi). I am sure that they also use at least two scenes from CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Here we get the expected scenes of killing animals (gutting the abdomen; the natives eat living snakes), as well as some additional nudity and castration. Me Me Lai appears to give her breast implants another workout, playing the widow, who is beaten three times by her brother-in-law far from the ashes of her newly cremated husband. Mel Ferrer appears briefly as a professor, and there is little that is given to him. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with MANGIATI VIVI! You pretty much get a promise fulfilled with all the nudity, blood, dead animals and bad taste that you expect with one of these names, so if you are a scoundrel hound, by all means watch this. Personally, I got sick of it halfway through, and I just wanted it to end. The original (heavily carved) US release in 1985 was named EMERALD JUNGLE to make people think that they actually rented the EMERALD FOREST by John Boorman. He was also called "doomed to die and eat cannibals alive"!
