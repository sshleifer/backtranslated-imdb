This is the first film that I saw from Italian Ed Wood, Demofilo Fidani, also known as Miles Dim. The above title was added unnecessarily later, as there is another film with the same title of 1961, starring Richard Beyshart, which was the only and only hit in the movie “Michael Carreras” Hammer Films; the original Italian name was originally translated as his name was Sam Walbesh, but they called him, although it was in fact WALLACH in the Italian version, which, of course, implies a kind of tribute to Hollywood actor Eli! <br /> <br /> Although, of course, this is not so bad, cases of clumsiness and incompetence abound, and I often start to burst out laughing: a terrible number that an irresistible French singer can bring; completely useless fight in the bar; actors do flips when they are shot; elderly villager performing an impromptu dance; inefficient use (even abuse) of slow motion; and, what is the most ridiculous, to see Gordon Mitchell and Lincoln Tate play two shooters (under the names of actors!) hired by the villain to kill the title character, and then not show them at all in the rest of the film! ! <br /> <br /> Lead actor Robert Woods is not even up to the fact that he clumsily whispered to Amenham over the bodies of his victims. The support of the actress Simonella Vitelli (in fact, the director's daughter!) In the role of the villain’s grandmother is pretty pretty, but unfortunately, she does little in the film ?? despite the change of heart towards the end. The main theme music is actually quite good, but, again, the title song itself is pretty lousy.
