Maybe it was just done in 1997, or maybe someone who managed to raise it to 7 years old would be a weak point for children with AIDS. But really people, maniacal laughter and mayhem during the scene of leaving? Didn't you expect it? I am surprised that there was no child crawling on the ceiling and sick, looking to the camera. The game was fine, of course. But for me, this is just one example of a film from the time when situations and topics can be passed for cinematic language. Things happen, but that's all. There are no glue or motifs that can be detected on the screen, which allows the subject to use pre-existing emotional connections to advance the plot, without a script doing it the way it should.
