May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> An innocent trailer park or maybe a white Compton guy from Los Angeles who witnessed the terrible tragedy of children associated with drugs and violence. Unprofessional, but loyal police partners are trying to remove the "sophisticated" high-class club ring with drugs only to be fired and chewed by expensive drug baronies. The plot thickens, as more and more people return in search of revenge and justice with a predictable end. The only memorable part was the Ron Jeremy walk. <br /> <br /> If I were in the cinema, I would ask for a refund. I feel sorry for the poor actors in this film. It was just awful and painful to watch. Worst of all, the director continued to flash in the same scene, so the sound did not quite match. And NO, it was not a codec or DVD problem, but an intentional technique. Ughh. Two stars
