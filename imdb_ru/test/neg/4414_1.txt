Huge, wriggling, grimacing tree trunks threaten fake "natives" on the Pacific Atoll (suspiciously similar to Southern California ...), awakening haok and revenge. Unlike the stupid stumps in Navy VS The Night Monsters, Tabonga is actually an adult male tree. Well, grown for 2 days: moost od'ed on these spikes Miracle Grow ... In any case, it comes not from hell, but from the grave of the fake native Kimo (Greg Palmer, "Zombie Mora Tau") killed by local elders for communication with these terrible American scientists. Scientists include Dr. William Arnold (Tod Andrews, “Hang them High”, “Under the Planet of the Apes”) and Professor Clark (John McNamara, “The War of the Colossal Beast”). The cast is completed by Linda Watkins (“Parent Trap”) as the abominable Mrs. Kilgore, whose obvious comic relief is caused by the obvious fake accent “cockney”. Truly a star cast !! In any case, because his loose, vacant wife Korea, which Suzanne Ridgway amateur played ("Love's A-Poppin '"), helps him to substitute, Kimo declares his revenge on her and all the elders. Then the American fraudsters uproot the tree, bring it back to life "in the name of science" and allow it to SLOWLY walk around the island, killing everyone who did it wrong. Of course, we all know that evil monsters take away beautiful virgins, so Tabong grabs the brave female scientist Dr. Terry Mason (Tina Carver, “Hell in Frisco Bay”) and leaves with her. A wine ally, a good shot with Remmington hits a knife stuck in Tabong, and he drops dead in quicksand. This ridiculously stupid concept is one of the stupidest screams of all time. Tabonga is probably the slowest monster in the history of the movie, right there with a monstrous, overly-folded robot from Robot Monster Against Aztec Mummy and a perversely slow carpet monster from Creeping Terror. Try not to laugh, watching as the tongong throws fake natives down the slopes and into quicksand, dodges copies, and slowly the log goes around the "island". Unclear writing, wooden ideas and a sharp guide all indicate that this meaty manure has more bark than a bite. This warm pile of wood chips was the last hurray from a longtime editor who was directed by Dan Milner, who quickly disappeared in the well-deserved gloom after this film. First you drive it through the vine from MooCow: “Hell has come” - a classic of compost !! : ??
