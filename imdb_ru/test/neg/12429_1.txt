Something strange is happening in Loch Ness. The water is crystal clear and not cold. Giant plastic monster robot appears and kills the Scots! What is this movie ?! First, I like to read stories about Nessie, sea monsters in general. When I saw this for sale, I thought it was a cheap jaw break. No, it was awful! This story was meaningless, the acting was 100% rubbish, the only positive side was the steep mechanical Nessie, which they used. He was full of inaccuracies, wrong places and all the bad things. Do not waste time, just leave it on the shelf (or trash can) on which you found it. On the second note, this film was shot in Cailifornia, and not in Loch Ness, the main dissess for Nessie fans.
