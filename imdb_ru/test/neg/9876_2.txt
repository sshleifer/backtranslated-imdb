I never read a book. Now I do not really want. I had no idea what this film was about when I went to the theater. I still do not know at what point it should have passed, but I know that a good two hours were wasted from my life. Two precious hours I can never return. <br /> <br /> The storyline was so predictable that it is ridiculous. Werewolves ... or something ... the very plot of Romeo and Juliet. I predicted the end five minutes after the film began. And I was right. <br /> <br /> The game is not terrible. The only two cool characters in the film were the British cousin and hero of Rambo-graphic novel. Other characters too ... the dialogues are very soft and predictable. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst part of the film is the transformation between "people" and "wolves." If you wanted something like Van Helsings, you will be very upset. Imagine a ballerina, a bright light, then a wolf. Yes ... that's all. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this movie. Period. Especially if you read the book because you just want to hit the kids.
