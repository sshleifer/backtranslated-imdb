Sorry, it was a terrible excuse for the film ... the storyline is so full of holes that it looked like a piece of Swiss cheese and a bunch of characters that seemed completely devoid of interpersonal relationships ... Well, except, of course, Carlyle and Lee-Miller, whom I could have sworn I had to fall in love ... Unlike Tyler and Miller's union, which for the most part, like the rest of the film, were completely unconvincing ... although the final product was uninteresting and funny for all the wrong reasons, production values ​​were you juices and deserve some recognition .. but, unfortunately, the end result was rubbish .. what did all the participants think ..? they definitely should have gathered early on this ..
