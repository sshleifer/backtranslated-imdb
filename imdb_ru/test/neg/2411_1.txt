I’m sure I’ve seen FUTURE KILL for the same reason as most people: a stunning poster from HR Giger. And, like everyone else, I was disappointed to find that the film could not fit the poster (Giger said that director Moore really begged him to do it). When I first saw it, at the age of 14, I thought it was the worst movie ever made. I still would have thought that if I had not seen certain films on MST3K since then. <br /> <br /> In the story there is a bunch of annoying college boys who enter the “city of mutants” to kidnap the gang leader for their fraternity. It is then that they meet Splatter (Ed Neal), a mutant / cyborg / psycho who kills the gang leader and accuses him of fraternity as an excuse to track them down and seize power. The rest of the film consists mainly of chase. Many brothers and sisters are trying to escape from the mutant city (which, I think, should be Los Angeles, although it was made in Texas). There are some pseudo-political things about the fact that a boy brothers society is a nuclear weapon, and a mutant society is against nuclear weapons. They talk about how Splatter became a freak because of radiation. For most people, cancer develops due to radiation, but splashes just shoot spikes and kill girls. Yes, it makes sense. At some point, our heroes rescue a mutant girl from two police supporters, and she shows them “how the other half lives.” It turns out that the other half are all punk kids who dance to the bad pop group of the 80s. So our little epic is both stupid and outdated. This is really all you need to do. Stray boys run around in tangled buildings, and guys who look like bikers try to kill them ... Oh, and this is the future. <br /> <br /> I don't think you have any doubts about why Ron W. Moore never made another movie. This thing is an abomination. If you like Giger, buy his books (they have a poster without the horror of the movie), or just look at someone else. “FUTURE KILLING” is a waste of time that no one needs. <br /> <br /> If this description makes the picture sound good, there is another crappy film that does the same thing, only bigger and better: AFTER A NEW YORK. That shit, but it blows FUTURE KILL from the screen.
