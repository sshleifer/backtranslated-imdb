Especially if you like horrible movies. When I first started watching it, all I could say was: “I hope that there is a dance sequence in it”. Imagine my admiration when not only the two main characters dance, but the main ghost, too, began to break dance. And in addition to this, Sherman Hemsley sings a breakdance song (not to mention the theme song). I'm a little sad that he went broke because of this film, but I never liked him as an actor, and he really should have known better. Even the director will not take responsibility for this film (and you should watch some other films that he made!). <br /> <br /> However, one warning, the author seems to be very fond of jokes about the men's lower regions. For example, one of the characters discovered a book called Groin of Dark Species. I am not kidding. And this is for me the most disturbing part of the film. In addition, find the darkest video rental store in your city, take a movie, invite all your friends and laugh until you cry from Ghost Fever.
