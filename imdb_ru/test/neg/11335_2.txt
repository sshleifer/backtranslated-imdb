This film may have become the worst title for the puppet. To some extent appropriate, given the actual fifteen minute content. <br /> <br /> I can do without Schem AD, but I admit that I had a few moments LOL from the two-person comedy that Moe and Larry offered in some new shots (and thank that they tried to give all this, given the position in which they were forced even to create these dogs). <br /> <br /> Another bright spot of this and the last smash of the era of "Unrest in the Ocean" is the decisive absence of screen time for Joe Palma and the back of his head. No attempt to make him talk or clap like a chicken (see “Hot Stuff”) can cost an extra rating point. <br /> <br /> 2/10
