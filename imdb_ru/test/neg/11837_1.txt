I understand that Roger Korman likes to do things cheaply, but it's just sad. I bought this film from a dollar bunker at my local video store a month after seeing the original Carnosaur. I was shocked; It was the same damned movie to which only Corbin Bernesen was added! It reminded me of all those 80s films about ninjas that shot old kung-fu movies and connected to a bunch of white ninjas running behind the wheels with the word ninja written on their bandages , see "Ninja"). Terminator "," Thunderous Ninja "," Black Dragon "and" Ninja Warriors "). Thank you, Roger Korman; You just made me spend a dollar.
