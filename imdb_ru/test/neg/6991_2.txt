I really liked this movie. Of course, the action was flat, there was no conspiracy, and the villain was the lamest whom I saw. Michael Bernardo in the role of Dante deserves laughter in itself, with an incredibly funny phrase and an evil laugh. But it’s worth seeing, just for the worst blast you’ve ever seen outside of the series Power Rangers. You will know it when you see. Honestly, this film should have a budget low-grade porn. I almost stopped looking after an hour, but I recommend looking through it all; at least there is a lot of eye candy for everyone to enjoy. Recommended for viewers with high resistance to bad movies.
