If Jack Black were listed as the lead actor, I would immediately stay away from this movie. Because of this, some of his films look good compared to this film. This film should have been shot as a cartoon for children aged 3 to 8 years, and it would be much better. This is nothing but a bunch of the most stupid parodies from other films put together to create one big mess. The film looks as if it was shot in about one day without any thoughts. In some cases, it may seem that a turning point will come, and the film does have a plot for the film, or at least the storyline will develop, but the stupid parodies inserted simply destroy the entire film.
