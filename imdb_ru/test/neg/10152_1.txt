I'm not even going to comment on which piece of trash this film is, since it has already been created. However, watching this with my friends, we all laughed out loud when the lead girl mentioned Shelly Hack when she spoke on the phone. We sat there, trying to understand why the writer threw it into the mix. We can only assume that he had a fixation of Charlie's Angels at one time. Based on this link, we suggested that this film should be made around her film “Charlie's Angels” in 1979 or 1980, but from what I read here, it was made around 1987. You just can not say it because of poor performance. It seems as if it was made by a college student for a film class. And although I would not in any way expect that a low-budget junk festival like this would be politically correct, the goons in this film would certainly like to send gay pejorative comments to each other. Despite this, I would still consider it the second worst horror movie ever made, second only to the Nails-and-Guns Massacre.
