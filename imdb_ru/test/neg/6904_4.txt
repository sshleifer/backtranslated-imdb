Let's take a look ... a couple of dozens of Gary Larson’s jokes, as well as his style of illustration, perhaps the legally difficult wholesale appropriation of Aardman’s character, more than the generous coloring of the artistic direction from various Pixar films that positively live Lion King-esquire villains is equivalent to an elephant’s cemetery IN THE MIDDLE COUNTRY OF THE FARM, oh, and the stinking joke "Riverdance" ten years after any possible significance. The children (three and five) liked it, but, god, it was a lesson for dad. Another weak attempt by Nickelodean Films to catch hold of an explosion of animation. I really would like them to spend a little more money on character design, rendering, script, director.
