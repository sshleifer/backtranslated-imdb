I watched the nameless version of this film and, as a person who carefully studied the life and crimes of Speck, I must say that this film is an erroneous but ambitious look at the real story. During the filming of the real horror of Speke and the killings, this film makes the following factual mistakes. 1. Speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene, as shown in the film. In fact, he was mostly an alcoholic and a pillmaker who rarely took drugs through a syringe. 2. An Asian nurse who survived the massacre of Spek, did not slip down the stairs and under the sofa in the living room, as shown in the film. That would be impossible. In real life, she hid under the bed, while Speck methodically destroyed his 8 victims. 3. In the film, Speck is depicted cruel and cruel to women as soon as he meets them. Not true. In fact, Speck was at first calm and affectionate, reassuring women whom he was not going to hurt them. So he was able to tie each of them. 4. The real Richard Speck was not the deep thinker the film portrays him. FBI professor Robert Ressler interviewed Speck in the 80s and said that Speck not only did not know why he committed the killings, but was not interested in why, and could not shed light on why. Speck, as it was known, had intelligence below average, and not the king-philosopher who tells this film. If the story were not so tragic and terrifying, the voice-over would have been funny. Overall, Doug Cole's performance is quite menacing and cold-blooded, although I do not think that the real Speck was so much ahead in his violence. No doubt he was a very cruel man when he was under the influence, but he was also known, after all, for being a rather clever con man who could reassure people before pursuing them. Speech by Beverly Ann Sotelo as a surviving nurse is the best in the film. She is a very good actress. If you are squeamish at all, do not watch this movie. This is very clear and alarming.
