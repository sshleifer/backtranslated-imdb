and generally speaking, you will eventually have to explore this little gem. When I describe “I changed my gender” or “Glen or Glenda”, as it is more known, I have to repeat the thoughts of Andrew Smith who hit the head so much when he wrote “If you have not seen any of Ed Wood’s other films incomprehensible experience. If you’ve seen any of Ed Wood’s films, it’s still completely incomprehensible. ” The film is hilarious and tragic, but it still moves with a strange rhythm that leaves no doubt that its author knows and means every word that he utters throughout the entire film. Wood, bless him, had some of the highest ambitions as a director who wanted to promote peace, mutual understanding and even acceptance in the 1950s of all time. When Tim Burton re-created Glen Or Glenda's viewing studio leaders for his biopic, he showed that the leaders laugh and tell each other that this should be put on. After more than fifty years, there are still people fighting to gain such respect, which “normal” takes for granted, so I say that this is certainly not the case. <br /> <br /> No, the real comedy in Glen Or Glenda is the obvious ineptitude that Wood manifests in drawing up his message. Producers often use video footage when they can find those that fit their goals, and can be edited to fit their own frames. Ed Wood indiscriminately used the footage, and a Tim Burton biopic noted this fact as a scene in which Wood, in the role of Johnny Depp, relies on the fact that he can make the entire film from a serial shooting. Unfortunately, the real Ed Wood died before he got a chance, but Glen Or Glenda is the closest he has ever achieved. IMDb claims that twenty percent of this sixty-minute film is still, and it’s never difficult to guess which one. Footage of busy highways flying overhead, weak effects of lightning, soldiers doing their job, they are all used at random, sometimes repeatedly, and they often have only a weak link with the story Wood is trying to tell. If Voodoo had been able to sit back and think about what he was trying to do, it would be impossible to say how high he could have reached. <br /> <br /> Wood himself appears in the film as a title character, a tangled transvestite who imagines himself to be a woman named Glenda. In addition to the bold way in which he tries to express his point of view, Wood makes one disgusting woman. Once on the edge of a society that thinks that I am a “disabled person” and should be “cured” myself, I honestly understood that I hope for the best result for Wood’s character. However, to express his point of view, Wood weaves the tales of two other transvestites. One of them takes an extreme step to undergo a sex change to become a woman, the other is so deprived of the right to vote that he is afraid of being arrested again so much that he commits suicide. The scary thing about this film is that if you edited transvestism and replaced injustices like my position on the autism spectrum, or things like schizophrenia, very little of the film would have to be changed. That's how little society has learned since Ed Wood was a boy. <br /> <br /> Another important person in Glen Ohr Glenda is Bela Lugosi, whom Wood included in the film. The assumption varies depending on Wood’s motives, but the generally accepted theory is that Wood wanted to help revive Lugosi’s career and would do everything to achieve this. Except that he spent the time carefully collecting a good movie. In Glen Or Glenda, Wood uses Lugosi, who is best described in “Flying plates over Hollywood” as “weird.” Lugosi plays a character called “The Scientist”, but more acts as an almighty puppet master. People who have not seen Ed Wood’s films before the biopic’s release will think that Tim Burton invented a speech “beware of the big green dragon that sits at your doorstep.” In any case, Burton restrained what strange speech to use when portraying the dialogue between Wood and Ian. Nothing can prepare you for viewing speeches in their original context, not even Criswell's hilarious rant during Plan 9 "From Space". <br /> <br /> Observant types will also notice the presence of Delores Fuller, Wood's girlfriend at the time. Again, Burton dramatizes his reaction to seeing the script for the first time, while the film portrays it as receiving and far-sighted. I can't help but feel that the image of Burton is more accurate because Fuller looks extremely awkward in his role. She only appears for fifteen minutes, but her birth seems so mechanical, so lifeless, that she somehow manages to appear less talented than her peers, if possible. It is difficult to determine whether Wood’s direction was better focused than usual in this case, but if the ability of the support throw to leave the stars (with the obvious exception of Bela) in the dust is some kind of guide, then this should not happen. Amazingly, Fuller will appear in a very small role in only one other Wood film. The fact that she wrote a few hits, says that she made the right decision to stay behind the camera. Although Wood will again appear in front of the camera, he has never been anything more than a cameo, a walk or a small part. <br /> <br /> I gave Glen Or Glende one of ten. Usually I give this rating only to those films that are so bad that they become interesting as a result. A bold and well-intentioned Glen Or Glenda fits this description of T.
