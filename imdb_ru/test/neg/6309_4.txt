I just saw it again last night and said bluntly: “Style instead of substance”. We can already guess that Jerry Lee to Lewis should have been much larger than what is shown here. The character Jerry Lee Lewis in this film is not portrayed as a real person for one minute for just an hour and a half plus the running time, but, again, all the other characters are just one touch away from being full cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> Let's get started. We see Jerry Lee and his cousin Jimmy Swaggart, sneaking into a black jazz club, and see Jerry getting inspiration. It may be possible. We see two cousins ​​taking different paths of life (also possible). Then we went to Jerry Lee, an adult piano player (Dennis Quaid now plays it), and it's exciting and a little scary. The scene where he first meets his cousin Myra. Since then, it all turns into a summary of some of the events, played in a style suitable for a high-speed news clip. <br /> <br /> It’s not that the film is not too interesting, and it would be great to hear the new versions. of the songs that Jerry Lee made. Alec Baldwin in the role of Jimmy Swaggart is also the reason why you should at least take a look at this, which indicates his great success in the coming years. Winona Ryder as Myra is the most prominent character in the film. She teases, she sobs, she chews the cud and plays coquetry, and that's all. Not for a moment did she explain why she was the third Mrs. Lewis and, speaking of wives, where are the first two? That's why it really cannot be classified as a biopic, but rather an inaccurate news feed. We see Jerry playing his first song on the radio, we see that his second single is in the top ten, we see that his third song is not there. 1 and so on. Then comes the inevitable fall. Absolutely, in reality there is no reason. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, another small altercation: the film unfolds from 56 to 58, and yet Myra says: “I’m only 13” until the very end.
