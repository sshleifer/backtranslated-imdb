This film is similar to many biological films that I have seen: formal, exaggerating, poorly played and, most importantly, occurring too early. <br /> <br /> I mean that this film was shot and for this it came before Michael Jackson was acquitted on charges of molesting minors, which, in my opinion, was one of the most significant periods in Jackson's life and career. This would probably make a great end to this documentary drama. However, this film is already biting off more than it can chew on, cramming too many details into this overly ambitious project. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that Michael Jackson led, perhaps, the most interesting life of all musicians, not to mention the modern modern pop star, today, and his story would probably require six events. For music "to accurately tell. This film tried to say too much in three hours, and, needless to say, it failed. <br /> <br /> Alexander Flex did everything he could by playing Jackson, but he looked more like a SNL caricature from people like Tim Meadows and Amy Poehler. Admittedly, it would be rather difficult to find someone who would accurately portray Jackson without meeting King Pop himself himself and learning his methods of madness. However, with a limited budget, you can only depend on what they see in the tabloids, and they do not necessarily give an accurate idea. <br /> <br /> In addition, the director’s efforts to make Alexander look like Jackson are completely stupid. Caucasian cosmetics on Alexander's face makes him look more like a minstrel show, and everyone who was at the grocery store knows that Jackson’s nose is not as big as Alexander’s. It’s also amazing for me that the film documents that Jackson goes under the knife to do cosmetic surgery, but in the next scene Alexander still has a nose of the same size. This kind of suspension of unbelief that the director expects cannot hold television viewers in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> It was even more distracting when the footage of the real Michael Jackson (that is, the time when he hung his Baby over the balcony in Germany) was interspersed with the movie in real time. It was a good attempt, but it just did not work. <br /> <br /> If this film, as it is, was released in theaters, it would make a profit only because of its stupidity. It even pales in comparison with "Mommie Dearest", and it says a lot. First of all, it was a film that was probably made hastily, like many television films that do not appear on HBO. This could have been done much better if he had just talked about one aspect of Jackson’s life. Even if he only covered the charges of molesting children, it would probably have been done much better and even more intriguing.
