I was on a bad run of films. This is clinker about arson and psychopath. Tom Skerrit, who I really enjoy, was quite young here. He is a builder with a passion, but he has a partner whose profit motive is excessive insurance and burning. This mixture includes an agent who drowned, his daughter and her boyfriend with a loony. James Mason plays an insurance investigator. Any idiot who received a small warning, would know that in the country of Australia something rotten. However, they go astray. The most interesting thing for me was that the huge hotel that was going to be built never went beyond being a bunch of sticks. Low budget, I think. The plot could be interesting. Perhaps they should have hired a film editor (did?). Half the time you do not know where the characters are, but I guarantee that a payment of five million dollars would probably make a careful study of the structure. Does not work. Although there is a lot of neat fire.
