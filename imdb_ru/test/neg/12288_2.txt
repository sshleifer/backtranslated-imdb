Well, I watched this movie when I was very small, and on the day we cleaned the closet, I saw it! .OH MY GOD !!!!! This movie is so damn bad! I never thought that this film could ever come close to my least favorite film, as it was, but I laughed because all the jokes were so trite and ridiculous, not funny !!!! So many things in this movie were funny, because it was SO silly! !!!! This film is not very good. I would say if you want to watch this movie, you definitely do not expect anything big, and if you have already seen it, believe me, I feel your pain too !!!!
