“Bone Snatcher” begins extremely promisingly, with the advent of a new and original type of invisible evil, as well as with the use of an elevatedly isolated filming location in the African desert. While inspecting the pipelines in the desert, three miners are attacked and killed by seemingly non-mundane creatures who devour their flesh and leave only a handful of half-eaten bones. The crew of the expedition, sent to rescue them, discovers that the monster is a mutated queen with an excellent mutation, and soon they are trapped in a strange desert. Directed by Jason Wolfson maintains a respectable level of stress only until the nature of the monster is revealed. Immediately after this, the film quickly turns into an ordinary creature, in which all the characters fall out of the race for survival one by one. The second half of the Thief's Bones is tirelessly boring; with the inevitable cliches of a love story, as well as the complete absence of bloody scenes. All characters are intolerable stereotypes that act and say what you predict in a few minutes. There is a newcomer who has to prove herself, a woman with mental abilities besides her hot appearance, an unpleasant experienced guy who ultimately buys herself through self-sacrifice and ?? last but not least ?? who could have forgotten a wise dark-skinned guy who addresses a monster using various voodoo names. Wolfson is trying too hard to make his monster look like a threat to the alien and predator’s outer space. Ant vision has infrared vision and is showered when shooting in a yawn! The film really just benefits from its unique setting and several hideous images of decomposed bodies. This might be a modest gem, but instead it is less than mediocre. Avoid.
