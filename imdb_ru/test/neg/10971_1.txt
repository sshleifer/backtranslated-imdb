This film takes a lot of liberties with famous historical facts. Even little things like Flynn licking one brand after another, when he would almost certainly use a moisturized sponge, are one of the annoying things. Flynn has never been tried for manslaughter or murder. It is not known that he caught his mother making love with another man, and it is not known that he had homosexual relations with anyone, and he did not end up in a slippery row in Sydney. He did not get his double-half-penny role in “In the footsteps of generosity” from cheating, and this role did not turn him into a well-dressed movie star. <br /> <br /> This is just a mediocre film in which the name Errol Flynn is used to sell more tickets and videos.
