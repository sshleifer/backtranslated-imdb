Not even the “smaller” Hitch, but just a bad movie. Cinematic equivalent of a dirty old man. Ugly in all respects: an unimaginable scenario, a static point of view, putrid clothing, terrible hair, unsightly actors, and one truly unreasonable scene of rape and suffocation. The director's perverse sense of humor is present, but it is not applied consistently; the film comes to life only in its cruelty. Women live especially badly; “Madness” can be used as proof that the director was a woman-hater, although the best explanation for me is that, perhaps, starting with his television series and “Psycho”, which he himself called the economy exercise, the experiment to see is whether the TV crew could take a passable line - Alfred Hitchcock almost abandoned the art and decided to do business. In Rabies, the great master seems to be bowing to conventions, trying to keep up with the times and give the audience what he thinks they want - in the form of unattractive nudity, nudging and general evilness. I do not regret the old man on his vacation, but I do not want to remember him tired, lazy and indulgent - time to look again at "Vertigo"!
