Honest young insurance agent Ronald Reagan (like Eric Gregg) is optimistic, but poor. His wife, the intrigues of Sheila Bromley (as Nona Gregg), craves the best things in life. Describing herself "not burdened with tons of righteousness," Miss Bromley begins to spend more money than Mr. Reagan earns. Bromley gets the best things in life, but puts a couple in debt. Bromley is a fun shrew. <br /> <br /> Handsome Reagan attracts other women, such as the cheerful clerk Gloria Blondel (like Patricia Carmody); but he does not indulge. To pay the bills, Bromley is entangled in an insurance program that helps dismiss her husband. It seems that the unemployed Reagan is tempted in the criminal life - will he stay straight or become crooked? Clinton Rosemond has a nasty "broken arm" scene. <br /> <br /> *** Accidents will occur (1938) William Clemens ~ Ronald Reagan, Sheila Bromley, Gloria Blondel
