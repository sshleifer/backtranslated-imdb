When I say worse, I mean less interesting. Todd Sheets seems to have learned some stupid camera tricks since the last Zombie Bloody Bath, which makes the film even less tolerant. In the last film there were no special effects of the camera, where in this film we got used to the shaky camera and the constant switching to black and white. In addition, it is called Zombie Bloodbath, despite the fact that there are almost no zombies in it. The film begins in 1945, when some Satanists kill a violent robber and expose him as a scarecrow. Nowadays, some children have problems with the car, and they go to the house, to the same house where the satanist was killed. Some mean that people are trying to rape children (or something like that), and they revive a robber stuffed animal who returns with some zombies and now speaks like Darth Vader. Mr Sheets strengthened his tongue and reduced violence. If you want to see what a bad movie is, check it out! <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 96 minutes Not rated, contains violence and language.
