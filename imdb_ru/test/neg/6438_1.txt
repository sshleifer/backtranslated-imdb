This soap is worse than bad: it is poisonous. Of the many television shows that have had a devastating impact on British society over the past twenty years, Eastrenders is a prime example. For two decades, this show marked a prank, a thug, a wide boy, a pie, a bull, a cruel, an incontinent, a criminal, an ignorant, unpretentious ... <br /> <br /> reflect life "?
