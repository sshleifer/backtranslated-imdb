The whole exercise is pointless. Why shoot a movie at all? The lighting is terrible, but the sound is just a joke. Like high school. Whoever budgeted for this film should be drafted and quartered so that it can be created without a proper budget for recording engineers with recording equipment. <br /> <br /> So many dialogues cannot be understood due to losses in the echo or lack of proximity to the microphone. Savings should have been made in any other area. The whole performance is lifeless and just LAME with such an amateur half-explored performance. He lacks warmth, clarity and no design.
