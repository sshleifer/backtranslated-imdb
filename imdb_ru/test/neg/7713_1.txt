I am angry! Much time has passed since the last zombie film that I watched, so I was looking forward to the opportunity to watch a good zombie film. HoTD2 was a big disappointment. Reasonable story, but terrible game, shooting, dialogue and nauseous cliches and raisins. I have not even seen the first one, which is supposedly worse than this ... now I am curious how bad it could be! The film is full of mistakes and stupidities. Who on earth is analyzing DNA using a blood sample!? Why are these "special forces" who "were in hell and back" fighting like spoiled 6-year-old girls? We see ferocious zombies who at every opportunity get a bite, and then hundreds who wave their hands to our two “heroes”, knock them off their feet and then let go without a single scratch. I could go on and on about it, but life is too short, and I have already spent a couple of hours watching this pathetic film, which is an insult to the film industry.
