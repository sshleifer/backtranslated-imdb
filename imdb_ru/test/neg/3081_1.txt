From what I remember seeing this film, it was not good. I always say that if the film is good and can hold your attention in the most difficult moments (for example, the war with Tylenol Cold & Sinus), then this is the film that did its job. The fact that I slept most of this film only proves the fact that he could not hold my attention, and therefore he did not do his job. Why did I become a victim of Tylenol Cold & Sinus when there was a film in my arsenal? <br /> <br /> Starting with Committed makes no sense. The game was bad, and the overall story left more doors that simply could not be closed. I think about the moment when I swear I saw Affleck and Graham (brother and sister in this film) kissing. It makes no sense. Then there was the scene with Affleck and his roommates, who indicated that he was sleeping with one of them, almost parting with the perfect pair of lesbians. I suppose it should have shown that most are not as committed to relationships as Graham, but for me it was just a filler. I have such a suspicious feeling that the director of this film was sleeping with Affleck. His play in this film was fierce. I mean, I never saw him do a “good” game, but it was the worst. Oh, I just remembered another moment during the battle, and I confirmed it on IMDb.com ... what did John Stewart do in this film? It was another moment when my eyes opened for a moment in one of those battles that seemed to last forever. <br /> <br /> And frankly, this is Heather Graham - after a while we could care less about her, She’s just not interested - she’s just boring, boring, and after a while she stops acting. Although they are desperately starting to throw wacky characters into the mix in order to revive the film, it just doesn’t work, and instead of just calling it by day, they start adding more characters to the mix, so now it's just weird, tiring, boring for really, really long Slow playing style of Luke Wilson slows down an already creeping movie to a complete stop - why exactly these two were married? Committed is a really awful movie - a kind of “fashion comedy” that makes you dazed and oppressed. <br /> <br /> Rating: * out *****
