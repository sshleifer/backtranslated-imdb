Skip this Hollywood version, a real piece of trash. A cheap insult to the ingenious original of "Spoorloos" or the English title, also called "The Vanishing". It is completely inconsistent with the typical, grotesque Hollywood fashion, usually because of the many incompetent corporate beans counters who have no vague idea of ​​anything artistic, they are simply looking for a "successful formula" and want it to apply to everything to make a profit. Just like the terrible “Scarlet Letter”, created in 1995, which so strongly distorted the original story to satisfy the crowd of McDonalds, which became an aberration, not even a bastardization, but a bunch of gangster form, similar to a similar form but does not look, does not feel does not even resemble the spirit of the original. In addition to that film, at least, was Gary Oldman, who is fun to watch in everything he does. This dog fails, even the usually very talented Jeff Bridges is embarrassing. The great tragedy should not and should never be “the film of the well-being of the year”, but rather removes one or several sad, too frequent tragic events in life and allows the reader / viewer to comprehend and understand the human condition. <br /> Do yourself a big favor if you are looking for a rental, skip this grotesque trash and collect the original, made in the Dutch-French collaboration in 1988. This is a great movie. This is a terrible mess.
