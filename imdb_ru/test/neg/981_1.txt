I was complementary to this film, taking it off at the airport in the first 15 minutes or so; I was one of the fugitive (mostly Mexican) Bangladeshi refugees running along the runway at Ryan Field in Tucson. At some point, standing in the circles of our turbans, while we were waiting for the next shot, one of my fellow extras turned to me and asked what would happen with this step. I told him that this would be a remake of Lost Horizons, just like a musical. There was a long pause, then he replied: "Man, this film will suck." Quite astute of him, I thought. I had a good time and made some money, but even with some interesting personal memories associated with this film, I can’t come to terms with it. <br /> <br /> If you have ever seen the movie “Swarm”, you can pretty much get the idea. You see how many famous and talented people lose the idea that at first glance it’s just BAD. It seemed that if you throw enough money into a movie and hire big names, then a good story and good writing are not needed. Just turn the large knob and you will receive the product. It's just not worth watching.
