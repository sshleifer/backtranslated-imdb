"Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels ..." he said. Just don’t expect anything like “Devil Went Down To Georgia” when old Charles Sorta says one song about Whiskey Mountain (yes), and that’s all for lyrics. Hi, though, fans of rape scenes will enjoy the installation of Polaroid (my used copy is classified as FAMILY), and who do not like the never-ending scenes with rednecks who are staring at cute girls? Because of the decoration of the film, the film looked damn stranger than before, with the promise of “you can lose your life or your mind!” But basically these are two couples who wander around the sticks and “behave” naturally. I love this hermit.
