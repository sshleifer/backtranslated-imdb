Mexican werewolf in Texas is located in the small border town of Farlow, where Anna lives (Erica Faye), her best friend is Rosie (Martina Hughes) and she has a Mexican guy named Miguel (Gabriel Gutierrez) who is determined to track down the beast that terrorized the city by killing livestock and several residents, including some of their friends. Local Mexican legends speak of Chupacabra, an evil creature from myths and legends. Hmm, I'm struggling right now, because there really isn't that much else ... <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Scott Maginnis. I will not fight about the bush here and just say that the Mexican werewolf in Texas is terrible period. In the script, only the word "werewolf" is mentioned only once, and the rest of the time it is referred to as "chupacabra", in fact, I suspect that it was not meant to be a click of a werewolf. The “Werewolf” creature looks mostly hairless and looks more like some angry dog, there is no mention of someone changing during a full moon, and it does attack during the day a couple of times, the transformation scene is absent and at the end, when she is killed, he does not turn into anyone. Honestly, apart from the name, there is nothing here that could indicate the film The Werewolf in general, and even then the name is just a plagiarism of the very popular American Werewolf in London (1981). This is the type of house shit that I personally think is killing the horror genre, how much time has passed since the real low-budget horror classic, such as Dawn of the Dead (1978), The Evil Dead (1981), Halloween ( 1978) or on Friday of the 13th (1980), which were all made on shoe shoelaces, maybe The Blair Witch Project (1999), but this is all in recent years, because the Mexican werewolf in Texas has absolutely no chance ever be considered a classic. The characters are terrible, and things just happen around them, the dialogue is rubbish, the moves are terrible, the story sucks and actually sends me to sleep, and in general this film is just crap, sorry, but I don't know how else to describe it. <br /> <br /> Directed by Maginnis does nothing to make it watchable, there is an annoying manual cinematic camera that can easily give someone a headache and quickly “blink and you miss something”, editing that just annoying and annoying in equal measure. It's not scary, there is no nudity, no tension or atmosphere, and special effects are terrible. The monster really looks poor, and it is not surprising that Maginnis is keeping him in the shadows or cutting his scenes so quickly that you never look at him. In the picture there is almost no color, it is either almost completely black, or over saturated desert sand oranges, which makes this thing also painful. The blood consists of several fake guts (blink, and you will miss them!), A few bloody wounds and a severed arm, a big deal. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 300,000, I admit that the budget was low, but I just refuse to admit that to create such a trash movie, there are many low-budget horror films that make their meager budgets go far . It all looks like a home movie, it has no style, and is easy to watch. The game also sucks, although you probably already knew about it. <br /> <br /> A Mexican werewolf in Texas is likely to force several people to rent / buy / watch it, because they may mistakenly think that this is a continuation of the John Landis classics, which is probably not the case, and it is not even real click of a werewolf. Do not be fooled, this is terrible, and I am fed up with the need to spend time / money on homemade amateur shit like this.
