“Tamara” just felt like another teen-oriented, knockout trend “I know what you did last summer” and it is painfully boring. An outcast from high school who is fond of witchcraft and black magic is accidentally killed during a cruel rally played by a group of hooligans who secretly bury her in the forest promising not to tell anyone. The next day, supposedly "dead" Tamara, comes to school with a completely new image, seduces her potential killers and takes a little revenge ... This is basically a combination of "Carry", "Crafts" and any other straightforward video, a tiny turkey, which our days is on the shelves. The actors are absolutely brutal and look ten years too old to impersonate high school students. There is some blood that is not really that interesting, because the film is so boring and I could not wait for it to end. If you like modern garbage, then I insist that you find it, otherwise do not worry ...
