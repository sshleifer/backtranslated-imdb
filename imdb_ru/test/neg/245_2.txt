The first 2/3 of this film did not differ from the American films about the mummies of the 30s and 40s. Two lovers in ancient Mexico dared to defy the law and were doomed to death. One became an Aztec mummy, whose job was to guard the sacred treasure and love its lady. And the lady was reincarnated these days, and her mother naturally attracted her. So far this is all a typical film about a mummy ... although it is a bit slower and more boring than the American versions. Oh, and of course the Aztec mummy looked very, very trashy. <br /> <br /> However, in this standard, but boring film, there is a supervillain. What for? I don't know - it definitely didn't make sense to have one. This villain seems to want treasure, and he manages to hypnotize the lady and make her show them where the Aztec treasures are buried. Why does he need treasure? Well, to buy the equipment needed to create an army of atomic robots, dummy! But first he must build a single mummy to defeat the mummy, since the mummy is still impossible to stop. <br /> <br /> You should see these “human robots”, which look like huge, awkward robots from Flash Gordon and other TV shows, BUT they have the rubbery head of the supposed dead guy inside! They really look funny and ridiculous, and after the final battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot, you should look at the battle. Both are fighting in super-slow motion, as if they are bathed in toffee ... and this is done in such a simple-minded and stupid way that it will surely cause a chuckle - certainly not a thrill. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is terribly boring and confusing - especially at the end. However, for bad movie fans, this is a must-see - this is bad, but it is unintentionally funny and pleasant to watch and laugh at friends.
