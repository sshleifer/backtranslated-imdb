Should it be serious? I hope not. This is one of the most pathetic and fun movies I've ever seen. Given that I took him to the shelf "Bad Movies", he certainly justifies his place in the store. What can I say, the bloody effects are scattered (pun intended) everywhere, some look very real, some look like a teddy bear that had an accident with a bottle of tomato sauce. Music is one of the most horrible I have heard, acting is one of the funniest elements ... should I continue? Do not worry if you have not seen all the other pathetic horror films in the store, and thatâ€™s all that is left.
