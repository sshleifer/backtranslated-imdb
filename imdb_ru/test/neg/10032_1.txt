I went into a bookstore in Brentwood, Tennessee. I am not going to give a name because I am a loyal customer. I was pleased with every item I bought there before. In the window in front of the store was the “Ghost Bell Tower”. (I can mention that this is the only store where I saw it for sale.) I heard about this story somewhere and remembered that it had to happen for real. I was very excited and couldn't wait to watch it. I had high hopes for that. I could not believe what I saw when I looked at it. It was not like a real movie. It was like a home video. I got the impression that it should be a horror movie. I mean, the movie was supposed to be a witch story about you. This is not a horror movie. You do not jump off your seat while watching this movie. I gave the film every chance in the world to get better as it went along. I swear I did. It never got better. There were several episodes when this little child threw poop and urine at him. I did not find this interesting at all. I watched the entire movie with a disbelief that the store would really sell it to me. I think this is how bad this economy is. I have to say this to the cast and crew. Do not show this film as material for other jobs. Do not do that. I mean it sincerely. I recommend you for a try. For people who bought it. I say this. Do not sell your copy to anyone. They can be very upset. Have a nice day, everyone.
