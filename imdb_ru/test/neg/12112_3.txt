This movie is bad. I have seen priced and unrated versions. They are awful !! Now, I know what to suggest that low budget, Spiderman porn parodies, but Spiderbabe is simply not good to be bad-good. It's not funny! Not at all funny !! I wanted to laugh. I tried to laugh. But this film let me down. At least the unrated version has a lot of nudity. And this is me, because Mundae is not a very beautiful woman. With a waist, she is fine, but on the way up she leaves much to be desired. She looks good in this school clothes. Please, if you want to watch this gossip, rent it. Evaluation or no rating, in fact, does not matter, they are both bad for me!
