The "King" of James Marsh is a film that misleads me. I can not think what it is intended for. This is a story about a young man named Elvis, played by Gael García Bernal, who gets an honorary dismissal after 3 years of service in the Navy, and then goes in search of his biological Father and behaves dishonestly with him and his family. Actually, this is all pretty bad. Elvis sneaks into the family, seducing his 16-year-old sister, Mahleri ​​(Pell James). From here, in Central England, it is impossible to identify with anyone in this film. Father preacher and cheerful, joyful Christian congregation; I could not understand whether the film was intended to ridicule them for their thoughtless beliefs. Or the goal is a happy family, and we must think that this is not viable. OR it just says that some people are lost and just damn prone to destruction. It is petty. We all know that bad things happen; It is interesting to know why, but this film simply portrays violence for free, without unraveling the thinking that led to it. "King" - such a missed opportunity. There are some really interesting questions about honor; Warrior Code; changing notions of valor; Honest killings in Indian families and so on. Honor is a very diverse concept. But this film simply adds nothing to the concept. However, Paul Projectionist did more than his meager role suggests. The DVD projector showed all the movies in green, and the only way to fix it is to send it to Belgium. He did it for Christmas. I think that those postal workers and repairmen and Paul went far beyond the call of duty, and this grim film was our reward. But could you see it differently?
