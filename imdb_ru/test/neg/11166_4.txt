Korea’s response to “I know what you did last summer” follows the same route as its American counterpart: a year after a group of school friends accidentally killed a classmate, the masked killer starts picking them one by one. Who could have seen them that night — or was their “victim” still alive when they threw him into the sea? <br /> <br /> No one can expect originality from the genre of the teenage slasher, but efforts can be made. to movies of this type were entertaining and scary. “RECORD” is neither one nor the other, in which poorly paraphrased scenes from “I know ...”, “House on the female row” and “Faculty” (among many others) were mutilated and failed to achieve one decent shock 95 minutes. > <br /> Acting with dignity from the actors, who seem to be the norm in Korean cinema, approach the boring scenario with pleasure and undeserved enthusiasm. The direction is, at best, mediocre; a strange choice of camera angles and the suit of the worst killer * EVER, contributing to the fall of the RECORD. The most disappointing is the end of the film, where the two "unexpected turns" are obvious: you previously rejected them as too glaring! <br /> <br /> RECORD's only saving grace is a bright beginning - the first act is really excellent and shows American colleagues how characters and moods should develop - but, besides that, this is a very bad movie. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
