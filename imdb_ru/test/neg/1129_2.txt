Obviously, with this film going straight to DVD, I did not expect much, but this film is so funny that it is unbelievable. The only part of the movie you can actually find funny remote is before they get to the island, where Eddie’s son is thrown from the bathroom by a stream of water, and that’s it! Why do they even bother? The first Christmas holidays with Chevy Chase were brilliant and fun. Is not. They rely on jokes about dogs with flatulence, as well as a character named Uncle Nick, who is about 80 years old, and he is trying to get through to beautiful women. When they approach the island by boat, the island in the background just looks so fake, and Randy Quaid, albeit funny in the previous film, just replays and it seems that he is trying too hard to be funny. You have been warned!
