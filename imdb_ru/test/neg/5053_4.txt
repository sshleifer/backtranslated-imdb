I did it about halfway through this film, and at that moment I realized that I absolutely didn’t care how it ended. In fact, I watch a comedy with an obscene teenager, because I like Helen Mirren, who is actually very good as an incredibly cruel teacher. <br /> <br /> The main idea of ​​the film (or, say, the first half of the film, since I don’t know - or don’t worry - how the second half goes) was done before, especially at 9-5, and the comparison between the two shows how carefully Tingle does it wrong. You should feel that everything is getting out of control in such a way that you feel that events are inevitable, and you need well-defined, interesting characters that you care about, and you do not have them. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but he never captured me for a second.
