Boy, this movie is bad. And not in a good, cheesy, fun. Even MST3K could not stop him from being boring, and it also confuses when everyone gets out. But the most annoying part of this dismal mess is Ireland's disgusting high voice, which I got tired of listening in the first five minutes. Not to mention how truly unattractive her character is. Even her dad ran away and left her! Honestly, I understand why. If he had to listen to her whine with her voice of a mouse for more than a few minutes, he would be tempted to cause her great harm. Like me, by the end of the movie. Plus, it is useless and annoying. When she fell into a long hole in the land a la Alice in Wonderland, she would have been ready for the first ten minutes, if this inexplicable Australian accented miner did not save her from all the various disasters she continued to fall into, He had to just tie it to the atlantic version of the track and get it over with. And this Atlantis is underground with a strange, confusing obsession with bone density, I have to ask, where did the light come from? Did they have generators that mimic the sun? Regardless of. In any case, there is no real conspiracy, just a bunch of oddly dressed Gothic imitators running around trying to catch Katie (probably so they can silence her). Stupid, meaningless movie. Thank you Golan Globus, for this cinematic abomination. Let you burn in the seventh ring of hell for all eternity.
