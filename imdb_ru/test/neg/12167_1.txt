I really hated this movie, and this is the first movie written by Stephen King, which I did not finish. I was really disappointed, it was the worst shit I've ever seen. What were you thinking, making three hours of it? It may be a good story, but the actors? Not. Suspense? Romance? Horror? Not. He did not have anything. <br /> <br /> He has this weird, crazy scientist with Einstein's hair, a classic thing. Not at all. And the man is getting younger all the time. Looks like they just used the name of Stephen King to make a shitty, too long movie, in which there is nothing exciting. <br /> <br /> I give this film "1 (terrible)". If they had like -5, I would probably take it instead. It was a waste of time.
