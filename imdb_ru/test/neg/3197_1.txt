I watch this horrible movie while we talk. perhaps this is one of the worst films ever made in my house. I am sitting here with 3 friends, and they agree. it's not scary. it's not funny. it is not dramatic. there is nothing attractive in it. we are 49 minutes in the movie. we only saw 2 critters. only one person died. this film is one big disappointment. nothing about this horrible, horrible movie made me want to watch everything else. I get the movie to hang. I hope that everyone who has had anything to do with the creation of this film is dying. I mean not only actors. I mean the director, producers, presidents from the studio that financed this film. It is fully, the worst movie ever. this should make IMDb the worst 100 movies of all time. at number 1.
