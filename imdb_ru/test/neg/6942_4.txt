Marlene Dietrich is gorgeous, like Concha Perez, a temptress who drives all men to despair in Joseph von Sternberg’s film The Devil Is a Woman. Her performance has nothing to do with "acting" in any generally accepted sense of the word, but she is heating up, a real star, fully owning her material. But she is the only good thing in the film (it is so good that it makes you watch this perch; I doubt that any other actress could do the same). <br /> <br /> History is a terribly lame melodrama (of course Pierre Louis’s novel was better) in which the immoral Concha Dietrich ruins the lives of two friends played by Lionel Atville and César Romero, with rigidity bordering on petrification. And for von Sternberg, this is an ugly film (perhaps, according to its rather ugly plot). Buñuel, on the other hand, thought about it enough to turn it into “That unclear object of desire” with more emphasis on the surrealistic aspects of all of this, to the point that two different actresses played the same role. None of the films is the best time of the director, and although the version of “Bunuel” may be the best movie, this is the “performance” of Dietrich that you remember.
