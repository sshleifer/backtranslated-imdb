This is truly one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. Rod Steiger, who stars the grandfather Orneri, Charlie, completely replays, hoping that the brighter he is, the better his performance (sound of Cue Buzzer). Rod Steiger is one of the last true legends about the film, and to see him in this film (although “The End of Days” is the second worst film I have ever seen) is really heartbreaking. From a bad storyline to a non-existent direction, it becomes quite obvious that the only reason this film was shot was that the producer’s name ended in DeLaurentis. The only good thing about this movie is that it’s so bad, it’s really hysterical. Look at the retrospective scene, where Rod, where is Jor-El is a wig from Superman and a big black mustache. One can only hope that his subsequent film “I Believe in America” from Uber producer Kevin Arbwe will buy it out and leave good taste on everyone’s lips.
