When a group of businessmen starts dying in the presence of the mysterious Mr. Coulon, FBI agent Dick Martin is assigned to this case. As mortality continues to grow, Mr. Martin is obviously not very successful. By the end of the film, a strange truth is revealed, which I will not disclose here. <br /> <br /> One of the other users comments on this: "This is a classic film, and it should be ENJOY rather than chose." Sorry, but I must respectfully disagree with this opinion. meaning that it is old, not in any way related to its quality. I liked a lot of low-budget films of category “B” from about that time, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Stepping is unbearably slow, work the camera is pretty soft, most of the acting is pretty wooden (in my opinion, even Lugosi is not very good in this), and the plot, though it has an interesting premise, it seems difficult very difficult to understand.
