“While episodically exciting (including a few truly tender moments) and humorous, the obvious homemade satire hammer“ Returning Home ”comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilled. With such material, time is everything (Michael Moore knew to release Fahrenheit 9/11 before the 2004 election), and the real tragedy of Dante’s film is that it did not come out 2 years ago when his message would carry energy which further fueled dissidents. In 2006, the mockery of the Trustworthy Bush Administration hardly looks as ambiguous (or endangered) as it was then. "<br /> <br /> Honestly, anyone who could convince of anything with the focus of a zombie, has dubious intelligence. <br /> <br /> and if you didn't notice, Michael Moore did not help defeat Bush. <br /> <br /> There was nothing exciting about this movie. I just disgusted with how frank and stupid the film was, it was painful to watch. if you are going to do something like that, you need a little wit. Unfortunately, this is not. a poorly made satire actually has the opposite of the intended effect. as they say, with friends who need enemies.
