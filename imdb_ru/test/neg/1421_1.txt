This refers to one of the most pathetic, predictable and poorly played films I've ever seen. Clint Eastwood has never been worse, never seen someone less convincing on the screen. I laughed at him all the way through. In addition, there is some romance between him and the gorgeous Rene Rousseau, which was even more pitiful than the one between Mr. Connery and Miss Zeta-Jones in The Capture. <br /> <br /> One IMDb user asked a question: What's not to love about this movie? I ask: what do you like about it? And the answer is: John Malkovich. He is an absolute genius and probably the best villain in the movie (he even saved Con Air, you know). But that's all. <br /> <br /> This film is called “In Line of Fire”, but “Bodyguard 2: Robbery” seems to be a more appropriate title. See only if you are a fan of John Malkovich. Otherwise, avoid at all costs. * 1/2 (out of five)
