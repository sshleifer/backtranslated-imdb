Most of the comments on this board revolve around discussing the validity of some comparisons with R DOGS made on the DVD cover. Forget about all this ... This movie ... a home movie is absolutely terrible. How can anyone with a shred of credibility claim that it is 10/10? No plot, no. I could not believe that I spent the money to rent it (more on this later), and that I deceived myself by believing that this (based on the artistic design of the box and some kind of film festival advertising) has potential. The only thing I really remember is that, incredibly, one of the annoying main characters was allegedly shot in the head with a bullet ... and he eventually survived the injury and got to the final credits alive. Wow. And my goodness, the Killers have a sequel. Double ear. <br /> <br /> True story - in fact, I was in so much denial that I wasted my money and vitality on this rent that I kept the video for what should have been six months. I kept telling myself that this never happened. The video on TV was an illusion — a mental symbol of my self-loathing. After someone indicated that this was true and that I needed to get control, I decided that I could not just leave it there. I thought, “How many others do I deny the suffering associated with watching this masterpiece, accumulating Killers for myself?” I had to do the right thing and return it to the hell from which it came. <br /> <br /> So, I suppose most of IMDb would have done this, I had the courage to go to the video store ... at 2 am. After making sure that there was no one around, I got out of the car (still working, of course), put the film in the slot with a hinged lid and booked to never return. <br /> <br /> I guess I expected some assholes from the Hollywood Video corporation to look for me (by that time the bill should have been about $ 1238.67), so I left the area. However, by coincidence, just like the Killers storyline, nothing happened.
