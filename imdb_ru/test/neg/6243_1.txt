I hate it when people in the cinema speak from the screen. This is one of the main reasons why I stick to a DVD or video. I saw “Clearing” on DVD, but if I saw him in the films, I would have to stand up and shout “IT'S NOT DEATH, YOU ARE THE MORON!” <br /> <br /> “Clearing” is another one in the long list of terrible movies with Mr. Redford. Legal eagles, Havana, indecent proposal, close and personal, sneakers, the last lock and spy game. If Robert Redford told me to invest in something, I would go the other way. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing you can do for an audience is. Let's say you were kidnapped, and your kidnapper has a gun. He keeps it on most of the film. You turn the tables on him and start choking him. Whatever you do, continue to choke him while he is DEAD! Do not choke him for ten seconds. Stay with it! Ten minutes at least. But Bob stops too soon, leaves and forgets about Mr. the abductor, until ....... He gets up, finds the gun and again holds it with our hero. At that moment I wanted Mr. Kidnpper to shoot Robert Redford. More than a few times. And I also wanted to shoot him.
