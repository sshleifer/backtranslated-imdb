Why do I hate it? Let me list the ways: <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Mary Pickford, but a 32-year-old woman playing a 12-year-old child is just stupid. <br /> <br /> There is a fight scene in which children throw bricks at each other, and this is considered funny - and this lasts for 15 minutes <br /> <br /> It is strange that none of the children get even a distant injury. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of racial and ethnic spots on the title cards. <br /> <br /> For the "family" movie, the fights were TOO cruel (I liked it when Pickford beat them out with a little boy!) and the humor was just stupid <br /> <br /> Seriously, after 40 minutes I gave up and turned it off. Dirt, racism and small children throwing bricks at each other got to me. Also there was no conspiracy that I could see. The only thing worth seeing in this film was William Haynes, who was the lead man in the era of silence. <br /> <br /> Just hurt. Avoid.
