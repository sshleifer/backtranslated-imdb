Over the course of three quarters of an hour, the story gradually develops in the direction of a certain turning point. Although it is overloaded with scenes that seem to be meant to dull the viewer and distract him from the real plot, something happens. It is not so much, and it is certainly not obvious. The combination of palace impressions and plot scenes does not add depth or understanding to the whole character. In fact, they keep them in a sterile state, since character development does not occur at all. Everyone just turns around and centers around his cliché and role - a sweet, slightly stubborn girl; combat überwoman, snobbish aristocrat. The lead man seems to have no differences at all, he is superficial, which in fact does not even matter, because he was only there, because the storyboard required him - it seemed that he was on vacation and was caught up. When the moment comes when you need to turn the corner in terms of what is happening, the film first freezes for a few minutes and then becomes ridiculous. She decides — or rather, dissolves — herself with the help of Deus Ex Machina, more clichés and some of the roughest plot techniques and options I've ever seen. This is a story, good. At first, the film is a drama, although it should be comedic, and then it turns into a farce. The main characters do what is expected of them, and no surprises. The first set of several serious antagonists, however, is replaced by a pair that literally just missed you. Maybe it was a nod to the audience. <br /> <br /> This film does not receive any bonus from me either for its philosophical significance (since it does not exist), or for its technical realization. The animation and editing is honest, as is the sound mixing; but it is by no means outstanding or even higher than the average Japanese production of the late 1980s. In fact, visual effects seem static, not inspired and not original. <br /> <br /> Worst of all - it does not entertain at all, even if you are not worried about the characters and so on. There is too little, but at best everything is trite. Instead, take the real Ghibli, give them a feast and keep your fingers away from it.
