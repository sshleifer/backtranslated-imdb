Yes it's true. This movie is a terrible piece ... you know what. Almost all fans of Sapkowskiâ€™s books in Poland think the same. The truth is that Polish cinema cannot afford to make fantastic films. It's a shame when you compare, for example, Vidzmin and Conan the Barbarian. I hope that no one outside of Poland will ever see this nightmare.
