8 days without a script, this is what the DVD tells you how the movie was made. It is captured in a blurred video, which is sometimes used for good effect, but it is really partially nude women who sit in the room most of the time. It works very well, and it helps a lot. But the killer only appears once for a long time, and the girls / women sit and joke that they donâ€™t try to escape or do something too interesting, so it all stops in about 20 minutes. It would be a good short, maybe even powerful. Even for eight days they do very little. What for? Because they did not have a script. How many films were shot without a script. Not so much. I wonder why this is so? How many good films were shot on bad scenarios. Not so much. Why? Working against this major problem, management tries and does some interesting things, but with the fact that nothing is. Topless girls filmed in a dark, grainy, colorless video are sitting idle, for some time they will make some people move, but not for a short one, but for too long. The actors deserve praise again if there was a script. <br /> <br /> In addition, the video quality or lack of it is really low, they try to use it with advantage, and sometimes some shots look like they are from Miami Weiss, a recent film that exists. But it is not intended to compliment Miami Vice or it is a bad enterprise.
