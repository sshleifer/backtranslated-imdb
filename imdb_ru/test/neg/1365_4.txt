I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of satanic horror films, and, in fact, I seem to love them less and less every time I see a new one, and it is not surprising when I end up watching movies like the Brotherhood of Satan ! Despite the low IMDb rating, I was surprised to hear something good about this film, and my expectations grew. This turned out to be a big mistake, since this particular film assumes its rating, namely, very bad! The plot is your main group of Satanists, which creates problems, and we are focused on a small town where people are being killed and abducted, and it’s not quite clear why. Naturally, Satanists are behind this, and this is bad news for a mother, a father, and a daughter who are on a car trip and are in a mysterious city. I had the feeling that this film could be in the same vein as the shitty Satanic film “Devil Rain”, and although it’s not as dumb as Robert Fouest’s later film, it’s not much better. The plot seems rather mundane, but it is also rather boring, and I cannot say that I liked it at all in this film. The brotherhood of Satan obviously has his fans, but I am not one of them; This is a film that I see no reason to recommend ...
