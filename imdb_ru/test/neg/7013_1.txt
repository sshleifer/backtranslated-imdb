Lucille Ball tries to look 30 years younger than it really is, in this bad excuse for a musical. <br /> <br /> The film presents the worst choreography that has ever existed in the world, with the constant threat that Lucy can enter the song. her bourbon voice at any moment. Lucyâ€™s lack of talent as a singer and dancer will drown the film before it can begin, and apart from loyal fans of Lucy, this is unlikely to please. Bad costumes and delicate decorations do not help. Another proof that Lucy was not good at anything but making stupid faces. <br /> <br /> Directed by Gene Sachs.
