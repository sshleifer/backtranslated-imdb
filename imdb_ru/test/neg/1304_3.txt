Digital effects were made cheaply and the sequence of actions lacked anticipation. It was essentially made for television, and it shows. David Suchet looks boring, and Nigel Glider looks down in embarrassment! As for the London accent of Dick Van Dyck Robert Carlisle, no comment! If you want to pass an hour or two, when you have nothing, it will do. If you are going to buy a DVD, wait a few weeks and take it to the shopping basket at Asda, because that’s where it goes! If the budget were bigger and Richard Doyle’s book followed more closely, it could have been something special, but in its current form it is a bit poor. Watch the trailer instead! Or read a book and see what could be.
