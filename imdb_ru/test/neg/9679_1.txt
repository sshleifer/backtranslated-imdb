I saw biblical trash. This is one of the best. Worse, it lasts about three hours. A terrible waste of time if you do not want to compare the biblical knowledge of your child with countless deviations. Do yourself a favor - take a stroll through the Sahara instead. Since I have to give you ten lines on why not to watch this film, let me say that there is absolutely no quality to be returned. The conversations of God with Noah are ridiculous. All of this has the stench of "let's make a bible story looking backward." The basic logic is: if they spent money on a biblical film, why not make it worthwhile? Since the basic logic is not respected, something is wrong. The film begins with a disclaimer of Poetic licenses ... it is an understatement of the century. Poetic rape. But then the poetic would be an undeserved favor.
