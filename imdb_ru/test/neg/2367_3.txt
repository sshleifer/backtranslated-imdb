Not a single 2007 exit was really bad, and if this is the way to fight, they choose the wrong way. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit and hardy guys from MVP and Minna: in my opinion, it was the best match at night a good fight, but not much. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Open Heavyweight Championship (which won Chavo Guerrero): terrible, no flights at all, really fast and boring. 3/10 <br /> <br /> little bastard and Finley, a little scary character and a scary character: it was more like a comedy than a fight, some laugh. 5/10 <br /> <br /> Kane de King Booker: these two worthy efforts, but they can do better. 6/10 Team Championship wwe tag: Paul London, Brian Kendrick, deuce and domino: another boring match, flying champions is not high. 4/10 ecw world title champion Mr. Kennedy def bobby lashley (disqualification): in my opinion, the worst match of the night. really terrible. I thought ecw had no rules, I was wrong 2/10 <br /> <br /> John Cena and Sean Michaels, Batistaâ€™s defender and the undertaker: a good match, but perhaps he would be much better. 6/10 <br /> <br /> In general, these were bulls
