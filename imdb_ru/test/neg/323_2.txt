Ugh. Pretty awful. <br /> <br /> Linnie Quigley gets the best bills, but her character doesn't matter much. Who is her character anyway, aunt of a little boy? Another user commented on her undressing in the shower. Although there was a shower scene in the film, it was a shot in the head and shoulders. Perhaps there are several alternative versions of this movie. <br /> <br /> Quigley has a bigger role than John Carradine, Cameron Mitchell and Brinke Stevens, though. Carradine appears for a short time in a monastic robe, reading a vague dialogue. There are no other characters on the stage with him, although he seems to be arranged, otherwise there are shots over his shoulder, which undoubtedly belong to someone else. There is also a really bad photo of him in the cameo medallion (it looks like a bad photocopy) and a decent photo of him in the family bible. Initially, he conjured up Jack-O or something like that. <br /> <br /> Cameron Mitchell briefly appears on television as a leading horror. Brinke Stevens in the film, which he shows "Coven", in which she runs around the cemetery in a robe. Obviously, there are still footage from Brinke as a bonus on the retromedia DVD double film “The Sign of the Witch / Bride's Blood. <br /> <br /> Jack O: what is this about? Damn, if I know. A little boy is told a story about a pumpkin-headed demon-killer, and he and some other children are frightened by a woman whom they somehow consider to be a witch. She follows him home and offers to help his family in their Halloween haunted garage (reach out through the hole and feel the eyeballs that are really grapes, etc.). A killer with a pumpkin head appears several times to hold on to the branches while he is watching people, or to hold a braid in front of the camera and pose for a while. Sometimes he manages to do more than just stand, hold on to things, and actually kill people. <br /> <br /> There are also memories of a Western or Prairie family, when a little boy also plays a little boy in that family. : his ancestors, I think. I think they appear in the pre-history of Jack-O, but I do not know how. <br /> <br /> The little boy is supposedly the protagonist, but we don’t know anything about him, except that he wears glasses, has nightmares, and will fight bullies, even if he is beaten in the process. More time had to be spent on establishing his character. I could not care less if he died. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, even on Halloween.
