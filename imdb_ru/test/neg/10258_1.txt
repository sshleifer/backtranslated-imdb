This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen; this makes Plan 9 of Outer Space looking wonderful. The game is wooden, the plot is stupid, but SFX does not exist. The only good thing about this is the fact that it is not a long film. The landscape is sometimes quite pretty if you like trees, if that helps!
