Well, we have 4 city electricians who find a mini-nuclear reactor, turn it on and fall into a parallel universe in which a giant spider queen lives, also from a parallel universe that has managed to slip through several of its relatives to seize the earth the only one left? If so, then why the rest of humanity did not join or track it down. Besides what happened to the military, in no case could several billion or more rounds be used, and why hide in the basement when much more defensive positions were needed. Also, do not dig the city workers, but how did they know what the mini-nuclear reactor looked like, and how, if they did not have it in a parallel universe, could they have opened the crack again? Sorry, but there was nothing nice about the movie.
