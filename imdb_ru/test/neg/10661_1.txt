This movie should be the worst movie of 2007, it was really very bad, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a bad movie, I mean, they don’t make really bad Hollywood films, do they? Hamish should really stick to singing instead of playing, because he just can't play at all, God, he was so bad, I mean, he was so bad in the film that he made Malliku Sherawath look like a better actress, than he, as for her performance, she plays the same role in every film, oh, how boring it is to look at her, I mean, what do men see in this woman? Yes, she has a divine body, but where is this talent? I have not seen it yet, and in my opinion, I don’t think I will ever be able to. <br /> <br /> In any case, Hamish falls in love with Ria, now this 15-year-old girl can act, my goodness, she was the best actor in the film, and she doesn't look 15 at all, for me she looks about 21, but her game was brilliant in the film. Bless her, she was really good, I hope to see her more in the future. Therefore, Ria falls in love with Himasha, but her father wants her to marry someone else, a typical Bollywood film fails in any case (it can only happen in a Bollywood film), and both of them eventually get married. <br /> Well, I would say that the music is 10/10, it was great, which made the film a hit, the songs were really amazing and brilliant. In any case, the only thing I can say is to go and buy music, and not watch a movie.
