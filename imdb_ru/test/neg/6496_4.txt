Most critics have written destructive about this film Mikhalkov, but I wanted to see it myself. And, unfortunately, they are right. The film had the largest budget in the entire history of Russian cinema, two international stars, colorful crowd scenes, apparently shot fairly close to the Kremlin, but in the end, this seems to be pleasant, nothing. You will not believe that this director used to make masterpieces like Urga and Burnt by the Sun. The characters in the storyline are inconclusive, neither Jane nor McCracken nor Andrei. It is worth mentioning only General Radlov. He stays on the surface all the time. Politically it is for me the glorification of the army, especially the Russian, with such values ​​as honor and duty. And, having lived at least six months in Siberia: my Russia is much larger than the one depicted in the Mikhalkov film. As for the movie “Burnt by the Sun” by the same director as the film “No Questions, 10 Points,” one of the best I've ever seen in my entire life, I was completely disappointed with this film. Sorry. Nevertheless, Mikhalkov's unique talent in creating amazingly beautiful paintings still exists.
