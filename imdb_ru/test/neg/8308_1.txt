I watched DEATH MACHINES as part of the Classic Classic Drive-in BCI Eclipse (with Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD. Working on a variety of DVDs, I fell in love with many of Crown International’s films - especially the creepy, erotic, psychological thrillers! <br /> <br /> DEATH MACHINES is not one of them. <br /> <br /> After watching films like MALIBU BEACH, CREEPING TERROR and PINK ANGELS, it's hard to say that this is the worst movie ever made; but that doesn't make much sense. <br /> <br /> No plot; really nothing to talk about. <br /> <br /> The game is not obvious ?? only the actor responsible for the badly played Tony (with a thick, fake Italian accent) made any attempt to “get into character”. <br /> <br /> Pricing is annoying and meticulous. <br /> <br /> The only thing in this film is why ... what made the filmmakers make this film? <br /> <br /> Whether they thought the story: 1) three ninjas, 2) two competing criminal authorities, 3) the character of the auxiliary bartender / student of the karate school; and 4) was his miserable love nurse so convincing that the world would not be complete without this film? <br /> <br /> This is a waste of time and money for you, me, producers, writers, actors and director.
