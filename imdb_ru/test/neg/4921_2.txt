There is not enough space to explain the many reasons why this film is disappointing. Stupid special effects and incomprehensible plot - the smallest of the problems of this film. The film looks as if it was conceived in the mid-eighties and is just a stew until it was finally made in the early nineties. A “hero” with a gray mullet (complete with a trendy three-day shadow beard “Miami Vice”), punching a ham with Ronald Reagan would have been funny if he hadn't taken himself so seriously. Like this, the film is just pathetic. I'm really sorry for the poor actresses who were wasting their beautiful scenes in this horrible movie.
