When I first watched this show, everything was in order. There were some funny moments, and I laughed a couple of times, but this show is getting worse and worse. Carly and Sam's web show is NOT completely funny. They play a stupid video from the Internet, scream into the camera and make very bad jokes. And then the track of laughter goes away ?! One of the problems of the show is that not one of the main characters is funny. Carly is not funny. Miranda Cosgrove's play is dull at best. Her acting on this show is not like the way she plays from Drake and Josh. Her friend Sam is very rough and rude, and the show is written in such a way that she looks like some kind of reckless. I mean, they joke that her mom drives an old rusty truck, her mother smashes an old TV with a bat, and then jokes that Sam fails at school, all the time lingers and runs away from the cops. All this is not funny. Then there is Freddie, who is a computer fan. He is not too funny if his mother does not treat him like a child. The only funny character on the show is Carly Spencer's brother. He does some funny jokes and does some pretty funny things, for example, pretends to control a spacecraft while making sounds of a spacecraft, knocking over a table of cookies of a scout girl for the sake of revenge, as they did the same to him. His stuff is the only thing worth laughing at. In addition to characters, other things make the show bad too. For example, the fact that a couple of children who are hosting a local web show from an apartment in Seattle became a world hit and gave them a free trip to Tokyo? Another thing is that as a 26-year-old lonely guy who has no real work, he can pay for a two-level apartment in the center of Seattle, grow his 13-year-old sister and pay for a room full of camera and sound equipment, including a remote-controlled projector and a green screen and HD camera? Looks like it was written by a 10 year old. Worst of all, the show contains rather dubious content. A couple of times Carly (remember the 13-year-old girl) has appeared on her bikini internet show. WTF? Then I saw an episode in which Freddie tells Carly and Sam that he "slept only in his socks last night." I mean WTF? Then there is an episode when rival Carly Nevel blackmails her, taking away the rights to her website and agreeing to return her in exchange for a kiss. Terribly! And I just saw an episode where Carly meets a boy who has just moved to their apartment building, he has some kind of back injury, he takes off his shirt, and Carly stands there, drooling at him. I can't believe that Nick even allows them to show such things, and I can't believe that it was created by the same guy responsible for Drake and Josh. This show is not suitable for children under the age of 12, and it is even doubtful. iCarly is another addition to Nickâ€™s long list of horrible programs.
