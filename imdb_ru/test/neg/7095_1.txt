This film breaks all films about gangsters and gangsters. MP Da Last Don has a link to each movie. The game was the worst I've ever seen. Who is John Mario? His game was the worst I've ever seen. He makes bad actors look good. As for Master P, he sells out faster than the N * Sync gig. I would very much like me to be there to tell the whole production company: “WHAT THE HELL, DO YOU THINK WHEN RECORDING THE SCENARIO?” Obviously, these people are so obsessed with the gangster image that they decided to create a film and live their gangster life truly in their minds. One thing I know is that nobody wanted to distribute this film, so it seems (and how predictable) that the guys from NO LIMIT should have started, NO LIMIT FILMS. I said enough! This film is terrible and should not be called a movie!
