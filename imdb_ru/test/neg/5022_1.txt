Don't kill me fans, but I have something to say about this. <br /> <br /> Pros: Well, the mildest season Iâ€™ve seen from all the seasons of Inuyashi has just passed on the Shichintai arc. Unlike the rest of the seasons, I personally think that it has more of a real storyline and those mercenaries; My God, they are such nice characters. Shame they were killed. Of course, I would write a 15-page essay why I like Shikintai so much, but it will be boring for some of you. So there really are some nice characters in this series. I will miss Bankots ... a poor, poor psycho, a little boy. <br /> <br /> Cons: outside the arch of the Shichinintai series was generally boring, repetitive, and some characters extremely annoying. Kagome, for example: it reacts too strongly to my taste; she behaves like Yuka from Elfen Lied. Inuyasha: He is a loud canine demon with a huge sword. What is so unique about it? He has amazing dog ears! PM Sessomaru - it's all talk, no action, and very bold. Naraku has just become the most stupid villain in the anime world that ever existed. Miroku and Sango ... they have some color, but they seem to be standing too far away. But what worries me most is the fact that they have absolutely no common sense at all. Rumiko Takahashi did much better than that. I have seen it before. <br /> <br /> If you like TV shows with a lot of action, without an annoying love triangle, without excessive repetition, then this is not for you.
