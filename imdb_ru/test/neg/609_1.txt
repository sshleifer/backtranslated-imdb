The show is about an incredibly stupid man and his insightful hot wife. 99% of conspiracies revolve around Doug doing something incredibly stupid, and then the variable comes: a) either he hides it from his wife, or b) tells his wife that she is draining him, and then the matter for the test character from Sainfeld) to exacerbate the situation. <br /> <br /> And the authors dare to say that they were influenced by “Newlyweds” (absolute classic) and that the plots are taken from real situations. If you do not live in a cave, you know that this is not true. <br /> <br /> Anyway, let's just say so. If Kevin James were thin, the show would be canceled by the pilot. If you are 12 years old or you like fat jokes ... be my guest, watch this show (or any other Kevin James movie). <br /> <br /> I noticed that some posters compare this parody to such great shows as Friends, Seinfeld and Everybody Loves Raymond - I still wonder how anyone could do it
