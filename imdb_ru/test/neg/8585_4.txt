Stone tried a different type of movie. Any given Sunday does not match the average value of The Last Boy Scout and is below average, no matter what. The stone can be fantastic, see “Doors”, “Natural Born Killers” or “Platoon”, but it can also repeat itself after seeing Nixon or “Born” on the fourth of July. His real brilliance is realized in the perfection of Michael Kane The Hand.
