I canâ€™t honestly believe that this is the continuation or continuation of the classic horror movie of John Landis from 1981. I believe that you cannot describe it as an original werewolf film, since the bare bones of history steal elements from one of the filming in London: an American tourist visits a famous European capital, he barely survives after a werewolf attack that kills a colleague he enters for a pun) into sexual relations with someone from the medical profession, he turns into a werewolf, he is visited by visions of his dead victims, etc. And reading the previous line, I just discovered that the storyline has something in common with the original, in fact it seems to be very similar. The difference is how enjoyable and interesting the Landis movie is. <br /> <br /> There are no truly outstanding scenes in this Paris film. There is no naked man waking up at the zoo, wondering how he is going to return home without money or clothes, there is no bizarre sequence of dreams about Nazi werewolves and there is no exciting climax. AAWIP is trying to be funny, but is there anything more embarrassing than failed humor? I think about the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone that he has gum in his pocket, not condoms! Perhaps the biggest difference between these two films is that there is no sharpness in this dubious continuation. You really regret the fate and dilemma of the protagonist in the London film, here you just feel that Andy is nothing more than a cipher going through the literary movements of the script. There are also a large number of visible holes. Is this the first time the Moon Club slaughtered? If not, is it not reported in the world press about a large number of corpses with torn hearts? Why didn't the police get a reason? <br /> <br /> Everyone else mentioned this, and I, too ... Visibility is bad. Look at the bungee jumping scene in the Eiffel Tower, it is painfully obvious that this is achieved through some kind of blue screen projection, while the werewolf transformation is performed by some very cartoon CGI. I will not put Anthony Waller in the same bracket as Stephen Sommers as a director who completely destroys the film due to excessive dependence on computer graphics (the main problem with AAWIP is a script combined with a high degree of expectation from those who have seen 1981), but I would prefer Rick Baker's type of special effects used for transformation. To be fair, it is reasonable to assume that perhaps the budget did not extend so far. But in the end, it's a pretty bad horror movie that didn't have to be made, and DOG SOLDIERS are much better entertainment.
