When I first saw it 9 years ago, when I was 9 years old, I thought it was smelly. I am now 18, and I still think it stinks. I mean, damn it, no special effects or anything else, it was boring and kind of climatic. My cousin looked once, and George Takai (Sulu) kept saying that it should be much better, but they continued to cut the budget. It would have been a great episode, but it was a terrible movie.
