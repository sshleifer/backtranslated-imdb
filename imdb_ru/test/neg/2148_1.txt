You know that you have a bad movie when you hear that the soundtrack is completely played on one cheap programmable synthesizer, without any melody or rhythm feeling. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to understand how someone can take this film seriously, even while giving it a bad review. This film is far below the "bad." <br /> <br /> The continuity of this film is outrageously killed. In one battle scene, we, the hero (in blue jeans and a T-shirt) turn the corner with two revolvers in his hand; he bends back, only now he has two semi-automatic devices in his hands; he turns another corner, and now he has an automatic rifle in his hands; he chases down the corridor and comes out (suddenly dressed in a standard army jacket for fatigue) with a shotgun; after which he leaves the building with another automatic rifle. Or here's one for the books - the bus crashes into the car at high speed; car flies, abandoned by a giant explosion - crash into a bus that is completely safe from the same explosion? The continuity of the narrative suffers from an equally numb feeling of unreality; the bad guys really want to kill the hero — obviously — but every time they knock him out or put him in a vulnerable position in any way, they suddenly decide that they want him to “live to see it”! BUT? One of the funniest moments of the film is when the hero got out of isolation because his lawyer came to him; then the bad guy decides that in the end he will not allow them to meet; and this is despite the fact that the villain, the hero and his lawyer all know what is going on, so the hero writes a note to the lawyer, and then we see that the note is handed over to the lawyer to other prisoners, although we never see the hero, give him that. (This lawyer, BTW, has full access to ATF offices in California, including his confidential computer files.) Well, but this is a meaningless action movie - so how are things in combat? Not bad, surprisingly; Unfortunately, they were stolen from a dozen Hong Kong films shot five or ten years ago. In the opening scene, in a shootout in the junkers' garage, there are actually shots that were stolen straight from Hard Boiled — so clear that it is surprising that John Wu did not sue plagiarism. <br /> Other films from Hong Kong stolen from the film include Prison in Fire, Island in Fire, Burning Paradise, Police Story I, II and III (also known as " Superkop "). It seemed to me that I also recognized a couple of Sammo Hung clips. In other words, action scenes are exciting only to the extent that they are a successful duplication of action scenes from other films. <br /> <br /> There’s nothing you can do about this movie if you don’t take off the smack and it just needs a lot of visual stimuli that shouldn’t make any sense. <br /> <br /> A very funny movie, for all the wrong reasons.
