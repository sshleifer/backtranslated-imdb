This is an extremely competent film technically. The filming and directorial work is excellent, and the acting is good, especially the wonderful play of Daniel Otoy as the Marquis. I really thought that there was no problem with these aspects of the film. Instead, I was a little annoyed at how Marquis was portrayed, since it did not seem so honest and, it seems, a very revisionist view of history. In fact, in recent years, the Marquis has undergone a slight transformation in the defender of liberty with great insight, and not in the fatty sadomasochist rapist he really was. In a sense, it is very reminiscent of the whitewash, given in “PEOPLE AGAINST LARRY FLINT”, where these people received hero status. Even if you don’t think that the Marquis’s perversions were not so bad (they included rape and extreme violence), his image in this film as a “sexual social worker” in this prison seems rather silly. Instead of a cruel and selfish Shade, he spends a lot of time carefully caring for the young virgin, and slowly helps her explore her own sensuality. What a good and kind person. In fact, now that I think about it, this performance reminds me of a man whom Maurice Chavalier played in GIGI (but without singing) - a nice old man who loves women. I strongly doubt that the real Marquis de Sade would recognize this character at all! <br /> <br /> In the film, oddly enough, there is no nude, although what he shows is extremely clear. Only a maniac could let his children see it, because it is a very adult drama. It is very well done and quite interesting - just not all that is true. The director acknowledges that the film was largely fictional in an interview among the special features on the DVD that I was watching. So let's see the film, if you want to - to understand it is simply not very good from a historical point of view. During the 18th century, sexual perverts were fully accepted in France, as they were quite widespread, so despite the fact that the film implies that it was not sex, but a problem, and violence and rape were (and still are) a problem .
