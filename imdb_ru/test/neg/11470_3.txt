I desperately try not to fall asleep while watching the film by Solomon Kane. I have about 20 minutes left. If it gets better, I will come back here and let you know, but for some reason I doubt that this will happen. Solomon Kane looks like it is based on the Dark Watch video game, and it looks like it is based on the Legacy of Kane video game, but unfortunately neither the one nor the other is true. I heard that it is based on a comic book, a graphic novel, a science fiction novel or something else I have never heard about, but whatever it is based on, there is nothing original in this painfully boring film. The atmosphere is stolen from movie 300, which was not so good in the first place. Tiring replaying is taking itself so seriously that it is almost hypnotic, and to be clear, I mean it in a bad way. The plot is almost non-existent: a cruel guy trying to be non-violent, meets a friendly family, a close-knit family is killed, a cruel guy becomes cruel again. All characters are stereotypes taken from the Waterworld or the Book of Eli, or "The Hills Have Eyes," or, whatever, just choose another apocalyptic fantasy slash film that you saw, and here you are. Someone somewhere said that this is how to make a movie: use a blue filter so that everything looks mysterious, add a lot of slow shots of horse's hooves in muddy puddles, add snowflakes soaring around while two boring characters talk to each other, and oh, yes, the rain pours radically to divert attention from the fact that nothing really happens, and don't forget about the black silhouettes that come to us with a blazing fire behind, and a lot of burning torches, and, of course, vague battle scenes during which time it is not clear that on the very This happens because we have no budget for terrible special effects, so just add the sound of a metallic clank, and, oh, by the way, do not let any character live long enough for the Audience to understand them, treat them or sympathize with them, and cross your fingers, hope that fans of movies about swords and magic will eat it, even if it is complete, and go straight to the video, do not miss the GO. ,,
