It seems I can not find anything good in this mini-series. Why the hell would you ban chocolate if you could ban something much more practical, such as smoking or alcohol? Also stupid is the fact that this is an Australian program, and all this is happening in England, and everyone is faking British accents. In general, I think this show is unrealistic and cheap.
