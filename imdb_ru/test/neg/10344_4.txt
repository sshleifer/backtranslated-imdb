Korben Bernsen made a horror film about chemical weapons, released at a sporting event and turning everyone into insane monsters. We watch as the radio station employees receive reports. <br /> <br /> She has moments, but basically it’s like a lifelong horror film with breasts and blood. There are some really good ideas here, but they just don’t work. In fact, film ideas are best handled in a film called Pontypool, which pretty much runs through and creates tension without showing us anything. It shows us things, and it just seems cheap. If I had a choice, I would watch Pontypul again, and not watch this movie again.
