--------- Spoiler warning ---------------------------- <br /> <br /> It was the worst of the series, it's horror disguised as political satire, and it's as thin as a sledgehammer, not very scary and not very insightful. Is Michelle Moore somehow connected with this piece of garbage? <br /> <br /> I am very tired of Hollywood using entertainment as a political campaign against George W. Bush and constantly repeating the same topics of conversation over and over again. This film wants to be DeathDream, but unlike the film, in which the problems of the soldiers who returned from Vietnam are subtly decisively solved, cleverly forcing the main character to return to the bloodthirsty zombie and slowly based on this theme: it was a real horror film, which was also good social commentary, because he did not become sanctimonious, exploitative, and preaching. <br /> <br /> I think Joe Dante thought it was an attempt to make a horror film to scare Republicans, conservatives and libertarians, and I was the last one on this list to find this movie completely funny, manipulative and exploitative, and I I do not mean a good type of exploitation, which you often see in films like “driving,” I mean exploiting in the most disgusting and vile way: to use the death of our soldiers as a manipulative political statement disguised as a horror film. <br /> <br /> In this film, it is assumed that all the soldiers who died in Iraq would vote against the conservative president if they returned to zombie life, which is an erroneous premise, because, as I recall, for the most part pieces and go by the rules of George Romero; zombies are brainless creatures that feed on flesh and act on the basis of pure impulse, and although Andy’s zombie in DeathDream could talk, he couldn’t have a conversation, and he was driven by his addiction to human blood. Okay, zombies are meaningless creatures driven by impulses, not intellect, and obviously they are dead, so why are dead people allowed to vote in the first place? My interpretation of this film is that the only war a liberal Democrat can win is for the mindless dead people voting for him. I think they wanted to say that people who vote for presidents such as George W. Bush are meaningless zombies, and real foolish zombies actually make intelligently sound decisions. Yes whatever. Dawn of the Dead coped with this idea much better, but used the idea of ​​mindless consumption. This film is not Dawn of the Dead, as it seems, strained by imagination. <br /> <br /> The film touches upon the problem as long as the soldiers are alive, since most of them voted for a president like Bush, but after death they will vote for a liberal anti-war democrat after they become zombies that are usually considered dead brains and ridiculously forced to destroy them after the vote. <br /> <br /> If you are going to make a film about zombies, Mr. Dante and call George Romero's name in it, you better have meaningless zombies who like to tear people apart and have their intestines, and not voting zombies. I also like the way zombies simply become “evil” conservatives who support the war. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie with social commentary, skip this poorly made, preaching piece of trash and watch DeathDream instead. <Br /> <br /> The worst of the Master of Horror series surrenders.
