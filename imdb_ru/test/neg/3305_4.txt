The bad news is for those who want to shoot a full-length parody of the movie Lifetime Network - the creators of A Deadly Encounter have already done so, albeit unintentionally. All life-long paths are there - a divorced mother is in danger from an abnormal stalker, an unreliable ex-husband (who, of course, cheated on her when they were married), and a police department that patronizingly rejects her complaints, forcing her to stand up for herself. Especially amazing is the scene where the heroine, having withstood the burglary and the attempt to kill her mother with her seemingly omnipresent stalker, decides to relieve stress, going shopping! After seeing the persecution of an employee by my own experience by some scum she met in church, I know that persecution is not a joke, but, of course, in this film.
