This is perhaps the worst of the main films of Ava Gardner. Yes, she is gorgeous. But over time, this can erode, especially after the banal and predictable end of the film. <br /> <br /> In this turkey, Robert Walker must pretend that he is Eddie Bracken (which undoubtedly embarrassed him). Olga San Juan plays the role of Jane Powell (damn it). Dick Heims plays a kind of dull girlfriend (!), And Eva Arden plays Helen Broderick (and many other wise semi-comedians). Yes, the film contains the main popular song "Talk softly." But look at the other, completely forgotten parts. Of course, Dick Heims sings very well, as does the uncredited vocalist backing up Ava. <br /> <br /> The sets are cheap, the script is full of cliches and unsatisfied humor, and Tom Conway looks as if he has fought liquor (as he really was). In short, if you want to see Ava in his prime, buy a photo and stay away from this movie.
