Do not waste your time. The plot lasts, the characters are wooden and uninteresting, the motives of their actions are completely indecipherable. He waited for "romance" or "comedy", and nothing happened. Worse, a love letter is not even romantic, but it sounds like it was written by someone who was desperate to meet the deadline. I mentioned that the “plot twist” that we saw after 15 minutes of the film was “smart Hollywood”, that is, it is meant for shock, but given the Hollywood mentality, it doesn’t do anything of the kind, but instead is slightly offensive. <br /> <br /> It doesn't even cost $ 2 to rent. Do not worry about it.
