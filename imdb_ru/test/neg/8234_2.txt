I consider myself a big fan of low-budget horror films. The more strange and creative the film, the more blood and courage, the better, and I really fall in love with cheap films, if they are done correctly. Luther begins well enough ... his origin in the circus, the eerie race to the supermarket, the attack on the old woman and his troubling occupation of a female rural home - all this creates a good mood. The hot sex / soul scene begins when the daughter of the woman and the boyfriend of the daughter arrive at the house. When Luther hijacks a motorcycle guys, the movie gets worse. <br /> <br /> Characters have many opportunities: A) save their loved ones, B) get police help, C) escape or (most importantly) D) kill Luther !!! I don’t feel sympathy or fear for characters who are too stupid to help themselves. Chareters risk arming themselves with weapons and knives until Luther is gone. The policeman eventually arrives and is equally ineffective at stopping Luther, even though at some point he has a rifle aimed directly at Luther, while Luther clicks and performs his Polish dance with chicken. I found that I was training my TV in vain: “Make sure he is dead!”, “He left, get out of here!” Or “Just kill him already!” <br /> <br /> Luther is a bloodthirsty savage, but he Hannibal Lecter. If you can not outwit this wiseacre, you deserve what you have to. By the middle of the movie you will be so lethargic to the fate of the imbeciles, that only a painful curiosity will help you to hold out until a slightly funny end. This film was noted as one of the 101 greatest films of Fangoria that you have never seen ... well, Fangoria is half right in the case of Luther Geek.
