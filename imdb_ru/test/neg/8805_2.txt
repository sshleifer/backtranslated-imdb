I usually crave bad movies, but this stuff is stinky. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible effects and very little humor. make this movie? I have nothing to talk about and nothing to talk about. <br /> <br /> I was able to cope with only 45 minutes of this movie about rats, and this is rare for me. <br /> <br /> Something positive to say about this nonsense? the cover was all right, I'm sure the film has an end too, even if I couldn't do it. <br /> <br /> The rats were unorganized and constantly broke their lines, they lacked intensity and seemed just to get through their salary. The actors were worse.
