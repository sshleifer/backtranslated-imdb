Got it from usenet, so I wasn't ready for a heavy (and I mean, EXCLUSIVELY heavy) religious topic. Not that I was one of the disciples of Satan or something like that, but it was very hard. <br /> <br /> Also, the cast is smelly. This may be because they needed to find good little boys to play bad little boys, but it didn’t work. <br /> <br /> A pretty cool movie was involved, so any fan of the director's style may want to check it out, but be prepared with fast-forward buttons. <br /> <br /> In editing there was some sloppiness. In particular, is the black Mustang (probably Satan?) Contrasted with the white 240Z. The wheels spin, the camera switches, and something else that the white 240Z turns into a white Civic. <br /> <br /> I gave up early, so I can not vouch for the moral impact of this. But I would like to point out that this film completely preaches to the choir. If the director / screenwriter / producer tried to get religion to unwashed street masses, they did everything wrong. I think I’d rather look at adult diapers advertising than listen to a rant biblical speech about Jesus dying for us. Yawn. <br /> <br />
