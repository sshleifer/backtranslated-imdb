Hollywood produced another rubbish that is wildly exaggerated and not thrilled at the first viewing. Hannibal is bad, terrible, inept, lame, stupid, idiotic, contrived, ridiculous and completely brutal (not a pun). Minor spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> There are huge logical holes in this film - more than in any Bruckheimer / Bay film - or, for that matter, - in any film that illustrates the indulgence of Hollywood exaggeration. This is a sleek Hollywood production, designed to make money on the mania of Hannibal Lector, directed by the director “so gloomy, he takes it too seriously,” and produced by a hacked Italian producer with a bloated ego, whose credo is “not important, whether it is **, the money is good. " <br /> <br /> I cannot reconcile with the fact that famous scriptwriters David Mamet and Stephen Zaylian wrote this trip, adapted from the lame and pretentious book of the good writer-writer Thomas Harris. David and Stephen - famous and extremely talented screenwriters - spent their efforts on a bad script in exchange for big salaries. Another factor of frustration in this film. <br /> <br /> There are too many ridiculous scenes on the list that can be amused because of awkward execution and bad logic, for example. Starling / Pazzi cell phone in the midst of chasing Lecter, who makes Inspector Pazzi a victim. Not to mention the ridiculously bad dialogues that lead Tony Hopkins with a smirk and Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta and others who cannot act with straight faces. Hopkins gives the true meaning of “chewing scenery” along with the fact that Gamie Oldman plays Hammy as a deformed psychopath, eager to get revenge on Lecter. <br /> <br /> The effect of Horus is good, but serves only to reflect, but not to provide an unknown, which is noticeably absent in Hannibal. The predecessor - The Silence of the Lambs - is more likely with tension and tension. Suspense is what made Silence of the Lamb work as an exciting mix of psychological horror and thriller, not to mention superbly written and intensely directed. The brainwave sequence is so ridiculous that it borders on self-parody. <br /> <br /> The ending is rather blatant and idiotic - should we believe that Lecter still poses a threat to society with the last shot set his sparkling eye looking at you? Oh, scary ... <br /> <br />
