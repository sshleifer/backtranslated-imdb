GOOD: The game was great, especially Terrence Howard and Tandy Newton. Terrence Howard should have been nominated for "Best Support" instead of Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> BAD: I am a visible minority (not white), and I have experienced some form of racism in my life. BUT, despite my life experience and the theme of the film, I will definitely NOT say that this film is the best this year, in fact, it is far from it. I have problems with this film both from the point of view of the cinema-goer and from the point of view of the visible minority. Here are some of my problems with this movie: <br /> <br /> (1) Poor character development (or none at all). Just because we have seen extremes in a character, for example, Matt Dillon, being a racist policeman and a good guardian of his sick father, this in no way means that the character is well developed. Yes, I admit that in a large acting ensemble, as in this film, it is quite difficult for each character to be well developed, BUT that does not mean that none of the characters should be like that. <br /> <br /> (2) The dialogue seems really far-fetched, and I'm really surprised that this film won for the best original script. They should show this film in scripting lesson NOT because it’s good, but show students and future writers what NOT to do. I just felt that I was hit on the head again and again, like racism is bad. I understood. <br /> <br /> (3) The plot seems so random that it is ridiculous. What are the chances that a black car robber collides with an Asian guy who also turns out to be a human trafficker when entering his van, and the same black car robber eventually hijacked that Asian guy's van several hours after he brought him to the hospital , just to find out that some Asians are sold inside the van, just to show you that the black car robber has a good side after all? Or what about the scene where the high-prejudiced white woman who fell from the stairs and all her prejudices and hatred disappeared into the air? If it were that simple, why don't we throw all the racists in America down the stairs so that their opinions change? <br /> <br /> (4) I think my biggest concerns about this film are unrealistic views on racism. As a person who has experienced racism in my life, a realistic view of racism is that it is hidden, and not in your face. I was refused a supermarket because I am not white. Did the store owner say because I was not white? No, he said that the store is closing, although there were many people inside who were shopping. Did he scream racial slurs? Not. Racism in America is more hidden. Some taxi drivers will probably not stop to pick you up, because you are not white, but that does not mean that they will try to knock you down or get out and say racial slurs. If a Chinese woman substitutes me, I will not say “Blake! Blake! On the other hand, if I were a Chinese woman and accidentally found a Mexican in the back, I would not say “Mexicans are bad drivers” in front of her face. This is not how things work. Instead, I would like to provide information about my insurance, apologize and go home and tell my friends and relatives from China that Mexicans are bad drivers and make fun of them behind their backs. This is real racism. It is hidden and not in your face. <br /> <br /> In any case, Crash is not original, unlike what some people may say. Linking and interweaving storylines, scenes and characters was done earlier. Magnolia is a film that makes it a lot better than Crash, and yet, it has never been nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. He had a star cast - Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman (who recently won the best actor), Tom Cruise, etc. It really amazes how Crash was even nominated for the best picture.
