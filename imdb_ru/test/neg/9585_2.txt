This is the worst exercise in the pretentiousness of the middle class, which has not yet appeared on our television screens. Unfortunately, I did not see him when he was first shown, but I paid for my joy by watching the six hours of torturous chatter - and I'm still waiting for laughter to come. I love Tasmin Greig, who was a big fan of Black Books and Green Wing, and therefore I know that she is capable of the best comedic roles. Nevertheless, she played this role as well as she could, given the absence of any decent comedic material. Please keep in mind that the Transaction Description Act can well be applied if you continue to bill as comedic material, which at best is pseudo-psychological romanticism, and at worst - a drama that pretends to be the fact that she is not a fish or a bird
