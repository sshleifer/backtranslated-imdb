I saw this movie, and I can say that it is a really bad movie. The director is crazy ... of course ... he knows a lot about the army, but of course he is a cheap guy. There are also many technical flaws in the films ... <br /> <br /> Well ... hereâ€™s my doubt - after all, when they save the family (including the girl who was just raped) ... why they leave them is there outside your place? I have not seen around the ambulance! There are many aspects in the film that are real ... but then I would just like the major to narrate / help / assist another good director and make a film. <br /> <br /> Mohanlal definitely deserves the best director!
