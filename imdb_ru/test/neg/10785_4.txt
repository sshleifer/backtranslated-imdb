I can not believe that some points of this film on the site IMDb! Did I have a special version? Edited by Dewhurst, produced by Bernard Matthews, this film is to be hosted at Battersea. I apologize for all UK-oriented links, but if you are in another place and you have no toenails to shorten or you donâ€™t have a beer-mat collection for the catalog, then this film may cost you 90 minutes of your remaining lifespan as long as you do not have paint for drying). The plot has more holes than in stockings in the form of openwork meshes, and the direction and editing are surprisingly well developed. What does Irons do in this film?
