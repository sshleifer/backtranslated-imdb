people get the key! I mean, the authors don't have one, so I would expect you ... this show is a pale imitation of the 60s show, so you can laugh at it! and the show of the sixties is a show with cheap special effects that takes place at B & W fer Chrissakes! However, the mood and writing on the old show - Miles ahead of this fuss. Get hip kids! if 98 degrees or Brittany told you to watch it, you would! You know it! Just go around them and tell all your friends that you were on the "stage", before it became too cool!
