This film is the worst thing made by people. Do you think Manos is the worst movie? It doesn't even come close to this garbage. I don't even know where to start. The “Russian” commander and rebellious chic are the worst “actors” who have ever appeared in a movie. They make the sister in troll 2 look like Meryl Streep. Foolish faces, which makes chic while she is engaged in kung fu, you need to believe. Then, during the prison break, the oomp music sounds, a completely inappropriate love scene, a stupid song that sounds during a crazy love scene, a fake castra, the fact that everyone has a bandage and / or bandana some part of their body the stupid rape scene ever filmed, and the worst acting game ever filmed. This film deserves to be better known among bad movie fans. Definitely the worst movie ever made.
