I'll start blowing the film first. Remove Abbott and Costello from the cast, and you get a badly colored film, hard cardboard from the casting department, a poorly voiced sound (especially while singing!) And an annoying dialogue (for example, listen to the commercial "Mr. Dinklepuss"). infinity). Obviously, some studio hackers thought they could make money on the Disney CLASSIC â€œMickey and the Beanstalk" presentation, but perhaps the audience was either more credible (incredible) or stuck in a double feature (more likely). Even children should feel offended when they are shown this film. Total celluloid waste. Now about the acting game of Abbott and Costello. Bad Abbott always played a straightforward person, and, apparently, he was nicer outside the set. On the radio, his character was usually a quick talker and especially funny when his speed made him splash out his lines and smooth out mistakes. In the movie, he still plays a straightforward man, but rather a crook. Not that he is bad at this, but this character was perfected by Groucho Marx. This parody of the duet in the film - Lou Costello. Again on the radio he was funny. He played a character that was a little slower than Abbott, but not much slower! He was also partial to the lines and made me laugh when he got stumped because of Abbott's mistakes. In the film, I do not know whether it was his decision or not, but in the films his hero turns into a stupid parody of Stan Laurel, which, in turn, was even more shamefully done by Jerry Lewis. Why change? he was funny on the radio when he was smart, but here he becomes a character that looks like a child, which looks like it is robbing cameras in every frame. this feature is featured in every film they make, and only casts doubt on the reputation they had on the radio. Their film career remained - a bad (very, very bad) copy of Laurel and Hardy. Cinema would be much funnier if they played their radio-satellites instead of casting rehearsals.
