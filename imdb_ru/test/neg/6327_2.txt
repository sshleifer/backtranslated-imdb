Well, the only reason I watched this movie was because Krista Allen is in it. Since I confess that I look at the Days of our life ... I know her as Billy. Yes, of course, it may be a reason to watch this movie .. what would be a soft porn zone. It looks like they extol it. And a bit more. I hope that anyone who rents / buys this film rents it only for the sex scene. Because if they bought / rented it for something else, say, high-quality television, they could die of a heart attack. In this film, little imagination. Although I laugh at this nonsense, and perhaps I will buy it myself, I'm just a fool. Rent before you buy on this. 2 out of 10. (Please note, I have not yet given the film 1 star. The sensual scene itself was giving out and rose from 1. if they didnâ€™t have 1 in sweat, and I want a refund if not for me.)
