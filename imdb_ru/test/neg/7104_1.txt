This film does not know what he wants to become: does he even make fun of action movies? Is it satirical? Should it be a black comedy? This is truly one of the worst films in history. <br /> <br /> Lori Petty is annoying. There I said what everyone else thinks. It is enough that she is such a terrible actress (Route 666, Bates Motel), but she is not even considered a mediocre actress in a b-film. Her shrill voice, strange manners and bad comic moments dot this movie from beginning to end, until you just want to put your head in a vice and end the pain. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs. You will be glad you did.
