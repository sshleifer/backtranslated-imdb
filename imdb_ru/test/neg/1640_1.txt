BOOOOOOOORRRRRINNGGGGGGG and STOOOOOOOPIDDDDD. Fell asleep. If you want to see how Miles O'Keefe rides a fluffy speedometer, by all means rent this movie. If not, please do not worry ... Paradise is an anachronistic. Should it be in the Ice Age, the Iron Age, the Steel Age or the Age of Reason? What caused the black nylon wig on a guy dressed like Genghis Khan? Was it really supposed to be Genghis Khan? If Ator had access to such advanced technologies and science, why should we have waited Leonardo for another 1000 years? It is never clear where ator comes from or it must be some kind of superior creature. You wonder if all this was explained in the first film, but when you see this film, you KNOW you will never worry.
