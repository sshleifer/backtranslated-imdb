!!! Spoiler warning !!! <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I did not think that this film has an end to spoil ... I started watching it in the middle, after Matt got into Sarah. body, but then I was fascinated by the quirkiness of the plot, even for the 5th channel movie ... and could not see how Matt would end up being happy. What about his bride? At some point, he looked as if he were going to meet his best friend, of course, indecently and wrongly ... and then the whole thing "oggi oggi oggi" DOES NOT WORK like a buddy's touching phrase, it's just funny ... going, of course, he can not just come back to life? and yet how can he live like a woman? and then the film just finished it, ending and explaining nothing at all !!!!! What is it about ??? I was so angry, wasted a whole hour of my life for no reason !!! :) but it was one of the funniest films I've ever seen, so swings and merry-go-rounds
