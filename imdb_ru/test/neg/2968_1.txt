I just have to say that it was the third worst film I had ever seen immediately after the attack of Tomato 3 and the landing ship killer of Tomato 3. It was not just dialogues or paper walls or even gunfire that just disappeared from no holes in the walls. It was a terrible game. Unsurprisingly, I never saw these actors before they probably slept with the director (s). I think I feel good about this film now, but it's only because I'm tired of screaming in the film (I just saw it). I advise you to buy as many DVDs of this film as possible and burn them so that no one else can ever see this terrible waste of time, money and film.
