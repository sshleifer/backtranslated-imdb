Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. This is so fun shot, the focus is not even on this supposed “real half-breed,” it’s more on the film crew from Hollywood. It has no cinematic value, and if I could take almost a half hour, which I spent on watching this film, I would feel much better. <br /> <br /> At first, he begins to create your impression will be lifted somewhat generalized, like a real Hollywood production. However, then they go into the story telling, and it is filmed so damn terrible. It is assumed that this is indeed the “Blair Witch project”, since they largely use what you think “real footage from the camera” is wrong, do not be fooled. <br /> <br /> Worst movie ever seen. On the positive side, it is like one half-grass scene, and the half-breed visual effects didn’t look so bad. NOT RENT
