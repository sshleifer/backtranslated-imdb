Following the matrix, this parody of a film with weak connections to virtual reality was reissued with the inscription “The Matrix Just Received a Deadler!” However, due to the choice of font, the tags look to the whole world as if it says “Beablier”. Anyway. <br /> <br /> To complete the transformation to the Matrix imitator, they modeled a VR battle scene with Morpheus-like on the back of the box. It may be important to know that this character is NOT CHARACTERISTICS IN THE FILM. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is a parody on all levels. Jalal Mehri is a terrible actor and is not impressive with his martial arts. However, his partner Stone plays Evan Lurie, who in this film is simply the worst actor I've ever seen. Obviously, he was chosen to make Jalal look good in comparison. The worst movie I saw a long time ago.
