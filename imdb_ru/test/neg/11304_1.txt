I do not see "Mr. Magu." This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Leslie Nilsson was not funny about that. He was not funny since the time of the movie "Naked Gun". Well, it does not take long to realize that this is not the film "Naked Gun"! The plot of the film is ridiculously stupid. Nothing in the whole movie was funny. The first few minutes of the film were animated to look like old cartoons for Magu. I wish the film stayed that way.
