Many negative reviews here focus on the historical authenticity of this film. Okay, this is about as much related to the actual NFL as your average war movie has to do with real war, or does western have to do with true “old west”. So, I think we should give them an artistic pass to this one. <br /> <br /> The problem here is that the director (Clooney) seems to think that making a comedy with a baseball means a) doing something stupid, b) a camera mug, and c) taking silly scenes, full of robberies, and stretch them for too long. Screwball comedies need a fast pace, not necessarily frantic, but moving fast at all times. Here things are dragged, dragged and dragged. After you watch this movie, you’ll understand how brilliant Mack Sennett was when he pretty much used this genre for the first time with his Keystone Cops. After 90 years, you might think that the directors will study the old masters and study one or two things, perhaps even improve it a little. But no, it’s as if someone watched a car pioneer build a duzenbergi, and almost a century later paid tribute and “improved” the concept, bringing together a children's car with square wheels. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed several Clooney films, I consider him a gifted actor. But very few actors can competently guide themselves; Clint Eastwood especially took time to master it. Cluny is clearly at the bottom of a very steep slope. The film becomes more accessible for viewing for very few times when it leaves the frame, but when it is in the picture, it makes itself the center of attention. In the battle scenes, his robbery is so disgusting that you want someone to really hit him. <br /> <br /> If you do a comedy with folly and want to add a little romance, you need to develop chemistry between men. and the woman leads. Clooney and Zellweger have all the chemistry of a pair of dumpster in the parking lot. Not a spark, not a hiss, not even a posthumous jerking. Zellweger, who also made some pretty good films, probably traded her Botox injections for tannins, which gave a stunningly wooden presentation. She may have just performed the “tough guy in the world” action, if at least once, trying to beat the testosterone in men, she looked into the camera with a slight half smile and a gleam in her eyes. But no, she tightly squeezed her bandage to the very end. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest sin here is that the film is simply not funny. Doing nonsense is not the same as farce. Doing stupid things is very creative, like Stooges, or very athletic, like Buster Keaton, can be fun. But otherwise it's boring and, well, stupid. I think I got one good laugh from the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this. I saw it for free by cable and still wanted to get my money back.
