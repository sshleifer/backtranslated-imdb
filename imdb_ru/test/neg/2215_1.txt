There is something about the appearance of Doug Maclure in the film that is a guarantee of wretchedness. His initials in DG are similar to the special certification of cinema, which stands somewhere before the letter “U”. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Kushin seemed to suffer from both a laxative agent and his own judgment. He did a great job in the Hummer films as Dr. Van Helsing. I saw him play the very bearable Sherlock Holmes in The Baskervilles Dog. And his opus magnum was probably the Grand Moff Tarkin in the first Star Wars. The only person, other than the emperor, who could tell Darth Vadar "stop quarrels" and get away with it. But - dirty! - he made some turkeys. There was one lamentable Dalex film for one. And here is another one. <br /> <br /> There was a car that was stolen from Tracy Island. This is a cylinder with a screw in the front and traction devices on the sides. I am surprised that Jerry Anderson did not sue plagiarism. Maybe it was bought. However, if the film is a guide, they could not pay him much. <br /> <br /> Now is 1976, and we are still playing in latex jumpsuits. <br /> <br /> That's it. Some films have entertaining value in the category “so bad is good.” This one doesn't even cope with this. It will not even entertain children. The Crash Corrigan material of the 1930s focuses more on the issue.
