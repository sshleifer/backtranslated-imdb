They make it all too easy in this movie. It somehow reminded me of Indiana Jones, where he hides outside the submarine during an ocean crossing. Everyone knows what is happening, it's just very easy to get to any place in the White House. I don't even know why I watched half of it. Because I like Charlie Sheen and Donald Sutherland. I expect the usual ability to dodge bullets from all sides, and be able to run faster than a motorcycle (usually it's faster than a car in a garage or on an alley). Basically it was stupid, and then I did not even know that there was a ten-story elevator in the White House. In any case, something conspiratorial is always interesting.
