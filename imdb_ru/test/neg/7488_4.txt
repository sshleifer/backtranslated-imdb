Obviously, Andreas Bettmann would like to wear the crown Jess Franco, while also wishing (at least cinematically) the wives of the old workhorse, Lina Romay. Romay plays a corrupt, indecent, masturbating prison guard in this modern, ambitious V.I.P. film. With a few exceptions, many Franco films are clumsily filmed and filmed in a hurry. Pictures are not always cut, and sound mixes can be terrifying. Watching the “Angel of Death 2” (aka “Prison Island Massacre”), I wondered if Bettman was trying to consciously copy Franco's obvious untidiness, or was he just sloppy, like his mentor? Is this film intentionally bad, which would be self-destructive, or is it just bad due to neglect? After a hitchhiker is forced to give a blowjob with a sight, her rapist fills her mouth and then fills her vagina with some drugs. A few minutes later she was taken to the prison on the top of a cliff for reasons that were not explained, and she was insulted and mistreated by staff and other prisoners. Since this is a WIP movie, there are a lot of lesbian scenes and a lot of cruel behavior. The blood is also bloody and sadistic, with such charms as pulling out teeth and scalping (courtesy of Olaf Ittenbach). The acting is pretty terrible, the battle scenes are not convincing, but in every frame there is a love for meanness and an understanding of what fans like trash. Unfortunately, a flat script makes a flat film. Thus, despite the numerous atrocities, hard sex and the appearance of visiting Jess Franco, the experience is empty. But isn't that what most Jesse Franco films are?
