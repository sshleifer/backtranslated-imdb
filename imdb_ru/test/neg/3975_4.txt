This film is a mediocre, low-budget film. I have seen much worse on MST3K, let me assure you, but this is still a pretty crappy movie. <br /> <br /> A film about Clonus, a top-secret government agency in which clones are used for bodies for politicians. In fact, it is almost Orwellian society: almost (but not quite) efficient. <br /> <br /> The film begins to roll down when the main clone (Tim Connelly from “Emergency”) falls in love with the female clone. (Paulette Breen, who appeared in this and no more than four other films {and this was not her first film}). They start to suspect something. After finding a beer can in a nearby river, the site begins to disintegrate. The clone receives no answers from the main scientist (Dick Sargent from "Bewitched"), nor from "Confessional", a computer that supposedly knows everything, so he bursts into the main building of Clonus and (in the scene ridiculously destroyed by Mike and Bots) finds out the truth (including a video about cloning, which, oddly enough, shows the same method that was used to clone Dolly five years ago ... and this film was made more than twenty years ago ...) about Clonus. He breaks free, pursued by two guards. He has one hell of a moment when he overcomes two-foot high fences, although it is much harder for him to climb some boulders. From there it continues to slide. Peter Graves (“Beginning of the End”, “He Conquered the World”) also appears as presidential candidate and Keenan Wynn (“Dr. Strangelove”, “Piranha”, “Once in the West”) and Lurlin Tuttle (“Murderer of Ma Barker "," Psycho ") as an elderly couple who helps Cloni after his escape. <br /> <br /> The MST3K version was priceless; one of the best episodes in history. <br /> <br /> Four stars for the film; 10 for the MST3K version.
