The screenplay is the worst part of this film, as it fluctuates from one premise to another, skipping all the important moments that would make possible many different stories. (This film is confusing because the audience doesn’t know what the story is about.) I didn’t have low performance problems and the acting was not very good, but it was not bad, so everything was good. I do not mind if some of the scenes looked as if they were made in one take. But to have such a meaningless scenario is absolutely not necessary. Did any of the executives really read this before you fork out for money? Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> In particular, the prologue was so poorly written that it needed an offscreen text to fill in all the details that were omitted. The prologue was hurried, it is unclear what is happening, i.e. The Russian revolution was reduced to “Some unrest is taking place in St. Petersburg,” and the next scene is the soldiers arresting them. I know the basic history of the revolution so that I can fill in the details of "these annoying communists." The prologue is best ignored. <br /> <br /> This could be a thoughtful study of a person who does not understand who she is. He sets this premise in the shelter. Then she can struggle to identify herself for the rest of the film. Gone. The film assumes that she is who she calls herself (although there is still no empirical evidence). It has a melodramatic novel, such a strong love, that she will believe everything she says. Okay, nice romance. No, because it does not make sense. Love interest seems crazy (and, by the way, mean-spirited) crazy, broke out with wild gestures. It also does not work, because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in a monologue at the end. They never married, and she returned to America. The love story is crumbling. Although there were many love scenes, I was never convinced that they were in love. I find the rom-com novels more convincing, despite the fact that there are only one or two scenes that establish that they even spent some time with each other. <br /> <br /> It could be a thriller thing, when the film suggests that she is what she says and she struggles to prove her identity. No, the case is summarized rather than reviewed. A strange voice is coming back to fill in the details of the best movie. <br /> <br /> The funniest thing to keep in mind is what really happened. Anna Anderson was a psycho who went to America and married another psyche, and they did crazy things together. Throughout her life she had bouts of crazy behavior. None of this in the film either. In the shelter there is a really annoying character who appears from nowhere and declares himself an informant like "One flew over the next cuckoo" or "The Twelve Monkeys". Fortunately, it disappears without adding anything to the story.
