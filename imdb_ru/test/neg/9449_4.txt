I watched it because of the description and the cover and was deceived again. I got sick of all these new silly horror movies right on the DVD. One day in the blue moon 1 everything will be fine. It all started with a tangled scene, and then jumped 30 years and showed one pair during a thunderstorm, which was fine, because I love storms, and it set a good mood. Then it turned into a cool journey, where they ended up in a diner Meeting with fancy people. The rest got weird and then confused. I watched it to the end, but got even more confused when it ended so badly. I had high hopes for this film, but it was more science fiction than horror and something else. it had to be made for television.
