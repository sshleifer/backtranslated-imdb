I saw it in the independent cinema of my city - no wonder, because none of the popular cinemas would not want its prints to be on this train accident. <br /> <br /> The work of the operator is very distracting. Constant displacement, refocusing and scaling can cause a sensitive person to motion sickness. It's more like a student project than a serious movie. <br /> <br /> Although the characters are well played, they are unlikely. Josh is cunning, always trying to manipulate situations and people in their own interests. Without any context of Emily and Josh's relationship, she looks like a tearful, insecure girl who desperately wants to marry. Rhett is an emotional child, unable to understand the complexities of human interaction. Without any redemptive qualities, I didnâ€™t care what happened to any of them. <br /> <br /> Obviously, someone liked this film because the couple sitting behind me was laughing hysterically. Of course, they could just laugh at it. I could hardly blame them.
