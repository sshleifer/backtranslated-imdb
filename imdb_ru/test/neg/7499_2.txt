Am I the only one who thinks this is a bad movie? <br /> <br /> I admit that horror films often lack such things as a big story, a good acting game, or even good special effects. But the way these flaws are found in this film is surprisingly pitiful. <br /> <br /> Pathetic story: the idea of ​​raping the vagina, which takes revenge, turning into a cannibal, sounds pretty funny, but the fact that the author invented it is stupid. <br /> <br /> Bad behavior: actors move like puppets. They play and look like people who are really trying their best, but completely unable to act. <br /> <br /> Bad effect: especially the van blast looks incredibly cheap. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that a director who made some good films during his career switches to such dirty things.
