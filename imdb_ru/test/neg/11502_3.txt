This show is pretty good and fun to watch, this is a great show on the Disney channel, and sometimes entertaining. <br /> <br /> I really liked the first season, but I hated the second and third seasons. This show has completely changed around. In the first season, it was more about science and animals, what was left of the season and the third season. More about her life and dating. Since this funny guy (Ben) appeared, this show has sucked. The screenwriters gave a great show for children and turned it into a crappy youthful comedy. Disney turned to the worst. I can no longer watch the latest episodes, they are all garbage.
