The reports about the brilliance of this film seem to be greatly exaggerated, and if other reviewers have not watched another film, I do not see how anyone can find in this film anything other than boring, not scary, not creepy, too long. , and at times unbearably annoying, I'm not some stupid horror fanatic. I love j-horror and euro-horror because of American horror any day, but I feel the need to warn all potential viewers about this film before they spend two hours on it in their lives. <br /> <br /> He could have been so great. The reporter is investigating a series of strange deaths and incidents that seem to be unconnected, but it seems that they are connected by a series of nervous paths - dead pigeons, deaf noises, the presence of strangely connected knots ... Our reporter moves from person to person, interviews them, rents them and then pass on. Among this multitude of people there are three important characters: a young, shy psychic girl, an extremely annoying, insane psychic, and a crazy old woman and her boy, the importance of which is not revealed until late. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the film is not even remotely interesting, which makes its two-hour show unforgivable. It is also not even remotely scary or creepy. Presumably scary scenes, such as shots of disgusting faces, are made incredibly poorly, shown twice or worse, they tell us when they are about to happen. Other techniques, such as the message that the family I had just interviewed "died five days later," simply do not bother me, let alone sneak in on it. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, the film rises a bit when our reporter, cameraman, psychic and cursed woman go to the village to “lift” the curse that binds all these deaths. However, by that time I was in a state of catatonic boredom, and I didn’t care, so all the pretty creepy camera work and shocks were wasted. The “last recording” is pretty good, but I gave up caring again and just wanted this movie to end. <br /> <br /> Boring and boring, not scary and not terrible, I would advise you to continue from Noray. This has some promising moments, but this is a film that was poorly made and not worth your time.
