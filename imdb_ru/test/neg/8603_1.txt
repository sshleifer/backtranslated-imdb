Christopher Tookie of the Daily Mail had a few things to say about this film, including “watching it throughout 82 miserable minutes, and I guarantee that you will shake your head and ask:“ We really went down to this ? “Yes, we have, because if the film has ever testified to complete cynicism, bad taste and moral decay of those who order and shoot British films, then this is the abomination.” Tuki continues "directly aimed at assholes with unwashed underwear, dirty minds and knuckles that graze on the asphalt when they walk, this sexual comedy is so disgusting, unmixed and smelly that is enough to throw you away from sex and even movies to the whole life "before the conclusion" The Sexual Lives of Male Potatoes "is not just a truly vile film, it is a symptom of a new national culture of instant self-satisfaction, hobby and sadism, which is now celebrated on the screen." Usually I do not listen to critics, but in this case, Tuki was hit with money. This film goes beyond the bad, in fact it goes beyond the merely ridiculous and enters some freakish parallel universe where every painful minute lasts for an hour and where the definition of “fun” seems to “say that b * t with focusing on Brammy. ”This depresses anyone with a half-meter who grew up with Goody, Monty Python, Spitting, and not with“ Nine Watch News ”and“ Faltie Towers. ” <br /> <br /> Ideally, the sexual lives of the men should have disappeared unnoticed after the release of their cinema and joined the equally terrible spin-off of Vix The Fat Slags (2004) and the ill-fated All Saints Honest car (2000) at the celluloid cemetery, but, as it seems, intended for endless late night fullness of the schedule shows and the fallacy of "the best movie ever!" I don’t know people who should know better, so I have to apologize in advance for trying to correct the mistake that the British film industry, with all its wisdom, put to the undeserved world. Yes, I really apologize for returning it from the dead celluloids, but in fact I remember thinking: “It cannot be as bad as the critics said” ... but since God is my witness, it was OK . <br /> <br /> Acting - terrible from beginning to end, a special mention of Mackenzie "Albert Stepto's legs on the body of a young man" Kruk. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack - cut and paste a “rock”, mainly a rock-based pajama machine with a pub jukebox that brings back terrible memories of how these funny cockers playing Lambeth Walk became imitations of madness Specials knob-shiners Madness in every comedy / pop in the eighties ... and Motorhead "Ace Of Spades" as the title music? What the hell ... trying to bring back memories of one of the most truly exciting scenes ever offered by Young, really ever offered by ANY comedy show ?! A cheap shot, far below the belt. <br /> <br /> Scenario — written by a 12-year-old who just read each of the back issues of Smut and Zit in one long session tucked in by Red Bull ... MANDATORY? Come on, not a single real, normal, worldly, adult man could put such backward garbage on paper? And Mark Gatiss was in that ... Mark Gatiss ... the least annoying member of the League of Gentlemen and Fans of Goodies, taking part in such a high pile of blown-up cinematic excrement? "One of the brightest British comedy stars"? No, no more! As for the "League of Gentlemen," someone gives me a pair of diver's lead boots and Steve's face, like Pemberton's collapsed rectum, and a long weekend in a soundproofed room before I die ... PLEASE ... <br /> Cinema, British or other, just not much worse than that. Kent Bateman's “Headless Eyes” (1971) is a masterpiece of a new wave compared to this disgusting thug.
