The warning may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I just regretted spending 5 bucks on this film on Amazon, and I wish I had spent it. I have never seen lame terrible special effects or acting skills. I mean, Jack-0 is just a ridiculous monster, and his costume looks like you can buy it at a Halloween store or make it yourself. Acting is just awful, especially Sean Kelly, I mean, come on, he's so pathetic with his little lines “Who, get me, Pumpkinman,” I laughed so hard at it, just silly. I mean, the film is so terrible that he had to spend a few minutes of nudity on it so that people would not turn it off at a low level. I think the funniest scene is when a woman sticks a butter knife into the toaster and gets an electric shock. I mean, come on, it looked so fake and stupid that I could buy it at any Halloween store or do it myself. Well, I recommend not watching this stupid movie, because it will be a time when you will never return.
