This film is really bad, trying to create a scientific explanation for the zombies, always end up depriving him of confidence in the history of the film. About the film I could point out so many things that I could write a book about how much the film sucks. For example, there were about 50 people on the plane, they killed about 100, and they continued to arrive, apparently, a “virus” causes complications from the liver, because everyone has yellow eyes, and the virus causes people to roar like lions or something that kind of thing, and the virus not only regenerates tissue, as it also gives superhuman strength, not to mention the fact that this virus spoils people's hair. It is also important to note that if you shoot someone with a pistol (it probably only happens on airplanes), that person is kicked into the air. Remember that if you escort a prisoner on an airplane and lose him, always look inside the bottle-size drawers and cabinets, you never know where these bastards will hide. And if by any chance you can land a plane full of zombies on a mountain and survive (this happens all the time), watching dozens of people die, just walk away from the plane, watch the sun rise and joke about the dating of the flight. duty. :)
