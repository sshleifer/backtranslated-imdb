Are you kidding me? This is possibly the worst amateur movie I've ever seen. The casting was terrible, the acting skills were worse than terrible, and I apologize, the guy at the speed of the picnic who loaded his plate full of food was almost meaningless somewhere, and the demonic turd and pot pursuing Drew were nothing more than funny. When I flock about the bell tower, I wanted to believe. I read some literature and thought it sounded believable. But this film just ruined it. Rick White (director, screenwriter, lead actor, etc.). Takes himself too seriously, and I think he gives himself a little more than he deserves ... Do yourself a favor ... skip this.
