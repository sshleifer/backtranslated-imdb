When I write this, Norman Wisdom is a very bewildered old man who spends most of his waking life, giggling and shouting out old tricks from his increasingly suicidal nurse. <br /> <br /> Indeed, by the time you read this, he will probably join the hereafter, and the obituaries will record an almost 80-year career of hysterical making fun from a cute funnel with a curved checkered cap. What most of these obituaries do not remember is how Norman Wisdom already committed suicide back in the late 1960s with this stunningly poor, but strangely compelling, final article in his film career. <br /> <br /> ominous with off ?? "Tony Tenser Gifts" are the titles. Have you scratched your head ?? "Where have I seen this name before?" Well, the names of the cheapest and dirtiest British films of the 1970s, so just choose. <br /> <br /> Then does it say ?? "Menachem Golan Production". Oh dear. <br /> <br /> From what I can see, the following follows: "Confession from the rest camp and the last tango in Paris." Sponsored by the Southport Tourism Board. <br /> <br /> Norman Wisdom is very versatile, because here is Norman Wisdom (or its variety). Even in such garbage, he never loses his form and somehow makes you look through his fingers apart, while he paws and dribbles the ball across the (obviously insane) Sally Gison. Tony Tenser and Menachem Golan were between them responsible for some real cinematic horrors, but the bedroom scene in a cinematic atrocity is reborn. By the way, Sally is very good at playing the role of a sex toy with a lobotomy. <br /> <br /> I wonder if any of the crazy young cats who populate parties in this film can think of themselves in a quiet moment? “Old Norman + sex + hippies. Get me out of this mess !! ”I guess it was payday for them. <br /> <br /> Although I feel sorry for “Cute Things”. They probably thought, “Yes! It will be the same for us as Blow Up for the Yardbirds. ” <br /> <br /> And the career of senior Norman this year is over. Freezing your little balls in Southport. <br /> <br /> I once was there. It was a depressing place.
