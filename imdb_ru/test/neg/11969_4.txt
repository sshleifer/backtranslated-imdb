"The scarecrow became wild: he is the death of the party!" Do I need to say more? The wild scarecrow received four out of ten stars from me for one simple reason: besides the terrible game, the plot holes, the cheap special effects and the anti-climate whistle, it was cinema gold! I think this film could have been really good if the scarecrow turned out to be a baseball coach (as Ken Shamrock depicted as very brilliant). But then again, they would have to turn off these AWESOME Jedi Return electric effects. <br /> <br /> While watching this film, my friends and I made sure that it was written by one of our friends, a stereotypical teenage boy. In this film, women with topless women, with terrible fake blood and dialogues that could not get out of a paper bag or, in this case, a corn field. <br /> <br /> If I could ask the director one thing, it would be; "How much did you have to pay a teenager who wrote this for you?"
