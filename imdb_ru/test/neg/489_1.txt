Contains spoilers <br /> <br /> But if you were not dropped on your head as a child, and then used as a soccer ball, you will agree with me that this is one of the worst and at the same time funny TV shows ever created . By focusing on a woman who, in her youth, was beaten by her father, who also killed her mother, she spends her time drawing, but waits for him, then she becomes her superhero drawings and continues to fight crime, so she is “drawn by pain”, clever. The story itself is actually normal, but it’s made like this; Jesse, the writer and director, doesn’t know how to write the script, just listen to the monologue with the 8-year-old hero, and it sounds like he was written by a 30-year-old man while her father, who has big mustache, just hum He looked around the house all day, looking angry, just showing how bad the characteristic is, especially where he gets angry in the first episode and starts repeating the phrase “no more”, holding his wife's head before killing her using a marble work surface. The next pounding sound effect and just his terrible behavior, because everything he can transmit is angry, just brilliant, including after he goes to beat his daughter, using his belt, which is all done to him, groans and looking angry in slow motion themselves episode You can easily have a nice clean script longer than 5 minutes, but oh no, Jesse doesn't want that. Little Jesse, making fun of postmodernism, as if he had just eaten Donnie Darko, and then plunged into himself. Stupid camera jerks, all at odd angles, excessively repetitive lines and even meaningless sequences, were simply confused from time to time to fill in too long episodes. In conclusion, the idea is not bad, it's just the way it is done, there is also a wonderful fat man character on the bench who isn’t fit and good enough, I just want to hug his chubby Lil cheeks because they look so soft. Character development does not exist, since the main character simply says the first philosophical sound that comes to her head, although they all contradict each other. But in general, basically s ** t <br /> <br /> Indiana Jones 4, nevertheless, much better, write "Jeeharv" in you-tube, the results may also make you mourn the beauty of the world. You will hear a lot of cheap sexy jokes, mostly funny ones.
