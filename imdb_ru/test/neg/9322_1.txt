Don't get me wrong, I love most of the films of Paul Schrader, so it was with excitement that I was able to attend the Rolling Thunder show in a French cinema in Paris with a surprise movie on December 17, 2004. Of course, the surprise of the film was the Exorcist, and most people were there for that (me too). The film was then finished, but the score, so P. Schreider used excerpts from The Return of the King and some other films that I forgot (was it Conan?). In any case, besides this the film was completed. The lucky few there (maybe 200 people) were ordered not to write about the film on the Internet or magazines, as this could jeopardize his chance to attend the Cannes Film Festival. Then came the film, then came the realization that the film could not be chosen for the Festival because of its quality: never in my life I had such an awkward feeling in the audience when people moved from skepticism to frank laughter out loud at the pitiful sight. I could not believe how the authors of Light Sleeper, Mishima, Blue Collar and Affliction woke low. <br /> <br /> Forced excessive play, complete idiotic finale, black and white moral, terrible effects, the worst look at Christianity in Schrader, not even hopeless, just damn boring (without a pun) and not at all amazing! Some good locations, but, unfortunately, have not been used, or at least have not justified the original hopes! In the end, I was 100 times more pleased with the Rolling Thunder created by Schröder and wished me 2 hours ago. <br /> <br /> Do not believe the hype, even John Boorman’s film is more exciting and original. Oh, and the casting of Billy Crawford, the poor fellow does his best, but what do you expect? Now he is part of a small club of the worst mistakes in history! I give the film 1/5 just because I did not leave the room, but I had to.
