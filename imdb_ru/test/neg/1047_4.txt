I watched this episode with high hopes, seeing it in the list of favorite episodes of many people. I do not brag in any way, but from the very beginning I realized that they were in some kind of toy box / can, with a huge look looking at them, at the type of characters there. Despite the fact that throughout the episode the questions “Who are we?”, “Where are we?”, “What is outside?” Without knowing the episode (which, unfortunately, I already understood), I must say that different types of characters and The interaction between them made the episode quite interesting. Although the turn of the story might have been harder to guess if ALL of them were (toy) soldiers.
