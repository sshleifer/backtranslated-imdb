This is not a hard story. This is not a mystery or plot for which you have to spend time watching, because you missed the inside of the dialogue. The statement that the film needs to be watched several times to “get it” may apply to very few films, however this is not one of them. Films of this type have content and are so involved that it is easy to miss an important part of the dialogue or a subtle nuance to portray the details that you might have missed. With Goya Ghosts this does not apply. The main disadvantage of this film is the lack of details. He moves from one character to another, never giving enough content to any one scene to allow the participation of those who watch. Because of this, you do not associate with any of the characters. You have not reached the point that you care. Either the main actor is gone just as the film seems like he is going to redeem himself, or their actions are mean, and you are still not inclined. Goya’s refusal to go very far to help Ines is a good example. His refusal to assume a further reflection of the general tone of his part. The only characters you can sense for a moment are Inez when she is interrogated and then tortured. After her rape Lorenzo all attention to her character almost disappeared. After this, the only other deep involvement comes from the best scenes in the film dedicated to the invitation of Lorenzo to dine with the family Ines, and her fathers are trying with all their might to make Lorenzo sign a fake confession and return his daughter. Then, when things start to develop again, they disappear from the film. I read a lot of comments here that the film didn’t know what it wanted to be, and so on. D. I found that it mostly succeeded in that it meant nothing. After the return of Lorenzo and the occasional viewing of his daughter Ines Goya, everything seemed no more than far-fetched. Without a storyline, no attempt was made to truly explore the turbulent times in which they lived. The essence of who Goya was was not materializing, except for his actions or the absence of such, arguing that he is more selfish than anything else. As for his art, the film seemed to intend to explore several pictures, which he did, but again provided another opportunity to explore the reaction to this work, rather than the work itself. Summing up, we can say that the film did not have cohesion, it clearly did not have enough substance to delve into the historical environment that he covered, and at the end you felt that what you just saw was a series of failed attempts the viewer. switching from one thing to another, without involving the viewer in any of them. You cannot watch something like this several times, expecting that it will improve with additional research. There simply is not enough to waste time. This is not the case when you missed something, it would be another proof that the ingredients needed to create a good film are simply missing. As for the best movie ever made? This is not even the best movie I watched today.
