QUICK (1 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> A pretty bad movie ... an old story about a high-ranking gangster who wants to leave, handing over his empire to his inept son it's hard to just leave ... so a contract is made in his life. After a big party, a fighter is called to the stage (Jennifer Jason Lee, who, I think, * will never * act on anything other than television films or low-budget live video broadcast). Our "hero" makes her pass ... offering her big money for "fast" ... she refuses his offer, although she needs money ... but still stays for the night ... even after being brutally persecuted by an overly zealous son who thinks she was sent to kill his father. Ugh. The story just goes on and on ... You can see every turn and turn that goes a mile. A strange soundtrack from some band called "The Tiger Lillies" will drive most people crazy ... but I thought that by the end there was one cool track. Or maybe I was just thrilled because I could say the movie was almost over? Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer ... what the hell happened to you?
