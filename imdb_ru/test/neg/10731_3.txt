You know, I once made this film at a local video store, a type of decoration film that simply holds out a hand and tells you to "rent me." Well, if you see this boring movie in your video store, pass by. Fighting the urge to make porn because this movie is BOOOoooorrrring. Despite an interesting beginning, the film turns into recurring murders, and the smoked policeman stumbles, solving common problems (wife, bastard boss, etc.). Want to know if the fast forward function works on your VCR? Rent this movie and experience your problems.
