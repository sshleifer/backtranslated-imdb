This is a completely forgotten picture. My friend picked it up in a trash can at a local box office for $ 50. He should have requested a refund. Or at least a discount. <br /> <br /> The plot is something like this: a giant monster threatens the earth, and aliens decide that the most average person on the planet must be chosen to save the Earth. Thus, a tiny holographic space alien arrives in front of a postal worker and tells him that he is “this.” <br /> <br /> The devil is in the details when it is time to evaluate the film, and on this score Zarkorr! The invader fails miserably. The monster Zarcorr has only a few short moments on the screen, which can reach 5 minutes (with a high score). The cute alien hologram has even less screen time and is probably the most interesting character to watch, and only because she is wearing a stereotypical “tiny bupper” dress, complemented by a teasing, short pleated skirt. The climatic final battle with the monster was over before one could say "Tango whiskey, Foxtrot is over." The next moment you have to wonder if you just survived a train wreck, or someone just drank 3 pints of blood out of you. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, this film really gave one line, that my friends and I still still repeat and laugh, and this was the only bright spot on this otherwise deplorable picture. Since the “main characters” group is “interrogated” with a gun, one of them answers the questions with the statement “What are you, some questioning question?” you actually persuaded your friend to watch it), you can actually experience a howl or two of incredulous laughter. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this is not Manos or Ego (it’s not even bad enough to be classically bad), this film will still tire you with its terrible dialogue, unimaginable characters and non-existing special effects and still deserve to populate the bottom 100. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
