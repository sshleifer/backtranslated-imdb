This film has some good performances, as others have indicated, but suffer (as others have pointed out, with the exception of people who are obviously either director's friends or actors, otherwise to explain why they consider this “10”) from some shy and absorbed film school pads and extra plots. This is a type of plot that “Sex in the City” could process in a half-hour episode, so there was no reason for it to be even an 88-minute film. A great example of wasted material is the quick installation in the first third of the film. Some of the background stories deserve attention, but, for example, too much time was spent on the character Daria with the guy having anal sex and on the background of Paulie, who was not a realistic character, although the actor did a decent job from the line he was given. <br /> <br /> The worst aspect of the film was the level of amateur roles: from typos in typed material to unsuccessful jumps and edits, poor camera position, camera angles, lighting problems everywhere and, most obviously, a poorly written script with a poorly designed concept . If the writer (also the director and presenter) collaborated with someone, he might not get a 100% rotten score on “Rotten Tomatoes”, which further reinforces the ability of someone to truly believe the people who gave him 10 system here.
