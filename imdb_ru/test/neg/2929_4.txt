The visual and sound art-house exposition created by Kiarosta is a surprise. For the director, known for his stories and keen observation of people, especially children, this excursion into minimalist cinema begs the question: why did he do that? Was it that he was busy on vacation on the beach? <br /> <br /> “Five, five long duplicates” consists, as you have already guessed, of five long duplicates. They (the names are my own names and approximate time): <br /> <br /> "Snags and waves". The camera stands almost motionless, looking at a small piece of snag when it is moved by small waves splashing on the beach. Ten minutes. <br /> <br /> "Monitoring people on the boardwalk." The camera stares at the ocean horizon and boardwalk. People go through the camera frame, their faces are too vague to make them interesting. Eleven minutes. <br /> <br /> Six dogs at the water's edge. The camera still looks at the horizon of the ocean with a sandy beach nearby. Far at the water’s edge, six dogs do little, just rest. Sixteen minutes. <br /> <br /> "Ducks in line, flock of ducks." The camera still looks at the ocean horizon at the water's edge. Dozen and dozen ducks flow in one file from left to right. I assume that Kiarostami released them gradually. The last two ducks stop on their way, and suddenly a flock of ducks quietly rolls from right to left. I assume that Kiarostami collected the ducks and reissued all at the same time. This is not the first time he has dealt with the contrast between organized and unorganized behavior. Eight minutes. <br /> <br /> “Symphony of frogs, oops, I mean cacophony for a stormy night.” The camera stands over the pond at night. It is completely black, with the exception of what appears to be a reflection of the moon on undulating water. It is a stormy night and the clouds are racing to cover the moon. The screen goes blank. For us, there remains a cacophony of frogs, howling dogs and, in the end, morning roosters. Hit me on the head if it was done at once. I saw this segment as a sound composition collected in the editing room and accompanied by a simple visualization. Twenty seven minutes! <br /> <br /> With the exception of the slightly funny ducks, this exercise in minimalism left me alone. An inessential movie for Kiarostami fans. <br /> <br /> I thought I would rate Five for five, but four is what it deserves. <br /> <br /> The film is about Yasujiru Ozu.
