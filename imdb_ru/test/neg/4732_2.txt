Holy crap, the beginning is taken from where the first one stopped (good start). Then he goes down from there. You looked as if you were watching television, and you continue to switch between this teen soap opera, the movie Predator and some kind of shitty detective show. Characters presented in the first ten minutes have nothing to do with each other until the last 45 minutes or so (characters of a soap opera for teenagers and a real story about aliens). <br /> <br /> Then, towards the end, the producers did not have enough money, and they decided to finish the film, so they decided to throw a nuclear bomb on the city. <br /> <br /> PS - What the hell is that with cameras like that? magnified, can't you tell what's going on? Seriously, filmmakers do well with battle scenes and get to the place where we can see the fight.
