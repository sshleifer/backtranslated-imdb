Well, firstly, for most, I just wanted to say that I retired after writing well-deserved comments about horrible movies. Only a movie called “Crazy Crazy” can bring me back, so I'm here. <br /> <br /> With that said, I would like to start with this comment. Oh !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This film was really terrible, I mean, I know it will be bad. But I had no idea that I would spend 60 minutes from a possible 90-minute film, laughing at what I considered a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the biggest drawback of the film (for me it is). Ken Shamrock. Now, if my memory serves me, Shamrock is one of the most dangerous people in the world. Now, if my memory serves me again, he was also in this stupid film a silly comic relief (or, as it seemed to me). I mean, how else do you explain all his lines. My favorite line is in this so-called film - “It has not been for a long time”. OK????????? The funny thing about this line was that no more than five minutes before he said that he was sitting on the beach and talking to the dead children soon that the stuffed dam could not be killed. Therefore, if he knows about it, why should he begin to try to fight him as soon as he sees it (stuffed, what it is). As I said earlier, he must have been a comic relief, except that I do not think his UFC pals were laughing. <br /> <br /> Now that I’ve finished this well-deserved paragraph for the film. <Br /> <br /> I admit that I can't remember many scenes, and this is not good, considering that I just watch the movie no more than fifteen minutes ago. So what I'm going to do is list the five wrong things in this movie 1. Usually, when a monster from a horror movie has its own theme, neither the victims, nor even the monster itself can hear it. So why almost everyone involved in this film is capable of this pitiful whistle. I mean, I saw a scarecrow's face, and nothing in him said that he was a whistle. <br /> <br /> 2. For what reason were the killings on the beach. Sorry, but the discarded history of the beaches is associated with a party and a feeling of relaxation. But I think this horror movie thought it would be so successful that it would change all that. Plus it was me or the beach, it seems the size of a living room. I mean that every time an actor or actress ran along the beach, it seemed that they were running in the same place. <br /> <br /> 3. The girl runs in gray sweatpants. It really worries throughout the film. I mean, she looks so funny. Plus, it didn't help that she looked like she was the youngest of the group. I mean, what was she at twelve or so. There is no excuse for someone to be so skinny on camera. I mean, doesn't the camera add ten pounds or something like that, and what was her excuse. <br /> <br /> 4. People are trying to get recordings of deals on camera. Just when I thought that this film could not be more pleasant, it turns out that I want to be Gort Brooks, and oh my gosh, he's lame. I do not remember the whole scene, but as far as I remember, it was not beautiful. This guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing to do, and I have nothing to do with what happens in the film. The funniest part of it is how everyone seems to enjoy it. I mean the only person who really doesn't know how to react to this is the “black guy.” And that's sad because, if I'm not mistaken, he was the one who encourages this latest addition of American Idol. But that's where it gets funny. While this guy is all in his new song or something like that. In the far distance, we see or villain aka scarecrow. And boy, he seems offended by this. I mean, there is a moment when he looks like he really envies this guy. So what he does with this jealousy, well, I'm glad you ask. He waits for the guy to finish his song, and then he finishes the guy. I don't want to play the death scene, but I can tell you that. If this scene does not make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will exist. <br /> <br /> 5. This film was much longer than I expected. And it didn't help that they tried to pull out a few wretched spinning bulls at the end to squeeze out another 10 minutes from this movie. I mean, I admit, I did not expect the turn to be narrated, but this was largely due to the fact that I hoped the film was finished and finished. But no, they should have done, they are spinning with ** t. It goes without saying that when I say this, I just turned off T.V. and said that the hell this film could not get worse. Thanks to my fairly quick judgment, I can say that I will never know what was going to happen next. But I promise that I don't care !!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything and the whole movie is good for laughs, but please do not buy it. Just unwind it to one of your friends and look there in the open spaces.
