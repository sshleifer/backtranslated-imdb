I know a couple of people who look like the main actress in this film (or at least the character she portrays). They all give me goosebumps, and I will be the last person to lend one of them a gun, even a sharp knife. She has one sneaky and ugly expression. If you can make her feel some sympathy, let me know. <br /> <br /> Of course, I could have the same expressions of anxiety and fear if I had an imaginary friend who had killed my real friends and acquaintances for the last 15 years. <br /> <br /> And for our European friends at IMDb, I’m sad to say that, yes, some colleges and universities in the United States conduct courses on paranormal phenomena, relying on pathetic defense, which is “academic freedom” and request. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth your time. You will have no sympathy for any of the characters (with the exception of Aunt Lydia, who leaves very early), and the plot does not make sense.
