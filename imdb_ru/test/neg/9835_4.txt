“The Girl in the Love Alley” is one strange little low-budget film. At first glance, the film tells of a hard wanderer named Bix (Brett Halsey), who spends his time looking after a little child named Danny (Lowell Brown) and girlfriend Carrie (Joyce Meadows) that Bix meets, who like to look after him. Nothing too interesting happens (Bix leaves Carrie, Bix rescues Danny out of trouble, Carrie’s father drinks a lot, etc.), until the film has about 10 minutes to kill Carrie. Her father blames Bix, pulls him out of a prison cell and almost beats him to death. Now their roles are reversed, and Danny has to save Bicks. <br /> <br /> Until I read the reviews on IMDb, I thought that maybe I’m just reading more about the relationship of Bix and Danny than it really was, but now I see that I’m not alone. It was completely obvious to me that in the early days Bicks and Danny had more relationships than you usually see in the 1959 film. The homosexual nature of their relationship, although never expressed openly, is still quite obvious. Their living and sleeping conditions, Bix’s reaction to the fact that he found Danny in bed with a prostitute, Beeks’s inability to commit Carrie, and that phone call at the end when Danny tells his parents that he “brings a friend home” Here are some examples of the inevitable conclusion that there is more to their relationship than it seems at first glance. I'm sure they exist, but I can't remember a single film I saw in the 50s that shouted to homosexuals as loudly as this one. <br /> Regarding the movie, I don’t know of another way to express it, it’s boring. As I wrote earlier, nothing much happens for 90% of the execution time. Characters are boring and the actors are not good enough to give The Girl in Lovers Lane a special spark. The only exception is Jack Elam. His crazy Jesse is a character interesting enough to be worth seeing. Elam had a terrible slap! But I think the biggest problem I encountered in the film was with character motivation and logic. d and Bix immediately blamed? What about the crazy Jesse who has been pursuing Kerry, probably all her life? Anyone think of asking Jesse where he was that night? Her father saw him disturbing Carrie at the diner, but he never thought that the nasty Jesse could have anything to do with his daughter's death? There is not much logic there. What about the recognition of Jesse? Is Danny grabbing Jesse by the lapel, and is that all it takes to get Jesse to confess? A real cool guy, huh? Why is he so easily recognized? And after he confesses, no one thinks to grab him? Jesse is very nice to just stay in place and not run away. In any other reality, he would never have spilled his gut and would have run like a rabbit if he had been arrested for murder. The fact that “The girl in the alley of lovers” asks me to accept these absurd actions by the characters is something I don’t want to do. In general, I give “Girl in Lavers Lane” 4/10.
