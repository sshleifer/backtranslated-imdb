If you live in the suburbs, are relatively well off financially and are not particularly familiar with the urban life of England, then this comedy is for you. Not what a mass audience would do, but if you are like these characters, they show that you will love it in pieces. In general, this is a comedy over which the snobs on the BBC will sit back and laugh for their own pleasure and only a few select viewers. Comparing it with BBC Comedys, such as Only Fools and Horses, Fawlty Towers, Black Adder and other classics, this series tends to move from the usual BBC product to the audience and deliver something like folk culture.
