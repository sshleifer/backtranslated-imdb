The film of Peter Yeats from the pen of Steve Tesic is a rather reserved “thriller”, which really does not manage to get off the ground. The story concerns the mysterious murder of an influential Asian business man and the subsequent investigation of a miserable Vietnamese veteran (James Woods), who is believed by the police, may have avenged his former employer. As a “Witness”, William Hurt never believes that his friend is capable of such an act. <br /> <br /> It hurts far below his usual strength, and it is difficult to sympathize with him or not inspired by Sigourney Weaver. James Woods and Christopher Plummer do a bit better at supporting. It is worth noting the appearance of Morgan Freeman in the role of detective Black. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the story of Steve Tesic is just an unlikely novel, dressed like a mysterious film. The plot is too contrived. <br /> <br /> Friday, October 17, 1997 - Video
