I hate to comment on what I didn’t finish, but if I spared one person who I sat for almost an hour before turning it off with disgust, it’s worth it <br /> <br /> I decided to look at it with an open mind, knowing it was on the bottom 100. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. I usually like rude humor, or at least can stand it. I love the so-called "black" comedy. I am also not easily offended. <br /> <br /> It all started well and quickly went downhill. I laughed a few times (for example, when the protagonist was stuck in the toilet of the plane), but that was all, and it did not compensate for the strong disgust that I felt. <br /> <br /> I didn’t laugh when the dog got into the jet engine. I usually do not see the humor of dying animals (except in Animal House). I did not laugh at most of this nastiness. I turned it off after an incident involving blind and baked potatoes, the details of which I don’t want to repeat, only that the wave of nausea still has not passed by me. <br /> <br /> Simply put, it was filled with mud and just not funny with almost any plot. This is one of the times when you have nothing to say, you have to tell about it. <br /> <br /> Do not say that I did not warn you.
