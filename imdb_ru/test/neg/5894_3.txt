We will never know the truth about 9/11. And this stupid movie proves it. <br /> <br /> I recently watched on YouTube a message that there were no planes in the destruction of the Twin Towers; that all the news programs were supposedly supplied with cadres of towers from the mysterious source (probably gubmint?) at the same angle, and that the provided CGI footage of the planes were replaced with real SEND that actually hit the towers .... <br /> <br /> This is a convincing video, and although I am not a Wako conspiracy theorist as such, I am still not sure whether real planes hit that day (Towers, Shanksville, Pentagon field) - because no available wreckage of the aircraft. (What about these notorious "black boxes"? None of them have been restored.) There are a million other theories, they all care for a drop of Truth flooded in the ocean of speculation. But you will drown in malaria before you find anything that is truthful or worthy of attention in the Commission Report of 9/11, a budget-less film that tries to close the door of the barn after all the horses and jihadists have escaped. <br /> <br /> Writer-director Lee Scott is obviously a worried American citizen who wanted to enlighten the audience about what the 560-page report can reveal. It would be helpful if there were actors in his film, and not a guy who looked like David Duchovny, a chicken that looked like Gene Gershon, a guy who considered himself Russell Crow, and another guy who, I am sure, is trying very hard to become Shawn Binomial. This would help if his camera operator did not have Parkinson's; if the lighting director did not try to save on electricity; this would help if its editor did not have attention deficit disorder, or if the soundtrack was not some kind of carefree esoteric of a new world order; and looping probably had to be inserted when people were actually moving their mouths. <br /> <br /> We cannot even call it propaganda. This is too funny. And by funny, I mean inaccessible for observation. <br /> <br /> You cannot squeeze this complex question into a two-hour film, but Lee Scott still tries, including all these sexy flashy phrases that we are used to: Bin Laden’s intention to attack, purchase weapons in Somalia, non-aggression agreement with Iraq, visiting Moussavi flight school, weapons of mass destruction ... <br /> <br /> The problem is that we know that all this is retrospective, so every discussion that interested intelligence officers are with each other smells fake backdating, everything is squeezed into a neat talk thief. Like contrived reverse engineering, everything that is relevant is mentioned briefly, so we can be surprised at how incompetently all these branches of government screwed up. <br /> <br /> There is an absurd scene of interrogation with a beating similar to a madman. guy with tomato sauce on his face. Now it would be considered torture if most guys did not think it was exciting. <br /> <br /> Slogan: “What if the attack could have been stopped?” Judging from the description of this film - and, we believe, according to the Commission’s report - the CIA and other underground agencies were set up to capture bin Laden and didn’t of this. Everyone who is involved in “terrorist” reports (do you mean that you actually read these reports?) Are so worried that we just want to slap them for their bad activities. <br /> <br /> However, this whole story is much deeper than the banal sound of the bytes of the careless Ku Bush Clan imposed on the American people after 9/11. We now know that even the seizure of bin Laden before the September 11 attacks would not change or reach anything - the wheels were in motion with or without the Taliban frontman, whose participation was a possible manifestation of someone’s inflamed imagination to unite America against common enemy, Contrary to popular belief, "they" did not "attack us." When Ron Paul tried to explain, it was a case of a Middle Eastern strike - “they” were so tired of America that they put their infidels “there”, that they brought the war “here”. So, although George W. Death likes to advertise meaningless words: “We fight with them there, so that we don’t have to fight with them here,” in fact, “because we are there, the fight was transferred here”. <br /> <br /> The September 11 attack was not so much connected with the complex planning of terrorists, as with the gross negligence of the Bush administration, which, as we know (without investigating the commissions), had all the information from the Clinton administration and beyond; information on terrorist cells reaching critical mass and their intention to cause chaos. But the oil idiot from Texas, who refused to read his daily briefings and would rather have a rest at his Crawford ranch than spend another day at work, canceled the responsibility he had vowed to fulfill - to protect the American public. <br /> <And then the scumbag who called himself president used attacks caused by his negligence as a political hammer against his own disadvantaged compatriots to put on a second term, destroy the American constitution and take America to a false war on the basis of lies (WMD) with a country that had nothing to do with the attacks of September 11th. Strangely enough, the film never comes near the Ku Bush Klan, without offering any opinion or judgment, and Lee Scott wants to remain neutral. Tell the raped and ransacked hundreds of thousands of them during the fake war on terror in Iraq. <br /> <br /> By pure coincidence, I realized that I was watching this DVD, putting on “Bush lied. Thousands died. ” T-shirt.
