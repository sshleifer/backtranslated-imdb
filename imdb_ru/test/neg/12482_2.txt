It's just awful. I’m sorry every second of the 80 minutes I spent watching this tree. I think it should be a comedy, but I don’t remember to laugh a lot, with the exception of a few glaring inconsistencies and outright scandalous mistakes. <br /> <br /> An unattractive middle-aged man named Lester meets a rich unattractive middle-aged woman with the help of a lonely heart advertisement, and then kills them for the money he needs to feed his addiction to gambling. This is the whole plot, and this is really all that happens. Incidentally, an intrigue is attempted when Lester begins to receive phone calls from a mysterious stranger who scoffs at him to learn his secret, but he is so poorly implemented that you may not understand what is really going to happen. The sequences in which Lester kills rich widows are rather cruel, but seem to be dressed like comedies. In one episode, a woman is beaten with a wooden pole and then shoved into the oven. This is very cruelly portrayed, but it plays out against the scandalous music of the big band waltz, with Lester stretching faces and accepting comedy poses everywhere. In another scene, the victim is killed, and she constantly sings shrill opera songs ... you have to see it to believe it! In fact - you shouldn't see it at all, in fact, I strongly recommend that you avoid this flop. Fulci doesn't seem to know what kind of hat he is wearing, and there is no sign of any talent seen in his earlier career. One sequence seemed to me especially pathetic: a revelation when Lester suddenly realizes that he has no shadow. It seems that Fulci cannot come up with any visual representation of this phenomenon on the screen, so from now on he simply removes the actor as usual, the shadow and all that !! And thus completely blows the whole corner. Either he had a zero effect budget, or he simply did not care to think of a way to show it. Whatever it is, it should give you an idea of ​​how lame this whole project is. I could not even understand much of the film, and there was nothing on the screen that would be worth watching in half the time. Even the final was as flat as a pancake. Real dirt.
