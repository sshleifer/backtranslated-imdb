It was very interesting for me to watch this film, despite the article I read about the director in Tattler magazine. I do not judge films by what the director could or could not do. This feature of the debut was very difficult to observe. I found the split screens distracting from the drama in the film, some of the minor characters gave bad performances, and the film a copy of several other films that I saw. There really was nothing new about it.
