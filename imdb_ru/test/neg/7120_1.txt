All I can say about this movie is absolutely boring. The introduction to the film is perhaps the worst horror movie I've ever seen, I mean that an angry chicken hitting a guy on the head with a frying pan does not frighten, I suppose, what the director wanted for, but in fact it was “softly” funny. <br /> <br /> The acting in this picture was beyond pity; Note to directors: if you are shooting a horror movie, please hire good actors, not a popular young soap star who doesn't know how to behave. <br /> <br /> The death scenes in this film were boring. .. there is no blood, and I am sorry, but horror movies without blood, or a good wait are just stupid. I mean, this girl is killed by hair curled around her in the center of Tokyo, and no one sees how this happens, they just declare her "missing", it's just awesome! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you and your friends want to watch this movie, make sure that you bring a sleeping pill, because I guarantee that you will not reach the end ... I and my friend left, because we didn’t care what happened at the end <br /> <br /> Hooray
