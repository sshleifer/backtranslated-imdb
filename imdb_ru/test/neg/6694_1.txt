This show is probably one of the most boring, most funny shows I have ever seen. While the humor was subtle, and I was all over subtle humor; the jokes were not funny. <br /> <br /> In the series there are about two Kiwis who are over thirty, and they are trying to start their musical career. <br /> <br /> episode where Brett leaves another kiwi during a robbery. Well, the plot idea has potential; but I got the impression that half of the episode was just filler, and the other half was really important to the story. <br /> <br /> I mean, they went on to explain how the one who was left behind felt like a devotee and had a lot of distrust towards the other guy. I have one tip for writers: mention once for idiots who can't figure it out by the way he acts, and move on. <br /> <br /> And I discovered that the characters are annoying, the character who left the other, Brett, seemed overly innocent and naive, and the one who was left behind walked in a monotonous and robotic voice. <br /> <br /> The third character who was the manager of the group was obviously incompetent, but he was the only character I liked. He was also the one who got the show for one star. <br /> <br /> In general, the show, which I am not even going to watch again.
