These films give independent films a bad name! This is just a boring collection of vignettes without any structure. I would not be surprised if the screenwriter was completely stoned. If you want to watch a good comedy featuring stoners, check out Half Baked. This is not a winner, but at least it made me laugh. The film was clearly made on the microbudget. Each scene takes place in someone's house, someone's apartment or in the open air. If the composition was good and the dialogue was interesting, I would have ignored the film’s budget (as in the case of Edward Burns films), but obviously this is not the case this time. <br /> <br /> I am quoting Robert De Niro from The Tale of the Bronx, when I say: "There is nothing worse in the world than wasted talent." Everyone in the cast is talented. Luke Wilson, Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, Jeremy Sisto - all talented performers! And they were all in much better films. Actors give all their strength, but they could not go too far with such a backward script. The only scene I found interesting was Jack Black’s cameo, where he sings a song about being in the forest. And of course, in the beginning there was a short strip club scene, which also seemed attractive to me. <br /> <br /> Characters are uninteresting and the story is almost non-existent. Many films are terrible, but at least you understand their intentions. What was the intention of "Bongwater"? The world will never know. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2 (out of 10)
