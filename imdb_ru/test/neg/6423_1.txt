Recently released on DVD in the USA; just stay away from that. <br /> <br /> I usually give enough foolish space in horror movies; I will settle for something remotely tense, supernatural, eerie, or even just a vaguely interesting concept. This one just stank. I knew that there was a problem when Sarah’s “best friend” in college, who had a lot of screen time, wasn’t even listed on IMDb! I was not surprised without recognizing a single actor, but this character ("Daishe" or "Day-Glo" or whatever her name was), apparently, did not even exist! <br /> <br /> I am so embarrassed that I actually paid rent for this garbage; deeply, very ashamed ...
