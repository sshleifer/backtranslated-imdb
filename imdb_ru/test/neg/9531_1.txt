I am one of those people who respect every director as achieved, every film that I watch, I respect (although I admit that I carefully select) and appreciate what he is. No longer. This is truly one of the worst scenarios I've seen as a movie ... so much so that I was forced to warn others of this. The dialogue was really incredible, the main character was about the last person I would be interested to learn more about. The scene where the old school friend “tells the story as it is” made me laugh only because it was a pathetic attempt to reveal the implications of the plot already concluded. The direction is brisk at best, and filmmaking by numbers at worst. Comparing this film with the atmospheric greatness of a film like Five Easy Pieces is a parody.
