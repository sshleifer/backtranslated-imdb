The children's storyline is ripped off from a lame Hollywood movie, a terrible acting game, a cheerful dialogue and not quite at the height of sex scenes. That's right, another great erotic parody! I really liked this movie! Of course, the game is terrible, but it's part of the fun! The storyline is ridiculous, but some things have to be sacrificed when the story has to revolve around scenes of girl sex on a girl. And because this is only erotic (without penetration), the sex scenes were a bit soft. But this is similar to how the great god of erotic chatter, Russ Meyers, said: "Who really cares that he will fall below the belt." I do not know if I agree with Mr. Meyers on this subject, but damn it, this film entertained me for an hour and a half. I give him C +, it would be nice if they could play more girls to make them look like actresses Russ Myers. Vavoom! Vavoom! ~
