I just caught "Wild Rebels" in one of the archival collections of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and this film was so bad that even the MST3K team could not entertain it. There are some MST3K “goals” that were films, the concepts of which were so grim that they could not be good films (for example, “Green Slime”), and others whose basic premises could be turned into really entertaining films if if their creators had not shattered them in execution. “Wild Rebels” is a film whose main premise was to make a good film three years ago, when Don Siegel sent his remake of The Murderers to Universal. Both films tell about a failed racer, whom a woman-fatal woman seduced while driving a car that made a flight during a robbery committed by a woman’s boyfriend - only in Killer driver was John Cassavetis, the woman was Angie Dickinson and the mastermind of the criminal case but successfully against the type in what turned out to be his last film) was Ronald Reagan. Steve Alaimo, Bobby Byers and Willie Pastrano - this is a real victory! But what REALLY makes “Wild Rebels” a terrible movie is directed by William Graefe (note the emphasis on the final “e” present in his screen note), which has absolutely no sense of tempo and seems to allow everyone a shot. ran at least half again, as long as it is necessary, to emphasize its drama. The only pity is that someone did not make a mocking commentary on this film now (in 2009); A comparison between Steve Alaimo and Rod Blagojevich's hairstyle would be irresistible!
