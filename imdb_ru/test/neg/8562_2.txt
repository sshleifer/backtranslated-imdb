The nun is a picture of revenge in which a very monastic nun is murdered by her rebellious trailer charges and returns years later to find out when adults now attend their old school. The storyline is predictable in peaks and will not present any surprises, as it is slowly progressing towards the end. This is the cry of the film with passable acting, script and script below average. Most of the special effects have a low score, and there is practically no credibility in the final battle. However, if you look past them, there is some anxiety and acting jewelry. If you like senseless screamers, you will like it, otherwise you must pass.
