Another French film with the absurd. Baise-Moi (F * ck Me) tells the story of two young women who get together to kill f * ck. One of them is a porn star who escapes from her community after her boyfriend is raped and killed. The second is a prostitute who kills her roommate and sees her boyfriend being shot. After these incidents, they meet at the metro station (both miss the last train), and then it all begins. They find boundaries and come very close. They sexually abuse men, take drugs, travel around the country and have a lot of sex. This is all about Baise-Moi really. We see that they have no mercy for their victims. They even kill a woman for her money. Both actresses are real porn stars in France who influence the film in two different directions. They look so comfortable in the sex scenes, however, they can not make the whole film worthy of attention, since, in my opinion, the film does not require any additional abilities to act. This is a version of Thelma and Louise on another level. I could recommend you a lot of things, instead of watching Baise-Moi. So bother to see if you want to see a meaningless, strange film. * outside *****
