This film was rather erratic. There was nothing really for this. The only character who had any appeal was Maya Bobby Phillips, and she wasn't even worth it. <br /> <br /> The plot is a standard, double crossing double crossing. With a few too many double crosses to make any sense. Sometimes this means that it “makes you guess,” in this case, “makes you wait.” By the end, I just wanted everyone to be imprisoned or shot.
