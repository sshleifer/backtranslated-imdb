First of all, I'm by no means a picky movie viewer. I am not one of those people who make films just to highlight flaws and criticize, I, like most other people, look to be entertained. I will basically watch any type of film, no matter how bad someone says it is (sometimes the film is so badly made and written that it causes some kind of pathetic humor that I enjoy). Despite all this, Lil Pimp was just pathetic. I saw it on TV and just did not know what I was watching. It was too poorly written and stupid to be an adult film, and there was too much sex, insinuations and oaths to be a children's film, in fact, I doubt that even children will be surprised by this. Humor (quite generous, even calling it that) was so pretentious and polite that I could not understand how it would even seem ridiculous to someone with half-sense. The only thing that made me laugh was how people like Bernie Mac and the ridiculous could put their name and time on something so painful. Luda's character was such a cheap trick for laughing that didn't reach its goal. The plot does not make any sense, the storyline should be the worst sequence of events ever presented on the screen. I could go on, but I want to see what people think of my reaction before I begin to discuss specific cases of pathetic scenes. All I have to say is to really make you wonder how much time these writers have spent on their knees trying to achieve this. <br /> <br /> j
