This film is an insult to the play on which it is based. The character of Claude was disfigured beyond recognition, leaving a painful performance that does not even vaguely resemble an original plot. Shame, shame, shame. They also reduced a significant amount of the initial assessment of the changing context in which the songs are sung. This distorts the filmâ€™s atmosphere and makes the viewer, who knows how it should be, flinch, as the scriptwriter gives Hud his wife, turns Sheila into a spoiled rich girl, characterizes Claude as a cowboy and kills Burger by sending him to Vietnam instead. If someone is not familiar with the original plot, I assure you, this is a good film for you, but if you ever want to see the original or you, like me, a staunch fan of a classic play, you will do everything possible to avoid the film as a whole. One really has to stick with one or the other.
