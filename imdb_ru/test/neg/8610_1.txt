Damn it, it was a piece of dog. I read a few reviews here after seeing an incident at a local video store, and thought to myself ........ Ah, that sounds like a decent movie. Vampires. Swords. Thailand. How can you go wrong? Right? No, no, not a damn thing. Lord, if only I could knock out my eyes and not remember this film, I would be happy. The main actor had the whitest, most cheerful voice. Person! It really was bad ... "Amandaaaaaaaa ....", "I have to save my girlfriend ...." Damn it! My friend and I actually changed the audio track on a DVD to Portuguese so that we did not have to hear the guy's voice. Subtitles and everything ... And this is IMPROVED film. I'm serious if you somehow look like me and wonder what this movie looked like .. STOP MIRACLE. I have an answer. The worst movie vampire ever! No good action, no good blood and only the slightest amount of nudity. Just pure shit in 90 minutes. Don't rent it, buy it, think about it, or watch it at 3:00. It just does not cut the cake ... at all ... no way. F * ck this movie and watch All Anal 7: Real Deep Cover. You had better time. I'm sure.
