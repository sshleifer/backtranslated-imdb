I am a Christian, and I watched beautiful Christian films, but this one is too bad. They try to do it well, but I think it is too difficult for them. <br /> <br /> - You can see that the film is badly duplicated in many places. - You can almost think that the main characters of this film were the only ones left behind. I think they will be much more. <br /> <br /> - The quality is poor and acting could be better. The story is not so bad, but it could be better. The only plus I give is the story in this film, but overall I canâ€™t rate it more than 3/10. Watch "Left behind" instead!
