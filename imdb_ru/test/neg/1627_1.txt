The inhabitants of the caves, or The Blade Mater, or whatever it is called, in one word: VILE! I saw it on MST and laughed not only at the magnificent comments, but also about how the inept movie was shot. Sunglasses, tire tracks and where did Ator get the hang-glider? Then they shoot a few shots from another movie where the Eagles dare, as Tom Servo points out. To show how cheap this movie really is, look at the scene where Ator and Tong fight invisible swordsmen. Or, even better, look for a giant hose, dressed as a snake, with which Ator must fight! And what exactly these scenes in the credits are related to the film?
