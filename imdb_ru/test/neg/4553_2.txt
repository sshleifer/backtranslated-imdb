This may be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Usually I don’t watch such films, however I had to watch it at school. What a flour! <br /> <br /> The story is as average and boring as possible: a boy meets a girl on the Spanish coast, a boy and a girl fall in love, but the love between them seems impossible, to everyone. all against their love. At the end of the movie, the movie becomes some kind of weird kung-fu movie, where the guys in white fight with the guys in black. Awful <br /> <br /> The action is so terrible that it makes you laugh. The dancing in the film, which I think should be cool, is so simple and funny that even I can play it! And Georgina Verban is probably the most annoying person I've ever seen on the screen. <br /> <br /> Johan Nijnehuis is going to be Dutchman Ed Wood. His films are so bad that they make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Victor Loew, however, demonstrates a surprisingly good performance, and Daan Schurmans also behaves well. <br /> <br /> So, please, for your own sake, don’t do it. Watch this movie However, if you like to watch soap, it can be worth your time. <br /> <br /> Yuk! <br /> <br /> 2/10
