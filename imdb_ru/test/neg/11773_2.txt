I saw it at Sundance, and I can't understand why he won the director's prize. It was painfully slow and literally colorless. This is a type of film that is valued only by film festival snobs, who believe that any film that many people like should be lower than them. <br /> <br /> The jury at Sundance this year seems to have made conscious efforts to reward weak, ultra-low-budget films. It's all good, but this wandering, dragging mess looks like a home movie. A shot of mini-DV in a snowy gray winter leads to a dull image of a gray film. <br /> <br /> Some motifs (snakes) are crammed to death, despite the fact that they add nothing to the story and do not make sense as symbols. <br /> <br /> Now everything was not so bad. Vera Farmiga is a phenomenal mother with a drug problem. She will go to places, and she deserves it. Her colleague Hugh Dillon is also doing an excellent job. Honestly, there are a lot of great moments in this film, but they just don't mix well with each other.
