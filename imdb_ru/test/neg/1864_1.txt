This is one of the worst movies ever made. I can not believe how bad it was. I was shocked by the horror of the ghouls masks. This is a VERY Halloween mask! Mouths don't even move when they say !!!!! Why did they feel the need to make the ghouls funny and stupid? Whenever they do something, it seems like circus music and excessive use of BONK and BOING noise when they hit people. The mistress of bondage is one of the worst actresses I have ever seen. This movie is just bad. The plot is missing. ONE TREE HILL's mom is in it, though, and she apparently had a nose job since it was done. Why is the main character from the first movie back to make this garbage? BAD BAD BAD film.
