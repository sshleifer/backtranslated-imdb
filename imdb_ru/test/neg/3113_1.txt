I should have read “I know why the birds in a cage sing” in my English class, and we watched the movie after it was finished. After watching the movie, I regret that I will see. This completely eliminated the influence of the book. The scenes made no sense in their sequences, the action was terrible, and it seemed that the screenwriter actually never took the book, but chose the cliff notes instead. I was outraged at how the movie ended. Almost half of the book was cut out, and some aspects were extremely important for the growth of Maya as a person. If you read ... Birds in a cage, this film will spoil the experience of the book, so I warn you not to see it.
