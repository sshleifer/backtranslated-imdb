At what point does a film become so bad that it is good? Inspiring for its horror, Darkhunters stands out as a vivid example of c ** p cinematography, and for that alone it probably deserves some kind of reward. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a century-long battle for heaven and hell for the unclaimed souls of the recently dead. In the case of the Dark Hunters, representatives of good and evil manifest themselves in different ways as a herd of cats, the Grim Reaper figure in a hood with a flickering flame face, similar to an electric fire with a coal effect, similar to Philip Marlow with a serious face. bad manicure and a woman psychologist, who seems to be on the daily release from Kwik-Save. <br /> <br /> The main characters are fighting for the soul of the recently deceased teacher, who spends most of the film, running around a foggy field and bizarrely, planting kennels in an attempt to evade pursuers. <br /> <br /> The plot spreads thinner than Dieter’s sandwich, without developing a character or trying to create obscurity. The game is ridiculous, comparable to a school play - although this would be an insult to many educational institutions. And the dialogue .......... Oh, how my sides hurt! With the unclaimed souls of the dead, whom the fiery demon describes as “unwanted gherkins of life,” you wonder if Hell really is McDonald's. <br /> <br /> But it is strangely irresistible, you find yourself looking just to see how bad it can be - just over 80 minutes is worth the time spent on unintentional chuckles.
