It sounded like it would be like “Silence of the Lambs”, “Zodiac” or something like that, but it’s not. It really was more like one of the Halloween movies without all the jumping scenes. It was a bit like Plan 9 from Space, in the sense that the main bad guy continued to make silly speeches that made me want to have a bite without pressing a pause. The idea of ​​a person who is so crazy that he could kidnap people and torture them as a form of spiritual enlightenment is actually an interesting idea, but the penalty was too much made for television. I have to say it was better than what I expected for the movie starring Dee Snyder. Good first effort. Perhaps he will learn some lessons, and his next effort will be less awkward.
