I just watched the latest film, Atoll K-Laurel, and Hardy together and is known here in the states as the “Internet Archive of Utopia”, expecting to see additional footage, since the version of the EA had a duration of 2 hours and 21 minutes. It turns out that this is basically the same version that I previously watched on a VHS tape in the basement at a bargain price from Goodtimes Home Video, which lasted an hour and 23 minutes (except that the Welch's Grape Juice label did not fit any product , which was inserted when the bottle was shown) the rest of the time is devoted to a dark empty space. While Stan looks like he is going to die soon, he still plays a great physical comedy with Ollie for most of the first 45 minutes or so. Then the plot to take a yacht with a haven and a man without a country on board - not to mention a charming French singer, who also comes to populate an uncharted island, on which they all end up, faces possible complications that largely drown out the comedy and never recovers, despite the familiar ending of how Ollie last told Stan: “This is another pleasant mess that you dragged me into!” before Stan cries uncontrollably before disappearing. In other words, if you are a devoted fan of Laurel and Hardy, this film is recommended to watch at least once. Anyone who wants to get to know this classic comedy team should look for their earlier work that they did for Hal Roach from the 20s to the 1940s, when they finished their latest Roach movie, Saps at Sea. If you think, even some of the L & H Fox films (still not seeing the two that they did for MGM) from the 40s are better than this one ... Update-8/29/09: Just watched some missing scenes, which appeared in the Italian version on YouTube. Cheri sings in one and talks to the captain. In another case, the wife of this captain shoots a pistol at Cherie. In another, Giovanni explains why he left his country with a scene of memories. Stan is dubbed in high field here!
