I tried to watch this movie 3 or 4 times, but I just can not understand what is just awful in it. I am sure that it was a bold act to play Jack Palance in the role of the main character, but there is not a single thread in my being who believes that he can act at all, and even more so act against the type. <br /> <br /> Yes, I understand that Clifford Odeds was a brilliant author, but it is not obvious here. It seems that this strange and forced confusion of the 50s hipster dialogue hides the real meaning, which explains why none of the actors, even good ones (Steiger, Ida Lupino, Shelley Winters, Everett Sloan), seem to know how to put their lines - as if they do not understand the meaning of what they say. Meanwhile, Wendell Corey and Palance arrange a grandiose competition to find out who could be more stony. <br /> <br /> Direction - amateur and completely overworked. The physical interaction between the characters is no different from the dialogue. <br /> <br /> And can we discuss this disgusting set? He is so busy, ugly and inventive that he adds to the robot of unrelated quality of characters, dialogue and image. <br /> <br /> This film seems to drain energy from me. It seems that everyone took an overdose of Valium each morning when they arrived at the set. It takes a pretty lousy film to make Rod Steiger and Shelley Winters look bad, but this film was a success. <br /> <br /> I see that he could be effective as a game on or off Broadway, where intellectuals and rhythms could congratulate themselves on appreciating the power of the plot and the fanciful flourishes of the pseudo-fashionable dialogue.
