This is a heavy film to appreciate. Although he really deserves his 3 (or maybe even two) for the Al Adamson film, he is exceptional - and practically the best Adamson. This is because, unlike many Adamson films, there are times when NURSE SHERRI looks almost competent. But being a film about Adamson, you know that sooner or later this stuff MUST raise its ugly head! <br /> <br /> The film begins with some strange cult leader of a huge gathering (six) trying to resurrect a dead guy who looks like he is made from blue cheese. However, in the process, the cult guy had a heart attack and was taken to hospital. He is obviously dying, but it also seems that many of these hospital scenes are missing, and some of them appear much later in the film. In other words, when you see the film, he may have recovered - only to hear later that he died. Because this guy is bf.f. from Satan, however, his evil soul cannot die, and he returns to pursue one of his minions and take possession of nurse Sherry. <br /> <br /> Now Sherry is obviously a very worried woman - an obsession with demons. or not. Sometimes she behaves like a zombie, and in others she brutally kills. Therefore, I ask ... "why her boyfriend (doctor) did not think that this might be problematic?!". In other words, after trying to kill a patient, he does not receive an exorcist and does not send her to the hatch !!! Oh, and if we talk about boobs ... this film is NOT a sexual game on the chest, its title and posters indicate. Although there are several bare breasts here and there, they are irrelevant to the plot and are seen very briefly (1/2 second or so) in all scenes except for one. So, if you are a pervert, this film is not for you - although in several places of the film (for example, a nurse is undressing for the patient) it seems that the film CAN be once conceived as a porn movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a bad movie fan, however, enough to whet your appetite. Some examples of incompetence are the inability of many actors to give out lines that are not like zombies - and I'm not even talking about Sherry. One of the most final scenes is especially noticeable - I have never seen or heard any unnatural game and dialogue in my life - and this includes Ed Wood films! There are also some cheaper touches, such as poor animation of “green things”, when the doctor finds the dead nurse and continues to investigate the house where the walls are covered with blood (I would take a cop ... even better - an army of police). <br /> <br /> So, despite all these problems, why do I think this is good for the Adamson film? Well, the story is not so bad, and he was able to very well increase the tension. A lot of false alarms early made my heart beat a little. In addition, the car accident, although not related to the case, looked pretty good and was practically budgetary for Adamson. <br /> <br /> In general, not a very good movie, and most people would be bored to watch. However, Adamson fans or inept movies will like it - it will bring some fun entertainment that will bring some laughter.
