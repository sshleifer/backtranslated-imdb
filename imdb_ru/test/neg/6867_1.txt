The idea is excellent, spoiled by the judges. <br /> <br /> Why laugh at people? if what the inventors say is true, and, as most of them say, they have spent their lives in saving the invention, then the minimum is to give up the idea without making fun of people. <br /> <br /> In addition, it shows when they want to accept an idea that they added to the judges. <br /> <br /> The only one I respect from the judges is the one who always sits to the right of the table, he is a respectable person <br /> <br /> Of course, an English snob who claims to be a business person and wears deluxe, doesn't make you one buddy <br /> <br /> last but not least, the big guy who sits between the English and heralds. wake up, man, you don't need a job, and you are an inventor to call yourself alone. the inventor is an attribute, not an employee. <br /> <br /> I think they wanted to add someone like Simon from the American idol, they thought it worked there, it could work here. the context is different, and the idea is completely different. <br /> <br /> This is a good idea, and they could make a good show out of it if they just changed judges and removed their actions and attitudes. <br /> <br /> just stop scoffing at people.
