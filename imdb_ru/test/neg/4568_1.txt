Totally unfunny "jokes" that fail, an amateur game (with one or two exceptions), boring characters and dialogues are mediocre at best. After watching this movie, you need to wonder how the producer could stumble upon such a project and think: "I MUST make this movie." Not surprisingly, it could not get a theatrical release.
