The film is very dynamic, whimsical and colorful, it is like Mad Max at speed with tons of colors and makeup. Also very caricature as it is said; the cartoon sequence pops up here and there. The plot is also very audacious, but I believe that this is also true. In this film, I’m really crazy about the characters that they are painfully annoying, especially Rebecca, played by Lori Petty, she’s really annoying (I believe she’s the most annoying creature I’ve ever seen). Editing is also annoying, very MTV stylized. Another thing that Tank Girl lacks is an exciting adventure. Humor is also not very funny. Although he has some good visual effects. <br /> <br /> However, many people love this film, most of them are women, and this is not at all strange, because this film tells about the power of girls. This is a real tiptoe movie and the best example of a hate / love movie.
