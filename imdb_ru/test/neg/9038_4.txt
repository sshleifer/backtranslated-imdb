Despite the fact that this film is not really terrible, it is still largely a waste of time and draws an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist picture of the Beach Boys history. <br /> <br /> In essence, this film makes you believe that Mike Love was the brain behind the band and Brian Wilson was just a pitiful psycho. In fact, none of the characters evolve beyond the limits of a one-dimensional parody, but this is a television film, so what do you expect? The ugly smell of Mike Love is everywhere in this turkey when he tries to rewrite the story with himself as a team leader and genius resident. Yes, however ... <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the music is excellent. Unlike the previous biopic of Summer Dreams, filmed by Beach Boys, this film actually shows the real music of the Beach Boys, rather than anemic cover versions ... It also shows an amazing amount of Beach Boys, and rarely Footprints - The Sunrays "I Live for the Sun" is one example. <br /> <br /> This film was originally shown in two parts on American network television. The first part is the excellent of the two and documents the early days of the boys and rises to the top. To the second part, Brian Wilsonâ€™s character has turned into a cartoon character, and the actor seems to be laughing - but how can you be serious about this shit? If you're not a Beach Boys fan, you probably won't get much benefit from this film, apart from a highly distorted and one-sided look at the history of the group. But then again, why would you watch this if you are not a fan?
