I have to raise my hand and say that I was one of the first (and probably the last !!!) who saw this movie. Where to start is a complete mess. The main attraction of course was the soundtrack. What goes without saying, brilliantly, is what Kimesh does best. But as they say, do not give up your daily work - HR definitely should not. <br /> <br /> HR acts simply and horribly. Even if there was a plot in the film, what confuses you the most is why this person is on the screen and what the hell is doing there. Two words for HR - give up acting and, secondly, use lipstick. <br /> <br /> HR has no on-screen presence, no acting skills, and the leading woman looks too young for him. As for Maliki Sherawat - just the same old Bollywood vampire crap. <br /> <br /> You can pack the product as much as you like, but if it isnâ€™t there, it will not stand. Do not waste your money ...
