It was only when I looked at the trivia section that I learned that the original producer / star of this movie Tyrone Power died during its creation. This no doubt explains why everything on the screen seems to think about other things, the symptom of which appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pitiful. Do you know when you were painting a wall before you got bored? Well, this is the expression of the face of combatants when they swing their swords in an extremely unconvincing manner. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the plot lies Soloman, the king of Israel, having an affair with Queen Sheba and his people are not happy about it. You can't blame them, because there are a few things more beautiful in the world than these Israeli moths, although Israeli women here all look like Cherie Blair! Modern Israel is also very cosmopolitan, since most Israelis were born outside the country, but that would be true a couple of thousand years ago when everyone speaks with European and American accents. <br /> <br /> After long conversations and a sequence of dances that must be seen to believe in it (and no, this is not praise), we have a climax when Israelis with strong numerical superiority must defend themselves from the massive Egyptian army which cannot read the map, otherwise they would know that there is a canyon in front of them. This is what I do not understand. Despite the fact that the Egyptians, blinded by the sun, spend ten minutes rushing towards the Israelis, never realizing that they are moving towards the gaping gorge! Isn't that somewhat illogical? It is also a bit of a blunder, because horses, chariots, and people falling into a canyon are clearly miniature figures. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film ends with Soloman killing his cunning brother and praising God for his victory. But who needs Moshe Dayan, Arik Sharon or God, when you have an idiotic enemy who does not see a ravine in front of him or is swinging his sword as if he is painting a wall?
