I see that I was going to make this movie. Unfortunately, it just never completes a deal. The “crime against reality” aspect works fine, and all the pictures are excellent. In fact, quite a few scenes are incredibly remembered in a capricious way. In particular, the silhouette of a detective talking to a battered woman, the scene of detectives passes through the garbage, and the father tying flies. In some cases, several scenes are stuck in too much dialogue. Instead of showing to the viewer, the writer perceives it as a book. But the real problem is editing. History does not flow. He cannot make a whole of the sum of parts. In the end, you do not understand what is actually happening. Those who like this detective film love to follow it, putting together puzzles while the main characters do. With such bad editing it is difficult, if not almost impossible to do.
