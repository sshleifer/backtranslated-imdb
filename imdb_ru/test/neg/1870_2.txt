I don't know why IMDb lists all the Ghoulies films as theatrical releases .. They were all directly to the videos. The same with the Puppet Master series. Why has nobody noticed this yet? Yes, you somehow stumbled upon Ghoulies IV, perhaps raiding an old abandoned video rental store in 1993. You looked in the discount section and found it ... Look at the back and front covers. What do you expect, Escape from the Shawshank? There is no need to criticize this film like that. This is the fourth movie GHOULIES! I bought it on DVD for 6.50, because ... it was 6.50 ... I knew that this was not Kubrick's stuff. And I was right. An unbeatable DVD with no additional material, not even a trailer, boasts an unwary movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, it contains the star of the first Guli film, Peter Liapis ... who really didn’t get many “Big” roles besides these two films. And I don’t understand why ... He’s not a very bad actor and quite funny. But I think if you are going to play a major role in the Goole films, Scorsese and Tarantino will lose interest. Also present is his bastard idiot Bobby Di Cocco, who, despite a very slight resemblance to Al Pacino (very small), does not retain any of his acting skills ... A complete idiot who is just awkward to watch. Then there is Stacy Randall - obviously a porn star, I don't need to look that up. She looks pretty sexy, although her costume, her character and everything she does reduces the credibility of films, which is not an easy task for such a film. <br /> <br /> Then there are the ghouls themselves! Which also have time to let us down. Ghoulies III made them start talking, no mistake. 1, but Ghoulies IV takes it one step further. Instead of being puppets, this time the ghouls are really CHILDREN in SUITS !!!! The filmmakers decided to overcome the extra mile to insult the audience. In addition, they are only TWO, and they are not the main highlight of the film, as they do not appear in many of them. However, sometimes they are SOME funny ... And this time they are not evil either. <br /> <br /> This is actually a funny thing, it's amazing that I could really enjoy it. I don’t know why ... Part of the black humor is actually funny, although the script is mostly light. Imagine that Satan’s only threat to you is that he "will kill you, slowly ... painfully ...". <br /> <br /> But this time, at least, the Full Moon did not participate. Did they do? Yes, a very bad and cheap movie with zero performance, but not so bad as to be in the ranks of Puppet Master 1/2, Lawnmower Man 2, Surviving Christmas or even Ghoulies III.
