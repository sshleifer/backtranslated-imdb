I saw this film when I was in France, and I must say that it embarrassed me. This is a story about a jewel thief and a young singer, each of whom ends up in Morocco, collides with each other and forms a bond. Simple enough? Well, the problem is that this is a type of film that has ambiguity both in chronology (the film is not played in order) and in reality (did what I just saw happen, or is it just a dream?). Given these parameters, and the fact that the film was bilingual, it was very difficult to follow, and I was not sure what happened at the end. I believe that some thoughtful types might understand this movie better than me, and it may take more than one viewing to understand it.
