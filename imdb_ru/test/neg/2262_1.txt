I am offended and angry with the idea that the continuation of "Gone With the Wind" should have ever been undertaken. Expressing this, I have no problems with the quality of acting or the actors in this film. Artists are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of garbage. The hype around this book and film is simply useless. I think this will be misleading as one of Hollywood's mistaken films. I do not believe that the favorite characters created by Margaret Mitchell should have been tainted with the ideas and interpretations of another writer. The film and book should be on the list of the worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and filmmaking. The sad thing is that people actually earned money from this prank.
