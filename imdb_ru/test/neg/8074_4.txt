The film was a pleasure to watch if you are a Stooges fan. The story is told from the perspective of Mo Howard and his relationship with his brothers Shemp and Jerome (Curly) Howard, as well as his lifelong friendship with Larry Fayne. The film is mainly devoted to poor-quality achievements and the failures of the career of the long-term career of Stooges. The casting director and makeup artist did an excellent job of finding actors like the famous ensemble. The actor who plays “Kinky” Howard did a great job with the image on the TV show of the most beloved Stojah. Be sure to look for any fan of the Three Stooges shorts.
