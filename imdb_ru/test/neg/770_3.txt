It was not a very good movie, the acting was pretty smelly, and the effects were mostly bad. But there were some funny moments, but most of them should not have been funny. The most fun part of the film for me was the role that makes a little kid in a wheelchair fall out (it's not the funniest part. What do you think I am a person)? the brother runs, and the way the child runs is so funny that he stumbles and because of the game, I had to rewind it several times so that I could laugh even more. so if you are looking for something to rent, but just can't find something, check it out and watch the working part.
