You know, I watched only 15 minutes of this film, so I can not describe how great it is. I mean that the concept itself is so original and intriguing that it just does not let me go. Then there are a lot of people awarded an Academy Award, involved here, plus a director nominated for an Academy Award. YOU JUST CAN'T MISS. I mean, imagine that it's the middle of the night, and you are still awake. This film begins. You watch it in shock. It's so brilliant, so original, so cool. It seems to you that after half an hour you turned off the screen, but when you go to bed, you see that it is only 15 minutes after midnight. ENJOY !!! <br /> <br /> 3 of 10
