What is it about addiction that attracts new directors so much to offer their opinion on this topic? This item has been made to death. Drug abuse is bad. We get it. Addiction is painful to watch. We get it too. But the grim theme does not give the director a license to create a sloppy movie. Each film does not have to be Hitchcock’s cinematic perfection or use Orson Welles ’deep focus, but it’s still a narrative film. Verite does not mean pseudo-documentary. Even consumer mini-DV-cameras are capable of reproducing white and black, and this director is simply lazy, taking off not contrasting scenes with existing lighting: the object is rather dull, without artificial imposition by careless cinema. And even documentaries have a sound mix. Vera Farmiga is very talented, given the right material, but the director clearly redirected her and sucked her whole life from her performance. Drug addicts may live in the fog, but they still have emotions, but none of these characters seem to exist behind the scenes. Supporting players simply put their lines without creating real people. Sorry to be so rude, Debra, but some things are true, whether you want to believe them or not. I'm sure your next film will be better, but please, not another film about drugs. :)
