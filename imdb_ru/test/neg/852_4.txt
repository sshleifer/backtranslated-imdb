It was a mix of the film that started nowhere, got lost along the way, and then suddenly found the plot in the last 5 minutes, when the title character finally appeared. There were so many ugly lamb cut guys in this film that I lost all sense of who was the owner and who was the guard. I have a theory about casting, though; all the bad guys were played by ugly actors (and one ugly actress), and all the good guys / victims were played by beautiful actors. Indeed, the actors who played the ultimate sacrifices, the slaves, were magnificent, like the daughter of an innocent priest, while the plantation owner, his minipulation mistress and his guards were pretty tough on the eyes. Purposely? You make a call. <br /> <br /> I stayed there until the end, and some others could do it as well. If you just want to look at bare breasts, there are plenty of them here, and if you have a slave / master fetish, then you will love this movie. Otherwise, watch it once, vomit, take a shower and never tell anyone about it.
