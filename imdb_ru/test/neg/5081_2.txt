those people who told me that “this film is good” are embarrassing for them! This film is for an audience that has no problems watching everything (especially when it comes to tough guys, guns, chasing and looting). film with "The Inside Man" {same time lost}. I'm tired of copying and pasting movies. And I'm not happy, but what can I do? Fans of this type of movie are much more ... If you want to watch a good movie of this type, I recommend you "Lucky Slevin". I do not mean, I just do not like this film {weak actors, weak script, weak actions}. Probably someone else will like it. Many people have a lot of tastes.
