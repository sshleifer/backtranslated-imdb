If I could give this film 0/10, I would do it, and this is the first film that I wanted to rate so low. This is worse than terrible. If I went to watch it in the cinema, I would like the cinema to pay me for watching (at least the minimum wage). Some of the camera shots were pretty effective, but many were, for example, rubbish. reflection of the villains in the mirror that separates his head and shoulders away from his body (to see is to believe). Some absolutely meaningless killings of civilians. 2 murders that made me laugh out loud because of the actions / facial expressions of the victims when they were shot. I just watched it to the end (fast forward about 10 minutes of boring, meaningless dialogue) in the hope of seeing Seagal in some decent hand-to-hand combat, but this was almost not there (you should have known that when at the beginning he left someone on the elevator, and it was shown in slow motion with music - the end of the "action" scene. In one of the scenes, we see how Seagal's hand slowly cuts off someone's neck, which makes it obvious that his hand did not even touch). The main villain continues to return to life. He gets a shot in the chest on 2 separate occasions. The first time is with a shotgun that takes him 2 / 3rd floor to the street. To summarize, this film is a waste of time and a joke. It looks like a very low budget (even for Seagal). Color is dull and gray. I could go on and on .... like this movie, but I will not. Watch this movie if you have insomnia. It is guaranteed to put to sleep.
