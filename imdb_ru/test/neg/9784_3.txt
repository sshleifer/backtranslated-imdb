My jaw dropped so many times when I watched this movie, I have bruises. Yes, of course, I really did not expect the quality of, say, Others or even Thirteen Ghosts (the new one, which was just awful and still a cut above this madness). Someone noticed thin characters ... I would not call them "thin." “Thin” implies that there may be something for them. How about almost non-existent? In no particular order do we have: A girl who will scream; An American who will understand everything; A macho who will jump through everything until they kill him: a wise black man who will die early; Extra guy who needs to die first; An extra woman who wants to play hard. That's all. This is your list of characters, and this is what they are, and that they remain from start to finish. If they were “thin,” they could at least slightly change from beginning to end. But they do not. Well, okay, the American guy decides that at the end he is going to stay with the fieldwork, and the Screaming Girl returns to where she came from. This is a change. In addition, they all act in accordance with their assigned roles and rarely betray any real emotions when they are finally threatened. <br /> <br /> Now producers get props for the original threat, I say. I realized that the story will be “Tremor”, but with ants instead of giant worms. I pay tribute to the writer: these are very cool, very scary ants, and what they do with bones is excellent. (I admit, I jumped a few feet at the first appearance of the “bone stealer”.) Unfortunately, a very steep concept quickly turns into an Alien in the desert. We get a lot of comments about ants that may or may not be true, but we don’t get much of the mythology on which the threat is based. And we get every cliché of monsters from films that we ever made. People go to places they don’t need, and when they don’t have a good reason for doing so. Stupid characters are trying to prevent our heroes from dying for it. One character performs a double duty as "a scientist who does not want to kill a monster, but studies it." A very cool gadget is presented only so that an American can tell everyone about ants, who, damn it, I hope everyone knows anyway. Then the gadget is broken. Our heroes have exhausted one thing that can keep the threat at bay. And then there comes that last, annoying moment when we know that the threat is still with us - and ask ourselves what exactly and how she made a hero or heroine. Everything that was before is completely useless and false. <br /> <br /> Three stars for cool use of ants and bones. Nothing to do with cliché, clumsy dialogue and dim bulbs.
