A brief marital infidelity returns to the haunting, loving wife of Grace Needham (portrayed always sexually by Nastassia Kinsky). <br /> <br /> She left the city and her depressing husband to go on a trip to sunny Miami, where she was persecuted and eventually seduced by Julian Grant, a beautifully evil and manipulative business leader, who is very well portrayed by William Baldwin (why Are all Baldwin brothers playing evil people so damn well?) <br /> <br /> The Seduction of Grace took place when the two drank champagne on a deserted beach, to which they reached privately on a sailing boat. Grace admitted that she drank too much for her own good, and revealed many problems in her marriage. Julian gained her confidence by saying that he would never allow such problems to occur if he had a relationship with Grace. Julian's manipulation continued when he described the fantasy “lost in the sea”, in which the unremitting Grace was participating, who sat side by side listening to his every word and more and more plunging into her romantic dream. <br /> <br /> His manipulation was paid for several subtle pushes led to Grace's soft kisses, stopping for a moment as she moved away, as if suddenly thinking to herself: “What am I doing? I am a wife I am a mother I have a real life. Real duties. Of course, the two of us talked about being together, lost at sea, but this is just a fantasy. Look what we are doing here. The consequences are real. We are truly alone on a secluded beach. Am I going to let this fantasy really happen? <br /> <br /> She is inferior to the dream as her kisses become more passionate. The once-guarded Grace, who usually responded to the men’s proposals, saying, “I’m Married,” watched with pleasure as Julian unbuttoned her shirt, which resulted in more kisses, caresses and nursing Julian's knees! She smiles, kisses, moans, laughs and often looks at the sun throughout the unfortunately short love scene in which everyone seemed to be wearing most of their clothes. <br /> <br /> While I fully enjoyed the expression of illegal passion on Grace's face, when the once devoted wife was completely satisfied with having sex with a man who clearly loves to manipulate others, I would say that in general the scene did not deserve the rating of the movie “R” . /> <br /> Julian returned home and found her husband rejuvenated due to the fact that he got a high-paying job, and she is glad to have the opportunity to return to a normal life, where she can again become a loving wife and a caring mother. <br /> But angry Julian Grant returns to the picture and does not want to give up so easily because of Grace. Grace has a plan to save her life from Julian, but will it work? <br /> <br /> Obviously, I don’t want to spoil your remaining storyline. Nevertheless, I will say that I always like films about sexual pretense on the part of my wife (especially when she demonstrates the unobstructed attraction and behavior that is usually inherent to her husband), but in fact I seek revenge against the antagonist. This movie would be much better if the movie included more than that in the storyline. I feel that if a movie picks it up, then the film should end. And this film definitely raised this. Unfortunately, certain limitations in the storyline prevented this from making significant progress. There are many other films available that do well from this point of view, and I will include their titles in the “recommendations” section of this section. I am also open to receiving e-mail suggestions about other films that have a good storyline, including sexual pretense from the seemingly devoted wife. <br /> <br /> In general, Nastassja Kinski and William Baldwin are both very good. There is no film.
