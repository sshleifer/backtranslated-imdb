This film was such a mess that I actually refunded the money to my friends, whom I dragged to see. The only reason I went to see was that my friend was an apprentice to the editor on the set. <br /> <br /> I am sure that this film was supposed to be extraordinary, but the approach was so tough and self-reflective it turned out to be really flat. Judd Nelson plays the role of an avid scavenger who is a hack comedian. His life is hellish, and his life is deteriorating from his disgusting and domineering companion Bill Paxton (which I embarrass - it was a really tasteless role for a talented actor). A monstrous accident changes Nelson's career, and chaos follows. <br /> <br /> Attempts at humor were commonplace, predictable, often low and tasteless. Wayne Newton in the role of agent for the selection of talents - a novelty, but he does not add anything - comedic or otherwise. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very weak and uncreative attempt at humorous humor that resembles a leading balloon. At the very least, you could laugh at Plan 9 from space. It just makes you wonder who thought it was a good enough idea to fund and withdraw. One of the worst bombs of all time you've ever seen.
