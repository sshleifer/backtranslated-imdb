Well, as the headline says, this is not a particularly good movie I was hoping for. I thought it would be great with Mr. Monty Man himself, but unfortunately not. From the very beginning, I literally lost interest immediately, when two women simply brewed tea, and then suddenly indicated that random water was flowing from under the door, and then it punched a full stream of water along the route at home, it is difficult to believe that they did not do that. I did not notice a rise in the water level outside, or at least I heard it. Sorry for the fact that it sounds like a rant, but it really grinds my mechanisms and influenced me. Most of the acting skills were bad, and the story tried to copy almost every clich√© into every disaster movie, but in that sense it just didn't work out. CGI was bad, I could do a better job using ms paint, also directing the poor, and in the end I did not care about 1 character at all !!! Do not waste your time, people, no wonder that it was released directly on DVD. Ok, thanks for reading xxx
