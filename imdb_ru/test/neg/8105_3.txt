Poor Bela Lugosi. Just another day at work. A group of saboteurs who are trying to disrupt American military action from within. At first it is quite difficult to understand, because although we know that these guys are plotting something, their method of work is simply not very clear. I won't spoil it, but the final is pretty awesome. There is a series of murders committed by our hero. The police who do not know what is happening. What a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house. There are comments like "A true patriot would do this or that." This is obvious, while suspicions abound, much of the world does not recognize the spy or disruptive agent if he jumps and bites them. I was also surprised to see Clayton Moore (the Lone Ranger) in a romantic role. I never understood that he ever did anything other than riding a horse. Of course, there is the complacency of the criminals, because they think that they are not protected from the killerâ€™s guest list. However, Bela seems to be a good guy and a bad guy in one person. The best scene in the film is at the end, but I will not spoil it. As a curiosity and historical work, it can be fun to watch some people.
