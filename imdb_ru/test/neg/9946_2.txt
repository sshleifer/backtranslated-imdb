As Jennifer Denuccio spoke on Square Pegs: "Thrust me out the door." I would definitely vote for this movie on the worst IMDB movie list. <br /> <br /> Dennis Christopher plays TT, a guy from Chicago who travels to California and sells his brother's jazz records. It is assumed that he is a barney, placed in the surf community only for locals. But he behaves like a novice in civilization (just try to go through your sex scene without wriggling). There are also ongoing adventures of the rest of the local population, which the viewer must endure. This is Duke (Seymour Cassell), a volleyball expert who is trying to make TT behave like a normal person, disgusting drunken surfers who cheat their girlfriends, and a guy who bets with another that he can live in a car for six months. <br /> <br /> California Dreaming is just a big old mess. It begins as a typical seventies romp, complete with bad 70s music (although this film came out one year ago from the 80s). And Dennis Christopher is considered the most annoying loser, because of which the film is difficult to watch (keep your finger on the fast forward button). Even if this film was supposed to talk about surfer culture, the surf scene is almost complete trash. People in a surfing competition look like they can't keep from falling asleep. <br /> <br /> I guess the only cool thing is to see Tanya Roberts outside the Midge role in the sitcom “This is a 70s show.” And Cassell was not bad, he was just in a bad movie.
