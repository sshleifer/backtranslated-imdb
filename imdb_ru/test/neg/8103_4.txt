Black Dragons is the second popular propaganda film of the Second World War. This is not as bad as some might believe. <br /> <br /> The secret meeting, hosted by the esteemed Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke), was interrupted by a mysterious stranger named Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Shortly thereafter, congregation members begin to be murdered, their bodies placed on the steps of the Japanese embassy in Washington. Colomb is suspected. Federal agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) is assigned to this case and meets Saunders' niece Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay), who is trying to help him. The reasons for the actions of Colomb are not explained until the final movie. Until everything is explained at the end, the story is difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> Lugosi, who by then had been reduced to the appearance of a number of low-budget fast, is really good at it. He is not allowed to act excessively as he normally did, and director William Nye should be credited with this. Lugosi's character slips through the shadows and reminds him of Dracula even to the extent that his piercing eyes close their eyes. <br /> <br /> Clayton Moore, at best, a one-dimensional actor, will become a lone ranger on television for several years. Joan Barclay is a good heroine. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it is now a bit out of date, Black Dragons are a good way to spend an hour.
