Wow, what a bad movie. Not scary, but barely understandable. The plot does not stick together at all, and the acting is absolutely terrible. What is this line from a famous critic? “She rules the emotional scale from A to B.” Aha. It is about summation. Not even suitable for the cost of the camp! I did not expect Oscar material, but is it? And what the hell is her friend a ghost? You do not need to have an IQ of an especially stupid mollusk in order not to see this one coming. <br /> <br /> This film (and I use this word freely) is an insult to the public. If only someone associated with this knew how to tie the story together! It gets 1 out of 10, simply because there is nothing lower. On the other hand, at least it's not two hours.
