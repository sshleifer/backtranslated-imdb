I found this movie at a flea market cheap. I was so excited because I thought it was a skateboard movie. I came home to put it on, the preview rules and the opening scene with the old guy rolling down the street on a skateboard were awesome. At that moment I realized that this is a post-apocalyptic film, but I still had high hopes for it. This movie was terrible. My friend was amazed when we watched it, and even he thought it was terrible and a waste to be high. I kept falling asleep during the movie because it was so boring and the music was terrible. I don’t know if during the apocalypse all good music is destroyed, and all music, which is only partly shitty, is destroyed, and all memory of how to play it is wiped off the face of the earth, but I think that I’ll rather die than endure that shit, And what the hell happened to the television studio? I can only assume that this film was adapted from an old Greek play with names and titles, but some plays are not intended for futuristic science fiction. Or at least not by the people who were involved in this film. If you are forced to watch this movie, I can only offer to take a gun with me and finish myself to the end. It would be a good movie to kill yourself too, everyone will understand why.
