The most disturbing thing in this film is not that it is nonsense (CPUSA has never been such a big espionage threat, as in the film). The disturbing aspect is that he bleaches the very dubious tactics of the FBI and the American Committee for Action. Secret informants, gossip turned into accusations, baseless searches - these are the things that secret police thugs did, as in the KGB, and, presumably, good patriotic Americans fought. And yet the FBI made them and did not throw an eye. This is the only realistic part of this film, and they represent it altogether without a sense of shame. Add to this the fact that it undermines the Constitution itself, forcing only the Communists to refer to the Bill of Rights. The film also makes thinly veiled accusations that the black civil rights movement was inspired by the Communists, another bundle of lies. On this day, it is extremely difficult to justify such outrageous propaganda, even realizing the paranoia of the time when you understand how harmful it was for real people.
