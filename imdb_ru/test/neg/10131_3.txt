THE AFFAIR is a very bad 1970s TV movie, in which Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood were starring husband and wife as indecisive lovers. She has polio, she leads a reclusive life as a pop writer. He is an ambitious lawyer who is very sociable and absolutely in love with her. Their business, whatever it may be, is doomed from the very beginning, and she knows it, but still agrees with it. Two things worth paying attention to if you are trapped while watching this: Wood Jane Fonda's hairstyle, which is never confused, no matter what, and the melody that she sings at the beginning of this horrible film She sings it in for four, five or six minutes, so you know that this is a classic addition between commercials. It is also one of the worst songs ever written, and the woman who sings by Wood should have been shot and free from suffering. Also follow all peasant tops and dresses. For comparison, Wagner looks relatively timeless, with short hair and a sporty series of classic suits.
