Worse than the incredibly boring Emily Rose Exorcism. It began decently, and until mother said to father: “See, I knew that she was obsessed,” I told you in such a voice. It was a terrible line, which was badly talked about, and it foreshadowed the quick demise of this surprisingly bad film. Every family member has a problem from the past with a priest. Dad begins to blame everyone for either loving his wife or actually having an affair with her, the culmination of which is that he killed his boyfriend and then himself in obvious instant clarity after he realized a friend still did not sleep with his wife. People are dying, others are becoming obsessed, and by this point most viewers no longer care. With the exception of their collaborator Miguel, none of the characters in this film were really cute, which made it difficult to care for any of them. The game was terrible, and the spelling is even worse. Glad I saw it for free; although I feel that for the film this bad person owes me money for the time lost.
