Walt especially loved the quality. So how did the producers at Disney release such a horribly edited, rudely acting (even for a family fee!) Movie mess? BIG GREEN had a good concept. And since this is Disney, you know how the film will turn out, obviously. But GREAT GREEN is terrible. The jokes limp. And Steve Guttenburg, still alive, plays another terrible staging on his resume. <br /> <br /> Children who have too little time in the small town of Elma get the opportunity to play football from their new teacher. Kids don't know anything though. And, fortunately for us, we see Steve Guttenburg trying to hit the teacher from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Acceleration of the camera does not work. GREAT GREEN is full of speeding up the pace of characters to promote the film. Children are not idiots. They will understand if you give them enough clues without showing all this garbage. Guttenburg, at least once in his life, had to refuse an offer to join this film. Also the pretty Olivia d'Abo should have called it off too. GREAT GREEN may be known as the “Big Bomb.”
