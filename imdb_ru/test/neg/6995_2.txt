The film, listed here as filmed in 1980, is not a film that can be found in Something Weird Video in their “Driver's Scare Films Vol. 5”. On the one hand, the 1980 version is in color. SWV has an earlier version (1972) of the film shot in black and white for the 5th WLWT television channel in Cincinnati. In any case, this film is notorious. However, unlike most other films made by the driver, it is intended for television broadcasting and viewing by the general public. Thus, the level of slaughter was reduced. It is still a rather dismal exercise in using bloody death for the intended educational purpose. I live in the Cincinnati area, and I remember how this film was shown every year during the prom on Channel 5. If you are looking for one film that demonstrates the tone of this unique American cinematic phenomenon, “The Last Graduation” is a rather moody, hyperbolic, extremely didactic, heavy on melodrama. Did it really affect the driving of any teenager?
