When I found out that there was a Christmas holiday 2, I could not wait to buy a DVD. I sent my money and watched them as soon as they arrived through the mailbox. I like all the national lampon films Chevy is chasing, and I bet he was glad that he was not here! I could not believe how bad it is, you might think that it is impossible not to laugh at a film about national lampons, but believe me, this is so! This film probably looked like a good idea on paper, when Eddie's cousin became the main character, he got on my nerves from the very beginning of the film and became completely meaningless by the middle of the movie and by the end of the movie my brain died and I didnâ€™t could remember what happened! ,
