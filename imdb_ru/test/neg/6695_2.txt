<br /> <br /> I didn’t tune into this film because I’m a fan of the basketball school in the USA (in fact, I rarely watch NBA games), but because I’m a fan of Gene Hackman who usually manages to bring the impressive depth speeches. In this case, however, I was very disappointed. It was not one of the bright bright stars of Hackman’s career. <br /> <br /> Honestly, he had nothing to work with. As Norman Dale, the new coach of the Indiana high school basketball team, he was not called on to play much. In fact, his speech was that he wandered through basketball on the sidelines, ranting the judges. I did not find him particularly believable in this role, to be honest. I was also not impressed with the necessary romance between Dale and Myra Fliner (Barbara Hershey). Honestly, there was absolutely no chemistry between Hackman and Hershey. Romance never attracted my attention, nor did basketball “action” that was too predictable. <br /> <br /> There were too many problems with this film to be worth it. I never understood the depth of the obvious hatred that so many citizens had towards Dale, almost until the time he arrived. Character development was poor, and the story itself was poorly developed. In my opinion, too much basketball and not enough human interaction. How many shots of children taking off the basket need to be seen in order to understand that this is a basketball film? There was no expectation: is it even possible to doubt that Hickory is going to win big? I understand that this is based on a true story, but I guess it proves that not every true story should be a film. Frankly, it was not a very interesting film. Definitely a film that Gene Hackman would like to forget. <br /> <br /> No better than 2/10 in my opinion.
