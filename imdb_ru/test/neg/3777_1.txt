The parallels between this film and “Captain Morges” (an independent film shown at the Team Projection Film Festival in 1994) are so obvious that any praise for “Sally Marshall is not an alien” should be considered with the knowledge that she is going about the success of other work. <br /> <br /> In Captain Walrus, two young boys (Jeff and Roger, played by Dean Turner and Brett Allen, respectively) study the strange behavior of their new neighbor, Britney (played by Louise Farley). ). When two boys look through their telescopes, they observe repeated visits by a man in uniform, whom they call Captain Walrus (played by Peter Sargent). However, the emphasis in the film “Captain Walrus” is on meaningless and to some extent power actions of her neighbor, Britney, and not on the friendship between the two boys. <br /> <br /> Critical success at the film festival, the story of “Captain Morges”, was obviously appropriated and reworked to give the Australian cinematographic community another step towards the children's product. Although Sally Marshall is not Alien, it is a wonderful film, and the merit of its producers, its unreliability leaves something deserved.
