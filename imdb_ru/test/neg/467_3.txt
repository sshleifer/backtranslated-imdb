I would like to tell you that this film is as fascinating as the theories it supports. But I can not. Another species could come and mutate while I was waiting for some action. For such a controversial man, Darwin lived the most ordinary life. If you didn't know about crazy theories, you could almost take him for a stamp collector. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers called Darwin a dumbass, which makes him a poor service. Even when he briefly lost his mind due to his tireless theory, it was not interesting to watch. Maybe great thinkers are boring people? I donâ€™t know what I was expecting: an eccentric, beating on the forehead with wild hair and eyes, supporting his love for all things of the monkey, the brilliance of madness, coming out of a frowning forehead? A long-haired hermit who chattered with animals? Dizzy crazy with eyes lit up like beacons of truth? All of the above would be great. These are films for the sake of Scorsese. <br /> <br /> But this was nothing. No lightning, no thunder, no wonder, no reverence. Just Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly have just come out of the Subtle, like the Method Breath School. I suppose that someone with Darwin's ideas had a brain that looked like a high-speed train, so why did this film just flutter like a slow winter? Disappointment is immeasurable.
