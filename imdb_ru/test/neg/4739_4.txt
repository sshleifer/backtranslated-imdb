I loved blood and gore. The type of violence is what films about Aliens and Predators talk about, from which no one has spared. It really answers the question of how it would be if the aliens were on Earth. The answer is simple. We screwed up. The effects were beautiful. Anyway, there are real problems with it. <br /> <br /> 1) The game on the part of the character characters was awful, almost lulling me because of how dry and boring it was, which really interrupted the flow of the film and was very annoying. Script writers could make sooooo much better. The good part was the game Alien and Predator, which, in my opinion, was for the most part very good. <br /> <br /> 2) The size of the ship "Predator" was much smaller than in the first AvP movie. I scratched my head at <br /> <br /> 3) Predators wearing a mask while still on the ship. It upset people, and I can't understand why. This is not a hole in the plot, as most people do. So I tell you, people calm hell. This is nothing important. If this makes you feel better, remember that they had boring faces in boring warehouses, so this may be a good reason. <br /> <br /> 4) The Predator shoots a plasma caster inside the ship. I thought it was pretty stupid of the Predators. But then I began to think that it was the younger Predator who panicked. <br /> <br /> 5) The hunter and his son almost instantly arrived at the crash site after he fell several miles. At least they did not bother us, showing them to run in the woods for 30 minutes. so rejoice. <br /> <br /> 6) Why did only one Predator leave? I thought it was weird. But then I thought that it was because he thought that he was dealing with only one Predalien, and not with a flash. <br /> <br /> 7) Why did the Predators on the ship not destroy themselves? Well, if people paid attention, he did it alone, but he was killed before he could fully activate it. <br /> <br /> 8) Unlimited amount of blue melting mucus. I thought it was pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> 9) The predator hides evidence with sticky skin, but will throw off the cop. It was also stupid. <br /> <br /> 10) Black. Well, come on people, Alien and Pred really fought this at the power station. <br /> <br /> 11) Predalien, half-hugged face / queen. It really annoyed me. I am a foreigner and a fanatic. I know for sure that foreigners DO NOT DO IT !! Just like they do not give birth, as a person, as they showed in Alien4 !! Of all the comics, games, books and films 1, 2 and 3, CLEAR reveals their behavior. They need a queen to lay eggs, the egg hatch into the face-hagger, infect the face-hagger, the parasite pops up and kills the host and turns into a drone if it infects a person, Predalien with a predator and a runner with any kind of four-legged animal. And then, living through years over the years, they turn into Preatorians (a mini-queen who does not lay eggs), and I can go on and on, but I will not. But this scene alone almost ruined my movie. If the directors are smart, they will come back and edit it, making a face mask that infects pregnant women. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you are going to watch this movie, just watch it for Aliens and Predators. And when a scene appears, when Predalin infects pregnant women ... Close your eyes so that you do not have to see this insult to the universe of Aliens and Prev.
