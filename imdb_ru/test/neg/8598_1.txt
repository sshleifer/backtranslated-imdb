The most awkward so-called comedy I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Nothing reminds of the naturalism of a cheerful and daring sister city <br /> <br /> Vegas, as usual, but the script is so awful, so badly predictable English is in the worst possible form (in recent years all films Ireland was at least committed, Scotland with Braveheart and Trainspotting 2 stand out with great films, and in Wales were Twin Town, Zulu, Last Days of Dolvin, Torchwood, Doctor Who and Under Milk Wood and t . D. <br /> <br /> The comedy is painted in figures, the actors are dead, coming from the lack of characteristics and originality, and it’s just not funny. <br /> England lags behind, no matter how many dismal northern films they produce. This is an old class system that destroys English films. Oxbridge graduates publish endlessly clichéd scenarios about the working class people with whom they have never lived. This is a pity. Monty Python was not funny, as was Oxbridge. Nothing like this. <br /> <br /> Let guys like Johnny Vegas and Peter Kay, Rob Bridon, Billy Connolly or write their own dialogs and forget that the archaic class system that is not valid allows working class people and real talents that come through the system properly taking responsibility for writing the script, and the British and English film industry will rise again. Which next prince Edward will write modern day, Oliver Twist?
