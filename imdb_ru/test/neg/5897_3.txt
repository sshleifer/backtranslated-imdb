I did my best. God help me as I tried. But there are only some people who are practically unable to create quality. Brett Ratner, Uwe Boll, Britney Spears and Asylum. To their credit, the “Commission Report 9/11” seems like an honest attempt by the company to move into a more complex state of narration and film making. But for all intents and purposes, it looks like another truly film in their gallery. At the opening of the disclaimer notifies the audience that all the names have been changed, but the names of the terrorists remain relatively the same. A man named Moussaoui is trying to learn how to fly a plane. With a stone cold grimace that instantly makes someone feel uncomfortable, this undercover agent can learn to fly on a small computer. And you should not be surprised how he could enter this program so easily, but how these people didn’t even ask questions; because this scene is so far-fetched, and the actor playing this man is extremely exaggerated. And you can see that director Scott is trying to imitate Paul Greengrass with a bright, grainy photograph, followed by a terribly dizzying and annoying manual direction that throughout the film is trying to move away from Greengrass’s insane guerrilla. <br /> <br /> You may feel Scott imitating the Greengrass technique for realism, but halfway through it becomes quite insane. Meanwhile, the film is shot not so much as “traffic”, but as “Law and Law”. Order, in which we will have a disclaimer, notifying us that the names have been changed, the logo almost resembles the Law and Order logo, and then for ninety minutes the actors swing their chests and discuss policies. <br /> <br /> None of which is ever as convincing as he tries to be. And then, when the film seems like he is trying to become an adult drama, Scott relies on his old, sex-tolerant sex scene. Scott’s new film looks like he really wants to be considered small Jet Munich, but this is not the case, and he manages to be delighted with every possible case. "Commission Report 9/11" does not make sense, and this is because he is limited in his attempts to emulate other films. <br /> <br /> Although I appreciate the ambitions inherent in the camera, this new perspective of events leading to September 11 is flat and boring. No matter how hard I tried to be a low-budget “Munich,” it's really as interesting as the usual Dolph Lundgren film, which You will find on Cinemax.
