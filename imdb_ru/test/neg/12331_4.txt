What to say about this movie? A married couple has more than just each other. After the game for some time, everything becomes more serious. It is necessary to make a difficult choice: continue the old situation or start all over again, following the heart. Guess what happens at the end. <br /> <br /> This film seems very budget. But a good story should not be expensive. It looks like a play that was transformed into a film using only a few cheap places (at least, very few other visible people), and not just the scenes in this house. From the first minute, future events are as clear as water. Nothing unexpected happens. Sometimes you can think, watch a soft porn movie, in which case you know in advance that there is no story. <br /> <br /> I find this film disappointing, so this explains the vote (4).
