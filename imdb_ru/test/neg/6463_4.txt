One evening on Thursday at 10:00 pm, my local branch of ABC on the west coast transmitted a pilot episode of "Northern Exposure". The ABC network usually broadcasts the film “People in the Trees” during this period, but the program has been postponed to the live broadcast of a sporting event. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that both shows are held in Alaska and are filmed on site in the Northwest Pacific a few episodes of “Sex and the City”) reminds me of how disappointed I am with the poorly thought out hybrid “Men in Trees”. Anne Heche can be a good actress with the right material. Unfortunately, her role as a writer who ended up in a small town in Alaska annoys me. Perhaps due to the fact that I feel that Heche is mistaken, I am not convinced of her nature of "fish out of water." <br /> <br /> I also can't help but feel that the cast conforms to typical bizarre stereotypes. Hot local resident, friendly bar owner, bush pilot, local police, troubled but friendly radio DJ, etc. <br /> <br /> The only stereotype that could be broken was a teddy bear and a veteran "ER" the actor Abraham Benrouby as a local bartender, in love with two different women. Considering that one of the executive producers is director James Mangold (in his films The Heavy and The Policeman were the main characters who were big men), I am not surprised why Benruby was played in an unusual role. <Br /> <br /> However, I understand why there are a lot of dedicated viewers who love People in the Trees. This fits a fancy niche for a television audience. I wanted the show to have a voice of its own, and not to borrow ideas from the best shows.
