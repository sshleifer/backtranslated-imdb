Low budget horror movie. If you don't raise your expectations too high, you will probably like this little click. The beginning and the end are pretty good, the average times stretch, and it seems they donâ€™t go anywhere for long periods while we watch the insane happening, which adds to the atmosphere, but does not promote the plot. A little blood. I liked the performance of Bill McGee, which he made quite plausible for such a budgetary picture, that he managed to make a film in those moments when it seemed that nothing special was happening. Nurse Charlotte Beal, played by Jesse Lee, played her heroine well, so be prepared to strike her to the end! She makes some really stupid mistakes, but that's what makes these low-budget films so good! I would be out of this place and in five states long before she even thought it would be a good idea to leave! If you like this movie, try Committed since 1988, which is essentially a robbery of this movie.
