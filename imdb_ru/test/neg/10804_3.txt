Soultaker was written and starred Vivian Schilling. The film also starred Joe Estevez, Gregg Thomsen and Robert D'Zar as the Angel of Death. <br /> <br /> The story begins with an introduction to Soultaker, played by Joe Esteves. We quickly find out what role Soultaker will play in this film. <br /> <br /> Then, young people from college are preparing for a summer festival called Summerfest. In this film, the battle of classes is present throughout the film. Girls are from a rich class, and boys are from a middle or lower class. Cool roles seem to play a role in a film for some reason, which is not entirely clear or irrelevant to the story. <br /> <br /> At Summerfest we learn more about the apparent class struggle, why Zack is not recommended to meet with Natalie. Soultaker also appears with his boss Angel of Death. Here, D'Zara character indicates who should die, and whose souls should be taken. It also turns out that Soultaker will have a conflict with the character regarding Natalie and how he copes with her because of someone in his past. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Natalie ruined her trip to Summerfest, and Zach convinces her to go home with them. During the trip home, Soultaker plays an active role, causing them to crash terribly at high speeds. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story surrounds Soultaker, collecting the souls of the dead passengers, while Zach and Natalie are trying to outwit him to return to their bodies so that they can continue to live. Conflicts of classes and characters lie in history, but in fact never come to the fore and are not resolved. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt to pull out part of the drama to the end, there are a lot of persecutions and jogging which tends to be really boring. This is not entirely acceptable, and it would be nice if this were treated differently in order to somehow increase the drama, but not to bore the audience. <br /> <br /> History and acting skills are decent. With the soundtrack, everything is in order, and even the product quality is good. <br /> <br /> Robert D'Zar in his short speeches on the screen copes with the role of the Angel of Death. Joe Estevez copes, but sometimes his role is a bit small. Vivian is cute and copes well with the role of Natalie, although perhaps a little in several scenes. <br /> <br /> This may seem strange, but this film could definitely benefit from senseless nudity. Vivian teases us a little, but that was not enough. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this was a rather serious attempt to make a film. The results are worth a look. Just do not expect perfect production. <br /> <br /> 3/10
