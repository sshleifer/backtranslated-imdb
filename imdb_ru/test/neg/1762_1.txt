<br /> <br /> Nothing happens in this movie. With Reverend, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, complaining about his constipation and other toilet humor in the 2.5-hour film, you know that they made no cuts and left literally crap. This is a waste of good talent and complete embarrassment. Awful <br /> <br />
