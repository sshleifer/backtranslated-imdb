Give me a break. How can you say that this is a “good hockey film”? I know that films tend to be damn bad - they portray hockey for the general public. And yes, it was done back then, when the United States did not accept our sport as it is today, but in reality. I played hockey all my life and watched even more, and this, my friends, is just insane. The scenes on the ice were stunningly bizarre ... the specific case I’m talking about is “sword fighting”, I mean “fighting with sticks” at the end of the movie ... during which everyone just stands around and not with admiration watching how this actually happens, but wondering who will win the duel between Youngblood and his sworn enemy Raqqi. Yes, the ice story is a little better, I emphasize a little. <br /> <br /> I don’t know, maybe there’s no point in continuing ... I mean, let's face it: the film is right. Hockey is just one big battle on the ice ... oh yeah, with a small piece of vulcanized rubber bouncing around - sometimes into what is loosely called the “goal”. Young Blood is either terrible or hysterical, I can't understand that ... maybe someone else will have better luck.
