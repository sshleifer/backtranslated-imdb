SPOILER!!!! Mind Ripper Hmmm ... I just watched a nightmare in movies on Elm Street and just learned about Giovanni Ribisi. I thought that Giovanni Ribisi did not commit any horrors, so I signed up. I saw the “outpost” (“Reaper of the Mind”) and checked it on “Tivo”. Sci Fi had a broadcast date. So, I was installed. I got my popcorn, went in and sat on the couch, and what the hell is this? Damn, brave guy in blue sweatpants running around! There is nothing wrong with this movie! Anyway, it's funny! It's funny how low the budget is, how funny it is predictable, how funny the game is, and how much money it DOESN'T EARN. Well, Giovanni Ribisi is a good actor, but this film is stupid. This is so stupid. They killed him at the end, and then they fly on this plane, and the "monster" is on it. They shoot him in the head with a shotgun, and he falls far to the ground. And <br /> <br /> -GASP- Killing final, he is still alive! WOOHHH! Fearfully! woooohhhh! Suck a fat waste bag in 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: you have where to go and you need to kill time. The Ripper of the Mind is not an offer. I would rather sit naked in the snow than watch this movie a second time. <br /> <br /> GENERAL EVALUATION: F- - - - - - - - - (ENTER)
