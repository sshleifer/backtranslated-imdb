UP IN VILLA (2000) ** 1/2 ATTENTION: YOU CAN FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> It is difficult to understand what is the point in UP AT VILLA, magnificent, but shallow periodic material, one of those that were made with the sole purpose of obtaining Oscar nominations for the best costume design and artistic direction (one for cinematography and another for the score are also welcome). He has the same basic idea about the thousands of historical works produced each year: a beautiful, intelligent woman trying to find love in an unfamiliar place. She has many difficulties, but ultimately she finds her happiness in the arms of a man whom she has not achieved. In this case, our lady is in Florence, some time before the Second World War. She is an English widow engaged to a rich but old man (whom she obviously does not like). One day she meets another man whose reputation is not very good, but with whom she falls in love. Of course, there is her friend who will help her for better or for worse, and the third man who commits suicide here in the lady’s room, creating a risky situation for her. Guess how the story ends ...? <br /> <br /> UP THE VILLA is a good movie. I have always been interested in this story, but never worried. The problem is not the slow pace, but in the script. Adapted from the novel, he needs something sharper, more exciting, turns and tensions. Every time you think the story gets warm, it will become cooler again. If you think that there is a conspiracy involving the mean police chief of Florence, well, there is, but that does not change anything in history. It just goes on and on to a predictable end. <br /> <br /> As I said, UP AT VILLA is not bad. If it is a little soft, it never becomes juicy and too sentimental. The game is half, but certainly convincing. Kristin Scott Thomas made some really bad choices after the ENGLISH PATIENT (the romantic drama “HORSE HORSE” and the boring / annoying RANDOM HEART). UP at the VILLA is undoubtedly better than these pieces, and Christine is also better, but she can do more than that. Sean Penn is as good as ever, even if his character is a big dude. Anne Bancroft is a terrific actress (GRANT, O my God!), And here she does not allow her character to become ridiculous. Now the supporting actors are pretty bad (Jeremy Davis is sooooo annoying!). <br /> <br /> The direction is good, but not cheeky. It was interesting to know that the director is the same “Angels and insects” (also with Kristin Scott Thomas in the lead role), another so-called drama of the period, but more daring than this one. Visual effects are important here. Florence is wonderful, the costumes are excellent, the scenery, the music ... <br /> <br /> In the end, UP AT THE VILLA is an ordinary romantic drama, but, of course, it could be much better. It is watchable and interesting, but do not expect an unknown film - it is not so! This film fails because it wants to have some kind of riddle, something that can be seen ... However, there is nothing much to say, mainly because of the small script. Now, regarding the Oscar nominations, do not worry - they are likely to get them.
