... and that says something. No matter how bad the film becomes, I can usually watch through it so that I can judge the entire movie. Through this I did about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> It may have been a DVD, or maybe it was my laptop, but I could not hear the dialogue even when the volume was fully increased. The sound effects were fine, so when the volume increased to hear the dialogue, I blew out the eardrums with the effects. No matter how much I wanted to see through this thing, I was not going to sacrifice my hearing for that. <br /> <br /> From what I could say little about the plot, the film became one of the main memories of the main character. character's daughter. It seems that the mother, a military pilot, had to flee from her ship, because one person on her ship whom she trusted turned out to be one of the enemies, and now he is chasing her through a desert planet. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about the film was the appearance of the main character; there was something that I liked about her hairstyle. <br /> <br /> Oh well, it looks like it's in the trash ...
