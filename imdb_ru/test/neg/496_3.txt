Here is another great film critic love. The problem is that this is not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film is simple. Nine prisoners escape from prison after the tenth man loses his mind and tells them where the treasure is. <br /> <br /> In the first half there are a lot of farces, some of them are very wide, and in the second - a descent controlled by a character. fantasy and longing. <br /> <br /> Two halves just do not mix. Separate scenes work very well (the guys breaking the friends house, who has a new Filipino bride, are funny, while a later scene with a big guy working in a restaurant pulls hearts.) They just donâ€™t grapple with each other. <The movie also lacks whole settings. One scene shows guys desperately seeking change under a deserted vending machine to buy a snack. In the next scene, the whole team sits in a restaurant in a dredge. Where did they get the dresses and wigs? (The team includes both the big guy and the dwarf) How did they get all the clothes and money to buy food? And the most amazing, why are they in drag? They're obviously shaken guys, and let's face it, is there anything more memorable for witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating food in a woman's costume? I mention a big guy and a dwarf, because apart from the old guy, everyone else seems to mingle with each other. (In fact, they wear identical white overalls for most of the film). In the first half of the film, the characters are poorly developed, and as a result, the second half really lacks an emotional impact. As we often try to find out who is who in their individual winning scenes. <br /> <br /> Speaking of burdens, in the second half there are all these wonderful exciting camera shots and great emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great movie. It is also painfully slow, which makes a boring movie. <br /> <br /> 9 Souls - a big disappointment, reviews of a big movie whip, and it's somewhere out there, good luck finding it yourself.
