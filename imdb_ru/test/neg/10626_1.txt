Big spoiler right here: this movie B! A! D! But enjoy, it's good, bad. <br /> <br /> “Bugs” is a movie you can't believe, with such inept dialogues, plots and directing, that Uncle Ned's home video in Carlsbad Cavern looks like an IMAX experience, Since this is a movie " Troma ”, there is a lot of dirt in it, but it is even more stupid than usual. <br /> <br /> Much of the production money seems to have gone to buy soda and sandwiches for the cast and crew. A brilliant dialogue is best summed up in the immortal: “% @ # $! What was it? ”Which is the second after often shouting:“ So what now? ”<br /> <br /> Any knowledge of how people act in a desperate situation is foreign to Ronald Armstrong, a writer / director. When it turns out that one of the friends is eaten alive by a grasshopper / termite / chiapet, Armstrong makes the survivors immediately find time with a cute, but dull, like a doorknob, "Divine." While they are beating her, the Divine is cooking a large, steaming pot on the stove with a mixture of rat poison and oatmeal, stirring, smiling, stirring, smiling, never falling dead from the fumes! <br /> <br /> Killer beetles are as scary as the piñatas they are too similar to. The effects used to move them include dragging them very quickly over tile floors when their legs are pulled back. <br /> <br /> The brightest moment of the film probably was a blown up house, but they were either without money or never, so instead of seeing even the miniature catch fire, they just let the screen go black (eat up your heart from ILM). <br /> <br /> The cast is almost all black. How can the NAACP constantly censor something really funny, such as Amos and Andy (who portray characters no less similar to those that are present in 99% of all white comedy shows), but do not talk about anything like Bugged. Come on, the best thing is that they don’t know how humiliating this film is for everyone involved (as it would be if some ethnic group played it, to be honest). Before they put kabosh on Bugged, gather some friends and get ready for the movie Plan 9 of Bug Exterminator.
