Algeria is not a classic, it is a perversion of the remarkable original Pepe Le Moko, directed by Duvivier and in a much more attractive and charming Pepe, Jean Gabin. If you want to fully get acquainted with the "Kasbah" and characters in Algeria, I recommend you not even watch this movie and instead watch "Pepe Le Moko", because it is much harder, more beautifully shot, the lines are not clickable, and the characters stick to reality more. In addition, the final is so dramatic and important for the character Pepe that the version of Algeria will be unbearable. Although Algeria does almost excellent work, imitating every scene, the acting does not cope, as does the credibility of the characters. In addition, the wardrobe is truly breathtaking in all scenes, especially in Pepe in the last scene and Gabi (at all times), but also when she is on the boat. To be honest, Algeria is cheap in imitation.
