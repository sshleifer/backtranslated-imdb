I have to start by saying that this is one of the most annoying films I've seen in my entire life! Annoying factor number one: never see the face of "son" (for the entire film). And an infinitely more annoying factor: this continuously ringing phone ... nothing but listening to the phone ring again and again, again and again, again and again, again and again, again and again, again and again and again, again and again ..., The old man was persecuted, but the observer was too! At first the film was interesting to me, but it quickly deteriorated. The film may have been good as short, but definitely was not enough to sustain anything approaching the length of the feature film. I think what I'm trying to say is that the message about racism (which finally appeared in the last two scenes of the film) is secondary to the persecution of this old man. Who cares to sit and watch what really is nothing but an old man, spewing obscenity to someone who calls him? If you have never seen a movie that just gets under your skin and drives you crazy ... check it out!
