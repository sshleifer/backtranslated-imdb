This is the voice of a man who has just finished watching the second season in Rome, almost in the same breath, and took the opportunity to see "what happened next" - this film is conveniently shot where Rome ends. If you find Rome to be an abomination, bad language, with a little historical accuracy, then you might like Imperium: Augustus. But if you feel that Rome is good, if you like complicated intrigue, the atmosphere of decadence and the work of actors, then the Imperium will obviously seem to be too timid, excessive and tedious soap opera, in which there is not so much expiatory. factors. <br /> <br /> There are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than in Rome. I especially didn’t like the image of Rome Cleopatra as a sexual drug addict. This woman must have had a lot of strength and dignity, and the actress in the Imperium is much better suited to this role. O'Toole and Rampling are good, as are some others. But then ... If you know and love Atiya as a super cool bitch, you will see her image in the Imperium - like a mother goose crying in tears in an apron - absolutely ridiculous. It is assumed that there are some bitchy characters in the Imperium, but these actresses rely heavily on men and nothing else. You will not find interesting female characters in this epic. There is also a painfully comical Patron, whom we see as a screaming transvestite, although there is little historical evidence that he was such (he was once referred to as "effeminate in his pleasures" in the annals). <br /> Interiors are rather scarce and rely on clichés on clichés. Cleopatra's Great Hall looks like something from a computer game or children's playroom in an Egyptian theme park. There is a very bad 3D graphics that does not meet the 2003 standards. <br /> <br /> The action is presented in the form of a series of memories experienced by elderly Augustus. Thus, we briefly consider some historical events, some of which are presented well, and some are not. The disproportionate amount of time wasted to show Libya as the “eternal flame” of Augustus. This business does not boil even for a moment, the dialogue is super-flaming and everything is flavored with sticky, tear-causing music. No matter how much the reality show intends to capture, every last piece of it is destroyed by dry synchronized duplication (most actors are not native English speakers). <br /> <br /> In this epic, everything is warm. True, the historical values ​​more than in Rome, but, if to speak dramatically, it is just boring. Characters lack the depth and sharpness of the dialogue. Shooting work often comes down to static shots, and the lighting does not give anything to please your eye. <br /> <br /> Imperium really has no one to love and hate. Regardless of whether you like Rome or not, there are a lot of the best movies and mini-series. Ancient Rome: the rise and fall of the empire is what I recommend.
