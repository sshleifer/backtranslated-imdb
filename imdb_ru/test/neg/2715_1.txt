Yes, it was a terrible movie, but at the beginning of the movie, I think there was a song called “I have Woody” or something like that. I would like to find a soundtrack, if there is one. I saw this song on MST 3K, and no matter how awful it was, it had its moments, and this song was one of them. <br /> <br /> If you like bikini babes, this is a movie for you, but if not, then do not worry. It was an excellent material for MST 3K, I must admit. I would really like to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack. Not only this song, but also a couple were really funny, and, as I understand it, this is a classic.
