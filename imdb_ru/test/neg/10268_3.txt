Everything that made the original so interesting here seems to be missing. This is just a slasher of "running demons mills in destructive chaos", but without the passion that graced the original. <br /> <br /> This story is nothing new, in fact it seems that they ignore the first one at all. Here the demons scatter into a high-rise apartment building and, of course, kill most of the inhabitants in a terrible way. The effects of makeup here seem less convincing than the first time. Although the actors in “Demons” were not exactly brilliant, in Demons II they were actually much worse. You don't care about these characters, EVERYTHING. The plot is missing, the music is bad (except for one song by Simon Boswell), this is not at all scary; it's just not so good. <br /> <br /> Most likely, the worst film, in which Dario Argento participated, and Lamberto Bava (in this film Bava has an episodic, not very funny). <br /> <br /> Perhaps 3 is too high a rating, but at least I could watch it all and did not think to stop halfway through. My advice; Stick to the original.
