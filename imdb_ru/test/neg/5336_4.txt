Before Miracle on 34th Street, Maureen O'Hara and John Payne did this, this, this film. I was going to describe it, but I cannot find words about how bad this film turned out. The subject of adoption of the child and Maureen's disease are very serious and sensitive issues, but despite this, this could have been done much better than it was. He was so extreme in his image that he did not look like a real one at all. His problem probably began with a weak script. <br /> <br /> Another example of a screenwriter shooting a novel and writing a weak film. (See My Review “The Stranger is in My Hands.”) The beautiful O'Hara was often burdened with such clokers, the other was “Forbidden Street” (“Britanica Muse”), which I can eventually consider. <br /> <br /> If you have any emotional connection with this since childhood, you will be kinder to this rather lifeless, colorless and dim film. But for something like this, maybe you can find a remake of a television movie. It should be better. It must be.
