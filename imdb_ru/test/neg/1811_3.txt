Honestly, I have never been to Congo or even to Africa, and after watching the television film Heart of Darkness, I don’t think I want to. The film completely shames the book to the highest possible level. Although the book was not the best I read, after watching the film I seemed to rate the book a hundred times more. Nicholas Roeg, the director of the film, did a terrible job of portraying Joseph Conrad's novel in the movies. I thank Horn for trying to do the impossible by turning the book into a film, but perhaps this was not a job for him. The film failed to express any part of the novel, except the basics of the plot. The set and landscape also lacked the beauty that Conrad portrayed from Africa in the book. In the book, Marlow has seen so many great wonders, but in the film you did not get the same experience. No, I do not blame the director for everything; the action in the film was just awful. All the actors were boring and uninteresting. Throughout the film, I felt that the actors did not express any emotion, as if they were reading the script all the time. Tim Roth, who plays Marlowe, did not portray the feeling of Marlowe’s adventure for his travels to Congo well. Marlow's trip to find Kurtz was supposed to be perilous, but I did not experience this in the film. I would not recommend watching this movie, especially if you have already read the book. This is not close to doing justice for the novel by Joseph Conrad. Conrad’s words capture the reader and take them on a journey with Marlowe, in his quest to find Mr. Kurtz, where, like in the film, he wasn’t. Great story, but very bad movie. The Heart of Darkness film is based on a book by Joseph Conrad, also called the Heart of Darkness.
