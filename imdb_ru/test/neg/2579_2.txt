Steven Seagal’s intention is commendable, and his actions in this film are similar to those of many others, if you ignore the fact that he supposedly portrays a brilliant scientist. I had a problem with two plot points, because of which my disbelief stretched to the limit. <br /> <br /> Firstly, as this is a carefully thought-out version of a nasty embryo, whose antidote must also be thoroughly investigated and designed by a large laboratory, is it possible to cure drinking tea from a flower growing high in the mountains? and that the grandfather's family seems to be the only people who know something about this? <br /> <br /> Secondly, and this one really takes the cake: having collected enough medicine to repair the whole city, isn’t it? Do you expect the army to land a helicopter and start throwing bags of flowers into all the houses in this small town? No, instead they decided to sprinkle flowers all over the city and make sick people go out and collect them again and again. Just silly, if only by driving the Indians the power of the drug does not depend on how it came out and collected the flowers itself. <br /> <br /> Add the cardboard nature of the villains and the unsuitability of the title, and you might think that my voice on this film is really high.
