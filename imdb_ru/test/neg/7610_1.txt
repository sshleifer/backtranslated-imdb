I really rarely give one or ten stars to any film, but it was so terrible, I had to make an exception. <br /> <br /> I am a SciFi fan and have seen some SciFi comedy shots that I genuinely like. There simply was nothing to please. <br /> <br /> I realized that it started with a very small budget for a film student. But even with that in mind, the sets and the effect are bad. Cinematography is mediocre, but perhaps the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> The game is bad. The sad state when a female voice at the computer is the best actor. The dialogue is bad. The script is very weak, the plot is incoherent and almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> Humor is not just subtle and sublime; it is nowhere to be found. For example, the whole 20 minutes from an 80-minute film are spent on an unsuccessful combo-joke with two blows, with an alien mascot and an elevator. <br /> <br /> This should have been a parody of all the bad 50s SciFi before 2001. What we end up with is just a slightly updated version of the old 50s SciFi C film. At least those films were funny because they took themselves seriously.
