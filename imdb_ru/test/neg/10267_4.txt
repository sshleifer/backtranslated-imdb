When the word “gifts” finds its place in the title, preceded by a well-known name, the work usually stops immediately. For some reason, people who are able to create good art do not seem to see it in others. However, I was always ready to try the second part of the Demons trilogy. On the one hand, the soundtracks absolutely die. Most American directors would sacrifice little animals to build a sort of talent on the soundtrack of the movie “Demons 2.” And two more words: “Asia Argento.” (Of course, she was eleven years old when this film was made, and a few years after her seeming decision that she would style her play after the early Helen Mirren: pair looks and small clothes.) In addition, Lamberto Bava comes from one of The best dynasties of Italy in this strange subgenre of horrors, known as Jallo (he is the son of Mario Bava, who may have invented this genre in the sixties). And the real “Demons” are absolutely necessary for fans of the eighties horror films. So how can it be bad, right? Well, bad. Demons continue to attack the Italian media when the film opens in a modern Italian high-rise building, where many people who go through life have televisions in the background. They all watch a sort of combo news message / video about some types of investigative reporters trying to get evidence of the events of the first film (which seems to set the time frame for this film no more than a few days after the first film). With the help of an ordinary horror film, unable to concentrate, the reporters manage to bring the demon back to life, and he goes through the TV screen to start the plague anew. <br /> <br /> Yes. This is so bad. The only good thing you can say about the movie is that the soundtrack (when you are not offended by the likes of The Smiths, The Cult, Gene Loves Jezebel, etc.) is terrific. It comes from the keyboard of Simon Boswell, who began his career as a member of the Argento dynasty and has since started making films such as “The Lord of Illusions” and “Hackers”. <br /> <br /> Makes half decent free rentals if you plan to drink a lot, but this is definitely not as fun as the original. Kronenberg's wonderfully funny joke about high-altitude nasty creatures, Shivers (from the inside), is much better.
