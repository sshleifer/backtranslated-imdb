I heard that this step was compiled by a group of schoolchildren. For a school art or theater project, this is not so bad. If you didn’t live near Milpitas in the seventies or didn’t know someone who was involved in making the film, that’s pretty awful. Most of the actors are clearly not actors, but locals who volunteered. Bob Wilkins (initial lead Creature Features on KTVU in Auckland appears, but only for a minute). Some of the monster effects are made with stop motion animation, and some with a man in a monster costume, and each works well on its own, but there is no continuity between them. If you look without dialogue, we can assume that there were 2 monsters in the film. I assume that the most inappropriate aspect is that even the main characters, who, I believe, are the children behind the film, cannot even pretend that these children are acting must have somehow been involved , to want to do this project, but they show zero believable emotions in front of the camera.
