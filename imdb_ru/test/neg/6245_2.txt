During my constant search for the worst movie of all time, my friends and I came across this little gem. Very fun, especially if you do not know (as we did not know) that this is a semi-continuation of another series of horrors. <br /> <br /> I will not go into the plot, except to mention that everyone is complaining about the terrible snowstorm that was approaching (it was equivalent to the characters just shouting "RETURN!" to the camera and waving their hands), and , in some strange twist of fate, a blizzard ever happens. I think the problems with the budget. <br /> <br /> Add this to the magic entrance door, which opens or closes depending on what kind of scaring effect the director wants to create and turn off the electricity until the gym teacher decides to take a shower with plenty of soap. I admit it; I had trouble breathing at certain points. <br /> <br /> The only decent part of this film, as it turned out, was from the original movie “Pajama Party”. Now it's much funnier for me when I know it. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * The end, when it turns out that the slasher did it, because her drunken friends stumbled upon her, and her friend, looking at, and then a friend, riding in a train or something like that probably the funniest source of psycho-killers, enhanced by the incredible use of blur and video. I am glad that all the friends of the slasher have completely forgotten about this incident until they need a memory. <br /> <br /> Run, don’t go to pick it up and see the fun. Of course, the continuity editor should get a reward for all this, unless they are stuck in this terrible blizzard ...
