Like most musicals of that era, you need to check the reality at the door. The 1938 Broadway MELODY is neither believable nor believable, but funny in its strange sense. This film is really just a reason to fulfill the talents of the stars. Some scenes just happen as if they were in a review, and not in a movie based on a plot. <br /> <br /> Judy Garland is shining, and it's a pity that she has so little to do if there is nothing left on the floor of the cutting room. br /> <br /> One of the most stupid events is how Eleanor Powell gets the main role in the Broadway show, and Robert Taylor says it will be work, work, work from dawn to dusk. Several scenes pass, and there is no work, no rehearsals ... NOTHING. She needs money to win a horse at auction. She has no money. Isn't she paid while she rehearses? Taylor must borrow money to help. He must be an outstanding producer. He has no money ??? In any case, these are just two elements in this strange story. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are simply wonderful, which saves them from total loss. The 1940 Broadway MELODY is much better than the 1936 Broadway MELODY.
