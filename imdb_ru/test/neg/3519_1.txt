I recently watched this movie because I'm a big Kinski fan. But oh my goodness Do not get me wrong. I love this guy. But in this film his whole acting is just a refusal to work! But, fortunately, he is not the only one to blame. First of all, the full storyline is absolutely weak when it comes to the militants who are looking for the killer, and Kinski is stuck in prison for a crime he did not commit. It's all. All conversations and characters are so bad that they make you scream. But maybe this is all the fun. If you know Kinski’s biography, it’s obvious that Kinski didn’t care about these films at all. Especially all of his Italian-Western roles. He just took the money, and that was it. again, this whole movie is completely weird. Only for hardcore fans of the genre.
