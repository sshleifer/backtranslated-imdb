It is true, no one expects anything from the sequels. But even by such low standards it is a terrible film. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is an anthological film, this fourth issue of the HellRaiser saga tries to become a story about the origin and the end of the whole series. time. An ambitious idea. But none of the actors were given enough time on the screen to do something with their characters, and newcomer director Jager refused the film, instead of giving in to studio intervention. The result is a bunch of mediocrity, which even fans are hard to protect. If you are not a fan of "Alan Smithee", avoid it.
