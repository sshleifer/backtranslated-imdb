The woman telephonist is captured by the spirit of the recently deceased ninja, strips down to her underpants, pours tomato juice on her body so that her boyfriend can lick him off, performs a seductive dance and leaves to kill the policemen who killed the ninja with whom she is obsessed. Only to track down the one-eyed ninja master. Like in real life, huh?

This is the perfect combination of genres that are completely different from each other.
