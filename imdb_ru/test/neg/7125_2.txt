I'm a big fan of the first four Ju-on projects. I own them and watch them every few months. I lend them to colleagues and friends only so that they can get scared by the quality Japanese filmmaking. I think Takashi Shimizu created a magnificent story and presented it very effectively in these four articles. <br /> <br /> I was somewhat excited about the opening of The Grudge 2 in cinemas. I saw the first American Grudge before viewing four originals. The grudge was actually pretty good. Of course, the originals are better, but I got a good Halloween panic from American Grudge 2004. <br /> <br /> Grudge 2 got off badly and got down from there. I kept waiting until it was better to make sense, to show Shimizu’s talent — nothing like that happened. There is a wonderful story in Shimizu Joo's work. True, as a rule, in a scattered style says that you need to think about connecting its components, but it is still a great story. There was no story in The Grudge 2. It was a series of gratuitous deaths from characters that you didn’t even have time to take care of. <br /> <br /> Editing was awful. Dissociation (as in Japanese originals) is one thing, but the complete randomness of the scene sequence was exhausting. I just kept thinking: “It's so stupid” and “No - he really didn’t sell so much, did he?” It made me want to leave the theater, run home and see the original work, just to convince myself that always committed this stupid, common, boring, meaningless, abandoned meanness. /> <br /> If you really want to watch this movie, I advise you to wait 2 months to make it. Indeed. Two out of five people in the theater came out with me in about 45 minutes. I argued whether I should do this myself. Returning home and cleaning the house actually sounded like the best way to spend time in this place. <br /> <br /> I'm really shocked by how bad this movie is. Let's pray, Sam Raimi doesn't spend more money to earn The Grudge 3. It's not worth it anymore. Sigh.
