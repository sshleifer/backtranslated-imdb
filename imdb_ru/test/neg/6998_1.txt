American critics and fans should have long since begun to refute their indisputable careless reverence for films such as Once Upon a Time in America by Sergio Leone. The checkered history of this sumptuous film (and the grandiose, whimsical myth associated with its production and many versions) contradicts its mediocrity at the narrative level. The film moves back and forth in parts and attacks, its central figures drift and seem out of place, surrounded by the ersatz-decadence of the highest scenery, small things produced, and by 1984 a cliche, but an excellent cinematic confectionery offered by the audience. The timeline of the story is confusing, useless and difficult, forcing some critics to imagine that the opium figure of Noodles is the precursor of some future "reality of dreams," as well as memories in sepia tones. This windy, overly fanatically apologetic interpretation obscures the blatant narrative disturbances on display. Even at this full (?) Time of work, the figures appear and disappear with frightening suddenness: Deborah’s character appears fleetingly in childish form, a cold and inaccessible “trophy” woman, without even hinting at the gravity with which she recovers her relationship with Lapshoa after prison, the aforementioned repeated union now sounds completely false. Something is to blame for the restraining pace, some episodes last too long, remaining unchanged, meaning very little, hinting at the director with such little restraint and narrative economy that he often feels obliged to usurp every bit of possible screen time to show off his production fatal for a film that contains such gloomy and alienated figures. The life trajectory of the figures is presented to us as a microcosm reflecting the historical trajectory of the teenager of America through the ban and his prey, ending with (controversial) destruction of his dying central figures (except for Deborah - a joke or deliberate cosmetics department) one miracle). This concept is banal, even banal. The cast of the characters, presented in the script from one note (written by at least seven Italians), is played directly and awkwardly by everyone except the younger actors, who at least risk using several variations of facial expression. This is understandable, given the almost non-working material. Some critics argue that the characters may seem so impenetrable to themselves, but actively pursue their own goals, suggesting the consent of others (for example, when Noodles come out of prison, Max picks him up and offers him a prostitute without asking him or not that he wants, and then makes deals, assuming that the noodles will comply). This explanation of their sharp, abrasive inclinations is unsatisfactory to outsiders and simply serves to underline the complex goals that unshakable filmmakers will go to in order to defend their positions in relation to the film, unfortunately without meaning. Although Ennio Morricone's assessment is very revered, it is undoubtedly sugary and repetitive, he gushes with the emotional breath of the intoxicated that the scenes themselves, a lot of violence, are simply not justifying. In some moments it is doubtful whether Morricone watched the same film in which I was so inappropriate, this is his work. Like the American film industry, it succeeds in terms of mood (thanks to several successes of masterful editing, intersecting time intervals) and visual effects (not supported by the specified score), but it lacks narrative cohesion and smoothness.
