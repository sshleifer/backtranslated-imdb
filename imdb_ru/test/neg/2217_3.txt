Why not write in French? Very Kitsch! This journey through the center of the earth is a disgusting technical opportunity, however, operating in 1976. These big "Casimir" monsters are completely ridiculous! The film, however, deserves a "remake", as well as "KING KONG" (the latter), with a slightly more set script. The professor has similarities with professorial calculus and is quite funny. David (the character) is rather inconsistent, but he directs (spends) the good message “unite and defeat yourself!” To people from below. In general, we would call the film, shot in the 40s. Now that I have said everything (or almost) the evil that I was thinking about, we can say that if we have a tired brain or something must see the other, then the thing (matter) is even quite interesting. Hugh! This is my opinion! (translate French to English using Reverso: sorry for any mistakes!)
