After his role in the movie “Seven Thieves” (1960), which I watched a few years ago, Edward Robinson seems to be stuck playing the role of old criminal masterminds (except for a strange juicy role, like in the movie THE CINCINNATI KID [1965])) . Earlier, I watched the quite good work of the Euro-cult GRAND SLAM (1967), and besides this, I have to check two more similar names from Italy, one of which was the director future go -meister Lucio Fulci! In any case, this is a type of international production with the participation of American and Italian actors and a British director, which was distributed in the 1960s; It is harmless and easy to handle by itself, but hardly remembered and certainly too long - especially since the acquisition of funds for heavy equipment needed for a robbery (for example, for an army tank and an airplane!) requires a lot of First, about petty theft. <br /> <br /> The gang is, of course, an incompetent party led by an American (Robert Wagner) and his girlfriend (Raquel Welch) - the rest are a “pacifist” black man, an eternally hungry Italian and a little Englishman. They are trying to convince the former gangster (Vittorio De Sica) to give them his fortune, except that he is a beggar ... but under the auspices of the "professor" Robinson he offers instead of capers platinum worth $ 5 million! Needless to say, the gang members do not trust each other (Wagner orders Welch to seduce De Sick to get the name of their fence in Morocco - where they must retreat after the robbery), or to spoil the job (by request) to keep the restaurant, the Italian cannot resist from sitting at the table and ordering several-course food for yourself!). Funny, in the face of such failures, De Sica tries to show them how they did it in the old days - however, allegedly holding a gas station, it turns out that the owner is his nephew, and he just asked to borrow some money! <br /> <br /> The central sequence of robberies is usually complex: while the gang, including Welch, is “taken” by a train carrying platinum, Wagner kidnaps the pilot Victor Spinetti and his plane. When the work is done, he fully intends to cross De Sick twice, but neither his partners nor Welch are ready to agree with this, so he is forced to relent. Based on the time when the crime did not pay off, the gang manages to lose its entire hiding place in the air, when the doors of an airplane bomb shelter accidentally open ...
