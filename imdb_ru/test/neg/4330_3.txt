This film has an amazing cast. MGM took some of its best actors and starred in the film with charming Margaret O'Brien. Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold and Lewis Stone play the role of three greedy old bachelors who live in the same house. Although they have accumulated a fortune over the years, they have also been selfish idiots. One of them has an idea to donate some property in order to buy a good name for himself (like Carnegie), but it turns out that the property they want to give is actually owned by O'Brien. And since she is an orphan, they voluntarily become her custodians so that they can give HIS property and look like great philanthropists. <br /> <br /> There is also a silly storyline involving fairies - led by the wonderful character actor Henry Davenport. And, since O'Brien is an Irishman (as evidenced by her outrageous accent), she and little people make up most of the plot. To be honest, I absolutely hated this part of the film and wanted them to just completely remove it. Instead, the story could STILL be about sweet Margaret, concealing the hearts of evil old men - it would have worked. But ... "little people"?!? Sheesh! In general, the actors try very hard, but the stupidity of the plot and the deadly serious way they tried made me cringe. I noticed that many people liked this film - I guess Iâ€™m an old grumbler! The film is terribly difficult to watch.
