I usually don’t try to figure out a crime thriller, but the Cleaner was too predictable. Samuel L. Jackson, who plays Tom Cutler’s character, along with his profession, created an interesting twist at the beginning of the film, but that’s what it was about. Without even thinking, I knew where the plot would be taken, and after 30 minutes I already knew who the murderer was. Instead of trusting myself and watching a few films that make a turn, I watched before it was completed. What a disappointment, I was right from the start. <br /> <br /> Character casting was good, as was the acting skills of Jackson and Harris ... except for Eva Mendez. From the starting gates, she didn’t play a believable character in accordance with the script, and this too quickly destroyed the whole plot. Maybe it was a direct failure or just a weakness in the story itself. Her role in the role of Ann Norkut was to show more emotion and stress in the situation around her. This would make the assembly more attractive, and the final more dramatic. However, Cleaner is watchable, not memorable. I saw CSI episodes that were more exciting than that.
