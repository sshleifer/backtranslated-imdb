Very similar to Final Fantasy, if you look at the photo - it doesn’t look so bad. But when people start moving, it's terrible. Heterogeneous sudden movements, a frightening lack of emotions and a lack of a feeling of life on my face make me shiver. Characters do not even seem alive / organic. <br /> <br /> I saw a preview with my daughter, who actually fell asleep! She was not at all engaged. For reference, I thought that she would be easily interested in both Pixar-esque films and a number of “bad” 2D films, such as Sinbad. <br /> <br /> Illumination is painful, gives children the appearance of holding a flashlight under the chin by the fire. Lip sync is bad - actually worse than Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> I also seriously doubt that Hanks played five characters ... this was a major distraction throughout the film. The role of the conductor is terrible, although I just can’t pinpoint. It reminds me of my father’s fake “telephone” voice when he greets customers. <br /> <br /> I think this is why several roles distract you - you know for sure that the voice is the same, but still distinctly different. This gives each character a feeling of ACTION, unlike real human characters. The illusion of reality is broken by Hanks' multiple role-playing game. I have seen the technique of work — a la Eddie Murphy, but Hanks simply cannot come close to coping with this one voice, given the horrific animation. <br /> <br /> I would not spend money on it - wait for the lease.
