Plankton, or Creatures from the Abyss, as I am sure that it is more commonly known as “Creatures from the Abyss” and is displayed under a moving image and in the same type of font as other titles, starts with five or more children, Mike (Clay Rogers), his girlfriend Margaret (Sharon Twomi), sisters Julie (Ann Wolfe) and Dorothy (Lauren DePalm) and an annoying idiot named Bobby (Michael Bon) who decide to fit into a small rubber boat and go on the sea, do not ask why, because I do not know. Oh, idiot, Bobby left gasoline behind and never thought of telling anyone about it, so it’s no wonder that they ended up in the sea without gasoline for the engine and, even worse, were trapped during a thunderstorm. detect a dead body floating in water. Shortly after their fate changes, when they encounter a yacht and potential safety, in an instant everyone sits on the yacht and begins to explore. First, they find a science lab with various fish samples and computer equipment, and then find fully furnished and luxurious cabins downstairs. They find a chemist (Deran Sarafyan) who looks crazy and can't talk. They eat fish from the refrigerator, which causes Dorothy to vomit green vomit, beetles and slugs. They learn that these fish are 1000 years old, and they are contaminated with toxic waste dumped into the sea, and that they fly, change, bite and, as a rule, it is unpleasant to be around. I really can't be bothered by the continuation of this plot, so I will not, that's what I think ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was produced and directed by Massimiliano Cherchi under the pseudonym Al Passeri (I would hide under another if I made a movie too bad), and I think Plankton is just one of the worst films ever, there’s so much wrong with this movie that it’s hard to know where to start. First of all, Richard Baumann’s script is complete nonsense, it makes no sense, it is so slow and boring that it was hard for me to sit in it. Why did five people simply float to the middle of the ocean in a rubber boat, large enough to accommodate them all? What did they plan to do exactly? Why do we often get pictures from the point of view of these fish creatures, but they seem completely invisible to the characters, because they are never shown on the screen, even if they are next to the character, and how these fish bypass the boat, as there is no water for them to swim in ? People’s actions and reactions to things are all wrong, they are constantly falling apart, they make strange decisions that simply have no meaning in the situation in which they find themselves, and some of the dialogues are as terrible as everything I heard. I could talk all day about all the holes in the plot and ridiculous events, but I do not have enough space if I do it. The fish creatures themselves look terrible, the mixture of rubber puppets and the really bad animation of the stop motion at the end, the scenes where they interact with the human character also look terrible with some bad superposition. I heard a lot of comments that plankton is terrible, don't make me laugh! Forget that there is almost no blood or blood in plankton, there are a couple of slimy scenes, when Bobby turns into a fish monster during sex with Julie, but it’s rather short and he doesn’t kill her, he just drops slime on her and a couple of tentacles grow mouth goes fish head. Later, some dark mucus begins to drip from Julie's vagina, but that is all, we will never know what is happening to her and what is mucus. Dorothy has a fish creature coming out of her back and controlling her, but again, we never know what happens to her while Margaret commits suicide, a very short shot of a plastic harpoon attached to her forehead. Most likely, the roughest scene is when Dorothy picks up this green material with something like beetles and slugs. That's all, only one person actually dies on the screen, and for the most part Plankton is quite tame and just as exciting as watching the paint dry, and I almost fell asleep, it's so boring. I can't figure out how someone might like this shit, I just can't. The game is terrible, dubbing is terrible, the characters are terrible, and I hate them all. From a technical point of view, Plankton, as expected, is also crappy, with an estimated budget of only $ 250,000, and all I can say is where does the money go? The sets are monotonous and boring with one laboratory and several cabins, special effects are the bottom of the barrel, including the most artificially looking exploding boat in history, the cinematography is soft, the music settles, there is no atmosphere or tension, and in general Plankton, like its name, as low in the food chain as possible. I hate Plankton, it is terrible in every aspect, it lasts more than 86 minutes. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs, unless you are a masochist or not having insomnia.
