This film tells about a young couple who runs off to start a new life in Los Angeles, and as a result, she is haunted by a psycho in a deserted rest stop. Actually, this is only a girl (Nicole), because her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes. The film is moving very fast, and from the very beginning you wonder how it can stretch the plot to its full length. Soon you realize that the film does this by simply wasting time on unnecessary scenes that do not lead anywhere. <br /> <br /> The story is not only thin, but unstructured, stupid and incoherent. A few minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and car, Nicole finds a motor home at a bus stop to rest. She sees the flash of the camera and KNOWS that people are inside, but she is easily disappointed in trying to get their help when no one answers her knock at the door. After the killer told her that her boyfriend was in danger, she went around the rest stop, doing all sorts of nonsense and unnecessary things. This includes turning on the TV (and even not looking amused when she thinks she stumbled on porn, even in this difficult situation), sit, wandering, and drink from a bottle of alcohol for several hours in a row. She does all this, Knowing that her boyfriend has been abducted, that the killer is still at large and is pursuing her, and is not taking any action to ensure her immediate safety (she is not trying to lock the door or stay alert). Oh, yes, she is trying to use the radio to call for help, but why bother even when there is a mobile home with people inside, THE RIGHT TO THERE at the bus stop for a rest? It seems that the scriptwriter forgot about this important fact when he wrote this part of the story. <br /> <br /> In this story there is no feeling of engagement or constant danger. The heroine freely wanders around the various buildings at the bus stop for rest, while the killer only occasionally drives in to scare her, and then leaves again. Nothing prevents Nicole from simply taking off (even if the rest stop is still far, it's better than sitting idle), but she still decides to stay. At some point in the film, the protagonist even CONFIRMS that she can run away, but does not. <br /> <br /> History is not going anywhere, but instead it just jumps from a meaningless segment to a meaningless segment. Nicole finally gets into a motor home, and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of protected, supposedly inbred, or psychotic religious fanatics. They seem deliberately ignorant or not caring about the actions of the killer (but there is no indication that they are in any way connected with him), and then they kick Nicole out after a few minutes. <br /> <br /> In the next irrelevant segment, the protagonist enters the bathroom building. She discovers one of the previous victims of the murderer (a young woman named Tracy), who is still alive and locked in a closet. For some strange reason, Tracy starts to rip a ridiculous amount of blood. Nicole leaves to take the crowbar to open the cabinet door, and when she returns in a minute, Tracy and her pool of blood disappeared without giving a reason. What was the point? Nicole finds a bulletin board showing a lot of missing people, and sees that Tracy disappeared in 1971. So was Tracy a ghost or something? The writer never bothers with explanations. <br /> <br /> Then, in the middle of the night, a policeman appears, who oversees the police department at a rest stop, which has so far remained unattended throughout the day. Nicole tells him everything about what is happening, and when the killer drives in his truck near the office, the policeman goes out to confront him. What does a policeman do, knowing that something is seriously wrong? He goes up and calmly talks to the killer (whom Nicole even indicated was the guy who was following her), and buys the killer's lies, that he was just passing through and needed instructions. Seriously. Then the policeman talks to Nicole outside, completely unaware that the pickup turns around and runs up to him. <br /> <br /> A policeman quickly begins to tell Nicole that he is finished, who is still "happy that he is breathing," but still, oddly enough, he does not die for quite a long time. The two of them are making more meaningless conversations, and the very important fact that he has a gun is not even annoyingly mentioned for too long. When the two of them finally try to use the pistol, Nicole stupidly wastes most of his bullets, firing blindly at the door when the killer may have been behind her. Leaving two bullets, the policeman tells Nicole to use one to put him to sleep. She shoots him in his mouth, and he freezes for a few moments, tearing a piece off his head. Then he suddenly and inexplicably shouts out: “You missed!” And she should shoot him again. Absolutely cheap attempt at shock. <br /> <br /> Nicole finally stands up to the killer and fails. The film ends with a scene taking place shortly thereafter, when a woman arrives at a strangely much more active stop for a rest. In the bathroom building, she hears Nicole calling for help in the closet (locked up, like Tracy). She forces the cop to come in and check it out, but he finds, apparently, a normal and clean closet. The policeman leaves, thinking that he was deceived. Because of some drawers in the closet, beaten Nicole could be seen (she would have been easily noticed if the cop had spent all 10 seconds searching), apparently too stupid to say or do something when there was a policeman. Wow <br /> <br /> This film appears to be the first in a new line of “quality” direct-DVD movies advertised as too extreme for movie theaters. Actually, it's just more cliché, bullshit B-Movie.
