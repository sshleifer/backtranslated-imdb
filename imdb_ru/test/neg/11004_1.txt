With a budget of tens of dollars, one of the most horrific actions you have ever seen, and absolutely NO, even remotely scary moments - not even a nanosecond! The filming was at the elementary school level — one, still filmed outside the house, was obviously tame and moved insanely.

Most titles in credits should be pseudonyms, it would be a career suicide to have IT in your resume. Do yourself a favor and watch Ebert's video about his colonoscopy instead!
