Well, I wanted to see it, because he had some good reviews, but this film was terrible ... Just awful. The characters were one-dimensional, and the actors could not do anything to breathe life into them. The story was terrible ... The wind stopped becoming a plot device halfway ... It is just completely forgotten. The visual effects were sooooo stretched ... 5 minutes of a guy crawling on the ground, 3 minutes of a girl applying makeup. I do not know what this guy is trying to accomplish ... as if he has no plot, no dialogue, and the film had to be shown for so long that it doesnâ€™t allow editing scenes at all ... Foreign films are great for This film makes me think that history without the use of a large number of dialogues does not allow American cinema to do so. I want to completely stop watching movies ... Bad Movie!
