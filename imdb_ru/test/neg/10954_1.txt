This movie confused me. I couldn't handle it. I thought I was missing something. Glad to see most of you agree with me. This is not always the case (see My recent review of RE: Extinction). <br /> <br /> More details about the mistakes in this film would be a glorious waste of time ... so I will. .. <br /> <br /> They are dressed like cowboys, but now modernity, right? Not? I do not understand ??? When I picked up the box, I thought: ZOMBIE WESTERN! COOL! Here is how it was presented. Have not seen this yet. I hope they did a good job. <br /> <br /> They didn't do it! They tried to create a cult character who would have spawned a series. They did not. <br /> <br /> They were trying to get an Australian indie zombie to click on the caliber (and maybe ride the tails of a coat) from a very well-made “UNDEAD”. They did not. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe they just wanted to create a tangled, incoherent, mess of salad from a movie that could eventually be turned into something watchable. They did not! This is new number 2 on my list of worst zombie movies. At the moment there are only two of them: “DAY OF THE DEAD: CONTAGIUM” - the first one (not to be confused with “DAY OF THE DEAD”, which is one of my favorite zombie films of all time). If you're going to make a movie about zombies (and I'm not a director of movies about zombies, I'm just an expert), make a good movie. The Flight of the Living Dead is a good example of recent zombie filmmaking. For your information. <br /> <br /> If you really forgive, you might think, well, at least they added something to make us feel that we don’t want our money back? Guess what ... THEY ARE NOT!
