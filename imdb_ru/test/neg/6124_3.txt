A dominant conflict occurs between a pair of beautiful actors (Huppert and Dutronk) and a terrible scenario. Obviously, the actors lost because director / screenwriter Claude Chabrol eventually forced the lead couple to follow this useless, sick fantasy of writing. Fortunately, the powerful performances of Huppert and Dutronka dramatically improve the overall quality of the film, which miraculously gains depth and humor. As for Shabrolâ€™s perseverance in keeping the film mild and illogical, it culminates in the final scene, which is so incredibly poor that you will wonder what pills he took when he shot it.
