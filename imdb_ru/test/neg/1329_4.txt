The 1993 film Stalingrad, with all its technical flare, is very disappointing. Before watching, I read non-fiction stories about the Stalingrad campaign and saw a lot of documentary videos and photos of the battle itself and its participants. I don’t think that any film can really depict the titanic struggle and suffering that actually happened, but I still wanted to see what the relatively recent German film production would look like. Although there are some good elements in this film, it’s a total failure. For me, the worst aspect is that it includes significant anachronisms, as well as some very contrived and clichéd elements, which is most clearly manifested in some clashes between a German officer and a Soviet woman. <br /> <br /> There are also some ideological elements in the film that lead to very distorted perceptions, including what constitutes a caricature of a German priest, some bloated messages of class war, and problem images of "good" against "bad" Germans . Of course, the Armed Forces of Germany in the Second World War included men who managed to maintain decency throughout the war, and others who did very bad things, but attempts to show this contrast in the film are very simplistic and childish. I pay tribute to Stalingrad in the sense that it does not fully depict German troops in a simple demonic quality, which is a stereotype that many people now have, but the film includes its own stereotypes, such as almost too well a true infantryman, who is related to the 1990s more than in the 1940s, and two completely evil infantrymen and a rear officer. <br /> <br /> Some recent films, such as “Stalingrad” and “Soldiers Rescue”. Ryan is often praised for their “authenticity” in depicting graphic battle scenes, but these same films are deeply corrupted and distorted in their portrayals of the attitudes, values ​​and behavior of soldiers and civilians of the 1940s. At Stalingrad and S.P. R ”is the main and minor characters who lack unconscious stoicism, which was common among ordinary people during the Second World War. Of course, soldiers throughout history were famous for their frequent grunts and periodic cynicism, but self-confident, talkative and about Dachnye characters in both of these films - it is something different, and they are much more common in our modern world than they were in the 1940s. While many people these days love to slander military films of the 40s and 50s Many of these earlier films, such as Battlefield, are much more accurate in their portraits of typical soldiers. Relationships, and they often show the terrible consequences of war more indirectly. in ways. <br /> <br /> One well-made part of Stalingrad is the battle between the German infantry and the Soviet tanks, which does a reasonable job of collecting some of the horror and confusion in such a battle. <br /> <br /> “Stalingrad” does not do a good job, showing a general view of the front-line soldier. In part, this may be due to the difficulties in finding thin, haggard-looking additions in our spoiled and well-fed America and Western Europe today. In addition, too many German troops in the film do not wear their uniform and equipment properly and do not demonstrate professional posture, which was common in the German Wehrmacht even in the years of defeat in Germany. If you want to get a good idea of ​​what real German troops looked like, I recommend the following documentaries that contain footage from the Stalingrad campaign: “World at War”, “War of the Century” and “War of Russia” Also the books “Operation Barbarossa in Photos” by Paul Carell, “Stalingrad” by Jeffrey Juks and “Stalingrad” by Paul Carell contain many useful photos. Books written about the battle of Anthony Beevor and William Craig are also recommended, and the latter is especially good for ordinary soldiers and civilians on both sides. <br /> <br /> Relatively recent films, which, in my opinion, are much better than Stalingrad and Saving Private Ryan in depicting the views and characters of people during World War II, as well as the overall feeling , the horror and harshness of this war, "Der Untergang" ("Fall") and "Talvisot" ("Winter War"). Although “The Bridge Is Too Far” and “The Longest Day” cover events on the Western Front, and not in the East, they are also excellent war films and are very close to actual data. In the last two films, some of the factors that are more common in later films are missing, but they compensate for this disadvantage with their other strengths, including truthfulness.
