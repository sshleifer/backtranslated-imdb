At best, a mediocre horror film that deals with stupid, not too excited teenagers who discover an evil video game (GASP) kills those who die in the game (DOUBLE GASP). This film is the steady mystery of the Secret Gang in Scooby-Doo. I waited for them to take off the mask of one of the villains. I could handle this for 40 minutes, even as a science fiction film, but, having gone all the way to the theaters, people come on. The effects were very mediocre, this whole script is a bit disgusting, but directed by Uwe Boll, since this will be his cast. As always, a distinctive feature of gaming systems is a great power button. I would suggest using this in the middle of viewing. * 1/2
