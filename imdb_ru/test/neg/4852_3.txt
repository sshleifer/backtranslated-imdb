I continued to wait until this film improved, but, alas, this is the worst kind of escapist film: confection with powdered sugar, which sinks under the weight of its own heavy weight. The tempo stumbles upon a legionnaire stuck in the Sahara. The lack of a good dialogue leaves attractive stars with little to do but look good in white lingerie. Irons plays another enchanted spellcaster who has the touch of the sun. Kaas is a pleasant singer, but not very actress. Fortunately, the script does not often call on her to move away from the microphone of the jazz club. All enviably relaxed, cute, unnecessary characters take turns, alternately chewing the scenery with a look of weary sophistication. The whole exercise is reminiscent of Ralph Lauren's infinitely long ad. <br /> <br /> If you are over forty and you think that francophilia is the key to sophistication, you can mistakenly take this piece of cardboard as a baguette. Well, if you liked this film, you probably felt smarter if you rated lead Leog de Lamour Godard, and perhaps you even sat in Divorce without cringing.
