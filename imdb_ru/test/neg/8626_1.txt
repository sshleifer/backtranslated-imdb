I can not believe that this film has 6 stars on IMDb. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen that was not an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The plot is predictable. I could not bring myself to take care of any of the characters. Cheese dialogue. A few moments in the film actually made me moan loudly (including Kiefer Southerland's crazy neighbor and an incredibly lame joke that ends the film). Jeff Bridges accent stupid - I can not say what country he was supposed to be. It must be one of the least exciting thrillers I've ever seen ... after Sandra Bullock's character disappears, absolutely nothing happens to push the story for a good 45 minutes. I would give this film a negative amount of stars if I could.
