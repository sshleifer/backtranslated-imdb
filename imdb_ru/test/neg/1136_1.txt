God bless Randy Quaid ... his generous cousin Eddie on vacation and the Christmas break fun stole the show. He even made a terrible vacation in Vegas, at least worth a look. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™ll say that he tries his best to do it for the TV sequel, but the script is not so funny that the film never gets to the end, Quaid and the rest of the returning vets leave (including the original Audrey , Dana Barron) wasted here. Even Eric Idle from European Vacation cannot save the show in a short cameo .... <br /> <br /> It's a pity and sad ... it really hurts to watch ... Christmas Holidays 2 is the worst of the Vacation franchise.
