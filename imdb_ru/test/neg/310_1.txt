The film had no meaning for me. Good actors (favorite SergioCastellittoaparticular; he was great at Uomo DelleStelle / TheStarmaker, but it was done by Giuseppe Tornatore, the great Italian director unlike the mediocre who made this effort), but a terrible, incoherent script, terrible editing and director who seemed to have no idea what he was trying to say, and ultimately said nothing. A delicious load of rubbish, but one that some Italian pseudo-intellectuals, whom I knew through misfortune in the dim and distant past, loved, and, unfortunately, Italy has no monopoly on them, they can be found everywhere and probably greet it as a great masterpiece . I never thought of Bellocko as a director. I remember watching his first film “PugniNella Tasca” / “Fists in a pocket” (or some similar name) in Rome, when it was first shown about 50 years ago (I lived there at that time). All the usual pseudo raving about this, but it left me pretty cold. I did not think that he was a great director then, and I still do not think so. Age definitely did not improve it, and this film should be considered one of its worst.
