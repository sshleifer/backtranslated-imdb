An experiment in St. Francisville argues that "this is not a walk in the woods," a direct slap in the face of Blair the Witch. While Blair the Witch turned out to be a film that overwhelmed the viewer's imagination with a simple sentence, the “Experiment at St. Francisville” overwhelms the viewer's patience. It must be said, however, that this is intended for the classics of the camp. <br /> <br /> Warning: Spoiler preparing !! <br /> <br /> I watched this film in a local theater where Troy Taylor’s Paranormal Consultant told the film about making the film. If someone wants to watch this movie without knowing the upcoming information, stop reading here. For those of you who cannot stand, read about my friends, and they will tell you everything. <br /> <br /> Mr. Taylor, the author of the rather ghostly ghost stories that he claims are all true, told viewers in this video that the "Experiment in St. Francisville" was not a documentary. Shock! Amazing As if we did not know ... He informed us that all the frightening discoveries made by the participants were all delivered and prepared in advance by the film producers. In fact, he told us that the last 15 minutes were not even shot in Louisiana, but in California. All four members were real actors (note, I didn’t say anything good ...). One of the participants is actually an ER effects specialist. <br /> <br /> What infuriates me in this film is that he claims that everything is true. He is weakly trying to beat The Blair Witch Project, arguing that this is true, whereas Blair Witch was a hoax. Amazingly, no one could believe this film for a moment. The experiment in Saint Francisville, filled with terrible acting games and such fun lines as “surround yourself with white light” and “I love ghosts”, can be seen in midnight movies everywhere, so the crowd can properly heck, bu, mock and sing “I love Ghosts! "<br /> <br /> Let's talk about false advertising. Genuine stories are not filmed using staged special effects that look like a squad of scouts in the neighborhood builds a haunted house. From bugs in a sandwich (oh ... scary ... ) to an annoying Madison, from “a session,” which is nothing more than a foursome playing on the Ugia board, to two mice found under the bed, The St The Francisville experiment is one awkward hoax of the film. throw this thing into the nearest garbage compactor or advertise it so much it should be: <br /> <br /> «Experiment in St. Frantsisville: comedic look at how not to make a film."
