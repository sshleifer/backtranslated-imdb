Why did I buy this movie on DVD? Well, the short answer is: I really don't know. As for the longer version, it pretty much comes down to the fact that I sincerely like Tatiana Ali, and she plays Alicia in this. <br /> <br /> And now Tatyana Ali really makes great efforts in this film? I must say that she is one of the best, and she is going to become a pretty decent actress. I look forward to seeing it in action when the best materials are available. <br /> <br /> It was said that this film was terrible, and my rating was based on this: 1 star for what I was not the worst film I saw, 1 star for the presentation of Tatiana Ali and 1 star for that he does not think that he deserves only 2 stars, for this there are the worst films. <br /> <br /> Jah Rul should stick to rap, not my favorite rapper, to say the least, but some seem to love him - and if he were kept there, I would be glad if he had not defiled the acting the scene. <br /> <br /> Wing Reims: And man, Marcellus Wallace, what are you doing here - you were a cool person. Just because Michael Caine is an incredibly brilliant actor who has been in so many horrible films, as well as good ones, you donâ€™t need to copy his Wing. <br /> <br /> The rest of the semi-loud names in Actors: everything is in order, there are bills that need to be paid, and we all have to do something that we are not proud of from time to time. <br /> <br /> The movie itself. This is so serious a disadvantage that it is difficult to know where to start. It's more like a bunch of scenes added together, and the director said, "We have to say it, and we have to say it." There is a story, unfortunately, it is not surprising. At the very least, the plot changes in the story were too obvious, and therefore it was predictable what was going to happen all the time. <br /> <br /> To summarize, in one word: Reallynotgood
