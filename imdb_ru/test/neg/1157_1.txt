Ed Hein's story is interesting, VERY interesting. This film, however, is only interesting because it was actually made. The image of Kane Hodder Ed Gein is so far, it is not even funny. Ed Gein did not behave psychotic in public, he was very calm and collected, always extremely polite to everyone and talked to everyone who listened to him - this is one of the main things that this film could not show the audience. But the biggest mistake of this film, except that at least one shot had ever been shot, was that Ed never killed anyone without telling his dead mother, with whom he thought he spoke to him from the grave. He killed only those people whom his dead mother said that he had to do it, because it was God's will, and he repented very much of it, although this did not prevent him from experimenting with cannibalism and wearing the flesh of people. I officially gave this film a rating of “1” simply because “0” was not provided to me as an option. <br /> <br /> I strongly advise everyone to stay away from this movie. If you want to watch a film that accurately depicts Ed Gein, and do not try to insert into the plot a love story between a policeman and a fictional woman who never was, I STRONGLY advise you to watch the original film, which unfortunately does not seem to be on IMDb .com, although I may be mistaken, but I have not yet found it here. The original does not deviate from real events and does not attempt to distort the story. I can understand how to tell a story from another point of view, but this film simply tried to directly change the true story itself, which I find as terrible as if someone made a film based on 9/11, but made it clear that by this. Or the film of World War II, which says that Hitler was a good guy and helped fight the Nazis.
