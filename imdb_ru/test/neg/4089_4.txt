Well, I watched this movie, expecting it to roll in the aisles ... how wrong I was. The film was rather funny, at best, and annoying at worst (comedy about building an ark from archaic instruments, laugh ... no, I didn't do that). I am very disappointed, considering that Steve Carrell was the leader. I strictly follow the office in the US, very excited, I thought that the 40-year-old virgin was good ... but Evan helped us - why on earth did he accept this scenario. And as for Morgan Freeman, he is old enough to know better. <br /> <br /> So, the idea seemed reasonable, to the actors I believed in - but there was nothing special about the execution and the final, well, it seemed that they ran out of money or ideas. This for me was one of the most contrived endings that I could imagine. They took the biblical story and stunned her to a warning story about local environmental problems, not even global, but about a local bill - a yawn! <br /> <br /> In general, the sensible beginning gradually worsened and, for me, it was all washed out by the time the loan was issued.
