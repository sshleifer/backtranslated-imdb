House of the Damned (also known as Ghost) is one of your low-budget, haunted horror films, filled with mediocre ideas and cheap effects. We are talking about a family that inherits the old Irish mansion, and after the move begins to experience strange phenomena and ghostly phenomena, including the ghost of a young girl who was killed and buried in the wall in the basement of the mansion. Then the couple’s little daughter is led away to another dimension, and they turn to a group of paranormal investigators for help. <br /> <br /> The ideas of this film, borrowed from the film “Haunted House”, published in 1982, are obvious. I will say that there are some horrendous episodes in this film, but sometimes it is very, very boring. There is nothing special, the mood is in order, the score (mostly it was dramatic Irish opera music) was somewhat annoying, and the CGI special effects are really terrible. I mean, it was 1996, you might think that they could have done a little better than they did. The ending, where the house was on fire, was the worst special effect that I saw, very very cheap. But hey, it was a cheap movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the translucent wolf monster, which their daughter sees, looks awfully fake. And what was the meaning of the movie? What the hell does a wolf monster have to do with a haunted house? The special effects here are what really destroyed this film. The game was pretty bad too. I usually enjoy many low-cost horror films, but not this one. “House of the Damned” is nothing special at all, just think about seeing it if you have nothing to do. But you probably want to pass it on. 4/10.
