Arthur Miller has always been known as one of the great American playwrights for such works as The Death of a Traveling Salesman and Crucible. Focus is one of his lesser-known plays presented on a silver screen. However, knowing what the great playwright Arthur Miller is, I doubt that his original play was very much like a movie. The film looks empty and formal, since William H. Macy is a non-Jew, whom Jews have mistaken for anti-Semitic neighbors in Brooklyn. Don't get me wrong: acting is fine, and I guess the people behind this film probably tried to explain racism, but the film just doesn't work. Macy, Laura Dern and David Paymer simply cannot create an effective story with the material here.
