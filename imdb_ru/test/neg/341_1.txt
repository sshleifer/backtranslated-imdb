You need to take a deep breath for this ... <br /> <br /> Awful special effects that tried to go far beyond the budget. Explicit and unscrupulous plagiarism of other sci-fi films (for example, Black Pitch). Horrible game Infinite slow-motion scenes of heroes wandering aimlessly through the sand dunes. A winding dialogue that does nothing for the further development of history. Characters dressed in sweaters with a tortoise neck on a deserted planet with two suns. "Cargo" ship, staffed by a team of camouflage machine-gun soldiers (why do you even need forest camouflage in space?). Some of the worst choices in the history of off-budget filmmaking are the steroid swollen “captain”, which is more like muscle on the beach than a trustworthy commander, and “convicted”, which looks and acts as dangerous as a rabbit. 70 minutes, 35 of which could be cut, if the director had some notion of “time compression through editing” ... <br /> <br /> I will not continue. Suffice it to say that although some of the components of this horrible film can (and should) be forgiven because of its low budget; bad concept, ridiculous holes in the plot and the snoring-causing scenario are unforgivable in any budget. The end result is a tedious, boring waste of time. Sorry, guys, I do not want to be so sharp in an amateur film, but you have no excuse to release such work.
