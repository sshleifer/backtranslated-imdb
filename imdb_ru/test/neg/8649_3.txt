If this is a film noir, then noir should be French for icy speed. Take the cast of absolutely incredible characters, do not let them say anything, accentuate all this on unreasonable violence, and you will receive a formula for an aggravating trait. The subtitle “Slimy Hollywood types trying to make money on robberies in Chinatown” could be written. One minute of Bruce Dern is several orders of magnitude better than anything else in this film. By the way, I did not like the movie.
