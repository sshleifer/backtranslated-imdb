Well, now this weird movie. It was listed as a comedy, but I certainly did not find to laugh. Actually, I'm struggling to find something positive to say about this movie. Oh, here I am. Alex Ferns is quite good in the title role, and I didn’t choose the ending for the change, but other than that, he doesn’t have much direction in two-dimensional characters, and he’s not fun enough to be comedy, serious or gloomy, to be any form of decent drama. I really will never watch this film again, and I think that it will not benefit any of the working-class characters that he is trying to portray. It was difficult for me to empathize with any of the characters, and I was not given enough information about the main character Jimmy to believe his motives. Best avoided.
