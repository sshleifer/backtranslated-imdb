This film, insulting both poker and cinema, turns the most dynamic, brilliant and fascinating figure in the history of poker into a boring task. Still a funny movie that you can joke about: from the clich√© of the lame gangster movie of the first half to the incomprehensible nonsense of that second hour. Fun Stu Angar wins all three World Series titles without playing a single hand on the screen. Is his infamous dealer abusing? Scene 1 His coke habit? Scene 1 His incredible memory? 0 scenes. They could not even get real poker players. What did they cover? Many high-angle shots from a house in the suburbs. Oh, and mounting Stu wakes up every day and makes purchases for meat that doesn't make sense. Why do I care so much about this little summer camp Soprano, trying to make money on a poker hobby? Because I think there is still a great film about Stu Ungar who is waiting for someone who wants to do it right.
