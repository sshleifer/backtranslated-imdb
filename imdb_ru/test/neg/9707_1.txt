If you have never heard of Jane Austen, have not seen the original film or the BBC 1995 adaptation, or have not even seen the pop-up version of the book, then this farcical attempt to show this classic love story can be considered indefinitely tolerable. <br /> <br /> From the first scene, this film should be remembered for its terrible acting, disgusting blunder and the complete absence of classic wit Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> Whoever decides to play the actors (with the exception of the excellent Judi Dench, who obviously never heard of Jane Austen, let alone her reading, should be punished! Keira Knightley grimaces and smirks through each the scene seems so disgusting that no one wants to marry her! Darcy looked as if he was trying to remember his lines throughout the film, and the other Bennet girls were interchangeable in that they did not portray their characters as they were originally written. <br /> <br /> that version did not show true Pride and Prejudice, which both Darcy and Elizabeth suffered, and at the end of the two longest hours of my life, who cared about whether they gathered together or not! Absolutely deplorable - even a few minutes save this trash. I can't think of anything good to say about this film, except that it has finally ended!
