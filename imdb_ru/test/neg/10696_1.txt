I agree with the comments of other users. It's hard to believe that this film really came out in 1994, because itâ€™s the cries of the mid-80s. I think this is duplicated, because the sound and image do not always coincide. If someone can really say that this is a good movie, it needs to be locked up. It is so sad that money has so much power over people that they will do everything to get it. I feel that I have lost the intelligence from watching this. I used to look at it with a little respect for Chuck Norris, but now I just feel bad. I bought it as part of a package of 3 films for $ 9.99, and I can honestly say that I would be better off literally throwing money away. Forgive me, Jesus.
