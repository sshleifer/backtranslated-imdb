I can't find the words to express how badly I thought this film. The original commandment was promising, but in all respects it was subsequently completely terrible. Let's go through the main points. The plot is a good initial idea, but a really awful development. There were many moments when I thought: "No, no one will do stupid things." The ending was surprisingly anti-climatic. Characteristics - all the characters were either completely soft or grotesque caricatures. I keep thinking about someone who wasn’t — perhaps a mother, but that’s all. Music is intrusive, inappropriate, and generally terrible. The direction is completely amateur. Cinematography - I doubt they heard about it. The viewing angles / stability / zoom of the camera are often very bad. I am completely surprised at how this film received such high praise. This is the worst movie I have seen in movies for many years, if not ever.
