Just when you think you have seen the worst thing a zombie subgenre has to offer, there is another budding Romero and his team of worthless comrades who will prove you are wrong. <br /> <br /> I suffered the Zombie Bloodbath Trilogy, which survived Death Valley: Revenge of the Blood Bill, sat in half masks in Zombie Diaries and laughed hysterically during Zombie 90s: Extreme Wrinkle and sincerely thought that making amateur films can’t come down below. However, after I just watched Zombie Planet, a two-hour festering heap of talk from writer / director George Bonilla, I think I found the best in horrible zombie films. <br /> <br /> In this terrible amateur effort, which is partly Mad Max and partly Dawn of the Dead (but ALL are bad), Frank Farhat acts in the role of T. K. Kane, a tough fighter who kicks zombies for a hobby, armed only with knives, machetes, some shaking grenades, and the fact that he clearly perceives this as a really angry look. <br /> <br /> After a desperately uninteresting opening episode in which he fights with hordes of sinister zombies, Kane teams up with a group of survivors who not only have to repel attacks from the undead, but must also reassure the gang of evil thugs who have taken their control area (by searching and transferring any values ​​that they find). <br /> <br /> Of course, Kane is not the type of person to receive orders from the z-rank group of post-apocalyptic hooligans, and he starts learning the bad guys - a lesson (basically, what they scoff at them threateningly) only by doing pause to periodically save buddies from zombies. <br /> <br /> With the terrible play of almost all the participants, the terrible scenario, the ludicrous effects and the Inconvenient Production Values, there is almost nothing in this film that could be worth watching. Honestly, I really like the basic premise that zombies are an unexpected result of a very popular weight loss drug that blocks cravings for carbohydrates (we learn about this when one character conveniently explains the story of Kane, who in a strange way doesn’t know something happened ), but we are talking about the only vaguely interesting aspect of the whole production. <br /> <br /> I have a certain respect for anyone who finances and makes his own film, but when the results are poor, this respect is lost when they decide to make it available for public viewing. I would keep it a secret if I did.
