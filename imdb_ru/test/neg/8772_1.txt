One reviewer wrote here: “Good game, good special effects, great location. Better yet. ” All I can say is “Ugh.” This film was painful to watch. Let me begin by saying: I am a Christian, whom many people I know are considered extremely conservative. So, what I am going to say is not biased due to the “Christian content” of the film. I am not going to scold it because it is a Christian. I'm going to give it a 2/10 because it's a horrible movie. The letter is bad, too PERFECT, and most of the "preaching" things simply have nothing to do with history. It just makes a bad script. Do I agree with the writer's beliefs <br /> <br /> - it does not matter - create a good script that works well, stays up to date and believable. Acting was at best amateur. But hey, when you shoot amateurs, you get amateur performances. Dirk Bean may have been in Survivor, but this show requires <br /> <br /> ZERO acting abilities. Playing in his name and reputation for selling units has a bad taste. Throw unknowns who can play, and you will have a much better movie. The effects were HORRIBLE. The scene with hail and the subsequent fall of the stars was awkward to watch. What was so great in the end? It made no sense. Yes, I know what Tim Whose was aiming for, but it didn't work. I bought this movie and expected much more based on the feedback and disinformation on their website. And, although I was hoping for more, I got what I always get when I watch “Christian” films - with a limited budget, a poorly written, pathetic, poorly-produced movie. Maybe someday someone will finally come up to a record with a film about the end times, as well written and done as Gibson’s Passion. 2/10 stars
