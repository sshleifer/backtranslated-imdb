Ken Russell filmed this strange (not very) erotic thriller, and if I didn't know what I would put at stake all my life, the director was Brian DePalma. Absolutely everything about CRIMES OF PASSION screams DePalma, from tasteless cinema, which is illuminated too brightly, to the inner storyline, which turns into a storyline, and even a name that screams "Depalma, Depalma, Depalma" Unfortunately, since Brian DePalma is increasingly seen as poor Hitchcock, for many years Russell had to try to imitate his style. Of course, an erotic thriller in the style of TOMMY or BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN would be strange with a capital B, but at least it would be a unique cinematic experience. Stories about prostitutes leading a dangerous double life and being persecuted by a religious maniac were too common in the video market of the 1980s. Oh, and Anthony Perkins plays the same role that he played in almost every film he made in the 1980s. The yawn <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be heard in “CRIMES OF PASSION” is the argument that he has caused. I believe the studios were the happiest people to hear it, because no advertising is a bad advertisement, but as for controversial sex scenes ... What controversial sex scenes? There is no one contradiction I can think of that China Blue dominates the baton on duty. Needless to say, he did not come quietly ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
