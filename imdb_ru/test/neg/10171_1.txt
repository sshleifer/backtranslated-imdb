Like many comments above me, I also thought that it was an ordinary science fiction film, but unfortunately this is not the case. I found it quite patronizing and truly preaching. <br /> <br /> But this is not the only comment. The scenes are very “artificial” (not like in scifi, as I will explain in a few minutes). (The next sentence is a small spoiler.) The film is more or less a discussion between the two groups. The physical setting of the discussion usually includes two or three men standing next to each other, usually speaking average. In the worst case, the other side is one person. <br /> <br /> Interviews of journalists are very artificial, sometimes even unprofessional. For example, sometimes the discussion is conducted between journalists (I mean, from the point of view of the respondents, “inconvenient”). Moreover, the interlocutors always remain calm, they say everything without normal emotions. That is, you cannot tell whether they are lying or not, crazy or not. They show almost nothing. <br /> <br /> This is also very unprofessional, “Christian” journalists always believe everything they are told by the people with whom they interview. <br /> <br /> Total: <br /> <br /> All conversations include: <br /> <br /> - facts. <br /> <br /> - arguments for / against. <br /> <br /> There are no lies. No one is lying. (The next sentence is a spoiler, ignore if you are still planning to watch the movie) The only lie that happens is to demonstrate how “bad” non-believers are. <br /> <br /> This leads me to conclude that the film is Bi-Film. It is very similar to Plan 9 from Space (from the 50s), but this film also has an annoying discussion about aliens and the Christian faith. <br /> <br /> NOTE. I have no intention of insulting Christians, people who believe in aliens or anyone else. This is the thought of the film, not the people. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would like to point out that I don’t know if the bad actors or they were just given terrible scenarios.
