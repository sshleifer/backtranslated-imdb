An exceptionally stupid thriller with "brain death" is leading a story that is suitable for the filling number of "Spider-Man." Sequences of actions never flow as they should, leaving some cool bits orphaned in a sea of ​​sound and rage that means nothing. I really wonder how they will release this one in the West. Sam Lee is replaying like crazy, rookie Edison Chan doesn't yet show acting talent. The robot is clumsy and not very impressive, and the effects of the CGI (although made by American sfx people) are ridiculous, completely destroying any remaining unbelief suspension. I'm not looking forward to Gen-Z Cops ...
