After the rapid success of The Wrestler (see My Review), Mickey Rourke got this “pearl” right on the video. Each copy was rented for several months, and I even heard a good noise around it. So, after a few months, I caught him in a movie network and sat down to watch it. First of all ... one of the places in the film (Walpole Island) is a place that I regularly visited as a child, because we lived very, very close to the reserve. Cool, yeah? This is where coolness ends up with this dirty. I mean that the story is decent enough to justify the four, and even the direction is not bad, but the performances are just awful and completely ridiculous, with some truly spent star power and Mickey $% # @ * &! Rourke plays a hired Canadian / American hitman?!?! What in the name of the Lord did they think? He doesn’t even look like his own blood, and his attempt at a native native accent made him look even more ridiculous. They could go somewhere with this story ... they could hire an indigenous actor or change the character of Rourke, what about a white man brought up by his parents? Instead, they made Killshot a complete and complete joke. <br /> <br /> Since you may have caught Mickey Rourke's “stars” at Killshot, I use this term loosely. I never liked Rourke, although his victory at the Oscars was decent enough. This shows and confirms my dislike for him. He looks bored, constantly bored, and his unsuccessful attempt to portray the natives borders on an insult, I think. He makes a decent cold-blooded killer, but then the story never explores that part of it that is completely backward from the story. Diane Lane, while highly respected in Hollywood, is turning into another dark performance. She had her own moments, but in general she usually does not act in any performance. It looks like it’s going to be great, but when it’s not, it is even more disappointing. Thomas Jane plays her protective husband. I always felt that Jane deserved a greater career than he. I think he has an action movie in his blood. Everything said and done by his performance in Killshot is actually quite good. He does not go too far, and he is cruel and almost heroic. He and Lane manage to have decent chemistry, but he doesn’t interfere much with his character. I absolutely do not know why Rosario Dawson A) made this film, and B) generally had a character. Her character is absolutely useless and makes no sense in a plot or story making a presentation that she would give just as bad. I have rarely seen a character who supports so incredibly useless. The only character and role in this film is the role of Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the role of an insane mini-killer who wants to team up with the killer Rourke. Gordon-Levitt is incredibly fascinating, and his character is really attractive. If this film were all about him, it would be a success. He literally saves it from complete shit. His performance is almost worth watching this shit. <br /> <br /> Oscar-nominated director ... aah, wait? Yes, Oscar-appointed director John Madden (I think a football coach could do a better job) controls this mess. In fact, I have never seen Shakespeare in Love, but I remember how he received critical acclaim, which surprised me because the direction of this film and the characters was absolutely terrible. Screenwriter Hossein Amini did nothing I learned, but apparently intended to write the next film about Jack Ryan, and after this mess I can't even imagine why they want it. I understand that this is based on a novel, and I really hope that the novel is the worlds over this mess. A little action and some kind of ridiculous attempt to create an emotionally rich story about a hired killer and his partner, as well as about the disorder in which they are involved. Unfortunately, if you are not a huge Rourke fan or really love Joseph Gordon-Levitt, then there is no reason to expose yourself to this pain. I did it for you, and I still feel pain. 4/10
