In the confusing zombie film Michelle Soavey “DellaMort Dellamore”, Rupert Everett plays Francesco, the superintendent in a cemetery where the dead are not stopped for long. With the help of his simple assistant, Gnagi, Francesco solves the problem of zombies in the cemetery, shooting undead in the head or smashing their skulls with a shovel. <br /> <br /> However, soon after falling in love with the mysterious beautiful widow, Francesco, one of his recently buried, now feels busier than ever before. <br /> <br /> Having received some particularly favorable comments from some of the more respected horror officials of IMDb, I decided to see what was going on. I just finished watching a movie and I can honestly say that a horror movie has not disappointed me for a long time. <br /> <br /> With his dreary, entangled pseudo-philosophical storyline and Dellamorte Dellamore - an extremely mild performance by leading man Everett. This is an annoying and stupid mess that even some kind of dirty blood (kindly provided by Sergio Stivaletti) and saved by gratuitous nudity (from busty Anna Fialci) cannot save. I am at a loss to understand the amount of in-depth analysis and discussion that this pretentious hold received from its lost fans.
