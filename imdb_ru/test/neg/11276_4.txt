When watching this movie, with its deterministic cause and effect, cliché from wall to wall and beaten moods, can anyone be so naive as to think that Barry’s life is played out like that? You see this in a disagreement pose. Hollywood biographical films are no longer based on individual lives, they simply rewrite previously successful biographical films. If Hollywood made a film about your life, it would be filled with such perfect timing that you would hardly know your own story. Any personal complexity will be erased due to some kind of simplified background. Your story will be similar to Rocky, because it is the only arch of life Hollywood knows how to produce more. We could not leave viewers thinking about something left open when they go out. This film does not trust the audience to understand things without being attracted to them. I perceived the benchmark of the era of Captain Hook / Mother before the film became literal to me. I could see the turn of 25 children in a few days. <br /> <br /> This is a completely ordinary movie. Not terrible, but not great. Consequently, it will probably be showered with several Oscars next year. There is nothing that the Academy loves more than to congratulate itself on the fact that it has finally noticed the patterns established during the last thirty years. <br /> <br /> From the Lost Boys article by Anthony Lane in New York: <br /> <br /> “Arthur Llewelyn Davis also adored his boys, and it would probably be unfair if“ In search of Neverland "he was expelled from the scene to simplify it; By the time Johnny Depp meets Kate Winslet, she is already a widow, whereas Arthur was very much alive when Barry first entered consciousness, and gradually the house of the Llewellyn Davis family. <br /> <br /> “In Search of the Neverland” - crying. From the moment Barry met George and Jack and began to reflect on the means by which they could become immortal, the story is sad, but the reality is even darker: 1907 - Arthur Llewellyn Davis dies of jaw cancer. 1910 - Sylvia dies of lung cancer. Five boys are orphaned, Barry became their guardian. 1915 - George is killed in the First Wu First War, a battle with his regiment in Flanders. 1921 Michael, a student at Oxford, drowns while swimming with a friend. Found that two bodies found to be stuck together. <br /> <br /> On April 5, 1960, Peter Llewellyn Davis, then a respected publisher, threw himself under a train in the London Underground. We should not allow ourselves to read thoughts in agony, but in passing we can see that if he had lived another month, he would have reached the centenary of the birth of Barry and, thus, can be presented as a new wave of interest in "Peter Pan" "This terrible masterpiece," according to Peter Llewellyn Davis.
