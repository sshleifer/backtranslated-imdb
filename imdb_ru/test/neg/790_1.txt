Now this film is the worst I've ever seen !! It is just a disaster. I think this is a really sick movie, I just wasted my time watching this cheap shit. I can not believe that someone could lead to such a disaster. Such a waste of money and time. There is nothing to learn from this film, itâ€™s just a smack of sick evil. I don't think they could make it worse, this film just got the title of "King of the lowest shit". Action is a disaster, a sense ... oh, well, there is no point, just a sick pain and sadness brought by a suffering child at the end of the film, and killing a wife, which again was another dull blow to this film you have self-esteem, stay away from this horror !!!
