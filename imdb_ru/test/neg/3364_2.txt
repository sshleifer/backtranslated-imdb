Jack Frost 2 is out of the question, I'm actually surprised that people are allowed to make such films. <br /> <br /> When Sam and his wife go to Tropicana for a peaceful Christmas, Jack returns to kill him. from fun and revenge by inbreeding ... <br /> <br /> Don't take this film, most people say it's laughter with your friends, but honestly it's a waste of time, If the people who made this film , can get a job, doing what they do, at least they can spend the time and effort to write a better story, especially names with stupid characters.
