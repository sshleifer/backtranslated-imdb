This is the case when going into a fairy tale too far. Enchanted cottage delivers Dorothy McGwire as the “terribly ugly” maiden and Robert Young as the disfigured pilot. In short: Scarface marries Spinster, after which their love miraculously turns them (light, cosmetics and removal of fake scars) into beautiful people - a magical change, which they attribute to the charm of life in a seaside cottage, was the abode of the newlyweds for generations. <br /> <br /> If the story stopped at this, well; it would be a fable with the proverb: beauty in the eye of the beholder. But it moves forward, reaching reality. When Mr. and Mrs. Skarfeys greet their audience, it becomes a painful shock for them that they are still at home. Do you see, they only seem beautiful to each other ?? A situation for which the public is well prepared, because all the minor characters preach that disadvantaged people really need to lower their expectations and find other ways to be happy. You know. Take a hobby. For example, Spinster makes woodcuts. Scarface is considering collecting snags. <br /> <br /> The original playwright (Arthur Win Pinero) and the filmmakers absolutely do not believe in human nature. Their message is this: you are either ugly or beautiful, and no handsome man will ever fall in love with an ugly one. Worse, ugly people obviously need to imagine their lover beautiful. Reality is simply no good. <br /> <br /> It is curious that Elaine Mason saw every day when she looked at her husband, Stephen Hawking.
