This film has to be one of the worst I've ever seen. The humor was rude, hardly ridiculous and was heard a million times before. The beginning was special, and every year it became worse and worse. I went about half the way and could no longer look at it. Fortunately, I only watched it on TV, so it didn't cost anything, but I strongly recommend you not to waste time and money. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the film was new. Characters were not developed at all. I actually think it would be better if I were a little children's film that was full of silly, unrealistic, "funny" events taking place ... it looks like something happening alone at home or something something like that. Not to mean that being alone at home was so terrible.
