Blackwater Valley Exorcism - a film about a possessed young girl. Should I describe to you some other story? “The Exorcist” and “The Exorcism” by Emily Rose are two amazing horror films. Classic (IMO). Exorcism at Blackwater Valley (BVE) is not. Not at all. This, of course, is not as scary as a low-budget copy of the Exorcist could be. From start to finish, this looks like a production “made for a science fiction channel” This is one of those films that are likely to be faked and ridiculed at Mystery Science Theater 3000 (or a similar show). <br /> <br /> Make-up and effects were just ridiculous. The game was terribly bad. There was not a single performance that would not make me roll my eyes or laugh. Oh, except maybe Jeffrey (the Rescuer) Combs as a sheriff. The script was not THAT terrible, but, of course, it was not something special. <br /> <br /> It seems that for the most part of the film, more and more attention is paid to the one who is sleeping, with whom, than with the possessed girl. in another room. Oh, I learned something from this movie. Obviously, if your teenage daughter is obsessed with a demon, then all you have to do is lock them in the room. C'mon. And if your daughter is obsessed, do not worry too much, because all this makes them talk in funny voices, eat rabbits, try to look at you and put foggy cars in their beds. In addition, there is nothing to worry about. Obviously, she was obsessed with the low-budget demon D-List. <br /> <br /> There were no terrible acts committed by A-List demons, such as crucifixion crucifixes, painful distortions of the body or even vomiting shells. <Br /> <br /> Absolutely funny movie. Not even worth the discount for hire. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
