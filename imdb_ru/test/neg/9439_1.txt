This film was absolutely terrible. Silly premise and terrible game of all. Whoever wrote this garbage should be hanged. Reminds me of a student film hack, BUT GOOD. Who ever produced it must surrender now. I know that opinions are subjective and all that, and some might think that this is “fiction”, as some people think that “Dune (1984)” was fantastic, get off the horse well and watch some real films. Well, acting was tolerable, and with a better direction, it might have been a lot better, but it’s not, it does. I do not know how much more I can say about this waste of the film, except to completely destroy it. In any case, it was terrible, and I recommend avoiding it like the plague, if you get close to “The Land of Dreams”, rent a movie next to it.
