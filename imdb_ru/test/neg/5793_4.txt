If you thought that Herbie, trying to commit suicide, driving off the bridge in the Love Beetle, was stupid, wait until you see how he is excited in this amazingly stupid second sequel. Dean Jones returned as a pilot who participates in the Paris-Monte Carlo rally; this time his reasonable VW falls in love with another car in the race - Lancia, driven by Julia Sommars. At this point in the series, energy and charm are not enough even more than in Herbie Rides Again; the film is too long and worn out, although it can be watched thanks to the return of Jod's typically cute performance, several funny episodes and insane robbery of actors.
