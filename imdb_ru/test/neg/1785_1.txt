Why do you ask if this person claims that truth is behind the all-powerful existence? Well, this is deductive logic, my friends, you understand, I know that God exists, because Satan exists, how else would my poor eyes be soiled in such a terrible film? Yes, there is no doubt about that, on cold Friday of 2006, Satan took possession of me and made me watch this movie. Is he what You are wondering; the devil makes little girls vomit and climb the ceiling, why should he waste time trying to make you watch this movie? My only conclusion to this question is that Satan believes that watching “Fear of the Camp” is the worst form of death punishment, rather than prying eyes or forcing you to speak in tongues, instead of making you sit mindlessly for one and a half hours Movies Ever Made, Can this movie be as horrible as it says? Yes, my friend watching this film is tantamount to being kicked in a bag about fifty million times, maybe more. But maybe I'm too harsh, this film has a few moments, for example, the beginning begins in the house of the female society with a lot of topless girls; now, never being in communication, I'm not sure whether girls really do that, but you can always pray. Now that the five minutes of boobs and buttocks are over, we were presented with a scene on the college campus for all the girls; the girls themselves (about eight in all) are in the class of archaeologists, where they discuss virgin sacrifices and ancient burial mounds. Fast forward, a class professor (who appears to be the only man in this women's college), takes a few of his students and a girlfriend to a remote lake in the mountains, searching for them to find ancient Indian artifacts; yes, right, professor, we know at what angle your pitching. This is where the film begins: a group of five, four girls, one guy stops at a gas station to find out the direction, but now, a gang of bikers pulls up and chases the girls, only to finally leave them alone and go their own ways. Moving on, they end up in a “campsite” consisting of four logs and several trees, and then everything starts to go terribly wrong. First prof. and his girlfriend leaves to retire, so that one of the girls takes it upon herself to find them, only to be captured by some unknown force. In the same vein, two other girls start looking for the missing girl when the bikers, as well as one drunk guy, are looking for them, their plan, to rape the girls and do terrible things with them. The film tells about a druid who needs four virgins to sacrifice in order to save the world from some kind of water monster up to the two thousandth year; but they interfere with this plan, Mr. Druid, one of the girls is devirginized right in front of us, so this plan disappears. Now, since I said that there will be spoilers, I will go ahead and spoil you for the end of the film. Four girls climb, pump up a green sticky layer, and then ready to be sacrificed, after one of them is killed, these two are the rest of the bikers and prof. come to save them; they stand on a ledge where the lead biker says: “I think I can do it there!” only to jump and break a leg. Prof. runs on the guy and becomes depressed, leaving only the once violent biker to fight off a 6'3 "giant druid. At first he makes a miserable attempt with a stick, then pulls the knife, the knife reflects a little laser beam in the mouth of the golden snakes and instantly lights the druid on fire. Afterwords they carry off the wounded with emergency sticks and ponder if everything is really over, only that the lake’s bubble, showing the monster inside it, still lives.This is a film and this is my review, which unfortunately will not read by most eyes, since this is only the fifth published review of the film, which was released in fifteen years.Fortunately, Satan can only get some of us, not all. The judge would like to make one heartfelt apology to a poor girl in Circuit City. I'm going to borrow this film: “Sorry, Sheila, please don't hate me for letting you see this.”
