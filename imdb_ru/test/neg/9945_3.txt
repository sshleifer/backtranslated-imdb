I heard a lot about inventive cinematography and directing in this film. I thought both were a mess <br /> <br /> and a really terrible game. the main “heroine” in the film is annoying to the limit and has absolutely nothing useful in any situation. everything she does or says is stupid, and she, as a rule, just ruins people's lives. if she could fight, I would forgive her. <br /> <br /> In general, all the women in this film are stereotypical "women" who need a man to save them. and all the people in this film are muscular unrest capable of saving anyone. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie and I urge you to avoid it. instead, watch something like “Sword of Destiny”, I hear that it is much better than this tangled movie mess.
