What I find annoying on the screen, what I find fault with and annoying people trying to watch movies with me, is the moment when a writer, director, set designer, screen provider or someone else doesn’t think the end and one single inaction - or commission - cancels all other work done by all who worked on the film. This moment "Wait a bloody moment ... What just happened?" it stops the narration dead in its tracks. (Not that this film’s narrative needed a big stop, because anyone who has ever seen it learns that Quintet’s narrative drive is pretty good until the end of the first shot.) There are several such moments in this film. And you think about them for so long. The film lasts two hours, and the script of the dialogue probably took five pages. There is plenty of time to think about its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> The film takes place on frozen Earth. Another ice age has begun, and the whole world is dying. Coldly. Very cold. Actually the screen is very cold. The film was shot in Canada in the winter, and in every scene icicles and real snow and people's breath are pouring from every mouth. Again and again we are reminded how damn cold. People wear big hats, layers and layers of clothing and walk around like disguised Weeble people. It must have been a terrible shot. My jerk happens in sequence when our hero moves into a hotel room. Waking up in the middle of the night from the next room, he hears a vital conversation about a scanty plot through a large grill in the wall that separates the two rooms. I do not wonder why there is a convenient grill in the wall between the two rooms. What annoyed me was the fact that the grill was not blocked by a long-term tenant with a noisy visitor. If you are trying to keep warm, the last thing you need is a huge gaping hole in your wall that leads to an unheated, unheated room. Trust me. I live like this, I watched this movie sitting on the sofa in my living room under a blanket with a bottle of hot water. My breath was as misty as the actors. If this huge hole were in my wall, I would block something. It may not be the best choice to watch a movie in an unheated room in the middle of winter, but the boy did it so that I noticed the lousy isolation in the movie.
