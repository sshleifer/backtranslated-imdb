It contains some information about the spoiler, but the film is still not worth watching ... <br /> <br /> Why Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson agreed to take part in this debacle of screenwriter-director Damien Harris, I cannot do. The story is full of unrealistic police investigation techniques, which include attending a party with a suspect and inviting that suspect to your house and getting to know him. The story also tells about a male psychiatrist, who seems to have nothing but female clients, and he sleeps with all of them. <br /> <br /> Even more prohibitive is the view that women are victims of a terrible disease. The crimes belong to a large, but at the same time, a secret group of lesbian S / M leaders. <br /> <br /> Poor editing and mistakes in the continuity of the film are fruitless in all its posh places, including in Barkin’s salary apartment. And the lame dialogue is suitable to put to sleep. <br /> <br /> Damian is a bad writer and a bad director. He tried and failed miserably from time to time to create a noisy atmosphere. In addition, he could not get Ellen Barkin to give 110%. I firmly believe that she realized that the film was pathetic and quit trying. <br /> <br /> The best were Peta Wilson, who spent her time learning from Dominatrix. Marshall Bell, the character of an actor with an extremely undervalued reputation, as always, proved to be the best. <br /> <br /> And since Damian could not perform at any level, it was difficult to experience emotions to any of the characters. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, he knows little about the real world of BDSM and decided to create a typical “Hollywood reality” for gorgeous men and women who are perverted and dangerous. <br /> <br /> Save your time, money and brains and pass by.
