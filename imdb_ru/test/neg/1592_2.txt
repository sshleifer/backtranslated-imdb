The only reason I didn’t give a terrible rating to this film is that I feel that it was such a horrible film in all aspects that it deserves at least 2/10; for not trying. <br /> <br /> The plot is the least of your worries when you are slapped in the face with a hysterical tongue and scenes such as “singing ass,” in a bad attempt to shock and disgust. It is believed that the main goal of this film is to shock, and the main part of this film did not reach it, the final scene disgustingly manages to erase the memory of this shockingly meaningless film and achieve its goal of becoming the dirtiest film ever. br /> <br /> A very budget film, badly played, and the dialogue is shockingly bad. <br /> <br /> I give 0/10 really !!!
