I, like many others here, bought this film on my local WM in a cheap basket “Two for $ 11.00”. I love raw scary B and sci-fi movies and it definitely fits into this category. Practically everything that everyone said here died. Yes, it was bad, but it was to be expected. The “main” problem that I encountered in this film is that it was just boring. I mean a serious yawn. The acting was bad, the costumes (the K Mart Skeletor costume around 1982) were worse, and the editing was terrible. There is no continuity at all. Mr. Skeletor eventually dies as a result of a kind of explosion ... ah, although he faced a multiple explosion throughout this movement. I suppose the last one just affected him. Obviously earlier meetings with this "military" group (cough) affected his horse ... it will change from red to black throughout this crappy holiday. Even for movie B, do yourself a favor and skip it. The only good I need right now is to add to my DVD collection. I hope no one will know about it when they look at my movie collection. Thumbs down, great time.
