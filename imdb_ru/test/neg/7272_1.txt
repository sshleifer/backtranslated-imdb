Finally, I can connect the dots between the Return of the Jedi and the Phantom Menace. We see here, where Lucas lost touch with what made the original Star Wars films great, and began to descend into the plot with fewer trips, which destroyed episodes 1-3. This film is more like one of those 80s low-cost cheese swords and magical films than anything worthy of being associated with the Star Wars saga. As is the case with the character Jar-Jar, he seems to be aimed at children (and the toy market). The scene of the battle is especially bad. It was distressing to see how the unbelievable talents of Sian Phillips went to such a waste after her classic performance in I, Claudia.
