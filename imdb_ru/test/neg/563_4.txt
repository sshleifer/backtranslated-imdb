This film was to be called “The Eyes of Alexander,” and they generally had to do away with the concept of Bogart. The film began with a frivolous approach to Bogart's legacy and some comic moments with his surgical-oriented face, but after the first 15-30 minutes it turns into a more serious thriller, where two palm-sized sapphires supposedly laid as eyes in marble Alexander of Macedon, for him and seen by him, just before his death. Thus, precious stones are of great value not only because of their quality and size, but also because of their connection with the Greatest Conqueror, whom the world has ever known. Being an expert on Alexander, I can say that it is completely and completely fiction, but in any case it is a good film. So the film unfolds around some early stupidity and stumbles along with Alexander's allusions in the foreground and background (which I really liked), ending with the outdated shark attack (you could not go to the movies in '79 - ') 80 without either a shark appearing to threaten the audience). There is a yacht named Eurydice (the young wife of Alexander's father), a man named Alexander, Philip, Clyte? (About 5 years have passed since I saw the movie, so I can’t remember all the details), Olympia, some street names and a lot others. It was fun to watch the movie, just to try to catch all the details of the background that the director put in (obviously Alexanderfil himself). When all is said and done, the eyes return, and the camera shows them on the bed, as the credits fly by. Kind of a neat finish. What would be more fun would be if they followed the path of Indiana Jones and made an adventure adventure. There were many, many real artifacts that could be used to make this more interesting, or, for example, the annotated (according to Aristotle) ​​version of the Iliad, which Alexander kept with him his whole life, even during his numerous travels in Asia (he would have innumerable value if found today). Olivia Hussey (my favorite actress in the bi-film) was killed too early, and she had to be the main actress everywhere, and not the girl from mom and dad ... although she herself was calm before her eyes. If you manage to find this film, you may want to check out the historical things and see Olivia Hassi in a very funny, cool, humor a little earlier, but other than that, I will pass it on for something more interesting. <Br /> <br /> your nickname
