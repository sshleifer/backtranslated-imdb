Cobb It sucks. I have not learned anything about a person whom I have not heard before. The performances were on top. The scene where Cobb and Al are driving along a snowy road in search of women in Reno should be one of the worst scenes conceived lately. This is just stupid and uninteresting. The sequences of memories were terrible. And they used the same sequences over and over and over. If I saw the same shot of Cobb fighting someone on the base again, I would physically fall ill. Having watched this “film”, we will not know ANYTHING, as it was during the Cobb era. We will not learn anything about his relationship with his players, nothing about his days as a manager, nothing about his relationship with his family members, except that “they don’t like him”. I thought that when I was sitting to watch this movie, I would learn something about the era of baseball in which Cobb played. Instead, all I saw was a repetition of how Cobb hated everything and everyone, and how they hated him. Boy, what a great movie (sarcasm intended). Cobb is portrayed as a constant liar in a film, so which of his stories must be accurate? Who knows? What's the difference? No one will after seeing this piece of shit. If you decide to rent this movie, make sure that the fast forward button works on your VCR, as you will want to use it again. I hope someday someone will make a GOOD film about Ti Kobbe. I liked this movie just as much as the people in it loved Cobb, that is, I hated it. Now I know why I found it in the section “RENT ONE GET FREE” in the video store. I think I will ask my fifty cents from the video clerk, since I cannot reclaim the time wasted watching this garbage. Oh, well, I would have thought of a film featuring Robert Hul.
