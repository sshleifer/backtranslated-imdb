It could be a good movie if more things were explained. Too many plot holes to find it enjoyable. The end, in particular, is outside the left margin. SPOILER WARNING. How did the kidnapper return to Dundee so quickly, and Dundee appeared in the house within two minutes? Breaking the impasse here. How did Anna get the money? No explanation. If the pit cop knew that Lancaster was in danger, why did he not have a cop at the door of the hospital. This and many other questions remain. It is a pity because the premise was there, just poor writing and execution. <br /> <br /> A good cast is lost here. Does de Carlo go from bad to good to bad? The character of Lancaster lacks development, and Dureya is just a “bad guy.” <br /> <br /> This can be changed with a cohesive storyline and better writing. Of course, that would be a lot more brutal with more free sex and everything else. I suppose editing would be abrupt too, so let's leave it quite well alone.
