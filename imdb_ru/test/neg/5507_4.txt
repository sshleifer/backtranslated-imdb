Jesus Franco hit or missed his films very much, and I would say that it was a miss, that is, if you are not completely confused. I will say that a man has a good shot, even if topless with machine guns in the background of the ocean are involved in it. In general, this is rather ridiculous, and acting is terrible, but acting is the smallest thing in question. And what is it about? Well, it's about 102 minutes of lesbianism, women picking in the hot sun for no apparent reason, and almost as much dirt as you can stand, or maybe a little. The most noteworthy (?) Scene is with the participation of a young woman tied to a chair and clearly in love with a German shepherd, and although what happens is simply implied (fortunately), this is probably a scenario I could do without. I would refer this to “Tender Flesh” as one of the Franco films, which I would not like to have in my collection, although the music is jazz and fun. 4 out of 10, yech.
