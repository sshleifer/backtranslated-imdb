I hate being too critical, but this one was really bad. I like the Baldwin brothers, I just want to have more talents between them. I liked the general plot, but there were too many “attempts” and not enough real “deeds” in terms of a quality game. <br /> <br /> My favorite character is a bald cop. He reminded me of Dmitry Valtan (Jeremy Roberts, I guess) from "Initial Campaign 6: Unknown Country." Just no hair. <br /> <br /> If you have a Hollywood Video MVP program and you’re really trying to make money, do it with one of the three MVP movies you choose. It is worth a little laugh. <br /> <br /> The most impressive special effect throughout the show is the sound of a Stephen Baldwin rifle. I suppose it will let you know a little about the quality and excitement of the rest of the show.
