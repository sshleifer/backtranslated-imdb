TDY is probably the only worst piece of garbage that has ever hit the video. They shoot a scene from the Order with Gene Claude Van Damme in the title role, and this makes me angry because Van Damme is a personal comedy film of his own. In the past, Seagal did an excellent job, but he fell very low in my books, and he probably will never pull another one besieged or marked for death if he does not sit down and take a very good brainstorming session with him. <br /> <br /> It also annoys me that he didnâ€™t perform many of his stunts, as in previous films. To conclude all this, if you are ready to watch a movie suitable for a bin or woodcutter, then remove it today, you will die.
