Alas, another Costner film, which lasted an hour. Credible performances, but the script had nowhere to go and did not hurry to get there. First we are offered an unrelated sequence of events, few of which develop a story. Will the script focus on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fisher? What about Fisher and Thomas? In the end, the real story does not develop, and the characters themselves are artificially supported by third-party monologues. The singer explains Randall, Randall explains Fisher again and again. Finally, for a long time, when you don't care anymore, you will learn something about meeting with scripts. Three endings were no doubt suggested, and no one could make a decision. Final result? All three were used, one after another, after another. If you can hang after the 100th yawn, you can choose them. Despite the transparent attempt to score points with a dedication to the Coast Guard, this one had to be washed on the very first day.
