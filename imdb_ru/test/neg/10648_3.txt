After the failure of Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth, the chapter that served as a kind of “death blow” to the franchise, another embarrassing cheap refund did not come as a surprise. A terrible attempt to explain every riddle of Pinhead and boxes of riddles that span literally centuries of history in a film that lasts up to 90 minutes ... Demonstrates nothing but a miserable actor, and nothing else but a miserable B-film special effects and an absurd and insulting attempt at a gloomy humor, while STILL tried to keep the whole project completely serious. I wonder how many ugly directors did this thing have? Poor Pinhead has so much screen time that every bit of the mystery and threats that this cult character possessed is completely lost. After an hour of listening to wordy speeches and dramatic poses, we just want to tell the guy to shut up! Gently entertaining in places, especially in the first segment, this mess begins to look and feel like a cheap, ugly, made for a television flick of a splash after a while, and ends in the most ridiculous way that you can imagine: Pinhead, along with your favorite dog Cenobite, kills a bunch of idiots ... in space! Sorry, but any true fan of the first two films of the series, which gave this film abortion more than 3 stars, should be ashamed. On the other hand, the film that follows; Hellraiser: Inferno is in fact an amazingly smart and stylish piece from the film Noir, which brilliantly restores the Pinhead as a master of illusion and cruelty and returns an idea of ​​the inherent evil of the human race, which was the central part of the original film, and the whole point of the story. For any serious horror fan, watch Hellraiser I & II, skip the lousy III and this one, and continue with Inferno. You won't miss anything by skipping this trash ...
