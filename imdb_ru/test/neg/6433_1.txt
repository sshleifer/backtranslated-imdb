“The war is in your blood,” says Rambo at the beginning of the film, “don't fight with her.” What? Does the screenwriter take Mickey off Sly? Anyone with primary school education can not miss the joke here. However, Stallone says this without a hint of irony. <br /> <br /> The same lack of humor applies to the film. Rambo IV is an incredible idiotic actor who would have been funny without intention if he had not been disgustingly cruel. The fantasy of the villagers, where the villains are so villainous, is not enough just to kill them ?? You must dismember them with pleasure. Stallone stops on clichés without collars, to express their point of view. It is not enough for the main villain to feed them to pigs, throwing children into the fire as a sadist. He is also a pedophile, homosexual. <br /> <br /> What happens with IMDb? Has this passed to the Society of Shooters? How is this disgusting excuse for such a high degree of exploitation? I like a good fighter just like the next man, but this is not entertainment ?? this is pornography of violence that trivializes and ultimately denigrates the real tragedy of Myanmar. The only good thing about the movie is that Sly doesn't take off his shirt. For this, I will give him one star ...
