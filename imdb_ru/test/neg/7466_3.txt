Antonio Margheriti, director of the fascinating cult horror "Cannibal Apocalypse", runs this 70s icon with a gothic aroma and a serrated star, Jane Birkin (as well as her French lover of the day, Serge Gainsburg). <br /> <Unfortunately, despite the inclusion of such pleasures as the delicious bisexual French teacher and the terribly unreal killer of the orangutan, "Seven deaths in the cat's eye" end in a melancholy mess, which is a struggle for patience. <br /> <br /> A pretty Korringa (Birkin) schoolgirl returns to her family’s Scottish estate many years later, only to find that the maniac is killing her relatives one by one. Using a variety of tricks with the “eerie old house” (hidden doorways, dark corridors, eerie cemeteries, rooms covered with cobwebs and candles), Margariti unites a tangled story that sometimes promises supernatural events, but ultimately leads to a lame cop. The end, which is not very impressive. <br /> <br /> “Where exactly does a cat fit all this?”, I hear you asking. Well, quite plump mighty witnesses of each murder, thereby justifying the pretty cool sound of Margheriti. <br /> <br /> “Burn, stylish fun,” as the DVD cover says; “A boring pile of dung,” I say.
