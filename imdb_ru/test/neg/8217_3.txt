The film successfully gives a graphic image of the suffering from forced sex work, but no more. The leftmost agenda of this film was visible a mile away, and the viewer is embarrassed while watching if you know this feeling. Thus, women are abducted and sent to former Yugoslav territory to work as sex slaves, because (sighing deeply) the American military establishment is corrupt and looks away, while their private security guards sell people abroad. You do not need a half-brain to see the attitude to the war in Iraq and Black Water. <br /> <br /> What a load of leftovers! It seems that I have been deceived all my life, thinking that this and many other problems were a direct consequence of the influence of communism on this region for 45 years. But no, it was the American war in Iraq, which was also responsible for the earthquakes, tropical storms and constipations that I had last week. <br /> <br /> The film ignores the fact that women are willing to sell 95% of the sex trade to sell their bodies for money and enter the western quarter. You also see scenes that are so stupid that you want to pull the hair. We have someone in broad daylight stalking a woman on the streets of London, beating her, and then somehow dragging her unconscious body for half a mile back to the apartment where he rapes her. No one sees this and does not call the police, and the running woman does not want to scream during the chase. Moreover, later we see 4-5 women lining up in the center of London among the selling day beams, one of them has a broken face, and people go shopping in the background, as if nothing is happening. You can not invent this nonsense. <br /> <br /> I used to think that such garbage was exclusive to Hollywood, but obviously I was wrong.
