<br /> <br /> This film is best enjoyed by a large audience with funny attacks. <br /> <br /> Very often KADOSH heroes look forward without much attention. Very strong unhappy faces, very thoughtful, very serious. In these moments, the sound of music is very serious, in order to make sure twice that the viewer understands that the scene being watched is not about fun and games. <br /> <br /> The more fascinating parts of this film turn out to be between many thoughtful looks. We learn that women in the KADOSH community have two responsibilities. One of them is to breed as many male men as possible for their husbands. Second, stay at work to free their husbands from the need to work. What do these people do with their enough free time? They pray. And we learn that at home they pray loudly: "I thank you for not creating me as a woman." And in their place of worship, they pray to thank for the possession of the existing male genitalia. <br /> <br /> Along with prayer, there are many scenes with frenzied antics, shouts and endless shaking of the head, and the bodies swing back and forth on the fourth and in many things many intricate and bizarre rituals are mixed action. <br /> <br /> The cream of unintended comedy comes from sex. The image of a hot and anxious man who actively exchanges biological fluid with his wife in bed, trying to prevent his hat from falling from the scalp, is unforgettable! <br /> <br /> Every sex scene is fun but eye-catching. This is when the husband rubs the face of his beautiful wife (Yael Abekassis). Oh yes, we are finally entering the land of sensuality ... but NO! The rubbing of the legs is stopped before something happens, and the husband starts shaking his head and shaking his body autistic, until the scene ends! <br /> <br /> In attractive conditions, three attractive women are stripped, but there is absolutely no nudity in KADOSH. Technically, there are several interesting images and the pleasant use of light and colors by the director. <br /> <br /> For a more believable, educational, and entertaining treatment of the difficult situation of being an unclean woman, unworthy of keeping a book to the World, in which respect is measured by the speed with which a person can quote a phrase from ancient writings, I offer “YENTL” Barbra Streisand. <br /> <br />
