A science fiction channel. How often do you disappoint me? Quite often I think, have you ever shown good films? Well, you gave me wonderful “Heroes” and a pretty good “Lost Room”, but they are series, and as for the film, there really is nothing positive. Bad game, bad direction, horrible characters and little story, and this is just for starters. I checked the director Allan Goldsten and was not surprised to find that there was nothing interesting in his resume (in fact, I half think that this is a pseudonym). The premises of four motorcyclists crossing the motto in a national park, when one of them gets into an accident, and he needs a park ranger to save them only to get into a forest fire, it is weak and predictable that you know every blow before that happens.
