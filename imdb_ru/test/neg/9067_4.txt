Is there anything else on earth to be more tempting than knowing what our fragile bodies are expecting after death. Spanish director Ignacio Cerda (the soul mate of his German colleague Jorg Buttgereit) gives an exhaustive answer to our curiosity and invites us on an exciting journey into the world of prep tables, scalpels, surgical saws, human bowels and twisted minds. <br /> <br /> Welcome to the opening room! <br /> <br /> I don’t know which facets of the film, besides its notorious reputation, could help him get a high enough rating. <br /> <br /> According to the plot, this is quite simple and understandable - a day in the life of (actually half an hour) a restless coroner (or, perhaps, an assistant pathologist or whatever) who is tired of his usual pathology of debt and relieves your psychological stress in an unconventional way, right at your workplace. I am puzzled by what message the authors tried to convey with the help of one plot. I suspect that this may be somehow inspired by the bizarre behavior of Udo Kiera’s character in Andy Warhol’s Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> The artistic values ​​of the film are also dubious. It is difficult to evaluate the performance of actors who do not squeeze a single word. Their emotions are hidden behind medical masks. Also, there is not enough space for excellent camera work - in fact, the whole action takes place mainly in four walls. <br /> <br /> Authenticity - the effects and make-up are impressive, and the situation looks very believable, but only a few medical / Judicial experts can judge how truthfully and anatomically correct the autopsy is (if anyone doesn’t care) Honestly, I accustomed to thinking that an autopsy is carried out in order to examine the state of individual organs and establish the cause of death. Now I know that the corpses are separated, raped and humiliated, the intestines are torn, the brain is removed from the head, filled with the stomach and mixed with the intestines, then the body is sewn back and washed - nothing personal. And what are these poor guys expected to write in their false autopsy reports? <br /> <br /> The shock and aversion factor - it is very unlikely that the unsuspecting viewer will find, to his dismay, that the disc for which it was intended to Watch with his wife and children near the Christmas tree turns out to be a graphic video tool for vivisection. This incomprehensible subject is hardly accessible, it is wanted by people who are familiar with the subject and are not easily offended. Therefore, it would be pointless to warn anyone about sabotaging this film. They perfectly understand what they are looking at and what they want to see. <br /> <br /> Cerda is a truly gifted and stylish director, which is evident from at least two other parts of his “trilogy” - the preceding “Awakening”, an amazing short black and white and 30-minute “Genesis”, visually stunning and capricious piece with an original and interesting concept. And I am sure that one day he will win the hearts of the audience with his new, more mass-oriented material. And sooner or later, “Consequences” will become a rarity for meticulous collectors of his “early” “warming up” works. <br /> <br /> But for now, I'm afraid this may be strictly recommended for medical students or specialists studying mental disorders and sexual deviations.
