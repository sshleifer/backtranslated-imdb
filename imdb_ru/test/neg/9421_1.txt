The novel “WEAPON”, which serves as the basis for this terrible garbage, is one of the best techno-thrillers that have long since descended to pike. The character SOLO, who should NOT look like a man, is a wonderful creature, and it was just awful to see how he turned into another clone-terminator, and Mario Van Peebles was terribly trying to “act” like a robot. Nothing in this movie is worth it. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood insist on redeeming the rights to beautiful novels and then killing them? There are so many wrong things in SOLO that it’s just as unfair to list them as inviting a person without legs to the lively Hopscotch game. Avoid this terrible movie and find the 2 novels of ROBERT MAZON that show the amazing character of SOLO. Books - WEAPONS and the excellent continuation of SOLO. But do not pay any attention to this terrible piece of film.
