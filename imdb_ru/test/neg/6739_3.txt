When you watch a Seagal movie, you expect good action. You expect a fight, not just a lot of shooting, like in this movie. And more: you expect a fairly simple story. Well, I can live with a more complex story, although this is a film about Seagal. But this, this, I do not know what to say. It is really very, very confusing. At the end of the film, I had serious problems finding out what happened. And I know that I'm not the only one. There is so little information in the story and so many holes in the plot that it is almost impossible to track what is happening in the film. There are a lot of people in the film, people switch all the time to the other side, and he changes his location too often. Terrible. I just do not understand why it seems that Seagal is doing a kind of continuation of this.
