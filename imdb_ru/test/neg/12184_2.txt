In the twilight years of his career, Charles Bronson established long-standing partnerships with several directors, primarily with J. Lee Thompson and Michael Winner. He also starred in two films for former director Bond Peter Hunt - the first - a decent fighter of 1981, “Deadly Hunt”, the second - an indifferent political fighter. Murder is pretty boring if you know the truth, and in the end you will find yourself craving for something with more passion and speed, like, for example, Wilby's Conspiracy (what the plot looks like this film). <br /> br / Bronson moans his role as bodyguard Jay Killian, whose task is to defend the wife of American President Lara Royce Craig (Jill Ireland, Bronson's real wife). Killian believes that Mrs. Craig was the target for the killers; she thinks he is an overly protective, paranoid pessimist. It turns out - surprise, surprise - that Killian was right from the very beginning, and someone really wants to destroy it. They both run, pursued by the assassins. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows that the wife of the American president is known as the First Lady. For some reason in this film it was renamed “One Mom”! It is clear that the meaning of this is in someone else's assumption, but it indicates the meaninglessness of the film as a whole. Most of the film’s performances are lazy, and the script takes a long time to get where it goes. If I had to call Murder in a particular genre, I would say it should be a “thriller”. However, I would say that with some reservations, that this is a thriller, he has very little thrill.
