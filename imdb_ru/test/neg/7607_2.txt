This is a student film and a piece of shit. I would use a stronger language to describe it, but then the review would not have been published, and the world should know - beyond reasonable doubt - this film really sucks. <br /> <br /> It seems that another Ruler was used to measure the early work of an already well-known director. As if it was brilliant that we were too stupid to understand, since he finally understood it today. I do not buy it. The early film “Bad Taste”, shot by LOTR by Peter Jackson, is a complete mess, and this “early work” of another famous director is also a mess. These “early works” are representative of everything from budget to scenarios, actors, etc., and all this is at the bottom of the basket. Do not be fooled by a big name. <br /> <br /> If you like watching a handful of hippie 70s men pretend they can ever command a ship with the worst special effects you've ever seen, this is your movie <br /> < br /> I can not believe that this thing has received a gold award for the best special effects. This is a joke, right? Or a reward for a joke? <br /> <br /> If you want to see what movie you WANT to shoot this season or three red dwarfs, you fucking fuss.
