A group of cavers with a sad history sends the author to a “hairy” adventure through an uncharted cave in Kazakhstan. In these times of remakes, sequels and film companies trying to capitalize on any winning combination of cinematic components, The Cavern has only one relatively different twist in the previous eight cave films of the past few years, and this twing seems to be taken by the Secret File. I like to give every film the benefit of doubt, but there were too many little annoyances for me. Camera work can cause you a headache, as they seem to be constantly confused as to which way. Not being a caver, for me it does not matter whether the shooting was realistic. Too much unnecessary PANNICK from presumably experienced cavers, by the last half you utter one of two things loudly ?? Oh, just shut up and concentrate on saving yourself, or I hope you all die by the end. It must have been very tiring for these decent actors to make this film. A moderate amount of blood and nothing special in the dialogue or characters. Although you are sure that you know what is happening by the end, the last five minutes explain all the details. But I would have a better opinion of the film if they left the last minute on the floor of the cutting room. It simply was not necessary. I suggest you click the “Extract” button immediately after confirming your suspicions and save the settings to continue. I thought for a long time that the film industry should divide the checkout scheme of the modified restaurant industry. You pay for the materials to make a movie before you enter, but any profit for a movie comes from the advice you give when you leave the cinema. I can't blame what I don't like about this film because of its low budget.
