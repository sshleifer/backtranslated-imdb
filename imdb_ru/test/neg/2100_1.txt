“Snakes on the train” is a film that I rented because of pure fun thoughts about the movie. "Snakes on the plane" were a pleasant fighter, so obviously, the filmmakers wanted to make money on success with this small budget. On the 85th minute, Snakes on the Train are almost unbearable. I had to continue to suspend the film in order to entertain myself due to the lack of events in the film. Throughout the film, it never fully explains why this girl has this curse, or why she constantly coughs with this green / purple stickiness. Moreover, there is an endless boring dialogue between the two main characters, Brucho and Alma, discussing how to get rid of the curse. I can rate low-budget filmmaking. I’m really not picky about movies, I’m open to any genre or budget, but Snakes on the Train is really one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. Were there screenwriters on Acid or something at the end of this movie? Why did a woman suddenly become a giant snake? and most importantly, how could he eat a train? <br /> <br /> The result. “Snakes on the train” is a film that should be avoided at all costs. Do not be intrigued, as they called me by name, this film is very bad. Let's put these snakes to rest <br /> <br /> 0/10
