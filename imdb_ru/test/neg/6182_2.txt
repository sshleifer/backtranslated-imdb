Great disappointment. “CLASH BY NIGHT” is a lot of talkative and stagnant, and the dialogues do not sound like real ones emanating from these characters. This is melodrama at the peak. Acting is really excessive and very unreal. Only MARILYN MONROE and KEITH ANDES as supporting players give this film any lightning. It is a pity that they had more cases. I am the one who looks at the details in the films. Two big questions ... 1. Who watches the baby all day, when Stanwick and Ryan are together, and Douglas is working, and then he unleashes a bar fight with his father? 2. When Stanwyk collects things to leave the city, why did she see her packing in her brothers' house, where she has not lived for at least two years? In addition, when everyone goes to the projection room in the Theater, who takes care of the child again? Such details really annoy me and make me give films much lower. What were the writers, directors and everyone else involved in the mindset of the film? Nuf said.
