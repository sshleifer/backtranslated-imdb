The keys to VIP are just another horrible series that can be seen and seen on this station. The show is terrible when guys argue that they are real players competing with each other (there are two in each episode) in silly games where they try to get the girls in the bar to talk to them, get the numbers of the girls and so on. four guys who also claim to be experts on recruitment, but they also seem like huge bags, like the participants. The show is not funny at all, not even interesting, it’s just boring to watch these guys desperately try to convince us that they are great players (even more about four judges than me, but about the contestants). Nothing funny even happened in the show, which I watched, and the show is clearly falsified. Do you really think that they invited all these people to the club, forced them to sign releases and tape them while these guys were playing the same stupid games with them? This is not at all a reality, it’s just nonsense, probably even daytime recordings. Someone else wrote here how he recognized someone on the show, and everything was fine, yes, it is obvious, this is a fake show, and even with the actors it is still not funny. One of the worst shows I've ever seen.
