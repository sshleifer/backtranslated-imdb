“Problem Child” was a good movie, but did it really deserve to continue? I don't think that did it. The only asset of the original film was Gilbert Gottfried, and he was not even good at this sequel. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why this movie was bad. For starters, it just wasn't funny. Even when I saw it at the age of nine, I didn’t sympathize with Junior (Michael Oliver) at all. His character seemed to me whiny, hating himself and, perhaps most importantly, a rebel without a hint. Looks like he hated every woman that his father Ben (John Ritter) met for the sake of hate for them. It also does not give a good message to children with divorced parents (who now make up more than half of the children in the United States) when one woman Ben decides to (almost) marry is a southern aristocrat who is vindictive and who hates children no matter what. . <br /> <br /> And no matter how I thought, it would be great if the original SNL actress Larayne Newman came back to the big screen, she couldn’t even keep this film. It also seemed strange to me that she was a white southern debutant named Lavender. This is more like the name of an African American woman. But, of course, this has nothing to do with why I did not like this film. <br /> <br /> I think the movie didn’t work because you had antagonists that you should hate, as well as main characters that you shouldn’t hate. The character of John Ritter had to be a good parent who was desperately trying to teach his child the right from the wrong, not obeying the authoritative upbringing of children. Instead, he lost consciousness, not only as a weak parent, but also because he desperately tried to find a wife for several days, no matter how well he knew the woman. Did I mention that it sends a bad message to children of divorced parents? <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, everything else that went wrong with this film included an unnecessary Amy Yasbek and an inexplicable return to play a completely different character from this young girl who was even more unpleasant than Junior , completely inclined to toilet humor and even more outrageous and outdated homophobic humor (with the participation of dog breeders). The film was just a mess, and really does not deserve a DVD release, if it has not yet been released. It should just rot on VHS along with all the other bad, forgotten 90s comedies.
