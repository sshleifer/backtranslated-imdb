Great concept, great features and voices, but a complete waste of time. A real shame since he aimed higher, it probably wouldn't be the bomb she was (is); Depends too much on scatological humor, for starters. I am amazed at the comments of "educated" reviewers who refer to the "good science" behind this children's rubbish.

Humor is aimed at eight-year-olds, but the subject is more suited to inexperienced teens.
