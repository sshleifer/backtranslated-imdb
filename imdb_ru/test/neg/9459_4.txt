I have this movie. And it is very difficult to find. This is a unique low-budget film about a doctor who is looking for the perfect companion. This is really a ridiculous low budget feeling, and blood is surprisingly good for what seems like a budget of $ 500. The director is considered a master of blood. I would not have gone that far, but perhaps he was at one time. Only 6/10 on the blood map.
