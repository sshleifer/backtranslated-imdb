Probably the worst creature ever to exist, boa versus python was a million times better than that, and it wasn't great either, bad game, bad effects and guess which DVD is one of those with 3 hours of preview before the main one menu. probably the worst film ever, without blood and violence, people are stupid and continue to use guns when they have no effect on these animals, the only cool part was radioactive leeches that were pretty cool, I called the island just a rush from the Jurassic Park the period is boring and tedious and you should not even look, but I believe that the stupidity of the characters is quite funny, so it will be a good comedy film, but definitely not a thriller
