This film is an undisguised attempt to appeal to young people between the ages of 14 and 24 and an insult to all of them. I refuse to believe that this age group is so helpless that it is entertained by this unnecessary "remake". At the beginning of the film, one of the characters proclaims: "Idiots are surrounding me." This is a defining moment in the film, which gradually comes from there. The film is full of clichés, red "frightening" and inexplicable events, as well as heroes who are not quite clever, a formula that is too familiar in silent horror films. and this shitty “so dark that I don’t see” scenes stolen from a chainsaw massacre, but just annoying, not creating any tension or horror. Shooting in the dark is difficult, and sometimes darkness is a great tool in a film that suggests tension. but I felt that the less you see in this case, the better. maybe he didn’t want to wait until the morning, because he didn’t care, otherwise it could cost him more money to do well night scenes, or he doesn’t know how. who knows? If you have never seen a horror movie in your life, or you are two or three years old, every aspect of this movie is predictable and done before. warning: Paris Hilton in this film. enough said. In general, the film “Blesh-slasher”, which begs the question: “Where is the wax?”, Was treated as a lost leader. if you are bored as much as possible, and all other prokaty are shot or you are just in the mood for a bad horror movie that is not really scary, or you would like Paris to pierce a blow to the pole, go ahead and take a chance. This is not the worst film I've ever seen, but if this is what the producers of this film think that young people want, I pray that they will be deceived. a profit-oriented film without any attempt to achieve any kind of art or respect for the genre. You know, smart characters make a movie worse. I think this is Colle-Serra’s debut as a director, in addition to advertising and music videos. in 2006 another film will be released entitled “Goal 2.”, I hope its goal is to make the film better.
