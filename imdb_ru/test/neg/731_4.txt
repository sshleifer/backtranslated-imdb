The ridiculous premise of this fraud is that Argentina returned the Falkland Islands, which failed in 1982, infusing the Argentinean spermatozoa of European women, thereby diluting ethnic purity until it benefited Argentina. Yes, right. Intelligence is carried out by our hero / villan and cad Fabian, who drags his fisheye video camera from the column to publish secret footage of his meetings with the Falklands, including his courtship and the possible conquest of one woman, Camilla. Unhappy indie and fraudulent documentary, this film gives us a lot of boring tourism shot from the hip ... yada, yada, yada. The film has no plot potential and is just starting to become interesting when Fabian and Camilla go through their usual moments of awkwardness and uncertainty, when they get from a handshake to a bed. “F * ckland” is intended only for those who love movies, who can appreciate the bleak, no-nonsense, strict austerity of Indian dogmas.
