Has it ever happened to you? I go to my local video store and see a few new arrivals in the “Film Noir” section. I discovered a copy of the new film “NAKED ALIBI”, which I have never seen. This is from one of those video postal companies that offer (mostly) dupey-looking copies of hard-to-find titles. The description on the box sounds good. There are players in the film that I like (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grame and Gene Barry). Therefore, I take him home and look. About ten minutes after the beginning of the film, I had thoughts. About halfway to this movie, I didn't like it. By the time the movie ended, I not only did not like him, I despised him. The film begins with the fact that the police interrogate Al Willis on suspicion of robbery. Except that the police are drunk, he has nothing. When he pushes a policeman and demands that he be sent home, the police beat him. Detective Conroy arrives, lets the cops finish the beating, and then announces that Willis is clean. Willis swears he will get revenge. Later, one of the police officers was shot dead. With no other evidence that Willis “hurts” about the beating, Conroy makes Willis his only suspect, despite the fact that his boss calls a couple of thugs suspects. Conroy arrests him, but for lack of evidence, Willis is released. The next day, two more policemen were killed by a bomb. This time Conroy goes to the bakery, which is owned by Willis, and tries to knock him out of recognition. Conroy does not know this, but a local journalist, whose newspaper accuses Conroy’s police department of police brutality, takes a snapshot of how Conroy tries to strangle Willis, and Conroy is fired. But Conroy continues the pursuit, and Willis flees to Mexico, where Willis has a mistress. Conroy manages to convince his mistress (whom Willis treats rather rudely) to help him prove that Willis is a murderer. What this movie lacks is a compelling screenplay. The script looks as though only a draft was written, and the filming began before the finished script was completed. Things happen, characters' characters change, plot twists do not occur for any real reason, except that it requires a script. Besides the fact that Willis now likes to knock over the glass, and in the beginning of the film there is nothing that could make us think that he is a crazy killer who cheats on his wife. He treats his wife, child and co-workers well. At the beginning of the film, it seems that his Conroy is the one whose gun is free. It seems he accidentally approves of police brutality. Conroy, for no reason, is convinced from the very beginning that Willis has a criminal record. He seems to be acting under the motto of the old communist Bulgarian secret police; “Everyone is guilty of something, we just haven't heard about it yet.” Later, Conroy shows kindness to Ala's mistress and little son, now we have to love him. Sorry! I had an early impression of Konroy for too long. And he is also a dumb cop. Only after he is fired and he goes to Mexico, does he verify the identity of Willis and find out that he has a warrant issued in Maryland. Why didn't he think about it before? Because this film did not use enough time. The cast is good. Gene Barry is doing well, considering how badly he conceived his role as Al Willis. I'm a big fan of criminal thrillers of the 40s and 50s, but not only did I not think that this film is good, but my mouth tastes bad (which is what many modern films do, but old films are rarely done).
