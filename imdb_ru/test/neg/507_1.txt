We'll see. What annoyed me the most? The super-long dance scene initially looked at people spinning around so much that I was dizzy ... Not even showing where the music was coming from ... The whole part of the college prom, which had nothing to do with the rest of the film. Or perhaps the fact that each scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than necessary. What is the resistance of this film. And the most annoying aspect is that the bad guys are so bad, so terrible that it seems that the director made this film for second graders. "These people are bad ... These people are good." Whenever the film has a heart on the agenda, I am beside myself. There is a scene on the rink that seems completely inappropriate. Long lingering love scenes with the main character and a Russian prostitute who looks more like a rock star and his sexual fan. The character of John Herth, who is part of a long onset scene, drinks and disagrees with exaggerated villains. His death scene may well be the stupidest in history. And I hear how everyone, even the haters of this film, talk about how great the cinematography is. I think it looks blurry. See "Days of Heaven" if you want to see the magnificent courtyards. This film is even worse than anti-hype. It's pointless. The epilogue showing the main character on the yacht was almost as stupid as the prologue. The battle scenes are tiring and dizzying. This movie is really bad. Avoid this if you do not like bad movies, because it is the king of them.
