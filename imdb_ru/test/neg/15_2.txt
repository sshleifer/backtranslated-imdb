Few films met expectations and upset me as much as Fire. Movie artsy trash. Nothing is achieved at the artistic level. The only thing that was possible to get is a ban in India. If only it was due to the poor quality of filmmaking, and not because of actual disputes, the ban would be more justified. <br /> <br /> Now that I have gotten rid of suffering because of my system, Iâ€™m more able to analyze the movie: <br /> <br /> * From the very beginning, the movie seems unreal, especially when the main characters start talking English language. The director, of course, did not make the film for the Indian audience; however, he underestimated his international audience, simplifying it. Observing the character of domestic help, speaking excellent English, is too unrealistic to be true. <br /> <br /> * Then we regularly see the views of Radha. These scenes are not very effective. They rise like noise and impede the flow of the film. I am still interested in how this philosophical dialogue is connected with history. I felt that surrealism was lost. <br /> <br /> Love scenes seemed to be voyeuristic and probably intended for the audience, not as a strong statement. In any case, they do not achieve one of the two. <br /> <br /> * The names chosen for women, Radha and Sita, are the names of Hindu deities and, therefore, were chosen to shock the audience. However, since the film was not originally intended for an Indian audience, the selection of shock by title is not intended to achieve its goal, which is absurd. <br /> <br /> * The quality of the direction is very poor, and some key and subtle scenes were poorly handled. The best director could create a powerful emotional drama from this story. <br /> <br /> * The game seemed to be wooden, although Nandita Das contributed a bit of life to this life, the rest were wasted. I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actress, but her talent is not shown in this film. Male leaders were outright trash. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Earth and want to see more of a director, stay away from that. You are welcome.
