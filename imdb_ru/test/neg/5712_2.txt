This is glossy soft porn; a boring soap opera concentrating on one thing: sex. They actually made sex boring, unfortunately, because I challenge you to watch it casually and tell me what the storyline was. That this is an occasion for Kim Bassinger to show his gorgeous body, and for Mickey Rourke - to grin a lot. That's all. Rourke's complacency is so terrible that it is disgusting, and Bassinger, despite the gorgeous figure, looks cheap and not beautiful. <br /> <br /> Prestige for a photographer for good close-up shots and wonderful color, but the story is so weak - there is no character development and no plot - this is not able to compensate. Let's face it: this film was made for one reason only - to interest the male audience. At this level it probably succeeded. If I recall, this is why I looked at him, being a fan of Bassinger's appearance, but I really expected a story too. <br /> <br /> Those who try to pass it off as “skillful” and something deeper than soft porn are just deceiving themselves.
