In this film we are invited to observe how a person begins to like and experience emotional experiences. What was the point of making a film then? To show that it would be better not to have a “COLD BLOOD” - a book that I admire, by the way, - to preserve the integrity of our hero? Barely He behaves at a party at the beginning of the film just as he behaves after his triumphant reading from a book, so his degradation is a matter of degree. Should we care enough for Capote to take seriously his statement that he and the murderer Perry Smith are kindred spirits, and the first one had all the breaks, and the second one did not? I'm afraid that Mr. Capote’s position didn’t touch me at all, so if it was a central idea, it was wasted on me. But even if I could understand why the filmmakers visited this meaningless project for us, the awkward story would still bore me, as before. Hoffman gives a bravura effect without an emotional effect, while Keener and Cooper are so warm and interesting that I longed for more of them. Sadly outside of faith.
