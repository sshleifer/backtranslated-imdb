This film was a complete deception. It is possible that this is actually pollution. The thin tense atmosphere of the original remake is not where to see. Sarah Michelle Gellar does not give anything, even in her death episode, but still she is the best performance in this film, and her death is the best thing in it, even if she deserved a better death. This is a sign of bad writing and directing. I guess she made this film to end her connection with him as with turning garbage. <br /> <br /> Not scary. Not tense Not funny. It makes no sense at all. And, as stated above, Sarah Michelle Gellar gives the only sensible representation from the entire composition.
