A lovely young cast is wasted in this empty, disgusting, manipulative film that tries to be a combination of both a cute comedy and insightful drama. The plot moves so slowly that 90 minutes seem endless, as the characters do nothing but jokes and emotions. The dialogue is filled with unnatural cliches and attempts at divination of pseudo-philosophy. <br /> <br /> In all likelihood, a swift and deep look at life and love, the film turns out to be just pretentious. The only real weight is the burden that talented actors have to carry as best they can. But do not be afraid - they are supported by the puppet strings of a contrived plot.
