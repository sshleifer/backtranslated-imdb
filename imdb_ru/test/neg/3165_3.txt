This love story between an American journalist and a Eurasian woman doctor does not contain much conflict, as she is largely westernized (she studied in London), and no fireworks, since she behaves rather restrained. The little that history can lift history is knocked down by their wooden dialogues. It is assumed that they are two cosmopolitan intellectuals, but they speak as if the words were embedded in their mouths by a Hollywood hack, which in itself is not so much. The film also suffers from an amazing lack of realism - a completely deserted beach in a crowded little Hong Kong, overrun by a million Chinese refugees? And, probably, an experienced American journalist at the age of 40 who doesnâ€™t know what hysterectomy is? Hollywood ideas. Finally a "song." After listening to him about twenty times during the entire film, starting with the credits, he unfortunately loses some of his emotional impact.
