Luchino Visconti was and remains one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation, but Adam Low (director of this thing) allows a stronger voice to be the voice of Helmut Berger! How can it be? What a missed opportunity! We came out of this ordeal, knowing less about what made Teacher great, and more about things that we shouldn't worry at all. Beautiful images belong to the Visconti world, awkward interviews with such as Berger and Zeffirelli to the tiny little world of Adam Low. Must be avoided!
