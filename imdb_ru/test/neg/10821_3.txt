I think most people would agree with me if I said that the movie “Alien” pretty much set the bar for the atmosphere. I have seen quite a few films similar to this bar, but none of them has ever surpassed the eerie tunnels and dark halls of the Alien. The Cave is a film that tries hard to reset the bar. I suppose that the trailer even mentioned something about being as scary as Alien, but never for the whole movie did I even feel the slightest fear or excitement. about negative skating, I could also explain why the main cave hook (atmosphere, if you didn't pay attention to it) failed my time. I will say right now that most of the sets were beautifully and beautifully lit, but what we hear and what we know there, as a rule, destroys what we see. Music for one is terrible. We either get banal rock music, or too exaggerated house music. Well, maybe it pushes a little, but I could not bear it. Many underwater scenes were bad enough (this is a well-known fact that underwater scenes are always boring to hell) I didn’t need to have rock music in my ears while they were just floating in a cave. This actually caused a lot of unintentional laughter, which was reinforced by the next wreck scene. <br /> <br /> In any case, as I mentioned, not only music killed the atmosphere, damn it, no. Creatures lurking in darkness must be terrifying. I have to be concerned that they will appear, and only a glimpse of them will make my blood run cold. The cave wisely takes a page from an alien reference book, not showing the whole creature for a very long time and resulting in a glimpse, but this simply does not work because the creatures are so lame. I think it would be rude to spoil the details, but mostly they are aliens with wings. <br /> <br /> I think you already understand the meaning. The atmosphere is ruined. Nevertheless, I know a lot of people who will still watch the film if it is exciting. I would like to say this about the Cave, but I would have lied. This film is not in a hurry to move on to action, and as soon as we get there, we are somehow surprised when the thing finally calls it in the afternoon. We used to see how this all improved, with the exception of a few elegant scenes (a guy pierced with stalactites, eel and rapids), so you really don't experience the thrill of watching people running from uninspired alien fakes in endless tunnels. <br /> <br /> Ah, but the pain does not end there. We must also take into account the characters and act. Well, I can not remember a single line of dialogue, except for "run!" and the only character name I can remember is Jack, but this is only because it is in almost every line near the end of the movie. Perhaps the actors were capable, but the script did not allow them to do anything but run and argue. They had almost no experience, and when someone died, they simply dismissed it. Very sad when you consider that CGI eel shows the best performance in the film. <br /> <br /> By the way, about CGI; There are many of them, most of which are terrible. I recommend using costumes (at least I think they were costumes), but nothing interferes with the environment, and as a result most of the effects look rather strange. <br /> <br /> So I think that to wrap it up, the Cave is bad and very little goes for it. If the film were a premiere film on the channel SciFi or was limited in the budget, I would love it a little more, but this film was theatrical. With a lot of wit and talent, this could be a frighteningly funny movie, but in its current form, the movie is as scary as entering the basement, and it is not very good. <br /> <br /> My review from Frieder Wave: http: //friderwaves.com/index.php?page=cave
