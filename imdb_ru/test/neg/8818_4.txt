I have to give this movie 4 because of a few things. <br /> <br /> 1. What I will call the “blunt victim syndrome”. If you have a killer on the floor and you have his gun, please shoot him. If you are a policeman, and your shotgun is aimed at the killer's back - shoot him, please. <br /> <br /> 2. When you are under a lot of stress and you have a finger on the trigger of a gun, your first instinct is to squeeze. This is one of the first things that you learn when training a pistol, and the reason why you don’t pull the trigger until you are ready to shoot - ask any hunter or infantryman. If you are electrocuted, your muscles should also contract - forcing you to squeeze your finger. <br /> <br /> 3. It is really difficult to lie on the floor completely motionless for 8 hours without two other people - one of them is a doctor - without noticing that you did not die. Especially, if you are presumably dying from a brain tumor and were in the hospital just a few months earlier. <br /> <br /> 4. Technically, the killer did kill one of his victims - the guy to whom he injected poison, which was supposed to get an antidote. If you poisoned someone, this is murder. <br /> <br /> 5. What lesson did Adam have to learn? Yes, the doctor should have been there, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I just missed something. <br /> <br /> In addition to these things, I would give this film a higher rating. The plot was pretty good, and the ways in which the killer decided to kill his victims were very creative. I can even forgive the horrible actions of the doctor - the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick. The cinematography and soundtrack were very good, but the final seemed far-fetched and just didn't work for me. Thank God, I did not have to pay to see this, otherwise I would have demanded a refund.
