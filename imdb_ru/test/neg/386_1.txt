I classify it as the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> If there ever was a film that I wished for my enemies, that would be so. The plot is ridiculous, there are only 2 characters in it, and the coincidences between these characters simply strain the faith. <br /> <br /> These factors together make this film extremely boring. <br /> <br /> My Wife and Mom went to the movies in about 15 minutes. I thought that this boring and slow movie * should * have some cool interesting plot twist, and was quite disappointed when nothing exciting happened. <br /> <br /> I briefly thought about sending the bill to the directors for my 2 hours of a lost life.
