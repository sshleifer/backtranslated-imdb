I would like to say something else about this movie. I have seen the comments on how beautiful Russia is, and the views from Russia were magnificent. Hey guys, this is not Russia, this is Bulgaria, the more specific capital of Sofia. So this is not Russia, this is my country. About the film - well, in Bulgaria, perhaps, with the exception of the "Gray Zone" - all the films of American directors in one word are terrible, as it is, of course. It's a shame that Patrick Swayze plays in such low-budget films. Most of the actors are Bulgarians, but in fact there is no plot twist in this film, no energy, what can I say - a weak and boring movie, a clich√©, nothing more. Hey, people remember that this is not Russia, in fact, this is Bulgaria.
