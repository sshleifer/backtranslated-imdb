Hulk Hogan acts as a champion wrestler (Real acting game ...) named Reap, who is forced to defend his honor, title and his girlfriend from the greedy corporation who wanted him to sign a contract with their network (because the fight sells! ) However, when Rip refuses, the network gets the ring fighting championship, which is called (and I’m absolutely serious) "Battle of the Tough Guys," the champion of Zeus (played by Tini Lister Jr.), possibly the most deadly person alive. Rip refuses to fight until his brother is attacked and placed in a hospital. "No Holds Barred" is almost what I expected from the production of Vince McMahon, in which the leading role was played by the least universal actor in the genre of action films (Hogan). Basically this is a lot of unintended humor, tons of clumsy episodes, a couple of good action films and tons of stupidity. In other words, this is not the same thing as a struggle in itself, so I give it a fair assessment, mainly because anyone who rents it knows what he gets. The film is cheap, but well made enough for what it is, and really fighting lovers will probably like it. I myself found it ultimately ridiculous. These are moments of such absurdity that you only chuckle at yourself. (For example, how Hogan jumps 20 feet in the air after being stuck in a limousine, how he makes a guy fool around, and, of course, how Hogan reads from his cue. (IE: “I'm not going to be around.” ). when this check is cleared! ") No Holds Barred is a lot of fun, really, though mostly because of how ridiculous it is. Lovers of the camp really like this clever clinker. <br /> <br /> * * of 4- (exhibition)
