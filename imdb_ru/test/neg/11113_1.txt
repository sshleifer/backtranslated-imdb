Just been on a sci-fi channel in the UK on July 5th, it was ****. Shame on JRD! Maybe he was bored one week! He can not be skint after LOTR. I suppose he was not to blame. Mr Sheppird was. I turned off after 50 minutes, could not bear it. The ship was bad and the creature looked like a big 5-foot bat. Who financed this project? I think all this should cost $ 250. Avoid at all costs, do not think about buying a DVD, if he releases one, I can not imagine that they will spend dollars on its production. Let's hope that someone will make a decent film Chupra and a decent film BIGFOOT. Sasquatch was fine, poor Lance. This is a shame a big studio and a direct one will not risk, more super heroes films, please!
