This is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen. The only positive thing I can say about this is, fortunately, I did not pay to see it. We were given a free presentation at school, and everyone in the audience was just embarrassed, wondering when the fun would begin. This piece of garbage is a poorly filmed, too long movie. The very idea of ​​making a movie took about 10 seconds. This film may be of interest only to those who have lost their jobs and want to know why. They may find some interviews interesting. Another editorial could have made an interesting documentary about this, but I doubt that the interviews shown were not exciting. In fact, this is just a tragedy, to contemplate and be a part. AVOID THIS FILM AT ANY COST!
