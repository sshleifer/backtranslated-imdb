Most of this movie was fine, to continue the sequel ... <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the amount of anticipation; I really expected it to be thrown out of the window in favor of blood, blood, blood. This is not true, but there are some pretty ridiculous deaths. <br /> <br /> However, I did not like all the complexities of the plot. It might be good if the writers took the time to explain all of them to the end. But what was the purpose of the secret society in a psychiatric hospital, in particular? Why were they protected from Michaelâ€™s damage until a certain point? What exactly are they going to do with the baby? How, by the way, did Jaime Lloyd get pregnant? Why lock her up for 20 years so she gets pregnant too? Why did Michael kill all his conspirators at the end? Why were the fruits in the lab? It seems that the actors "found out everything" as soon as they saw the germ. But it was never explained to the viewers. <br /> <br /> If you are just going to watch this movie to see how people have gone out, then it will be good for you .. However, if you cannot stand the plot thrown at you, which remains unsolved by that time when loans roll, you have to go see something else.
