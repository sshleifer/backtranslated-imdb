Thirty-five years after this, Castro still rules. Unfortunately, we were left to scratch our heads, wondering how the stupid maniac, played by scenery set mate Jack Palance, made it back in 1960. I stumbled upon this recently, and was surprised to see the incomparable Sid Haig and "B" Paul's Favorite Film (The Untouchables) Pickerney among the rebels. Fleisher was clearly far behind his heyday when he led this folly. Some of the lines are classic in “Did he really say that?” Another thing I just noticed is that the score and sound (NOT the dialogue) are really excellent - the only first-class elements of the entire production. So don't look at it to learn something about history or acting, but if you want to look at it stupidly, bring a beer and have some fun.
