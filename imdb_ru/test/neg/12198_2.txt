I saw Hurlyburly on Broadway and I really enjoyed it. I don't know what happened to the movie version, because it was awful. Perhaps some kind of dialogue that works on stage sounds just incoherently on the screen. Anyway, I could not wait for the end of this film. Acting universally from above. Only Kevin Spacey has it together, and he seems to know that he is in a bad movie and can't wait to get out.
