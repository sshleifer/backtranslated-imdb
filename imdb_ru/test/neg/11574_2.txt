“Scientists in a remote laboratory are experimenting (insert a scaly creature here) and create uncontrollable monsters. Meanwhile, a military team / daughters of a scientist / bank robbers will find their way to a remote place and they will be threatened by giant creatures. One after another they are eaten, and all this happens during the “exciting” race, in order not to be blown up by the forces that originally created the monsters ... ”It’s sad that it sounds like a dozen films appeared on Sci. -Fi channel. I'm just wondering what's going on? Of course ... I like that the bandits and imitators of Hollywood-Hunk are eaten by CGI creatures just like the next person ... but where is the plot or originality? Of course, there are times when the science fiction channel is shining. Battlestar Galactica, if a bit dark, can be very good. Script writers continue to fill life with various Stargate sentences, and the latest BBC import of Doctor Who is surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> Even in various films about “giant animals” on Sci-Fi animation it seems to get better all the time. Compare the Commodo in this film with the rather awkward version of the first film about the Commodo Giants on Sci-Fi. <br /> <br /> But oh my God ... how about another plot? Maybe some other giant? On a whim, I began to search the Internet. Among the litter, I found some interesting stories that might appeal to SF fans and non-working Russian CGI animators. I offer http://www.macrophile.com/~arilin/archive/metamorphosis-day network the opportunity to offer them to contact the author for the rights to the story. (History contains violent images, as a rule, along with images of various offers of the Sci-Fi channel). <br /> <br /> In the plot there is a plot, ethical and moral commentary about the nature of humanity, and it does not end on any of them. awful "they REALLY killed all the monsters ???" moments, but rather leaves you to guess completely and in a completely different way of thinking. <br /> <br /> What science fiction should do in general, no?
