Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress ... But this film was so terrible that I could not help laughing at the film in perplexity that I actually watched something so shitty. Ha ha. Audio editing is awful, theyâ€™re trying too hard to come up with creative camera angles. Because they are just weird and stupid. Scenario sucks. It was terrible to act, the storyline is not very good. Very unreal even for a movie. But this is a 20-year-old film ..... so I will give him a bonus for that. And yes, the music was terrible. But we all have to start somewhere. And sending these things is such a problem ... at least 10 lines ... disturb. Well, now I know why I could not find this film in the movie store ... I had to buy it offline to see it ... well, that was only $ 0.58 cents ... even though that the delivery was $ 2.59, Well, well .... I do not recommend anyone to spend their time and money on watching this movie ...
