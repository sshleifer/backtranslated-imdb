In 1965, I was 22 years old, when I was a hippie, I watched a play 5 times, had two versions of music and read the script many times. Maybe it's a separate thing, the film is fine, but like accepting a play, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> First, good. The songs are well sung, and the product quality is pretty good. The homosexual implications of the Black Boys, the White Boys are cute. The Claude / Berger switch was interesting. Hair is a liquid product, and its constant changes are inherent in the condition that their basic spirit is preserved. <br /> <br /> But the main spirit was greatly distorted. It seemed that all the producer wanted was to sing certain songs and fine-tune them to the storyline, regardless of what it did with the original plan of the play. <br /> <br /> Claude, Sheila and Hud were presented as selfish children who could care less about anyone outside their tribe. Claude destroyed Sheila's parent party (it's hard to believe that she smiled when her parents were injured), and repeatedly hijacked cars. Sheila stole soldier's clothes and car. She then left him in the middle of the desert, where he undoubtedly had a severe tan, probably would have been ravaged and could die on this lonely road in Nevada. Good fun. And Hud was pleased to break his son's heart, shouting at the former. This is not what hippies looked like, not what was described in the play, and this is exactly the opposite of the generation of love. <br /> <br /> I never saw a hippie asking for money. The point was to be self-sufficient outside the capitalist system, and not to ask for it. <br /> <br /> After Berger is jailed for destroying Sheila's party, and Claude offers to help someone out, Berger insists on being released on bail. without a better plan for saving the others who attack Sheila's parents and then attack his own mother. <br /> <br /> “Being in” has always been a very spiritual matter, but here it is wasted on stupid brides floating around. Even if it is part of his trip, she will spoil a beautiful song. I know that they oppose the "Floating in space" with the Army. But again, it completely destroys a beautiful song. <br /> <br /> While Sheila and Claude are thin, Berger steals their clothes, laughing, “it was funny,” even after he saw that both were very annoyed. Then, a little later, Berger does what no hippie did. He beats Claude. Awful. <br /> <br /> Then they have a great opportunity to sing “Starlight” at night in some beautiful SF-place where stars twinkle, possibly turning into an inventive duet. Instead, the whole tribe sings it under the scorching sun, rushing along the road in a gig (stolen, of course). <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with the 1979 film, and now I like it even less. I think it would be possible to make a fairly close acceptance of the show, but it is not.
