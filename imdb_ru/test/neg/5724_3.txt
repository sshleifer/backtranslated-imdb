... when dubbed to another language. Let's face it: neither Nielsen nor Schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialogue. And, given that they have to pronounce in the camp, this is a free situation. Any type of voice acting will definitely be an improvement (and this is true - at least in the German version). <br /> <br /> But this is only a minor moment. The game is bad. Accelerated combat sequences are pathetic. Nielsen could not use his sword to get out of the wet paper bag. This becomes painfully obvious compared to the smoothness of the movements that the child demonstrates (which, no doubt, had some training in the martial arts), and with the athleticism shown by Sandal Bergman. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger does his job with Conan - nothing new here. <br /> <br /> Some visual effects are good, I have to admit it. The dragon's skeletal bridge looks cool. But most often the gypsum is too obvious. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is not worth watching. Even "Conan the Destroyer" is better than this (albeit slightly). I would prefer to see Bergman as Red Sonya, as it should have been originally, but I doubt that this could save this film - oh well. <br /> <br /> 3/10
