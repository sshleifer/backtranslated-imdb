Mararia really disappointed me. I can not consider it a bad film, but the development of events seemed too hasty and unbelievable to cause any emotions. Dr. Fermin demonstrates unprecedented strange behavior due to passion, which makes it impossible to understand where it came from. I mean, how many times has he ever talked to Mararia? Maybe once? In addition, Mararia never looked like a real character, but rather as a stereotype of a movie that just had to be in the movie (... or did you need a different title?). Some of the best actors came from a role that is not very important for this story, because of the role of Marcial, a stupid, but humble drunkard. Of course, the scenery, cultural delicacies on the Canary Islands and other “wow” moments were interesting, but the film did not fit the documentary (in case it was his real intention), and, most importantly, a solid drama.
