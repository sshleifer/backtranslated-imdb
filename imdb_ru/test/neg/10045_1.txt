I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was terrible; it was pointless and just stupid. the alleged plot concerned a future groom, too busy with the problems of the world to relate to his bride and other people in his life. He disappears on his wedding day (no less in a tuxedo) and connects with a bunch of strange people. <br /> <br /> We saw this with a bus of people on the way to Atlantic City, and everyone agreed that it was a terrible movie. He tried to be deep, but he was not; it was stupid and insulting. If I had not been on the bus, I would have gone to the movies. Anyone who wants to watch a movie, rent or buy a video has been warned.
