When you read the commentary on this film, this clever and funny political comedy based on real events - the only true word here is comedy. If you are told that this is an insider film about Russian politics, this is not so. Probably, in the film only 2% of what really happened in Russia during this election campaign. In fact, in 1996 it was interesting to observe the situation a thousand times, and it was a real election campaign. Well, there were PR advisors from the United States who worked at Yeltsin’s headquarters, but their role was minimal. The whole campaign was completely different from the one shown in the film, it would be much funnier to show all the people of the president traveling across the country with paper boxes of cash and celebrities who show shows in support of Yeltsin everywhere — at least that would be true. I give these three only because of the respect for Jeff Goldblum, Anthony LaPaglia and Lie Schreiber. And about the machine guns on the streets of Moscow. I lived in the place where in the mid-90s was the highest level of serious crimes in Russia, and I never saw a man with a gun on the street.
