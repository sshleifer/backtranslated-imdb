What a waste of energy and money. What a waste of talent. <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez was completely wasted and was mostly not used everywhere. John Lovitz was very funny, but meaningless. Harry Dean Stanton - why? And whether it was just me, or Kari Urer can hardly play it. <br /> <br /> The story was rather non-existent and truly disconnected. One of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events. How are the surf "guys" giving up their lives every time they are threatened in the last half? How about the fact that you have never seen them surfing once !! Preparing for some scenes took a lot of time with insufficient feedback to give a damn. Nothing in this “film” seemed truly true or authentic. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say is that some (very small) decorations were beautifully shot, and some scenes were a bit interesting. I don’t see this when there are so many best pointless films.
