I did it through half of it, but I didnâ€™t have enough of a masochist to see it all. The first half of the film was almost without dialogue! Almost everything was offscreen commentary to carry the story. The writer forgot that sometimes less, more, and tried to explain several thousand years of detailed history in his voice. However, he forgot to do any character development. Most science fiction fans don't need a huge amount of character development, but it would be nice to know why the two main characters, who survived the destruction of the space fleet together, ended up fighting with each other. <br /> <br /> Good things happen in the movie. The soundtrack was well done. Some of the computer graphics are very good, but others were just mediocre.
