I wouldn't give too much film to tell you that there are many, many, many MANY scenes of Lucas (the young main character) walking and looking at things! Yeah. And you will be pleased to know that the first third of the film is meaningless, meaningless and largely ignored for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> In this film there are boring people who do stupid things and the most boring of them is young Lukas, who is blind and needs surgery. You see, he has delusions, terrible delusions! He thinks the killer is hunting blind women! He walks a lot and behaves like an intolerable jerk! <br /> <br /> Patience does not pay off this movie. In the end, the plot and events become as confusing and lethargic, and it is very difficult to care one way or another about what any of the nightmarish images meant. Nothing clears up, the film moves at the speed of a snail, and he left me with the same effects of a hangover. <br /> <br /> Judging by “Afraid of the Dark”, the British do not make stupid thrillers like the Americans do; they make boring.
