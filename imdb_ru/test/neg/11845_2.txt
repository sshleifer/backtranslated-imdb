The biggest and most unpleasant thing in the movie “Raptor” ended up because the tyrannosaur is identical to Carnosaurus, except that the child in the loader was a little better acting, and the action was an adult. Similarity to the films of Carnosaur was a rather unfortunate choice in the storyline. The only thing that went well was the start with the kids in the jeep. Then the plot went down the hill from there. It would be nice if another story was invented, and not to clone earlier films. The film "Raptor" was supposed to draw lessons from the series "Jurassic Park" on different subjects. The only film that very recently approached a good movie about dinosaurs is Aztec Rex. Repetitive scenes, as if taken from Carnosaur films, make people think about these films.
