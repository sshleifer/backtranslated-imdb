Usually I do not like films of Chuck Norris. I appreciate his work as a martial arts master, and his fighting scenes are usually pretty well set. Chuck is undoubtedly one of the great martial arts. So, in my local second-hand bookshop, I found a film that I hadn’t seen before, and took it home. <br /> <br /> Although the game in this film was worse than in most of the films of Chuch Norris, I was hoping to watch at least one battle scene. I quickly began to realize that it was not a typical Chucha Norris film; rather, it was a Christian film designed to illustrate the paradigm of "good will win." <br /> <br /> There is nothing on the packaging to indicate that this is a Christian film, with the exception of the label. .. Goodtimes Entertainment, which I had never heard of before. I will surely consider this next time I see the film of this company. <br /> <br /> I have no problems with Christianity ... I really have a problem with vile proselytism. If someone is going to make a religious film, at least have a common sense to tell the viewer that this is exactly what he will receive. The only redemptive part of the exercise is that I spent only $ 3.25 to spend 97 minutes to see how the great martial artist does not fight. At least it was during dinner, and I spent some of that meal cooking. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are looking for a mediocre martial arts film and do not expect much, don’t bother with this film because it doesn’t even offer this.
