Australian Shakespeare for 18-24 sets. With blood, blood and more blood. And a good dose of nudity. it will not be for everyone on the May levels, for the violent for some too cheap for the majority. made on a low budget, they try and do there the best, but it only works from time to time. and this macbeth just seems to be lacking, its just not convincing although most good actors play it in the head, especially in mekbets. the best performance came from Gary Sweet and the strangest Mickey Molly. if you are in love with Shakespeare, then take a look, but if you like mature cheese, you will like it. This is not a bad movie, but not very good. Sam Peckenpach would love it, that is, if it were shot as a western. I expected a lot from this since I loved the sliders. but it was an empty effort.
