After the book, I felt very sad when I watched the movie. I agree that sometimes the film should be different from the original novel, but in this case it was more than acceptable. Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) why ranks are different (for example, Lieutenant Distel instead of sergeant, etc.) <br /> <br /> 2) the last screen is very bad and makes Distel as a soldier feeds itself and wants to die. But this is not 100% true. Just read the book. He was a bull in the last seconds. He did not want to die, breaking his gun and going simply towards Michael and Noah. <br /> <br /> So this is some kind of happy ending that is not at all suitable for this film.
