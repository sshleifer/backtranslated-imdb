I liked Milos Forman’s films since I watched “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” and “Amadeus” (two great masterpieces), but when I saw Hair, I kept wondering if it was the same Milos Forman. This film is boring and uninteresting, if not more. Well, the music is pretty good, but on the screen it just looks like a group of addicts dancing around (wait a minute ... that's what it really is!). In fact, the only interesting part and the only part where Milos’s talent manifests itself is the last 15 minutes or so (SPOILER !!) since Berger took Claude’s place as a soldier set up for the Vietnam War. These 15 minutes are touching and well directed, but it’s a shame that we have to endure so much terrible stuff before that. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe this is one of those films that you need to be on the theme “enjoy” (the theme of marijuana, acid and other drugs that glorifies the film). I don’t, so .. .
