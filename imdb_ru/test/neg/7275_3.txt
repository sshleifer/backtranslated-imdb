Scrolling through the TV and seeing that the "Secret Life" has begun; gave George Durant a chance to be the master. I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that no one could be the same as him, but George was rather boring. Looks like he really didn't want to receive guests; his voice-over was monotonous, not contacted by guests. It seemed that he interviewed the guests for Unwrapped, and he just ended up in the frame. I do not know if George will become “better” in this show, I doubt it, because he now had his own show. The show seemed to collect more information, but only because we saw less host. The formula of this show was very delicate, and I am afraid that it was destroyed forever.
