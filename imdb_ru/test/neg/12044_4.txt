It is unlikely that anyone other than those who adore silent films will appreciate the lyrical camera work and the busy (but prickly) background score that accompanies this 1933 release. Although in 1928 the sound became widely used, it tells no more than fifty words about an unhappy woman who, after a romantic break in the forest, throws her husband for the sake of a young man. <br /> <br /> The brightest scene photographed is a jealous husband who throws a young man on a trip to the city and continues to drive normally until he realizes that this man is his wife's lover. In a frenzy of jealousy, he rides at top speed to the railway crossing, but at the last moment he changes his mind, losing composure. This is probably the most intense scene in history, which is clearly slow and obviously far-fetched. <br /> <br /> Hedy Lamarr paid special attention from Marlene Dietrich to the pioneer, but her beauty has not been finalized by her cosmetologists, as she was taken to Hollywood. Her performance is to look sad and sullen while she mourns the loss of her marriage with short glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love (ARIBERT MOG), a beautiful young stallion who picks up her clothes after nude swimming. <Br /> <br /> The swimming scene is very short, photographed carefully and not worth the heat that it obviously generated. Later, the love scene is also artfully photographed with a lyrical photograph that is evident throughout most of the film - artfully so. There is more to imagination using symbolism - and this is what others proclaim that the film is a kind of lyrical masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Not so. It is disappointing, primitively rude in its sound parts (including laborious symphonic music in the background), and, of course, Miss Lamarr was lucky that Louis B. Meyer watched the film and based on it made her career in Hollywood. He must have seen something in her work, which I did not see. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this was intended to be a silent movie with a camera that does all the work. The harsh “working” scene in prison lasts too long and represents a sharp invasion in which nothing is needed. Can't finish the movie on the right note.
