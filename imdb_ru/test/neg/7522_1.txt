After reading the novel, which reads about an hour, watching this movie was a sad, disappointing experience. Just as he did in the Egyptian prince Simone Wells, somehow he managed to send a script that removed all the drama and mystery from the source material and turned it into this homogenized nonsense. Now I am a lover of cheese and camp, but this film makes absolutely no sense. There was no joy in any of the speeches, nor in any humor. There was no thrill, and this stupid deception with the character of Eddie, when Philby threw his hat into the air, was the last straw of the hacker inscription. I felt very offended when this film ended, and I still refuse to believe that only 90 minutes had passed and it went on forever. I thought how the studio and the director could have made OK such a lousy script, but then my friend presented the film to me exactly as it was, and I said, â€œOh, that sounds great, but what happened to the film.
