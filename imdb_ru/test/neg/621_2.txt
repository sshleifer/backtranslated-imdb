Making a film based on a true story, especially one as incredible and terrifying as the crash of the Andes plane in 1972, is difficult even for the best filmmakers. But the Mexicans behind this frivolous and cheap film about exploitation do not even try! The actual names of both the survivors and the victims of the air crash of the Uruguayan Air Force ALL have been changed, the catastrophe itself is obviously very dramatized, and the aspect of cannibalism is unnecessarily and terribly played up. Shockingly, he made a lot of money on both sides of the border. Fortunately, I thought, this, fortunately, is forgotten. But the same people behind this, will later give us an equally disgusting GIANA: CULT OF FEATURES! <br /> <br /> This cheap flick of horror demanded making ALIVE fifteen years later. This film was a masterpiece. SURVIVE! To put it mildly, no.
