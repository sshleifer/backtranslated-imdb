A terrible essay, very contrived, from a "virtue" who knows absolutely nothing about race relations in Los Angeles or the USA these days. Stunning positive reviews are a mystery to me, but they can be provided only by those who believe that someone's “good” intentions should be welcomed, no matter how superficial, simple and absolutely unreal results. If you want to watch a film that realistically addresses issues of the modern race LA - the film that you need to watch (and probably already saw) is “Pulp Fiction.” In any two minutes of this film, there is more honesty and realism regarding the race than in the full 4 hours (oh, sorry, it seemed to me that only 4 hours) of this bastard. <br /> <br /> If someone needs proof that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, then this film is for you.
