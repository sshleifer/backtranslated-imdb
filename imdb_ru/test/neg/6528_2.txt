.... and now I am before episode No. 7. I really hoped that it would end already (not to mention cancellation, as soon as everything related to the show, including the actors, would be dumped along with toxic waste somewhere in the middle of the ocean , and they will never see him again) because this series is really terrible. <br /> <br /> Placing this program in the comedy genre is misleading at best! It is so hard to believe that Ben Elton could write something so bad, perhaps it indicates a great contribution from other authors in everything he was associated with before. In some episodes, I didn’t even laugh once! <br /> <br /> Oh, and I can't believe that Ardal O'Hanlon actually stopped doing “My Hero” and started doing this instead, his decision making skills were obviously that day — maybe he was just does not know how to read and does not understand how scarce the scripts of the "Blessed" were. Don't get me wrong, “My hero” is not a masterpiece, but a million times better than this garbage. <br /> <br /> And even more annoying me, I bet that this DVD release will come out as well, when there are so many great TV shows' that are not released!
