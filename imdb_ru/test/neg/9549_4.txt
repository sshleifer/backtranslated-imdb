The storyline has too many flaws and illogical sequences to make sense. Jolie's play is pretty flat and bad, Washington is fine, the rest of the actors are cardboard clippings. Somehow, almost everything in this film oozes mediocrity. The plot is lame. The only thing that I liked about this film more or less was the rather original methods that the criminal uses to end the victims. Technical details are worse than the most common “knowledge” and CSI gizmos, and halfway through the film, the question arises whether the director did not care about the accuracy of the details. (Some spoilers here and hereafter!) I mean an electrocardiograph with a pure sinusoidal wave, reflecting a person's heartbeat, quadriplegia with muscle spasms of the whole body and one index finger. The murderer gutted the human guts, while at the same time keeping him alive, to allow the rats to feast on them, and then a rat tending to the guy's face! What with all this nonsense? Then there are quite a few stupid things, but you can find them elsewhere on IMDb. To be honest, I found this a bit insulting even for my limited intelligence. <br /> <br /> Loss of time. Another 4 out of 10 so my girlfriend wouldn't kick me.
