Predictable, cliché, unbelievable, boring ... what else can I say? This is only the caliber of the cast, which retains any redeeming qualities of this bloated mess. Oh, yes, and antics from the entertainment end zone. <br /> <br /> But wait 11 hours, because the result is as predictable as the one who is going to win the match Globetrotters / Washington Generals. <Br /> <br /> I was in the second act, before I realized that this should be the PRO teams we were watching (all in vintage Padres brown). And the imitation of Cameron Diaz’s character in the young Georgia Frontiere was ill-conceived on the page. (Not your fault, Cameron. Do you want to go out for dinner?) That's enough - I just ranted it out because I was looking forward to this movie. Rent a LONG GARDEN instead. <br /> <br />
