It was a very good concert of a single MJ. The choreography was excellent and the costumes decent. The vocals were fine. I have to admit that his vocals were crap in Human Nature and Billie Jean. You could not hear it half the time. Other songs make up for singing. Highlights of the show: Jam Smooth Criminal, I just can't stop loving you. She came out of my life. Thriller Billie Jean (Dancing, not singing) Black or White Man in the mirror The concert was almost perfect. If it were someone other than Mj, it would be 9. This needs to be seen. I would like to be born then so that I could get a ticket for the best concert of 1992.
