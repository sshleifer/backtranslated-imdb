This is the worst war movie I've ever seen, perhaps the worst I've ever made. I find it incredible that some people actually rated him as 10. He has a terrific lack of even elementary traces of realism. Almost every clich√© of a war movie appears in this film and is done poorly. On the other hand, I would not have watched it to the end, if he had not been so surprisingly bad that it amused me.
