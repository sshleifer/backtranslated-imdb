I bought a DVD collection (9 films for 10 euros) where this one was included. It turned out to be the “uncut version”, whatever that means. In addition to the low average quality and short scenes, there was one strange thing - the scene of soft sex. It began with a close up of 2 large breasts. After about 2 minutes, I had an expression on my face that corresponded to the term "boooooooooooooring!" quite well 7.5 minutes without even bouncing, like boobs that look like concrete (at the moment the term “chest” is a bad choice) is far from entertaining. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie was more like “people are not / stupid, are they? "<br /> <br /> Fortunately, the DVD was scratched and I got my money back.
