It was one of Christieâ€™s latest stories. Throughout her long career, she has been interested in the volatile narrative and concept of conflicting agents. In essence, this is the same thing, and it all comes down to questions about who controls and creates the situation. <br /> <br /> In detective literature, the game is a matter of contradictory realities. The killer intends to change reality, to deceive the detective, the writer intends to do the same with the reader. Both the reader and the detective are in identical battles for what they see. That is why her stories often include a writer. <br /> <br /> In her work, she explores every combination of tricks she can come up with to cope with this. Along the way, we often have bodies that are not what they appear to be, and times, and supposed victims and the like. But the real magic of books is the concept of control. At Bertram, it was literally a building. <br /> <br /> The dead here. Well, sometimes it happens, but not like this. As if the writer was the famous Mr. Rafiel. This is especially pleasant for Marple's readers, who remember this character from Caribbean Mystery, which her nephew also created in some way. In this story, Rafiel was the donor of this story to the authorities. <br /> <br /> The producers of this series made an almost foolish commitment to use different creative teams for each of them. Sometimes it produces soft work. The Bertram episode was pretty brilliantly posed. This is the most generous of all, and he has an active camera. But, unlike the work of Bertram, it has nothing to do with history. <br /> <br /> The camera moves and shoots just because it can. Quote "Citizen Kane" in the beginning was too literal and stupid. This story is good, but the adapter took out some pretty important things, and this inappropriate camera is annoying. <br /> <br /> Ted's score - 2 out of 3: has some interesting elements
