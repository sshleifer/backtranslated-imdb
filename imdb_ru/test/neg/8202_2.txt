The non-epic picture of Roger Corman in 1957, in which different characters find themselves in a valley covered with lead (sic), just as a thermo-nuclear feature is removed. This is the end of the world. Four men with guns, two women (one unmarried virgin, the other - a show from Las Vegas that drinks and smokes - guess who will get to the end of the movie?) Time passes, tension develops (or is supposed). Something in the forest is eating radioactive rabbits. Mutant Monster! Seven weeks of radioactive dust fulfilled "a million years of evolution" (on an already living person), the result was a ridiculously bad rubber monster on his back, who is strangely afraid of his only source of fresh water. It's raining. Monster dissolves. The remaining two characters, Hank and the Virgin. intended to colonize the world, because the heading "Start" fills the screen after it turns out that a short-term rainstorm washed away all the radioactivity and dismissed all the monsters running around "there". <br /> <br /> The only thing that deserves special attention is the incredible number of “curtains” that occur in it. One of the main elements of creating a bad and budget film of that time was the excessive use of curtains in the scenery. It was cheap. Finished with one setting? Pull the curtain over yourself, throw another piece of furniture in front of it, and within a few minutes you will find yourself in another place without moving the camera or changing the lighting. <br /> <br /> “Curtain Play” is the skill the actor gets to comment on what happens outside of any building in which he finds himself (“It’s like rain” or “Here they are, now, and it looks like they have a sheriff with them! ”, that such things). He will do this by standing on one side of the window - stretching all over his body and lifting the curtain from the window, but along the axis of the shot - that is, towards the camera - thus allowing him to pretend that he looks and tells us what happens behind the scenes, not letting viewers see him looking at the studio wall three inches from his nose for some cheap velvet curtains. There was a lot of stuff in this movie.
