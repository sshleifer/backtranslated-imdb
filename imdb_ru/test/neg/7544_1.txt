Yes, it must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. It is completely tasteless, it has no style, the story is so thin that you can watch TV through it, and there are so many holes in the whole film that you can break through an oil tanker. <br /> <br /> Of course, I appreciate a good B-movie as well as most white men homo sapiens. But this must be the worst I've seen. In fact, it is so B that it lacks everything that makes a B-movie interesting. <br /> <br /> The entire movie is based on such charming artifacts as characters, shit, various bodily functions and a complete lack of common sense on the screen. <br /> <br /> This is not even funny. In fact, everything is just the opposite. I was sometimes bored because of extreme predictability. <br /> <br /> I do not find anything good in this film. Watching this was a waste of time, and I hope others do not make the same mistake. If you also pay for it, you must do a serious brainstorming analysis.
