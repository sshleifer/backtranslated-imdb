I went to this film with some trepidation; the original is a masterpiece of both writing and acting, and, unfortunately, my fears were justified. This is a job without humor, and I sat in the theater, waiting for the beginning of wit and humor - it seems I am still waiting. Upgrading the plot to date has simply not worked, and changing the characters is an absolute parody - why they presented the character Bette Midler when she disappeared just as quickly as she arrived; the corresponding character in the original 1939 was an integral part of the plot. The women in the cinema laughed a few times, but nothing hurt me that I was funny, except that Meg Ryan told her mother about her situation and said that "it doesn't look like a 1930s film" - to me It is unfortunate that I was not viewing the version of the 30s. It was too touchy, “the sisters are holding together,” and I really needed some wit and intelligent dialogue from the original play — I still watch the original film and pick up a line that I had never noticed before. It makes no sense to close this new version, and although the film of 1939 is politically incorrect by today's standards, each thread was connected, and when the film ended, it was very strong. This remake should be marked with a warning for all viewers - if you know the original, do not worry: I felt deceived, having lost part of my life in the cinema, watching this immemorial piece of fluff. Bring Jungle Red !!
