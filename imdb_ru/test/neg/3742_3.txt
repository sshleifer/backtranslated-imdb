There were some funny parts in this movie, but for the most part I wanted to go ahead and change the DVD and watch the Malibu, which I had in my own collection instead. At the very least, I would know that something funny happened, and would give me something to look forward to. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed in this very low-budget film. And I do not judge the film on his budget. He simply lacked originality and was too predictable. I would not shoot or even watch this film again, and I am usually a recurring criminal. The actors were forgotten. The story was half thought out, and I had an insatiable desire to laugh. I ended up watching Jamie Kennedy's "Gangsta" White Boy to scratch the comedy itch.
