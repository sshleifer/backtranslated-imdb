Hi people, <br /> <br /> I can't believe that "Shades" from the movie What you do has taken on this role. I don't think Corey Feldman would take this role. This film was a steaming pile of dung. Save your money and time, and look at each of the best 250. I swear, I wanted to slap a lady in Blockbuster for letting me rent it. Stay away !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Mr Hipp
