Perhaps this is the worst remake Hollywood ever produced, and that says something. I will take it further and say that this film is so awesome, insanely bad that IT SHOULD BE SEEN. I don’t know if I’m not able to cope with all this, for example, the fact that the casting director pulled names out of his hat, or Richard Gere’s breathtaking character, who is allowed to leave with impunity at the end (I’m sure that : “It's just an invention, who cares,” would have no problem if it were a former al-Qaida employee who just wants to return home) - so I just devote my review of total gaiety, which basically represents is the scene where Bruce Willis tests his weapon. <br /> <br /> In the original version, you remember the jackal practicing its pumpkin killing. A pumpkin explodes on impact, an effect known as "understatement." In this version, Willis sets the target for the pumpkin, but he does not use a sniper rifle - he uses a giant remote-controlled gun, which costs tens of thousands of dollars and can only be stored in the back of a huge conspicuous minivan. (this man loves the challenge). He opens the cannon, removing the tarpaulin, and at this moment Jack Black, who is there to watch, jumps around and says: “Here are the rocks! This thing is swinging! ”About 18 times (I think Willis didn’t have to disassemble it first, he just picked it up, tarp and everything else from the back of the van, despite the fact that he probably weighed several tons). Then the scene turns into an Austin Powers film, in which Willis misses a pumpkin and takes out a tree, then Black runs through the mud with falling pants, eventually blowing off Black’s entire hand. Pumpkin falls to the ground unscathed. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend this film for ONE non-ironic reason, then this is for the character of Diana Venora as a tough Russian major who becomes romantically associated with Gear, despite the fact that he has a facial deformity - a bold move for the hollywood feature. By the middle of the movie I really liked this character, so it was a pity when she had to be killed. I would like to see a movie about her. Apart from this, this pile of crap is only useful as an objective test of intelligence. 3/10.
