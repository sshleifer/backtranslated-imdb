some argue that this is better, mainly because of the game; but it is indeed much worse for reasons that outweigh the improvement. <br /> <br /> the source from which all problems flow; story. besides the fact that one of them is shot at point-blank range from a gun to the chest and survives for hours without medical assistance, there is an even greater problem. Nick, a gangsta with a heart of gold is ready to do everything for a friend whom he just met that day; and this includes turning an evil spirit for help. Se-Se, who appears from nowhere with the past in voodoo, is ready to call Kiljoya while Nick can "pick her up." the action, although improved, is still terrible. these people could not convey emotions from a paper bag. the script does not help them either. stupid lines, and I can only take direction from the director. this script was read as Shakespeare in high school when the teacher hits them as they go. <br /> <br /> Although this film (if you can call it that at the 80-minute run (fortunately)) is perhaps even funnier than the first one because of all these things, it is definitely more painful to watch. 1/10
