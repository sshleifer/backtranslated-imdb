This film was the main bait and switch. I rented it because of Rebecca St. James, a popular Christian singer. I met her and wondered what she would do in a UFO film. Well ....... <br /> <br /> I think she starred in this film to help a friend or friend of a friend. My first clue that this film was not what it was supposed to be was when I witnessed the special effects of the UFO encounters. Cheese! As the movie progressed, I noticed how plastic the actors were. It was funny that almost everyone in the film wore solid colors. (There are a few exceptions). <br /> <br /> Rebecca was very disappointing. She is always in the house and does not show realistic facial expressions of the one whose husband has returned to the herd. She never leaves the house? <br /> <br /> I had to turn off the movie several times to finish it. I hope that Rebecca does not believe the message of this film - believe in what we believe or suffer in, and go to hell. Jesus spread the message of love and hope. His message inspired others to change their love, not fear.
