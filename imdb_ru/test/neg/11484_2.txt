When I first saw the trailer for this film, I really wanted to see it. I thought some of the director’s other works were pretty good, but I must say that I was disappointed. The plot involves a young woman who lives with the widowed father and his two sons. They move to a well-guarded community, but this is not what it seems; a kind of twin peaks. A woman begins to see or not to see people's things. During the first video I had a hypothesis, and I thought: “This cannot be the whole reason?” Well, the end was over, or better DOWN, and gave us what I felt was a really weak final act. Sound mixing and quality is excellent. Saw it in the THX certified theater, and was impressed ... with audio and audio only. There is no substance in the picture.
