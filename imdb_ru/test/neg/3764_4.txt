Wow, that was a real bastard. This early science fiction film has nothing to do with net camp. There is so much scientific mambo-jumbo in the dialogue that it is ridiculous. The female character, played by Osa Massen, is just a plot device for male characters to serve sexist remarks throughout the film. Look at this with your girlfriend, and I guarantee that it will make her bleed. The only thing that is good is the musical score, which skillfully creates the mood of the film. The special effects are pretty rough, but not bad, considering the vintage of the film. With some good B-stars starring, acting is not so bad. But the lines that were given to them should have challenged them. The task is not to laugh at your head.
