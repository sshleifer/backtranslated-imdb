Please see some films of Yugoslav authors (Emir Kusturica, Lyubisa Samardzic, ... for example, Bure Barut (A Barrel of Powder), Tito and I (Tito and I), Lepa of the Village of Lepo Gore (Beautiful villages burn beautiful), etc It's just a real way to learn about the so-called Bosnian problem. Hollywood is definitely not the right address to make films about the Balkan Peninsula, maybe Vietnam, World War II ... but not Slavs living in the former Yugoslavia.
