The way this character has ever been hired by mail is far from me. Verification, which is held by postal workers, is very difficult. It is impossible for such a stupid guy to work in the mail. Everything in this film is just stupid, and this is probably the point of the film. How they could live their whole life and not see the elevator is also puzzling. I didn't take this film too seriously, but he was so stupid. Then he tries to start the car without keys? A lot of horrible scenes and terrible games, and this film is not funny at all. It's just a sad, dumb mess. I liked mom's dress. <br /> <br /> Send it back to the sender as soon as possible.
