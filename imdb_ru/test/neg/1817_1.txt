I felt that last night the episode was slow and at times boring. Honestly, I do not think it is related to writing. Because I know that the story was well set and tried to keep things in place. I thought it was not so bad, but overall I did not like it. Most of all the director of this episode Stephen Williams is guilty of it. I have always hated the leadership of Stephen Williams. If Jack Bender had continued this episode since the season premiere, he would have kept him at a good pace and would keep everything afloat so that everything would be interesting. I'm glad that Jack Bender runs the episode next week, and it will be much better, and I'm glad that he got the first episode of Syaid for the director, and I wonder what he will accomplish this time, since Stephen Williams shot too much Syaid episodes before. <br /> <br /> I always think that Stephen Williams should be excluded from the show. He doesn't even do anything interesting with the show. <br /> <br /> Why is the discovery to be made with a goal, while in a helicopter? THIS was so boring! Bad camera perspective too!
