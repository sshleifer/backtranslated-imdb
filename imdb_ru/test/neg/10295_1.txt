The executive producer of the film is none other than that peace envoy through transcendental meditation, David Lynch, the father of the director. I wonder what the guru of David, His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, would think about this performance. Hypocrisy is as disgusting here as the film itself. It is safe to say that Samuel L. Diteman, the serial killer of Phoenix and an adherent of entertaining violence, would have liked his every minute. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many will blame this film for its cinematic prowess; at this level it is pretty good. But from a moral point of view, this is the most depressing film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WILL BE <br /> <br /> I think this thing makes me sad. The morally numb generation of Xers studies craft and a bit of postmodern aesthetic theory in an art school or film school, and then enjoys the arts and entertainment industry; and here's the result: a film that is buried in human suffering, injustice and bloodshed, most of which is watched by a nine-year-old girl who sees her entire family brutally murdered by a couple of murderers because of the violence during the holidays sunset. <br /> <br /> MORE SPOILERS DO NOT COME <br /> <br /> Who are these films made for? In fact, sadists adore it - why not? Who else? As I noted above, there are some really good films here, but good craft can be applied to any subject. Why apply this to such things? In addition, the film is very tense, but this is not due to the clarity and brutality of the violence; it is annoying because it is well directed and works well. I’m sure that the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock could explain this much better than me. <br /> <br /> So what did we get here? And above all, why? <br /> <br /> Yes, our world can be ugly, dirty, and even evil, but shouldn't we have to disagree when the “artist” does this with his work in order to rub our faces in him? Or, even worse, hang it on the faces of those nine-year-olds who, one way or another, will eventually see it on their home DVD? <br /> <br /> I hope that people will make sure that this film is not seen by their children. Yes, I know - dream, Bernon ...
