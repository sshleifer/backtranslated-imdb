I don’t know how this DVD got into my collection - my wife suggested that it was one of these “3 for £ 20” deals in a main street store. This thing is not worth 66 pence, not to mention 6.66 pounds sterling! Having invested considerable funds in it, I felt obliged to watch it to the end, just to make sure that it was equally bad all along - and that was it. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was terrible, the story line was impenetrable (I still do not understand what the hell was happening, despite the fact that I read the summary), the camera work was fragmented and hopeless, the action was wooden (did not help the dialogue). <br /> <br /> In fact, there were no redemptive functions — no, not even the beautiful Sandra Bullock, on whose brilliant subsequent career this pile of slag probably was sold. She must force her agent to buy all rights to her, and then bury her as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> As a last funny example of the director’s incompetence, there was a scene in which a young manager talks with his father. former army assistant driving. It was the clearest dialogue in the film - no engine noise! I look forward to when engine damping technology will eventually make its way through the pond into British cars!
