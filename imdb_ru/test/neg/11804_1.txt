Characters are annoying, immature and flaky ... Madison is the most annoying of all. Oooh ... cool place! Such a terrible threat! Any ghost in this house would run away in self defense! In short, this film is boring. Seeing a chair flying around a room can be creepy, but it's as intriguing as possible. I watched it once, and when one of my children wanted to watch it again, I had a desire to take a baseball bat on TV, and not to watch this garbage again. If you want a good horror movie or even a decent comedy, it's not like that! The only good part of all of this was the roach scene, and by the end of the movie, you ended up regretting the roach!
