this film is rubbish because for many reasons it is based on the book by Mark Furman, which is also rubbish. Let me say that Mark Furhman - a racist pig who is just looking for another way to get the spotlight - and others who are entitled to this type of garbage are in prison. The film itself, based on the book, was also terrible. The only reason this murder case became such a big book and movie was because this guy, due to his marriage with his aunt, is connected to the Kennedy family, and itâ€™s funny that people still think that this family is somehow able to create and cover up the Killings - it's just a family, and the average America must overcome obsession. this poor guy and his family were persecuted by the police for many years, they could not get a baby, so they followed Michel. It is surprising that he went to prison with all the evidence confirming that he did not do it, except for the fact that the statute of limitations, among other things, should have kept this court from returning twenty years later for loving the case. God, don't watch this trash
