ANY GUN CAN PLAY (2 out of 5 stars) Completely ordinary “spaghetti western” with the guy who played “Kookie” on the 77 Sunset Strip. The plot is some kind of convoluted nonsense about some stolen gold coins and various action films of dubious motivation trying to track them down. This is one of those "carefree" westerns ... which means a lot of time-consuming "comedy" attempts ... and really awful music during most action sequences (you can say that this is not the work of Ennio Morricone). George Hilton plays a bounty hunter named "Stranger" ... but he does not leave much impression ... he simply does not have the style of Clint Eastwood or Franco Nero, who can do a lot with a rarely written character. The ending is complete respect / parody of the ending “Good, bad and ugly” ... although it is hardly fun enough to be considered a “travesty”. The highlight of the film is the first 5 minutes ... in which the actors are modeled on Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and someone else (should it be Eli Wallach? Franco Nero? Not very clear ...) who a stranger faces. This is a fun joke for fans of Sergio Leone fans and lovers of spaghetti westerns ... but I think no one else will see the point.
