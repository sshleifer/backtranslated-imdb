Although I am not a big fan of the Coen brothers, I am a fan of their dark humor films such as Fargo and Miller's Crossroads. I was much less impressed by their other comic way, stupid camp (or is it Goofy Camp?) Unfortunately, 'O Brother, Where are You?' falls into the latter category and is not even as good as the “Big Lebowski” or the “Hadsaker Proxy”. <br /> <br /> “O Brother” is, in fact, an episodic series of jokes without much meaning, and there is not that much humor or cunning. As most reviewers point out, the plot of the film is very poorly presented. and, as far as I can tell, completely arbitrary ?? based on Odyssey. His main character, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), is an “adventurer”, like his namesake Homer, and his “real” goal is to return home to prevent his wife Penny from marrying his fiancé. Of course, we do not find out that this is what Clooney / Ulysses really wants until we stop caring. And what does Homer have to do with the Cool Hand Luke chain gangs, the Ku Klux Klan meets Indiana Jones cult meetings, an unaccompanied advocate vocabulary, a talent for singing country music in blue grass, an association with Baby Face Nelson, a double hairstyle Clark Gable and other random and different traits and encounters? I leave it to the discretion of others. <br /> <br /> The hint of Preston Sturges' Sullivan Travels in the title “O Brother” is equally meaningless. Yes, viewers familiar with Sturges' little comic classic comedy may be a little pleased to know the name of the socially-conscious film “Depression,” which Sullivan throws to Hollywood and hopes to make a comedy. And they may even be slightly surprised by a pair of riffs shot on the stage / stage (for example, jumping freight cars, and the chain gang is sucked into watching a movie). So what? The Coen brothers seem to have nothing to add to the critical debate of “art for art’s sake” versus moral high seriousness about the function of art. They clearly fall into the old school, but this does not seem to motivate the mention in the least. Is it a homage? If so, why do it? I like postmodern pop culture and text games just like the next person, but much nicer when it comes down to something, at least in tonal, if not thematically, sequential? and not just an arbitrary mixture. <br /> <br /> This script is just a silly mess. The only consistent and consistently enjoyable element is the folk / country soundtrack. This has nothing to do with Homer or Preston Sturges, but, given the rest of the film, this is probably a good thing. On the other hand, I would recommend using the price of the entrance ticket to the soundtrack CD.
