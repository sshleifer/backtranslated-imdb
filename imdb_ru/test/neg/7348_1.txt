I always hated this late show. I liked Cartoon Network shows, such as Dexter Lab or Megas XLR. But I never liked this piece of poop. Mainly because there are stupid characters in it (good or villains, it seems, all mentally retarded) they have stupid voices (especially Bubbles. She must be a “cute” character in the series, but she is incredibly annoying) the storylines are very, very stupid. Some episodes could be interesting, but almost always the series becomes childish and banal. There was no nice character, the music was terrible, and the animation is the worst I've seen. Even a five year old boy could draw better! I do not understand why the whole world seems, I like this piece of garbage. Powerpuff Girls seems to be one of the worst cartoons ever made. Fortunately, the "Foster Home for Imaginary Friends" from the same creator was much better.
