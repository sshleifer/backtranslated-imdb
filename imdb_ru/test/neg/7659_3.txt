With the cast consisting mostly of lesser stars (Alain Delon, Robert Wagner, Eddie Albert), lousy special effects (of course, it was the 70s, but Alien and Star Wars came from one decade) and the storyline it's so funny that I want to cry, this is a “flight” that was supposed to be GROUNDED. <br /> <br /> Even Oscar Sisely awards laureates Tyson and George Kennedy cannot keep this “bird” in the air. <br /> The incredibility of the third film - the plane is immersed in the Bermuda Triangle - much more believable than that of this turkey. <br /> <br /> Avoid Concord at all costs!
