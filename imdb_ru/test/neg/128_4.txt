The discovery of the "Jungle" promises us a safari adventure with an element of science fiction, but mostly we get a trip with a lot of video recordings and stuffing (and a strange attack of a leopard). The film is leisurely, when you want it to be exciting, and trying to instill interest in the process with poorly organized matches between various wild animals (I had no idea that lions and boars were natural enemies in the wild, didn’t they? in the hunt for herbivores, but apparently the producers knew better). <br /> <br /> As for the actors: Cesar does her usual excellent job of swinging his mustache, and Mary Windsor is quite plausible as the daughter of a progressive-thinking rajah (nice eyebrows, by the way!). However, Rod Cameron is barely noticeable, as the hunter returns as the only survivor on his expedition. I am sure that he was in demand at the time, but here he acts as the rented center of Bogart: he looks rude, but without taking into account the range or time of Boggi. He spends the movie back and forth from stoic anger to evil stoicism, and every time the script tries to rekindle romantic sparks between him and Windsor, you just need to laugh. This uneven, sloppy face is not a good remedy for tenderness. <br /> <br /> The script is not completely useless, although it makes strange choices. At the beginning of the first act, the script puts an end to spending a few moments when the heroes decide to take the obligatory smart boy and the monkey talisman with them, but then mostly ignore them until *** SPOILER *** the monkey somehow grabs live hand grenade during a giant scene and accidentally thrown near Windsor. This is so that Cameron could prove his courage by immersing herself in it and saving her life at the cost of her own. *** END SPOILER. It is possible that the Indian version of this film (which, as I understand it, seemed better than 2.5 hours), could have given the child and the monkey more work. <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes a film show its age ** SPOILER ** is the problem of woolly mammoths (a plot device that primarily drives a safari). When they finally appear, the way the scene is filmed, it becomes obvious that the “mammoths” (obviously, elephants in draped carpets) actually do not “attack” anyone or even move too fast, and yet Cameron immediately begins to try destroy them with hand grenades. Nowadays, the idea of ​​destroying the last known specimens of a species considered extinct would be unthinkable, especially when all they seem to do is roll through the jungle with good walking. *** THE END OF THE SPOILER *** <<br /> So, IMO, four stars, which is pretty good for setting Robert Lippert (usually Lippert’s hacker works estimate two or three stars at best). This is not a train or movie wreck; plus, it seems to mean well, with the daughter of the rajah, advocating for the improvement of the most repressive aspect of the "traditional ways" and elements of the "mixed race" romance, which was quite progressive in 1952. And there are some beautiful landscapes and an exotic spectacle. See if someone offers to show it to you for free, but don’t expect much, except for the interesting historical chapter of an early fantasy movie.
