Just saw .... plot, plot, script is absolutely meaningless !! This is Samvis, the brave part 2 (without the RING), his characters appearing from nowhere (without a reason), his Hercules, whom everyone hates (nobody knows why), his Lily Sobieski, showing her true talents (two of them), his crappy special effects, some good actors spending their talents (did I mention two talents Lily ??) ... should I say more ??? It's just terrible, even for NBC-TV standards !!! It's just the lowest .... what a waste! btw: how can you people give this mini-series so many stars ????? This is me! .... Shame on you! I need to make 10 lines, so this is my last word: AVOID, AVOID if you are considering buying!
