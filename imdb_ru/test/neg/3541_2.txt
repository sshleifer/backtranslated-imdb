Think you saw the worst movie in the world? Think again. The person who created the cover of this box should be accused of false advertising. The cover makes it look like a good, scary horror fighter. But no. Instead, we have NIGHTSCREAM. The film that makes "sweeeoooowww !!" noise every time the loan flashes across the screen. The biggest name in the whole film is probably Casper Van Dien, who hardly has a role. <br /> <br /> I voted for him only because I could not vote below. If I could vote for something like a negative five thousandth, believe me, I would do it. So, now I'm going to give NIGHTSCREAM 1/2 * out of 5 just because it's over.
