This film is really a strange mixture of genres - toilet humor and action in one. It really does not cope with this - it had to adhere to one genre. The best thing I can say about the film is that the dog is cute in it. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing sequence occurs in the middle of the film when Moses (Sandler) and Carter (Wayans) decide to stop. away in a hunting lodge / motel. I'm not quite sure what the meaning of this sequence is - it seems completely unfounded. The owner of the hunting lodge ("Charlie") is a very boring guy. For some reason, Moses begins a conversation with Charlie about porn, masturbation, homosexual sex, sex in a trinity ... Charlie's photo of his "wife" seems to be Charlie wearing clothes. There is no reason for this truly youthful dialogue and scene. Anyway, the whole scene seems to be aimed at the moment when naked Moses finishes with Carter's pistol in his ass, and Charlie sees them through the window. All of this smells like a schoolboy's humor about homosexuality - horrified and at the same time - which I do not find at all ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I have a friend who is always crazy about Adam Sandler films. This is the first thing I saw - after that I am not sure that I want to see more. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is my husband's account - he saw Happy Gilmore and tells me this pretty well - maybe I should give Sandler one more chance. <br /> <br /> Countess Skogg
