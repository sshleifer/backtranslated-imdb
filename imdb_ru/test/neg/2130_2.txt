This cheap film about exploitation is truly tasteless material, courtesy of Spaghetti Production Director Lamberto Bava, who wisely left his name in this junk. <br /> <br /> The main essence of this walk is connected with the discovery of some severely mutilated people. washed ashore in the caribbean. At first, the authorities believe that they were the victims of shark attacks, but, as a result, the case turns out to be much more sinister. <br /> <br /> All of this is ultimately very small, but we have here â€” poor duplication is complemented by an equally weak scenario, which often consists of meaningless chatter and for the most part does not matter much. Act can only be described as a sub-item, which in this case is the nominal value for the course. Truly weak direction also helps nothing. <br /> <br /> Special effect mainly for numerous close-ups of bloody bodies devoid of limbs, and so on. Of course, there is an obligatory creature that periodically appears during feeding, which looks like something from a big octopus monster, where its animation consists only of its sharp teeth, rising and falling in rhythmic articulation. In general, the end result is not very convincing, of course, but, admittedly, it is almost funny in some silly manner. <br /> <br /> It seems that what the filmmakers were striving for was a kind of low-rent jaw and piranha hybrid, but the final product is just bloody ruins, very much like the corpses shown continuously in this picture. It is hard for me to come up with any redemptive attributes to justify viewing this, therefore, moreover, strictly for incurable monster addicts.
