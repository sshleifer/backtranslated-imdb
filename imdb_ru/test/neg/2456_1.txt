Greetings to all, <br /> <br /> Is it not surprising how strong the films are on you after the first viewing? <br /> <br /> I was so glad to see this movie for the first time that I couldn’t stop Since then, my taste in films has become a little more conservative. <br /> <br /> Then for some reason I forgot about this movie until I saw the DVD in my local department store and remembered how great it was, I thought, “Good! I'll take you off the shelf when they release the Special Edition. ” <br /> <br /> Last week I was very happy when my best friend invited me to watch the Flatliners on DVD. The expectation was that I would love this film even more at the second viewing .. How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> Verdict: after 11 years, my view on this film has changed from a very scary first class film to general garbage, which imposes quite superficially on the religious and supernatural side of things. <br /> <br /> I have never been a big fan of acting skills by Julia Roberts (with the exception of Erin Brokerage, in which she earned her Oscar), I think the problem with this film is definitely the director and so mediocre script. I left this film, feeling that there is no real substance or potential in it, but only a few frightening cheap thrills that were not very well made. Even the James-Newtown Howard score, which I rather like as a film composer, could not fascinate and excite me. <br /> <br /> In 1990 I would give this film 9.5 / 10; but in 2001 I’m lucky enough to give 2/10 at best. <br /> <br />
