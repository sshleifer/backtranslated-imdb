2001 was probably not the best year for Eric Roberts. And Raptor, and it came out. Some time ago, I watched Raptor and really thought it sucked and that Eric was the worst. But it was a fun moment and a D-standard. There is nothing in it. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Thomas - the name is probably the worst actor in our day. The plot lacks punch, and it all feels even slower than a snail breaking in curves. <br /> <br /> Two things stand out: Martin Cove and Eric Roberts. You may argue that their efforts are good or something else, but compared to the rest, they are above any criticism. <br /> <br /> I say thank you, Roberts, see you next time (and hopefully better).
