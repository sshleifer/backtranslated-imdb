I watched only the first twenty minutes of this film, and I personally think that this is the worst film in recent years. <br /> <br /> The plot was so bad that it could be possible that a 10 year old child wrote it. The acting was also careless with an almost unknown composition, and not only that the action films, especially in the first half of the film, were so terrible that it was unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know how the producers got the budget for the production of this film, but the production company already regrets it. <br /> <br /> To anyone who can meet with this film in the near future, I advise you to stay away from this joke about the film. ,
