It is sad that Schwarzenegger was the best in this performance, especially given the fact that he had not yet recovered, and was still as tough as cardboard in his dialogue. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is not as bad as some critics say, but also not good. It's funny, and REALLY plays like the poor cousin of Conan's country, which makes him a conflict, bumpy, bad job. And if we talk about bad, the quality is terrible because of the era in which it was filmed, but this is not the only reason. <br /> <br /> This story is even inferior to the line of Conan, but more than that, he loses himself in the trick of “The Red Sonya must be dominated by great strong Schwarzenegger,” and completely forgets its purpose if ever. <br /> <br /> This is interesting, but in a low-budget, guilty Pleasure "B". <br /> <br /> He evaluates 4.2 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
