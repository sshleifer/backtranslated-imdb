I started watching this because I was looking for a good “background” comedy for my Sunday morning. Then I noticed that it would be a road film, and I decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> The first 15 minutes were terrible, but I wanted to give it a chance, because I never judged the movie without looking at it completely. Then things got a little better. It looked like a good road film about friendship ... But then the film began to acquire horrible predictable turns of cliches, and when the film ended, it left you feeling that you had lost time. What was that to say? Why did they even make such a film? And I did not expect the modern citizen Kane, but, nevertheless, I have a few ideas how this film could be improved. <br /> <br /> So accept my advice; leave it alone and go see a real road movie. There are many of those. I will not make the directors of these films seem bad, indicating their names in this review. <br /> <br /> 1/10
