The film is nothing but a nude exposition. Has anyone noticed that all three main female characters look naked? It seems that the only winning bet for Portuguese filmmakers is to include some (if not many) nudity of local stars along with slang, which is reflected in horror in modern Portuguese society. If you watch advertisements of Portuguese films on Portuguese televisions, then they all include a "hot" scene from the film. I am by no means saying that Portuguese society is alienated; Just the film industry does not seem to be able to find other ways to succeed. Returning to the film ... From the spirit of the book, which is a masterpiece, nothing is left. The film could be good if the real idea of ​​the book (relevance at any time) was emphasized, and not a purely erotic part. It had almost all the ingredients ... but the "chef" was terrible ...
