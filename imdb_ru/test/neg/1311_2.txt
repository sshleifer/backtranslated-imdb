Current? Of course. Entertainment? Perhaps - but only when removing a piece of common sense of the viewer. Reality? Only to the extent that it was done on this planet. <br /> <br /> Thousands of people were supposed to die as a result of a 5-meter-high wall of water in a city freely strewn with buildings that are more than 25 meters high just for me. Carlisle's line is about "How could anyone survive this?" when the picture shows the scaffolding of buildings with several floors above the water, it is completely ridiculous. In addition, if someone takes himself to an area (under water) where one cylinder of air is not enough (that is, he is going to die), why not use the simple way to take more than one cylinder? It is clear that the author believes that people in stressful situations cannot consider more than one (one cylinder, one floor). <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this prank, you will be more informed and entertained if you throw away the DVD and read the price information on the outer wrapper made of cellophane. <br /> <br /> A pitiful, truly pitiful and terrible waste of screen talent. <br /> <br /> With regard to sexist propaganda, suggesting that only women can see through problems in order to highlight decisions that should be influenced by people to be spent: even more tosh. It is not surprising that “First Blood”, “Delta Force”, “Sea Seals” and other similar films with little or no virtues will always have their followers, while this brazenly politically motivated hold is being traded.
