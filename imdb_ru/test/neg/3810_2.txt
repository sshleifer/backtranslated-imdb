I don't understand what the buzz is about this movie. All horror sites said that this film has everything you need for an “old American slasher” to fit your needs. “Although it looked like an old American slasher film, my needs were still not met. <br /> <br /> My big problem with this film is that we are now in the 2000s, and not in the 1980s. The horror of the 1980s is the past, and it must remain in the past. Horror movies have changed so much that old movies now look tender and unreal. Even though they are fun to watch, they do not offer the same realistic bloodthirsty bleeding that recent films offer. <br /> <br /> The ax is trashy, unrealistic and utterly awful. If we wanted to see the old American game, I can simply return to the Friday 13 series, the Nightmare on Elm Street series, or the Halloween series. I have to admit that the film is better than some of the horror films that have been released, but it’s one of the worst. The jokes are not funny, but the actors are terrible. <br /> <br /> I would personally stay away from this movie and never look back.
