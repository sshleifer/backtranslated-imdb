OK, so it's terrible? I get horror - but I'm not terrified. Black and white is artistic, but too much black is too much ... enough is said about lighting. The story is a serial killer ....... there are so many around. This has been done in the past, and yes, it will continue ... but I hope not. My question is: when do viewers get tired of reliving this insane dilemma? I think the director thought he would do something different - portray the murder of children. Well, it was done before. So I think he should have gone for the cost shock ..... to kill them in a grim fashion. Well ... the audience was shocked ... disgusted ... disgusted ... numb. And standing up, I felt all these things. So was the director successful? Yes! Absolutely! This is what he wanted me to feel, and I did it. What should I do with feelings now? And more importantly, what is the “message” here? With an amazing talent that Francis Xavier was “endowed with” ... could he ever think of using it to create films that, as I can tell, would come out of darkness? After watching this film, I was left in the dark, my soul was attacked .... is this what kind of craft? There are a lot of such films out there - they make money, as I was told. So what happens to people who want to see all these unfortunate visual effects? What happens in this world when people pay for terrible shock? Will I see it again ..... never.
