It was more a love story than a story about an angel who came here to Earth, although both sides of this story got a good share in the film. <br /> <br /> If I take this film to heart, as someone who knows and believes the Bible, I would do it pretty quickly, but I don’t think the general atmosphere was mean or blasphemous. It was just funny or just stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean John Travolta as a dirty angel? Smoking? Scrape his groin? Quote the Beatles? "Warring Angel" who knows nothing about heaven? Angel who flirts with all women? Yes, this is all absurd and, of course, biblically wrong. <br /> <br /> I could tolerate all this, but I don’t know how many people, no matter what their convictions, could endure the boring movie that it was in the second half of the movie. It begins to drag when the romance begins between William Hurt and Andy McDowell. Some of the dialogues during this novel are so stupid that they insult any discerning viewer. <br /> <br /> This is another film by Nora Efron. Dude, I can't believe how many incredibly stupid films this woman has written or directed. At least she is consistent.
