The Heart of Darkness novel by Joseph Conrad is a dark, deep, and long-lasting novel that tells about the futility and irony that takes place in Africa. If you are looking for a great book to read on weekends, this book is not for you. Konrad doesnâ€™t hide anything when he describes 19th century imperialism, but the novel is meaningless unless it gives him the reflection and attention that it deserves. If I read this novel in search of a wonderful adventure story, I would say that I wasted my time, but looking at the prospect of explaining the uselessness of the XIX century civilization, I would say that this is one of the most significant novels I have ever read, Because I read this novel in English classes, and we analyzed each page, I think I rated the book more than someone who just reads it for fun. I'm not going to lie, this book was difficult, and it makes the reader delve into this novel to find the true meaning. The film on the other hand seemed to me tiresome and boring. The film "Heart of Darkness" is not far off, giving the book of justice. The film misses many key pieces that I consider important to get the true message of the story. If you find it difficult to understand and visualize a novel, then the film may be a good way out, but I would not recommend viewing the film as an alternative to the novel or even another point of view.
