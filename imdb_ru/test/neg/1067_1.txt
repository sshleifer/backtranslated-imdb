The time I spent watching this movie I demand is back! Then I felt bad, but not because it somehow touched me. It's pretentious, trying to make the audience feel bad because of the people involved, but I didn't care. Characters are soulless and stupid. You do not get explanations for some scenes, and after that there are no thoughts left to come up with your own explanation. All students in the film have problems, but since you do not feel them, you do not believe their problems. <br /> <br /> If I could write better in English, I would never stop. But I can't, so Iâ€™ll stop now. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this.
