"You can survive anything." Anything but silent horror. The director could not even decide whether he wanted a demon or just a serial killer from the wilderness. You can not have both. This is similar to Michael Moore trying to get his cake and eat it too (or in his case 1500 cakes), releasing his special charlatan brand of “documentary comedies”: they have to be so fun and crazy, and yet you also have to view them as truth-based, stunning, violent documentaries. Some genres can not be mixed. <br /> <br /> “Anything can happen to anyone, anytime, anywhere.” (Translation: this is a horror genre, so we can do any stupid things we want.) This sounds not so much as something “wise”, found on Chinese pastry paper with predictions, but rather like the creed of every horrible horror. film director. We get this nonsense from an application filed to us at an early stage, a kind of preparation / justification for the upcoming ridiculous buffoonade. <br /> <br /> "My phone is not working!" Well, of course, it is not. There is a much greater chance that the brain of Sean Penn will start working (after decades of catatonic apathy) than a horror movie mobile phone. The only most dreary and predictable horror cliche in the last decade. Why even say that? We KNOW that help will never come through a phone call, so that you, terrible fools, can simply not mention it. The last 50 horror films I've seen use this storyline trick. It becomes awkward. <br /> <br /> "You should always expect the unexpected." The final turn was pretty awesome, I will give them so much ... However, there is a lot of nonsense along the way. <br /> <br /> Look at the difficult traps that the heroine sets at the speed of an addict. laboratory rat - in cold, wet and almost completely dark conditions. I just adore the realism of horror films ... <br /> <br /> When a bloodthirsty demon begins to try to be funny (“shm” his victims), then you know that your pleasure in watching horrors is in doubt. The less said about the old eccentric “wise man who will crack,” the better ... Another stupid cliche submitted by a tired, lazy, boring director. <br /> <br /> What are the chances that your husband will attack you, and then the demon who hates his eyes - on the same day? "Expect the Unexpected." They might as well squeeze if she survived a plane crash, and then in another case, when she encounters aliens who were trying to investigate her ... <br /> <br /> The fast forward button needs a temple or temple is built in his image.
