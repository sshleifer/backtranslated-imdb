Wow, there’s a lot of poison in this film, and a lot of it’s deserved, but it’s not the MOST ARTISTIC film ever. (This is probably "Zoolander".) <br /> <br /> In any case, if you like something, you are really drunk or just in the mood for the movie "B-minus-minus" you can laugh at it could be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Yes, as others have said, the first part of the film makes you think that you are watching the Bram Stoker novel update. The two main characters are Van Helsing and Mina, the ship is Demeter, and they are in the Carpathian galaxy. Later you will find that Van Helsing is a descendant of the original, and he happened to be on the ship in the 30th century with Dracula. Suuuuuuuuuuure. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, and to add to the originality, this movie "creepy ghost ship" has another character named Ash. Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> There is character development on thin paper and anachronisms, such as the above-mentioned manual wheelchair, and Culio and Tom Lister speak in black slang from the 20th century. But what really makes a movie fun is the ending. If this is what happens to the characters, then the previous two hours were a waste. <br /> <br /> As I said, you want a stupid film to play in the Mystery Science Theater, and your mind. Approximately the same mode is required to watch the episode “The Lost Plant” “The Great Vegetable Rebellion,” then can find this deviation. Otherwise, bet on it, it's done.
