Jerry Angell, the owner of the best zombie horror mullet, returns for more undead in the sequel to the brutal bloodbath directed by Todd Sheets. This time, Jerry plays a vile gangster with a low standard of living, who, along with his equally despicable accomplice in the crime, some escaped convicts, several teenagers and a bunch of screaming girls, face to face with a horde of shame. Corpses eating flesh. <br /> <br /> Obviously, having learned to keep quiet about improving his skills in the two years since Zombie Bloodbath, Sheets presents another crappy film mess that somehow manages to be even worse than the original ?? a feat that I thought was almost impossible to achieve. Acting is equally lousy, the effects are amateurish and cheap (most of the blood seems to be nothing more than a choice of products, by-products and blood from the local butcher shop), an incomprehensible story (as I understand it, the zombies rise from the dead because the scarecrow orders them !!! ), and the direction, depressingly burdened with cheap video effects and completely meaningless transitions to black and white. <br /> <br /> And as if it wasn’t Enough to convince you of the lack of redemptive features in this film, the stupid final must do its work: few survivors survive on an abandoned truck in which it turned out that it was convenient to be the moan of the flesh-eating bacteria lying on its passenger seat — just a thing to dissolve the undead (but, oddly enough, not at all harmful to life).
