The idea that anyone could come up with such a trite, cliché, but unintentionally funny film is shocking. The last 20 minutes of this film is comic glory; six people dug enough trenches in 10 minutes to light up the runway with gasoline for 747, while the supposed “major” landed 747 perfectly in a side wind at 110 miles per hour, which led to a doubt in the name of this film CRASH LANDING ... <br /> Some dialogs were equivalent to rubbing sandpaper in my ears, while the only aspect that kept this film for 1 is the many attractive women who occupy the screen most of the time. Not quite a consolidation for this pathetic excuse for the film, but my mute button finally got a workout. <br /> <br /> View at your own risk! 2 out of 10
