I waited a long time to finally see what, in my opinion, was supposed to be a funny movie, and was shocked to find a crappy direction, awkward dialogue, a weak pace, unmotivated slaps and general rudeness that permeated the entire movie. Just not funny! The sets looked cheap, the costumes of the usually superb Donfeld are catchy and distracting. Even the title track is annoying. The characters of the children's book as a whole did not come close to the idea of ​​a married couple, whose life is turned upside down when he loses his job. For the film, which seems to be aimed at the unfairness of the social security and unemployment systems, the filmmakers have no problem being unfair in themselves, allowing Latin American, black and gay stereotypes to be practiced at such a cruel level. The appearance of the film resembles any episode of Love American Style. It's not a compliment. In the world of white-collar theft, the tasteless fashion of the seventies abounds, which only gives a sense of the implausibility of any situation. Beyond a clever initial idea and two capable stars in Jane Fonda and George Seagal, this outdated exercise in social commentary looks like a forced and mean mood for minorities, especially for gays. If you want the best movie with capers, you'd better play Hot Rock with George Seagal and Robert Redford, or “How are you doing dock” with Ryan O'Neill and Barbra Streisand. Now it's funny!
