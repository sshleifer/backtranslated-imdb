Even Mel Gibson could not save this trailer. It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Why did Mel Gibson make a film in which, I am sure, he cannot sit and watch? What was it? Totally ludicrous on some hard drugs chasing a shizofrina lady who was also on some hard illegal street drugs For all moviegoers out there for hard drugs; you will like this movie
