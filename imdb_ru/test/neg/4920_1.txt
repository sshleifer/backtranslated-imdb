Well, at least it was the last sequel that I could find in Blockbuster, because this film was just awful. I mean, I can understand how difficult it would be to get rid of an evil house. We are talking about the beginning of a terrible fire, bulldozers, floods, etc. But the mirror? How hard can it be to get rid of the mirror ?! It was the most terrible movie that could put the name of Amityville in the frame! <br /> <br /> Well, a group of friends who, from the very beginning, are a bunch of freaks. One of them is a photographer who buys a haunted mirror from a homeless creepy guy, teaches me a valuable lesson, do not buy things from a homeless creepy guy. Of course, this group is accompanied by horrendous deaths and chaos, although I cannot imagine anyone missing them. <br /> <br /> Please miss Amityville: a new generation, I already have a few complaints about my generation. I think it was a premonition. Don't sound so crazy. : P But believe me, this is terrible, badly thought out and not even scary! I’m so sorry for the original authors of Amityville’s Horror, they must cry every time a person witnesses this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
