Voor een verloren soldaat, for a lost soldier, is a sad example of how not to transfer to the film a touching, complex psychological study of that same magical time in a personâ€™s life when he is still a child, but a person begins to become. The novel describes the real life experience of Rudi van Danzig, told by boy Jeroen, in the last days of World War II at the age of 11, when he deals with his nascent sexuality and his deep fears of abandonment when he is sent to the province. from Friesland, north of Holland, his parents due to lack of food in Amsterdam and have not heard from them for many months how the postal service broke down. The arrival of the liberating soldiers in the film is presented in a painfully banal way, with soldiers providing entertainment in the style of vaudeville. Then one soldier, Walt, starred in the novels with Jeroen, and the couple presented themselves as two high-spirited guys who complete their love in their sexual experiences. This was taken from the age of 11 by Jeroen. The reality was somewhat different: Jeroen describes his meetings with Walt, only 6, in detail, but indirectly. But there is no misunderstanding of their nature. Walt evokes a strong passion in Jeroen, during which he treats him roughly, so during their last meeting, Jeroen has a bruise and a painful sore on his shoulder, where Walt bit him. During this meeting, Walt twice raped Jeroen. Jeroen could have easily escaped Walt after their 2nd clash, when Walt first attacked him, since Walt was clearly trying to prevent his insult from being associated with other soldiers. Why Jeroen continues to search for Walt is a mystery of the human heart, and I still can not explain. The fact that the film misses is a consequence: nightmares, despondency, a mad search all over Amsterdam to find Walt, because Jeroen loved Walt, and nothing could shake it.
