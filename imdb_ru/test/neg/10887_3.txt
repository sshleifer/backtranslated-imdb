SPOILER Wolfcreek meets the Texas Chainsaw Massacre ... if you saw it, don't waste your time on it. A typical film slasher, there is nothing new here, except for the SPOILER "visions" that simply add fluff to an already weak storyline. I would recommend this film if you have absolutely nothing to watch, and he either watches this film or looks at the bare wall for 1.5 hours. The only semi-interesting part of SPOILER is that when a chicken starts drinking an empty sheriff in the office, I say itâ€™s interesting because, at least, she used this liquor instead of stereotypically using it to make a fire although I went this way to the end. Overall, lame, bad and not worth the effort.
