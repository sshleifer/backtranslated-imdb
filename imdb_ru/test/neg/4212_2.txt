Breaker! Breaker! Chuck Norris works as a truck driver and as a karate master, talking about how to combine two different careers. He gives a load that cannot be delivered to his younger brother Michael Avgenstein, and then, when the young man does not appear, Chuck is looking for him. <br /> <br /> What the young Owenstein got involved in, a high-speed trap led by Judge George Murdoch from the Law School named after Roy Bean. Of course, Norris solves questions in the usual way of Chuck Norris, and when he gets into trouble, the Central Bank calls up all the truckers to come and help their friend. This high-speed trap, known as Texas City, has a bad reputation, and drivers are just happy to help a friend. <br /> <br /> Chuck, of course, is a bit younger and without facial hair. He has a tight, shy look of a man who understands that the Academy will not look at this saber. George Murdoch outrageously replays, as Judge Roy Bean imitates. <br /> <br /> This is exclusively for fans of Chuck Norris.
