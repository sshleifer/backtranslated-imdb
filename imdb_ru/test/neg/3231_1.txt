I could not agree more. The book is one of Dean Kunz's best novels, and this film is a complete parody. I looked at about half of this, and then threw the tape in the trash with disgust! I have no idea what this stupid director was thinking about when creating this piece of shit, but I would prefer to stick my eyes out with a sharp stick than to watch this useless movie again! Everything in this film is just wrong. First, the main character is changed from a former marine to a high school KID. WHAT FOR??? Secondly, the love of his life in the book becomes his mother in the film! I bet Freud would have something to say about that! Lol The dog is pretty cute and the best thing in the film and completely rejected all the rest! Also the main character, who helps them in the book, betrays them in the film. There is nothing good to say about the film, except that at least it is relatively short, an hour and a half or so. If someone has not seen the movie, do yourself a favor! TO READ A BOOK! This is much better than this waste of time!
