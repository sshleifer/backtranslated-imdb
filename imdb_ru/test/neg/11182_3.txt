As for the purely theatrical side, “Last Stand” was great, because the reconstructions and soundtrack are very interesting, but in other places you can find more detailed information about this battle, which, although not as long and vibrant, is much more historically comprehensive. <br /> Some small details, such as the misuse of the word “hoplone” for the Greek hoplite shield and the incorrect pronunciation of various names and words, really ate me. <br /> <br /> I think, because “The Last Stand of 300” was shown on the eve of the theatrical release “300”, the History channel tried to participate in the film’s commercial. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a description historically accurate in all respects you will be lucky elsewhere.
