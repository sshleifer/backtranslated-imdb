I'm a fan of get shorty. This is a continuation of the film, which does not need to be continued. <br /> <br /> Chile returned, but Rene Russo was missing. Unfortunately, Chile's game was played out in the first movie, and instead of finding an interesting personal arc for him, they just make him stand around the repeating lines from the first movie. This is pretty cool. Travolta looks old here. As if they move people around him because his bones become creaky. His pink lip gloss and blue eyes are very strange. The second bad role is Edie (played by Umi Thurman). She is a music producer, a role that requires her to be only a woman Reuben Kincaid. (“Hey, these kids have a great new sound.”) In any scene, she strikes at the wrong step, motivating, emotionally, or both. It hurts to watch. Despite the abundant problems, Be Cool is getting better after a very hopeless start. <br /> <br /> I, of course, laughed at this (Vince Vaughan runs in the fire, Cedric the Entertainer, Ludicrous, Scala, t shirt with the word "widow", but after everything is over, there will be no memories. the helium light of love from the first frame. In the first film there is no such priceless idiot as Gene Hackman. It is about doing good in the world for a couple of children who deserve a chance (Beyonce & the Rock). Ho-hum. First was not preaching. <br /> <br /> It’s annoying to work in (many times) the jokes and lines from the first movie, as does the stupid concession to the fans of Rock (he twice one eyebrow), as Tell us about the jokes: Steven Tyler says: “I’m not one of those singers who are in a movie.” Ar Ap. <br /> <br /> An impressive lineup of stars is part of the problem. The first film wasn’t burdened with "stars". <br /> <br /> For rolling a dollar, let's call it even.
