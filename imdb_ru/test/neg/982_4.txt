To remake "Lost Horizon" as a musical, a musical composition such as Rogers and Hammerstein or Lerner and Low was required. Bert Baharah and Hal David were the wrong choice. Having said that, my favorite thing about "Lost Horizon" is his appreciation. Just the bill does not fit in size. The cast, composed mainly of non-musical talents (Ulman, Finch and Hussey, all were duplicated, and still not sound so great). <br /> <br /> To be honest, the story about which this and the earlier non-musical versions of the film were based, mediocre, at best. While the possibilities for a really good, cinematic music version exist, they are not implemented here. The film succeeds in being a good, rainy vehicle to pass the time. Otherwise, you'd better buy a soundtrack CD. It is recommended only for curiosity because of the terrible reputation of the film. I have seen much better; but I saw MUCH worse.
