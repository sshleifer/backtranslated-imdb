The Okul "School" is the result of a new trend in Turkish cinema. Again and again repeating the same stories, the directors of the new generation, in the end, come to other ideas. Of course, this does not mean that they are all great. I think Okul is one of them. It should be a scary movie, but it is not. This is not successful due to the fact that it is scary. So what is it? The actors are so average, especially Deniz Akkaya, rather annoying to the role of the teacher. I’m sure it could be better if you tried it. Maybe focus on one topic, for example, make it scary or vice versa. But the directors didn’t hit the mark this time. ** outside *****
