I really enjoyed Tycus, if not much more than mocking production values. Dennis Hopper was just fine, although I wonder if he would have signed up for the project if he had seen the special effects that they used. And besides what happened to the scene with the ninja ?? It was just not keeping up. Perhaps someone came up with a brilliant idea of ​​the middle of the shooting. Well, this film is great if you are drunk and want to laugh. Greetings.
