This cute Italian film, which has deserved some recognition, boasts pretty good special effects by Rick Baker and Deran Seraphian in a small role. Cerchi gets some credit for still filming movies, while most other Italian directors (Ruggero Deodato, Sergio Martino, Lamberto Bava and Enzo J. Castellari) have switched to more modest television films. As for plankton, this is half Piranha - half the Thing, people turn into monsters, rape women and cause general chaos. Ultra-dirty, sloppy and overly sexual feelings from the film make it difficult to enjoy. Available only in Italian.
