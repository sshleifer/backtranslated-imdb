I really liked the idea of ​​traveling between dimensions, and I even liked the tension of Wade / Quinn in the early episodes. Some of the worlds they created gave the protagonists extremely interesting backgrounds for their stories. However, as the show went on, more silly disputes and fewer real connections arose between friends. There was less surprise and excitement when they were involved in other worlds, and more condescension. And in every world one of the characters was in love. The letter got boring and everything was too much. It is a pity that it would be nice to have a friendly group of friends (a la "Star Wars"), traveling in different dimensions on TV for several years, and not a tired group of knitted collectors.
