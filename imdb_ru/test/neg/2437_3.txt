It is difficult to say who this film is directed to; The characteristic and stylish flavors of the ITV Kids' Series are intertwined with Australian soap, but the plot, nudity and language are directed at a senior audience. <br /> <br /> In the first half hour, the heroine Justin philosophizes about losing her virginity and painfully embarrasses anyone over 18 years old. The complete fabrication of Ferris Bueller, from talking to the camera to screen graphics. <br /> Her brake friend Chas leads her to a computer fair, where an explosion while using virtual reality machines turns her into a man. Or, in fact, creates a male alter ego named Jake. Do not look at me so; I'm just talking about it the way it was shown. <br /> <br /> After that, the film is a bit funny for a while; Among all that happens in drama school, only Rupert Penry-Jones makes a real comic touch to the role of Jake, trapped in the body of a man. There are some funny scenes with Jake dealing with his new body and new feelings; nothing that you have not seen before, but then in this film you will cling to something interesting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Justin and Jake meet, and they are followed by funny antics (I wish) with the participation of the owners of a virtuality machine that wants to kidnap Jake to have sex with him, or to examine him, or something something else. In any case, this is just a reason to fill the extra half an hour with explosions and car chases; for such a cheap movie, explosions happen often and loudly, suggesting that the money was spent in all wrong places. <br /> <br /> In the end, the heroine realizes that she cannot fall in love with herself, removes her alter-ego and ultimately finds herself alone with the nerd to lose her virginity (apparently, this is what was meant for a happy ending in the 90s). But only after he takes off his glasses and puts on a little hair gel and leather jacket; God forbid, she actually has sex with someone who looks like a nerd. Of course, this is a bit disruptive - these days computer films that tell you to love and be yourself, and that each person is special in its own way, it is refreshingly reactionary to have a film that shouts “CONFORM!” To you and botanists with the contempt they deserve. <br /> <br /> Characteristic is simple and terrible; nerd very nerd (room full of computers, thick glasses, social backwardness, virginity, without a leather jacket), there is a slut, she is very slutty (blonde, tight dresses, orange tan, accompanying vampire music), there is an athlete, he is ... well, you understand. You can avoid trouble with such a characteristic in a wide comedy, but “Virtual Sexuality” is not very funny. It is only slightly amusing in some parts, and painfully in others. A woman as sweet as Justin (played by Laura Fraser) needs a lot to annoy me, but she copes. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the name; There is absolutely nothing erotic in the film, and it doesn’t touch on the topic of how new communication technologies change our view and acquire relationships (unless you really think that there is a chance that your PlayStation might explode and change your gender)). <br /> <br />
