Awful waste of time. There is no meaning of camp or garbage. Watch the best amateur films made by children from 10 to 12 years old in film clubs. <br /> <br /> How can you spoil a movie about vampires and lesbians? <br /> <br /> This is not a movie where you can gather several vampire and sadomasochist enthusiasts in one room and just shoot them. <br /> <br /> Could not find anything good in the film. There was no plot, real actors, real special effects, humor. Several complete ready, in contact with each other, can not be called a sex scene. Nothing in common. <br /> <br /> The cemetery was good, but in the dark you need to make a film about vampires. <br /> <br /> The goal was probably good: to make a trash film in the spirit of Ed Wood. The problem is that you can't make a bad movie intentionally. It takes talent and effort to make a “real” movie. Ed Voodoo may not have had enough money, but he certainly made an effort. These guys lacked everything. Ed Wood was a genius compared to these guys.
