In the 1940s, Veronica Lake flew up to stellar glory thanks to her sultry beauty and her highly exploited “peek-a-boo” hairstyle. She starred in major roles with such big names as Alan Ladd and Fredrik March, acting on the screens of films such as “This is a weapon for hire” and “I married a witch.” She held herself in the hands of female stars and even surprised her detractors with her performance as the bitter navy nurse in the film “So proudly we welcome.” But times and her own shortcomings were changing, and by the end of the decade, her heyday was over. With two unsuccessful marriages behind her (and two more in her future), Veronica went to New York, where she sometimes appeared on television and in summer promotions, before completely disappearing from sight. It was a short big news story when in the early sixties she was found working as a bartender in a second-rate hotel. But by now her long-time alcoholism and years of hard life have taken away her appearance. Without them, public interest in her soon faded away again. She returned to the scene in different vehicles, but her success was minimal. She eventually moved to Miami, Florida, where she lived in relative obscurity. In 1966, she traveled to Canada to participate in the unknown film “Steps in the Snow”, which was not released in the United States. The following year, it was discovered by some industrial filmmakers who have long wanted to create a commercial film. They approached her to star in their movie “Time to Terror” and persuaded her to invest in the project. As one author said: “If the movie queen ever experienced a final fall, that was all.” Surrounded by amateur performers and pretentious production values, she could not even rise to the minimum level in this quick battle in Miami, Florida. Poor Veronica looked quite ordinary on long shots and darkly aged on close-ups. Like a deranged doctor who has found a successful formula for restoring her youth using carnivorous larvae! Supporting the cast does not help, just promotes the plot, saying it to death. Director Brad Grinter apparently required the actors to move only when the camera was pointed to them, and nothing like entertainment was needed (admittedly, there is one unintentionally hilarious scene involving a private detective / nurse and a corpse in a wheelchair the wheelchair, which preceded Bernie’s “weekend” for almost 20 years.) According to Veronica herself, the film was postponed for three years, because no master shots were shot. But in 1970, the production company revised it, changed its name to “The Feast of the Flesh” and released it to cash in on the newly published biography of Lake. And since former leading ladies such as Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and Olivia De Havilland unexpectedly resumed their horror films career, this parody was called Veronica “the film about the return”. This seems like a strange course of action for filmmakers, however, because it is unlikely that the (young) audience for a horror movie of this quality either knew or wondered who Veronica Lake was. As expected, this had no effect on Veronica’s career, and she died in poverty three years later. The previous reviewer quotes a scene in which a female detective working under the guise of a nurse in a doctor's laboratory (watching the theft of bodies from a nearby morgue) enlists the help of a talented chauffeur to cut the body parts. "Poor Mrs. Lustig," she sighs, "I hope she does not mind leaving her body to science." “Try not to think about it,” advises the chauffeur while sawing. "I think you're right, Hans." concludes the detective / nurse, "What is done is done." What a sad end to a career still naively memorable star.
