This film amazes only with its banality and the use of stencils. Unfortunately, it was obvious all over until the final. But do not think that it is very over. Only a little unexpected, although nothing was worth watching. <br /> <br /> From the silent and unfair hero to the German villain and expendable team, the characters were completely wooden and obvious. The two FBI agents Smith and Wesson (Geddit?) Gave hope for humor, but this led nowhere. <br /> <br /> I’m a big fan of science fiction, but it’s hard to find any redeeming quality in this film, Turkey! <br /> <br />
