I'm glad that later reviews burned out - after reading all the positive reviews, I started to worry that my understanding of films (and life) was completely different than everyone else in the world. Everything in this film seemed to me false: the characters, the dialogues, the manipulative soundtrack, the banal narration, all that. As each scene developed, I continued to think: “People don’t behave like this.” It is relentlessly heavy and wise. In a sense, the film makes you love him or pretend that you like him, because he is serious, about real people and faces problems. But man, this really does not work for me.
