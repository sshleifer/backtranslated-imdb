So I decided to watch the entire Puppet Master series and just looked at parts 1-3, which, in my opinion, were ALL great. They had a unique charm and a certain intelligence, which I really appreciated. About a year ago I even saw Puppet Master Vs. “Demonic toys”, which, of course, was bad, but still terribly pleasant and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning of this film I knew that he had problems. Angry Egyptian villain in the style of the Mighty Rangers, who watches the dolls in the style of Rita Repulsa through his glass of the pyramid, went straight from the left field! All additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd! Suddenly, we have a huge assortment of all sorts of new and random characters and plots that are far from the first three films. I seriously doubt that when the first Puppet Master was written, the authors had a vision that someday they would see a villain from Egypt, Power Rangers, totem monsters who irritate twenty people who seriously cannot act (and should be brilliant scientists , but never say anything clever) and the lame puppet “Decapitron”, whose head can turn into the ghost of Toulon. <br /> <br /> Another thing that greatly disappointed me in this film is that it completely ignores what happened in the last recording (Part II, since III was a prequel). Suddenly, the puppets returned to the Bodega Bay Inn, returned to their business (with the exception of Blade), and Toulon, for some reason, is ready to help his puppets again (he betrays them in the second part for his love for Elsa). This is not explained by EVERYTHING ... and so with this, and with all this other junk, I was no longer surprised. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of funny B-films, a connoisseur, if you will. I even collect laser discs from rare B films that you cannot find on DVDs, and therefore I need a lot to say that it was one of the most absurd films I have ever seen in my life. I still love these original puppets, Blade, Tunneler, Pinhead, Jester and the rest, and if they only stuck to what they had, instead of trying to fix what didn't break, well, the series could still be alive and well. At the same time, despite the fact that the reviews are not so good, I am really interested in getting acquainted with Puppet Master Retro, it sounds like an interesting one, which pays tribute to the original topics.
