***** SPOILERS ********* <br /> <br /> This movie was really awful. This woman from the very beginning deceives her employers, and then selfishly tries to separate them. In the end, you see that she is making a profession from the profession that she learned from her “pupil” father. I put the student in quotes, because the governess really seems to be teaching the child nothing. It seems that she hates her and can not endure near her. I felt sorry for the little girl who just wanted to be loved, in the absence of this it was clear that she would speak and commit insults, just to attract attention, but the viewer should not sympathize with the little girl; his student, manipulated and deceived their employers. I just couldn't do it. It was not a story about a woman who made herself; rather, it was a window into the mind of someone who uses others at every opportunity, not thinking of anyone except her own family. I hated the governess! It was a really awful movie. I only paid one dollar to rent it, but even that was too much!
