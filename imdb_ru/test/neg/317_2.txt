Three offenders resent the grave of the ancient sorcerer, who, after calling Jack-O (a less threatening pumpkin-headed figure) to send these hooligans, continues his revenge oath to kill all the descendants of the family that killed him. This includes young Sean Kelly and his horror-loving family. Of course, Sean must find a way to save the day. <br /> <br /> Such a stupid low-budget B-film. The game is terrible, and the plot is not much better. Add to yourselves an extremely lame assassin, a possible pedophile who laughs too much, and a couple of stereotypical cardboard cutouts of a “conservative” couple, and you will get this film in a nutshell. It’s not worth the time to see how great Linnaeus is getting older. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Lynn Quigley is always good for some T & A, and she does not disappoint here with a long soul scene; Rachel Carter also becomes topless (although it could be a double body) <br /> <br /> My rating: D-
