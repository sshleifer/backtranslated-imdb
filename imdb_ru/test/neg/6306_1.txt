Great balls of fire is a film that you show to those you really hate. This is the absolute torture of the highest rank, and it is likely that foreign minions use it to extract information from captured intelligence agents. I have enjoyed some Dennis Quaid performances in the past, but in this film he is completely exaggerating. He doesn’t cross the line so much, he jumps in pole-vaulting, and then returns to jump again and again. He gets drunk and spins, as if on some incredibly bad trip with acid. This is one of those rare performances where you would like to go into a movie and beat a man for an inch of his life for doing something really awful. He was desperate to win the Golden Raspberry or some other award for a bad game? This is the only conclusion I can make. Thank you, Dennis, you gave us a bad performance for ages. Where was the director in this guy? <br /> <br /> The opposite side of the extreme is Winona Ryder, she is from plastic traits and a plastic game. I came across a review of her acting style, which compared her to a wax mannequin. This, of course, was an insult to mannequins throughout the land, which could have brought more humanity to the role of a minor cousin / wife Jerry. This brings up the film’s mixed thought that if it is 100% normal to marry your cousin and have a baby from a union. I do not see that this is such a "good", but it seems that Hollywood thinks that the incest of minors is a wild dory. Let's talk about "family values." <br /> <br /> Another problem is the format. Is this a straightforward tale about the life of Lewis or a musical? I'm not talking about music, I'm talking about a really weird scene where Jerry goes to school, the melody starts to sound, and everyone starts to dance like it's a Broadway musical in search of Tony. Fantasy and reality are combined into a mixture that does not work. But who cares? I do not. And you should not. You cannot bring back the minutes of life you would spend on this film. So do not waste your time, it is too valuable for something so lost and poor.
