My friend and I went to see this movie when it was released in 1980. He played in a huge theater, and we were the only people in this place. Two days passed in the theater before they stopped showing it. It was so bad that we laughed to the end. Since then, we have rated movies based on “Kill or Be Killed” as the worst films of all time. As other reviewers have mentioned, it’s so bad that it’s funny. It is not worth a second look, that's for sure. I just can't bring myself to give him more than 1, because I don't think the filmmakers intended to make it so bad, and I can't pay tribute to the accident.
