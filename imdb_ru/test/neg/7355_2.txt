This film is so audacious that it does not try to hide its resemblance to “The Shining”. For this lack of originality. And when he comes to an end, he tries to hide his story that “the father goes crazy under the influence of a haunted sketchy house in a strange place”, he does this by leaning towards many other agreements and ideas already established. In other words, it comes down to a simple cliche. But damn it, even I like a good predictable horror or thriller, as long as there is an interesting story filled with violence and blood, somewhere before the movie makes a terrible turn in the direction of the predictable and banal. Well, this movie has no good story, and I was really disappointed with it. What “Darkness” does for this is a wonderful direction and cinematography. This is a well-made film, carefully thought out, full of fun, eerie angles and shots. What “Darkness” does not have for this is almost everything else. Let's start with a little niggle - the editing in this movie is nasty. He jumps from one scene to another, sometimes meaningless. For example, an old man in a film (who largely carries a background story, later filled with another character) is emphasized by the hamster running circles. I mean, it looks cool the first time, but why keep using the same image? I suppose you should see for yourself to understand what I mean. Another problem with this film is the character of Anna Paquin, who essentially whines throughout the entire film, cries and cares too much about everything - she is an unsuccessful attempt by the film to make a horror movie, controlled by the character. The film has scenes of bloated sentimentalism, and the family drama it portrays is simply implausible. In the end, “Darkness” is an intricate melodrama that does not involve mystery, equipped with a too simple ending. And this is hardly scary.
