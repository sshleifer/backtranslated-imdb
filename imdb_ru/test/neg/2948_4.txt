The film begins with Riva (Ekina) and his assistant, fighting with the same vampires. This scene is probably the best of the movie. The rest of the film, unfortunately, is trashy, extremely unrealistic and robbery Buffy, the vampire slayer. The final also sucks. <br /> <br /> Some moments, such as the scene in which Gypsy and Helen (played by the popular Chinese duo group Twins: Charlene & Gillian) are fighting for a teddy bear, are particularly noteworthy. The storyline is also unconvincing, of course, they could come up with something more terrible than a book called "Day to Night." <br /> <br /> Although there are some good moments. Jackie Chan and Anthony Wong make the film tolerant with their comedic roles. However, the good bits just end there. Charlene and Gillian (from "Twins") never knew how to behave themselves and annoyed you into pieces, and the role of "friendly but stupid vampire", unfortunately, was given to Edison Chen, who is a talentless boy. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 -
