No matter how bad this film is, I really like it. Bad game, dialogue and actions made it so funny. I loved John Travis from Omega Cop and didn’t sleep all night thinking about how Death Machines checked in at the airport, if they can't talk, probably should have shaken / nodded to security issues. In fact, why can't they talk!? He does not adhere to any kind of film making agreement, which makes him strangely interesting to watch - just a lot of people are killing around a very free plot surrounding assassins - no “cars” as such and those strange faces / mountain things on the front cover and trailer do not appear! I like the fact that in this film there is not a good guy to about half, and I like the numerous meaningless scenes of this landing of the plane - many people are killed who have nothing to do with the "plot", and no explanation is given about anything - hope to understand this movie. Instead, admire how the main good guy can't even cope with a random old guy in a bar - who is presented as a bad guy, but still opposes the decision of the bartender to hire a poorly dressed woman to dance poorly in the corner for "entertainment" - to all good guys love it Why did the old man beat our hero - and why did the random guy decide to help the old man in battle ?! Why did the hero collapse under the blow of an old guy to a bar where water is flowing in the background and it looks like he is coming from his mouth? A determined Top 20 B-Movie, should check for part 2.
