The new death of a celebrity is terrible. They kill popular people and defeat low-budget celebrities. I mean ... Andy Milonakis? Lil 'flip? Lil Flip and Lil Wayne should both die. Lil flip sucks. The fight between Lil 'John and Lil' and Wow Lil was FUNNY trite and short. They should just kill them all. Why did Toby lose to Jake and did Christian lose to Adam? they are the best actors and superheroes. They also spend too much time talking, not fighting, which can tire the audience. It seems everyone is in a hurry for some reason, they can't just fight for a long time? old deathmatch is much better.
