This “good guy versus evil tyrant” story, filmed in Russia in the 19th century, may have been an attempt to expand Steve Reeves’s career beyond the limits of these Hercules films. However, despite the different costumes, this is still the film "Hercules" with the usual shaky dialogue, random duplication and cardboard characters. On the other hand, there are many actions, the tempo is rarely marked, and Reeves gets the opportunity to do another of those scenes where he is stripped to the waist, tied with ropes and give an energetic beat, which, of course, has little influence on his defiant character.
