Go to the video store and get the original. I do not understand why in Hollywood you need to take the perfect foreign film and redo it. “Basically Martha” or “Bella Martha” have a much better composition. Starting with the heroine of Martina Godek, who convinced me much more about being obsessed with the work of the perfectionist than the better-known Catherine Zeta-Jones, an Italian chef and niece who suddenly deprived her mother and forced to live with her aunt is suitable for raising children. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the American version of the film is a copy of the German original. They just exchanged actors. However, they also changed history because it would be difficult and not very likely to materialize a father for a little girl in an American context. <br /> <br /> I thought about it. Perhaps the father could be a Puerto Rican, or Cuban, or Mexican. Well, there are so many "guest workers" in the USA. But I doubt that any of them would show responsibility, like the Italian father in the original. Therefore, the American film does not take into account this part, but keeps the Italian cook. And because of this, the whole story changes. In the original, "Martha" is so divorced from reality that she believes that you can send your niece with a complete stranger to a foreign country. <br /> <br /> American “Martha” is softer, and therefore the film is sweeter and does not have such an advantage as a German film. <br /> <br /> In the original, the “Italian” chef is not so good, but much more charming, the little girl is rather stupid, but much more believable, and “Martha” is more representative of a woman’s career in the modern world, except for the diluted version , we are presented in the American version. And all the opera music in the American version was very annoying. I loved the original Italian songs and bought a CD. <br /> <br /> Hollywood admitted that "Mostly Martha" was a great movie. Maybe distribution companies should have put it in more cinemas or show it in English without subtitles. In any case, the original is much better. By the way, it reminds me of another remake. “Let's dance” is one of my favorite songs in the original Japanese version and completely forgotten in the American version.
