This review contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> I was looking for DVD horror movies on Amazon when I stumbled upon Flight Of The Living Dead. I already knew by name that it would be terribly muffled and most likely Snakes On A Plane plagiarism, but he was selling a brand new 69 pence, so I decided that in fact I had nothing to lose. /> <br /> The music played on the opening credits did not fit at all, although I liked the song itself, the pop-rock song is not quite suitable for the soundtrack to the zombie horror film. It all started surprisingly well, the opening scenes were not so bad, some acting games were a bit decent, but not as bad as I originally thought it would be. <br /> <br /> Everything goes well until Laura Cayouette (Kill Bill's Rocket: Volume 2) enters the picture. She must play the scientist. If she is, she is not very smart. Fortunately, it quickly polished. <br /> <br /> I actually physically loudly laughed when the camera covered the passengers of the plane during some kind of turbulence. There was a nun. Have you ever been on a plane with a nun! I was surprised that she did not squeeze the crucifix. <br /> <br /> Finally, after 35 minutes, we proceed to some action of the zombies and freely use the word "action". Special effects are much lower than standard ones, but this is to be expected from a film with such a budget. Coverage with blood and the presence of yellow contact lenses does not make you look like a zombie, but makes you look quite funny. Using slow motion does not work very well either. I think this film is probably to blame for trying to add too much history. Attempting to pass this problem off as a variant of the "malaria virus" was not a particularly good move, given that malaria is not a virus. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film largely loses, like any other. another zombie movie. Most of the characters are killed, and ultimately this results in a handful of people fighting to stay alive. Perhaps the worst part of the Flight of the Living Dead is a completely unbelievable end. I know that this is a film about people who come back to life and enjoy life, but the ending was ridiculous. Rating: ★★
