I watched this movie based on good reviews, and I will not repeat this mistake again. <br /> <br /> The first couple of minutes show that a group of people gathered together for some kind of tragedy, but you don’t understand, I don’t see what it is. The memory of 12 hours, and we see the boring lives of each of these people, who, after all, are completely meaningless for what is about to happen. When the finale finally makes you happy, you realize that you have spent an hour of your life waiting for a big return, which will not happen and does not mean anything to what you have watched. The only connection these people have is that they all had a “bad day”, but even this continuity is lost in boredom. <br /> <br /> If this was supposed to be a clone of "Crash", this is a complete failure.
