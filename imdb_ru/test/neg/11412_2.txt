Sam's Other Son is definitely not an Oscar winner. Technically, it's terrible. The game is also not too good. But there is something that makes you want to look more (like a car accident). Funny close-ups of the killers are funnier than anything else. If you are looking to scare ... this is not a movie for you. It is very unclear and almost impossible to find. I am sure there is a reason for this. For a while he was called HOSTAGE. No matter how you call it, it's still a bad choice for entertainment. This could be good for a MST3000 party or something else. Can you believe that they will use such a name as ANOTHER SON? If this is not written, I will eat my hat. I remember when it was filmed in Belmont, North Carolina. Many local personalities were used as talent.
