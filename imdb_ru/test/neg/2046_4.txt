What is really scary about this is that the filmmakers thought they were doing something clever and sexy. Instead, they made perhaps the stupidest horror picture of the year! <br /> <br /> This film begins with a group of snob-friends in the gallery. This stupid European eccentric comes up and starts talking pretentious fruitiness with the main character, it sounds like he just left the episode of “Dark Shadows”. Then he offers her some stick to smoke (yes, damn stick), with which she willingly agrees! He pulls out some red shit and puts it in a spoon so that she can for free! If this ever happens to you in real life, don't do it! <br /> <br /> She was transported to some strange scumbag by Jean Rollin, who must be sexy, but this is not so, where there is something like a rotten creature from the black lagoon! <br /> <br /> Soon, she turns all her cunning base balls into her new form of supernatural crack. No matter how these idiots go crazy and turn blue, they can't leave him alone. At some point she even deals with a rotten creature! <br /> <br /> After the final battle, when a stupid woman evaporates or something like that, the so-called hero is left alone to collect his copy of “Dude Michael Moore. My country cannot resist smoking this stick again in order to try to save its retarded girlfriend. What a dope. <br /> <br /> Ranks four stars for unintended humor.
