I received a discount copy of this. I saw it a few years ago. My only recent experience was the Theater of Mystical Science, where it was forged. No one ever gets a chance to get into these films because of all this. I love the beginning of the fifties horror movies. They give us a pompous lecture on defense systems near the Arctic. They were there to protect us from the expected Soviet invasion, but they should come in handy, given the threat of very large insects. <br /> <br /> This particular flies. For some reason, despite the fact that its exoskeleton is made from the material from which the grasshoppers are made, they can still reflect the air from the air missiles and turn off the fighters. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is more fun - firstly, the obligatory irresponsible case that saw the flying thing, cooling its heels in the hospital (this teaches only one thing - to see a house-sized insect) keep your mouth shut). I wonder if the poor fellow should go home after they found a mistake. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a fairly ordinary effort. It follows conventional efforts to find a way to dissuade a stubborn mistake — and leaves us open to other possibilities — the Russians next time. I still enjoy these films, and this one is fine.
