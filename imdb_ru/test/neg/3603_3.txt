Another direct video from Disney, which is perfect for kids. The problem with Kronk's New Groove, which I find, is that everything that made the first film a fascinating and exciting trip has been replaced by a more sad and gloomy film. In this film, Kronk learns many lessons at the expense of many others. It takes a long time to create a more enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> Kronk’s new groove is dedicated to two stories: “Ism returns for payback,” and one Miss Birdwell hopes to win the Kronk counseling championship in the camps. All this leads to the fact that Kronk confronts his father and his disapproval regarding the direction of his son's life. <br /> <br /> From The Lord of the Rings to Michael Jackson's Thriller, Kronk's “New Groove” recycles every moment in time that allows its audience to entertain. If you like the original or are looking forward to the upcoming Cusco series, I recommend Kronk to its loyal fans.
