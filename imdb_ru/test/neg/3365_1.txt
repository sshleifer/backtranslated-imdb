This is the worst movie I've ever seen, without exception. This film is very bad, funny, from the flimsy, poorly lit scenery, to the ridiculous acting, infantile plot and trashy, protracted action movies. Ten minutes. After which you will reach for the console or power connector to end this film is not an experience. Although this was obviously done so that the entire language of the film crew and the cast was stamped on the cheek (please, God), I found Jack Frost 2 so terrible that it could not be watched for more than a quarter of an hour. If after that you do not get tired of this, it means that you are abusing drugs.
