My God ... I have not seen such a horrible movie for a long time ... for a long time ... I saw him last night and wanted to leave after 20 minutes ... Keira Knightley is trying very hard at this, but she can’t cope with it ... from time to time she dropped her accent and had no charisma to play the role ... acting skills Sienna Millers leads you to the point that you start asking yourself the question: did she ever have acting lessons? judging by the edge of love, she has never been to acting class, but she should think about going soon ... they both look very pretty ... maybe that’s what they should focus on in their future career. .. if they can be actresses everyone can!
