I usually give sequels benefit from doubts and am calm towards them. But this is very bad. The same thing that happened in the first film, happens here. Similar. Only they wanted younger children to see it (this explains the repeated presence of Bugs Bunny, but why they threw one “f * ck”, I cannot do it). <br /> <br /> They didn't even bother changing the character of Jackie Mason from Dangerfield. Let me explain, in the “CADDYSHACK” Rodney Dangerfield played the boorish property owner who infuriates the energetic members of the Bushwood country club. In this film, Jackie Mason plays a boorish property owner who infuriates the energetic members of the Bushwood country club. Great effort they made to change the content of the script, eh? No, I do not think so. The very unfunny Dan Aykroyd shamefully copies the character of Bill Murray. He even stalks a gopher (now more like Gremlin) almost as much as Murray. <br /> <br /> Don't laugh. Sample "comedy" in this film: Jackie Mason is preparing for a hot date with Diane Cannon. He is his bathrobe in the bathroom. He walks to the door to get dressed in his bedroom when the door handle breaks down. Wow!?! This is the best they can do. Eight years to come up with a completely new sequel, and that's all we get!?! I could get the best script out of my ass. <br /> <br /> You can see it only if you are a devoted fan of the original. This is the only way to find laughter. The rest stay away.
