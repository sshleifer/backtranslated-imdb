Macbeth's story was one of the most successful Shakespeare ever written. This may be due to some features that make it close to the slasher genre, murder, murder, murder, murder, gallons of blood, tense sexual relations between the main characters, etc. Moreover, the original game is very attractive, considering length (this is only half the size of Hamlet) and an emphasis on Macbeth, which we have to take care of, despite its bloody nature. The game seemed to be perfect for the film. Not so long, it gives directors the opportunity to explore many levels, a good actor can play the role of his whole life, the film has a deep meaning in any historical period. Unfortunately, this was not the case with Macbeth. Polanski’s version is pretty close, but it’s too insistent on the medieval period. Wells film is too personal, with an interesting twist towards totalitarianism, the television version of 1990 is too superficial. This 2006 film is no exception. This is very far from Shakespeare's film, but it is interesting to see how the director understood the story and where he put it in modern life. No knights in brilliant armor, but gangsters in brilliant machines. Many drugs and trippy music replace the fear of the night in the original play. The idea of ​​Macbeth is so simple that to take and introduce it into modern life does not need Shakespeare at all. The worst part of the film is the line. Most of the dramatic scenes in the play, such as the dagger, are cut so short that they seem meaningless. Replacing knocks on doors with door bells and horses on cars seems ridiculous. If they wanted to make a film about power and its temptation, they could have done it easily without Shakespeare. This Macbeth seems to be a loser with a traumatic brain injury, not a valiant warrior, brave and ambitious, who so wants the strength that he is ready to kill, and who is captured by a network of fear and despair. In the film, it is not clear what drives Lady Macbeth insane, but there is no reason why some characters should fear Macbeth and his “horror” (since there is no hereditary ascent to the throne, that is, without the throne and all) and this puts Macbeth in an awkward position because the leadership of the gang is as far from royalty as this entire film is far from any Shakespeare. In conclusion, we have two combined ideas that never occur, turning this film into completely meaningless.
