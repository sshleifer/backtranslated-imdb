So many people took pictures in the platoon and those born on July 4 among others, calling them “the left propaganda film”. Now it's my turn to make a political film. This film imposes on me certain religious beliefs and its political views. <br /> <br /> The acting and writing was a little cliche for my taste. Mel Gibson seems to love playing in these unnecessary violent films and proves it once again, teaming up with his partner Randall Wallace for one more. Throughout this film, there were such trash prototypes: "Just tell my family that I love them" or "Tell Ronnie to pray before the hoe goes to bed." They were so overwhelmed by these garbage collection lines that I felt sick. How about that scene when Gibson's wife goes to wash clothes, and this “no color” refers to putting in a washing machine. In the mid-sixties, she was stuck under a stone, not noticing the racism around her. Another scene in which Gibson's daughter asks him what war is, and the scene is removed in such a trivial question. <br /> <br /> The director showed it all perfectly. Countless scenes of prayer by Gibson and his family or soldier. I show it well once or twice, but after a while I wonder if the film is trying to put something in my head. How many scenes with the American flag in the best hours were filmed with melodramatic music included. The director also creates the impression that we won some victory in Vietnam. What exactly was won. Cinematography was the worst because of the slow motion scenes where the American flag was visible from a distance. I love America, but such films seem to glorify everything we do. <br /> <br /> This may seem pointless, and perhaps it is, but I cannot bear it if such a film makes people irreligious. not so patriotic to agree with everything that their country looks bad. This film for me is limited and limited in many aspects. For me, it says that if you are not a Christian, then you are wrong. Would God or Jesus want people to kill, I don’t think so. For me, this film was offensive. At first this film was funny with countless clichés and overpriced scenes, but then, when I looked at what this film was trying to say or not, to say that it was really difficult to watch it. I think, although it's my fault that I decided to watch this movie. I hope that no one takes this comment offensively, because I do not criticize religion or patriotism, but some of the narrow-minded people who love and devalue everyone else so much. <br /> <br /> If you want to truly describe the Vietnam Military Watch Platoon born on the fourth of July, Apocalypse Now, the Deer Hunter or the Killing Fields. Even the all-metal jacket, which I absolutely hated, was the best image. I read a quote that, in context, says that a true patriot disagrees with everything that a government or country does, but questions when it’s wrong. A true patriot loves his country too much to see how she does bad things.
