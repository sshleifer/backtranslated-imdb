This short plot is a remake of the movie “Three Puppets” of 1942 “What is a Matador?”, Telling about the boys' trip to Mexico and their adventures about the bullfight. Although the original short film was filmed during the Stooges peak period, it is not so memorable, and I think it is one of the most mediocre films with Curly Howard. <br /> <br /> Having established this, I think that "Sappy Bullfighters" is just awful awful, like all the other shorts with Joe Besser. Moe and Larry should never have hired Besser, because his whiny, almost feminine character was not at all suitable for the violent comedy Stooges. His 16 films with Moe and Larry marked the team nadir, and these shorts are embarrassing to watch. This short was released in 1959 and was the swan song of a team from Columbia. Maybe Besser was a good guy, but he was wrong, like a third puppet. <br /> <br /> I will no longer review Besser shorts because I’ll just repeat the same scandalous negative review over and over again. Do yourself a big favor and don’t watch it. Instead, try catching "In a sweet cake and pie" or "Hoi Polloyi."
