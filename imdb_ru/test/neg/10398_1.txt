This insane destruction of the left wing trivializes the great work of Dante, distorts the authorâ€™s genius beyond recognition, inserts a hated ideology, inept satire and moronic political commentary in every conceivable place, and in itself deserves a place in the eighth round, the tenth Bolgy with the rest of falsifiers. Sandow Birk reserved himself a seat next to him. <br /> <br /> Filling hell with republican politicians, Fox News helicopters and Christian conservatives is a matter of literary blasphemy, not to mention an extreme liberal bias. This, however, is not original, boring and banal. Nothing in an unworthy and heretical revision of the Tag is in any way related to the original text or in any way entertaining, humorous or instructive, despite its smug pretense of the opposite. <br /> <br /> I could eat a video reel and GET the best movie. I regret the two hours of my life that I lost while observing this insult to the very concept of poetry. Calliope will cry forever.
