I waited a long time to watch this movie. The IFC finally held him one night. I thought it would be something like "Barfly" from Barbet Schroeder. Wrong. This film does not recreate that underworld of the well-fed, dirty, smoke-filled, character-filled bars that you associate with its stories. It is also not able to reflect the position of Bukowski, which Mickey Rourke showed well in the aforementioned film. This is a natural smart attitude. Fans of Charles Bukowski will love to see scenes from his books on screen, but those who are not familiar with his books may get a wrong impression of his work. This film looks like another “Film of the Week” about a drunkard and his relationship. If you want to get a better idea of ​​Charles Bukowski’s “Barfly” worldwide watch.
