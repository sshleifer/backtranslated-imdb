This short film was the last and only short film directed by Del Lord. Problem: it was rather weak, and the cafe scene was pretty much a replica of the curly short "Busy Pals" (1944). The interrogation scene was pretty funny, and the initial part was part of the cafe. But in this short story a lot of holes. For example, why do puppets hide in a trash can when the police arrive? In a remake of Cash (1955), director Jules White corrects this, and the reason that the puppets are hiding in the garbage can is that there is a shootout between the police and the robbers of armored vehicles. The scene in which Mo is experiencing problems with oysters was made earlier with Curley in Dutiful But Dumb (1941). Part of the creepy house was not so good, except for the fun scene outside the creepy house. To top it all, there was no sting in the end. Rating: C-
