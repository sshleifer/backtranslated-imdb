This TV show is perhaps the most pitiful show of crap on television today. Awfully predictable, obscene use of slow-motion photography, cheese plot lines. Chuck Norris - an abomination that could never be removed. The way he chooses turning each episode into a public announcement is really annoying. His actions are so lame that they make a person embarrassed. I will give credit to the series, although ... sometimes it becomes interesting, but not so much that it matters. Despite all the negative moments in this series, I still prefer it over a reality show, it cannot become more useless than this.
