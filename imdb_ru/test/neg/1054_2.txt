This is your typical comedy. <br /> <br /> Almost no laughter. No presents. No memorable lines. There are no scenes where you think to yourself: "It was smart." Nothing. The plot is embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br /> Disgusting and boring in appearance! There is no substance here. There is nothing in this movie. It doesn't matter whether it was farely or not. A shitty movie is a shitty movie, no matter who participates in it. <br /> <br /> In addition, David Spade is a terribly unfunny comedian who plays the same lousy character in any movie / series he participates in. <br /> <br /> This movie was dead on arrival. There is no life here. Not fun. No intelligence. There are many other "dumb" comedies, more enjoyable than this. This movie is just pathetic. <br /> <br /> 2/10
