Let's Get Tough is one of those films that people probably regret years later, what they did. This story about the children in the East End, full of terrible racist talk about the Japs and jokes, tells how the children want to join the army to defeat the Japanese. Since they are too young, they decided to clear the city of these mean Japanese. They find one, throw fruit at him (nobody does anything to stop them), and he draws a short sword to threaten them! Cops say to stop annoying him! He is only Chinese! He is on our side! When the children come back to apologize, the Chinese are dead! This is all part of this huge Japanese and German spy ring! Children make sure that it is stopped at all costs! I am sure that all this was good when it was done (1942), but if you look now, you certainly understand that this is clearly a product of his time. Full of stereotypes, German and Japanese. It's funny that the children of the East End have a black guy in the group, and they didn't spare him either. That's great.
