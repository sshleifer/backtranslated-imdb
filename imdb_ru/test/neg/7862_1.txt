The curse of the wolf begins with the fact that the involuntary werewolf Dakota (René Porada) manages to escape from her "flock" and get into the city, where after 6 months she works in the veterinary service. The rest of the Dakota pack is unhappy and wants to get her back, their leader Michael (Todd Hums) says she will come back to them, but the fat werewolf Franklin (Brian Heffron) catches her scent, and the pack decides to aggravate the problem and bring her back using her attachments to to my human friends, including her boyfriend Danny (Dennis Carver). Can Dakota save Danny and finally get rid of werewolf chasers? I doubt that you care ... <br /> <br /> Executive producer, scriptwriter and director Len Kabasinsky, who also played a rather large role in the film as Stick. I was afraid to watch The Curse of the Wolf, as Kabassinsky was the man of Swamp Zombies (2005), which is certainly one of the worst films in history. Unfortunately, my worst fears have been confirmed, and I must say that “The Curse of the Wolf” is really a terrible film in all respects, both conceptually and technically. “The Curse of the Wolf” is a film in which a low budget dictates what is happening, and the script, and not the scenario that dictates the budget. You have the impression that everything was written and conceived in order to take advantage of the several sets and actors that they had, you can almost imagine that the creators say that we have several actors, basic equipment and a couple of locations, so let's make a horror movie around them. The story is terrible (Michael locates Dakota, looking at a big dog that two women walk), a character is awful (a big fat werewolf guy who puffs a lot), the dialogue is awful (almost everyone is in this) and there is never any motivation for everything what happens (why does the pack so desperately try to get Dakota back?), people just do seemingly random things, and since director Kabasinsky’s experience is related to martial arts, he insists on inserting a lot of random things. martial arts fight sequences in plot. No offense, but it should be a horror movie, not a martial arts, right? In fact, besides the presence of a few werewolves, it will be difficult for you to describe The Curse of the Wolf as something that is approaching a horror movie. After almost two hours, it seems that it goes on forever, and so slowly and without incident that it is simply not funny. <br /> <br /> Director Kabasinsky obviously worked on a small budget, but this poor film making must be a crime. There is no continuity between frames, battle scenes look awful and so poorly prepared that it is not true, and sometimes it is impossible to follow what is happening, due to unstable editing and poor camera angle or the fact that it is sometimes so dark that you literally do not see nothing Seriously, during the Curse of the Wolf there are times when the screen is completely black and you see nothing, I would not want to sit and watch it on a low-resolution fuzzy VHS. The sound is terrible too, you can hear the wind and the wind from the microphone! There are also many other unpleasant and unwanted ambient sounds in almost every scene. Did the production really have any lighting equipment doing it? It does not look like it. Special effects mainly consist of a werewolf mask, which is similar to what Halloween stores sell to children, they mostly look awful. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the Curse of the Wolf is just as bad as I, I'm sorry, because I know that it had a low budget, but it really is awful to sit and try to get some entertainment. This is a quality student film, sorry if it sounds unfair, but it is a fact. The game, well, you can probably guess, so I’ll stop right here before saying something else negative, I mean, I’ve done enough of it already, and I really don’t get pleasure from it. <br /> <br /> The curse of the wolf is terrible, and conceptually, and technically, this is a real routine that needs to be experienced. “The Curse of the Wolf” is a type of film where, while you watch it, it seems that time stops, it is a type of film that lasts almost two hours, but feels like two years. One of the worst films you or I may ever see, definitely avoid.
