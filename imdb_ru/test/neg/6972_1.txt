Let me say this about Edward D. Woode Jr. He had a passion for his work, which I would like to have more people. If we all had optimism and Ed Wood's overwhelming hope, the world would probably be much better. I am familiar with the story of Ed Wood and several times saw the most remarkable biographical film "Ed Wood" (1994). I admire his courage and desire for his beloved work; I still admire his never-say attitude. He had a love of directing, and I would like to have more people in modern Hollywood. <br /> <br /> But that does not make his films more interesting to watch. And Glen or Glenda, his first and most confessional film, is probably his worst. <br /> <br /> “Glen or Glenda” is a dying cult film about a transvestite named Glen (played by the director / writer Ed Wood himself) who, despite his love for his bride Barbara (Dolores Fuller), cannot to conquer his passion for transvestitism, in which he wears women's clothes and a wig and thus becomes ... Glenda! The story of Glenn / Glenda is told by a doctor, and a mysterious character named “The Scientist”, played by horror veteran Bela Lugosi, also tells and observes him. Oh, and there is also some implication about the character Alan / Anna, who becomes a transsexual after the story of Christina Jorgenson, on whom this film was originally titled “I Changed My Sex!” Previously had to be based. <br /> <br /> I already lowered my jaw? Well, no matter how much I want to warn you, if you have never seen it, I would never lie about the film, and in this plot synopsis there is not a single word of lies. This is all true. This is a film about crossdressers and transsexuals, a topic that at first glance sounds not very attractive and not very attractive. I’m sure that with a good script and a good director (he didn’t have one) that “Glen or Glenda”, despite the subject matter, could be a very touching picture. This is a confessional film from Wood, as he was a transvestite both in real life and on screen. But, again, this does not make it a good film ... or watchable in this respect. Glen or Glenda is a messy, unorganized mess of a movie that plunges into new trenches in the realm of bad cinema. It makes no more sense than his notoriously stupid scene, where Bela Lugosi shouts: “Pull the rope!” For inexplicable shots of bison stamping. Most of the film is told in a monotonous voice, reminding me of some very bad short informative films I've seen before. It's like one of those really bad short films, extended to a seventy-minute film and doubly boring. We sit there for ages in anticipation of a plot that never comes. There is no real attempt to even accumulate energy when the camera is locked in one position for many grueling minutes and long periods of time when nothing happens. The only moments that deserve someone's time are those of Bela Lugosi, who manage to shed light on these dark trenches. I suppose that Lugosi should be like a film deity, but personally I didn’t care who or what he should be. I will tell you who he was: a gifted actor who started the trash. But he and Wood were very good friends and loved working with each other, which is very good for him. <br /> <br /> I will always admire Edward D. Wood Jr. for his passion for cinema, but I will never be that way While I live, I admire his films. A film critic once called Ed Wood's films “innocent fun,” but I think even that is doubtful. Innokenty? Yes. Fun? No sir. And if “Citizen Kane” is Mount Everest of the cinematic world, then “Glen or Glenda” is probably the Mariana Trench.
