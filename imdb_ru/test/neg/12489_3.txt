At the beginning of the film Ramgopal Verma says that “Sarkar” is his tribute to the Godfather. This is more like an insult. He terribly pales in comparison with the classic Coppola. Although no one expected Ramgopal Verma to fill Coppola's shoes, the film caused a lot of expectations and noise. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan plays Sarkar, a character who automatically conducts instant comparisons with Shiv Sen’s Indian political party Supremo Ball Tekkerei. Abhishek Bachchan plays his son Shankar, who is returning from abroad and is embroiled in Sarkar's politics at home. Just like Al Pacino in the original godfather. <br /> <br /> Like most of the Bollywood characters, the incidents and characters are clearly simplified and lack any solid foundation. Fast phone calls and flash ads turn a movie from one direction to another. Abyshek enters into a dark relationship of politics and the underworld in Mumbai, like a duck going into the water. Amitab Bachchan as Sarkar should look gorgeous and powerful, he just looks old and ignorant. Most of his acting skills are centered around a constant look at different things around the set - the actor in front of him, on the floor or in some other random direction. <br /> <br /> However, Kay Kay plays very well, like the eldest son of Vishnu. Just like Zakir Hussein in the role of Rashid, a smuggler of drug dealers from Dubai, who wants to get his footing in Mumbai. This actor has a terrific presence on the screen and can cause chills all over the spine exactly as it looks. The moment he enters the screen, you want to run away and hide under the bed. <br /> <br /> Despite all the obvious flaws, the film did not work at the box office. The buzz and the big cast clearly help. In addition, Verme manages to contain your interest, albeit for the second half of the film. In fact, he makes a sequel to this, which, I am sure, will be more than the same tariff.
