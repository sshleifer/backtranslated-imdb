The movie about the monsters of the 50s, which can be forgotten, shows truly awful special effects - the claw in question is a giant puppet, because of which Jim Henson wants to kill himself. I just watched the movie last Thursday, and I can't even tell you who was in it. This is a bad sign. I was told that when the audience for the premiere of the film laughed at him behind the scenes ... and that was in the 50s, when the standards for special effects were much lower. In fact, I had to leave the theater as soon as the word “producer Sam Katsman” appeared on the screen, if I knew what was good for me, but then I also got through Harum Scrum, so I think I deserve.
