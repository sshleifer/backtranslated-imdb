I assume that the heart of the filmmakers was in the right place, but, to be honest, this film is really shameless. I was offended by the tone and the complete ending of the cop. You can’t treat such questions so easily! Not knowing the last warning about the film ... we are watching a guy shoot his 9-month pregnant wife and two sons and have to follow him for the next 2+ hours when he tries to create a new life ?? You cannot have sympathy for the character who does this. I can not! Not to mention the fact that until the last hour 1/2 of this unnecessarily long film we are not given anything, why this guy suffers so much. No memories, sudden reactions to noise or movement - things that are affected by these vets. All we know is that he is in pain in his wife's ass and cannot financially take care of her and his 3 children. It looks like there really wasn’t any research that current Iraqi vets are going through. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film is extremely suffering from hard and completely inappropriate results. This is a catastrophe. This is really bad for some really good actions from the male leader, and sometimes Joe Morton. This heralds EVERYTHING you should feel, and sometimes gives completely wrong clues! Again, this was a brutal act that this guy did, and therefore to see how he gets a new job, meets a new blonde, the fight over the counter does NOT fit! And really, the ending? What a damn cop! How dare you. <br /> <br /> There are much richer films telling about the impact of war on returning soldiers, please do not worry about it.
