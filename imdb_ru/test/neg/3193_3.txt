Interlaced point of view can be a good idea in some films. Here it is a complete mess. <br /> <br /> But a complete mess begins with a story: the dumb video clip wants to make a light comedy with a pernicious noir-like female character. She is gorgeous, and no man can hold out to dive, crawl and suck her toes. It is all the more materialistic that it looks as if the butter does not melt in the mouth. <br /> <br /> The film melts in its own pretentiousness: to be smart, fun and beautiful. Falocretinism at its best. Only white trash, please.
