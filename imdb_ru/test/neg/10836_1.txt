Killer Flood: The Day the Damn Broke: 1/10: Finally a movie whose title is proof of a spoiler. Sorry, let me correct even by the low standards of disaster films, even by the low standards created for television films about disasters, this is really terrible. Where should I start? <br /> <br /> The dammaker may have once seen a photo of the dam, but I doubt it. With most dams, especially large ones that generate electricity, oh, I don’t know a power station nearby, some sluice gates through which water passes, even a high voltage electrical wire is pierced or two. <br /> <br /> The dam is also somewhat understaffed. Two, count them, two employees man the whole dam, all three shifts. And the employees were obviously imported from a clichéd film about the Second World War, because they heroically and for quite a long time eulogized death scenes full of photographs of grandchildren swimming past. Hell, one of them manages to shoot the dam itself, which is beyond description. <br /> <br /> The special effects consist of running water superimposed on a photograph of the city, so that the film of the sixties Godzilla looks like the Matrix. A three-year-old drawing with a blue pencil on film would bring better results. Since cash disaster shots are useless, like the rest of the movie? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the script and actions follow the instructions of the special effects. This is not a diamond in its raw form. That's rough. Is this a guilty pleasure? Killer Flood is awful enough to cause laughter, and the film itself has that serious incompetence that makes good cult classics, but bad disaster films should age like good wine. (Avalanche, Roy, Meteor) It is also doubtful that Michelle Green, hiding from a flood in a dumpster with a golden retriever, will ever be in line with the great Henry Fonda, which the raisin, which is supposed to be a killer bee, will be knocked out. Come back with me in 2024.
