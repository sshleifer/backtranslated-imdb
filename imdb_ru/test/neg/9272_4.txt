The story of a former fur seal who is currently a military doctor assigned to a modern Russian submarine with a nurse. This should answer the call for help sent by a dying member of the original team. The submarine was overtaken by terrorists prone to destruction. So, we see the duo trying to regain control. And this is due to the fear that the US Navy could free up everything they have on a terrorist submarine to prevent the launch of their arsenal. Be careful of the early sex scene in the first quarter of the movie. A pair of unexplained scenes at the end. See when you have time. Do not miss anything, even if you let the show go while you walk, bring yourself a cup of coffee: slow motion.
