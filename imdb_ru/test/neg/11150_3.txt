To sum up, skip the End of Days and see how Roman Polanski rented the Ninth Gate. This film is the perfect stereotypical American film, and The Ninth Gate is the perfect stereotypical European film. <br /> <br /> “Ninth Gate”: noir, intelligent, pleasant, atmospheric, great game (Johnny Depp, esp), beautiful scenery, good cinematography, funny wit, intelligence, profanity, reflections. The only mistake was that several people did not understand the open finals and said that the film was “shitty” because of this, and there were several questionable scenes. <br /> <br /> End of days: Excessively cruel, liberal use of foul language, NO musical accompaniment, except for the unsuccessful attempt of a commercial soundtrack, which was heard only when Gabriel Byrne walked around New York like Satan (but what you might have noticed was Corn Jonathan Davis's incomprehensible cry) sex, has nothing to do with plot, violence, incredibly predictable, violence, and I mentioned much more violence? I think some of the special effects were good, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe I’m wrong, but I thought that the “Ninth Gate” was much more interesting, bizarre, original and smarter. But perhaps the Americans do not need it. * dripping with cynicism * Even if I'm American, sometimes I wonder.
