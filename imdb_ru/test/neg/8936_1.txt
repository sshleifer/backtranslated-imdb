One of the worst films ever made ... If you can get through these movies without falling asleep, then you are fine, no matter how much you turn up the volume, you cannot hear what “actors” are ( ?) speaking, and if you can really see what comes from a horrible movie (I mean, damn it, if you can't find something that works better ... use a home movie camera ... At least you can say exactly what is happening!) <br /> <br /> It is beyond my imagination how people make a film like this, skip it call through cracks and run off on video ... and even more .. how people who do this do not know how awful it is ... oh my God ... (!) <br /> <br /> After that I just told you ... If you wait for me to give you a brief summary of this part of the film, I have nothing to say. ... a group of people resting on motorcycles is lost in the woods, and a bunch of people are terrorizing them ... or something like that ... which is more important than a fighter than a horror ... this “movie” (?) NO interest ... i If someone likes it, I literally feel for you .... <br /> <br /> Absolute rubbish ... not even one of those cheap funny movies to watch, rent .. " Plan 9 From Outerspace "and get the ball
