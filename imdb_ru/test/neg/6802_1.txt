I do not know how this film received so many positive reviews. You can call it “artistic” and “beautifully shot”, but these things do not make up for an empty story filled with sexual hints. I wish I didn't waste my time watching this movie. Instead of being biographical, it was a bad excuse for encouraging weird and indecent behavior. It was just another attempt by Hollywood to convince us that such a life is normal and normal. From the very beginning I asked myself what the meaning of this film was, and I continued to watch, hoping that it would change, and was very disappointed that he continued in the same spirit. I'm so glad I didn't spend the money to see it in the theater!
