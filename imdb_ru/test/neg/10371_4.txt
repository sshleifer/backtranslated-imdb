*** EASY SPOILERS *** This release of the Full Moon franchise slightly changes the storyline and implements some new elements. First installed a new master of dolls. Secondly, the dolls become good in this sequel. Finally, it also presents some elements of fiction / fantasy. <br /> <br /> The new tenant of the infamous Bay Hotel, his girlfriend, her psychic friend and this psychic guy stumbled upon the puppet box Andre Toulon. They will also learn about a demon from another dimension, who considers Toulon responsible for stealing a secret to enlivening the lifeless. So, Suteh (demon) sends totems, a group of little greedy creatures that look like gremlins without ears. Then it is the puppet troupe that should take care of the interdimensional threat that is trying to kill new friends there. <br /> <br /> Like most low-budget films, this film is replete with problems of continuity. How did the puppets back in the trunk? Why no one remembers the last murder case in a hotel? Who bought the hotel? Why would a contractor build a building with a history of massacres? All this and many other questions will not be answered ... never. <br /> <br /> The real surprise of this film is the action. This is actually very good. The actors take it with unusual enthusiasm, especially for the Full Moon group of noname. Teresa Hill was especially impressed with the shy, nervous, extrasensory Lauren. Chandra West (Suzy) was also a pleasant surprise. Gordon Hill was a tolerant protagonist. But Cameron was too annoying to worry about. Thank God Scandinavian, he dies before halfway. <br /> <br /> Dolls are ordinary animated characters. With some improvements. There emotions (especially jester) are much more human because of the sounds that were given to them. Blade hiss, Pinhead grunt and Six-Shooter sneaker have been improved and sound much better. At best, the animation of the stop is only average, especially totems. They do not seem to move as smoothly as the previous part of the series. Also Sutekh costume is absolutely amazing. How should we be afraid of a creature so humorous looking. <br /> <br /> This story seems a bit juvenile for the series. I think Charlie Band wanted to focus on a younger demography. The violence mitigated in this film seems to be saying the same thing. Gore fans will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think that the above is the main problem with which this film cannot be reconciled. It does not have violence for gorewhores. The tongue is a little cleaner. Yet it is too cruel and harsh for tiny ones. That is why the film gets low marks. I have to say that general reviews are mostly fair.
