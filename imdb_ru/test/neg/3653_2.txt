I was looking forward to watching this film, and everyone who saw it liked it. I was completely disappointed. The game was so exaggerated. It seems that the script collected 25 different scenarios from different films, arbitrarily chose the dialogue and put them together to form one plagiarized script. <br /> <br /> Spoilers: wasn’t there any cliches in this movie? There was mobstyle, homosexuality, prostitution, serial killer, fire, numerous godfather imitators, the main character in love with a prostitute, dressing up, police torture, Hannibal Lechter's injury, I could go on and on. <br /> <br /> The line is similar (the godfather wants a prostitute) <br /> <br /> - “Ben Senin Arik Chalismani istemiyorum” (I don’t want you to work anymore) <br /> <br /> - "Ben Kalismasam Kirai Kim Odecek?" (Who would pay for the apartment if I didn't work) Unreal scenes: we never saw a single policeman during serial killers, but when the main character disappeared, his father was taken by the police and tortured in for several weeks. <br /> <br /> The only way I can understand from this entire film is if the scene that I had was strictly edited from the original. I definitely do not recommend it, and would like to discuss it further with anyone who would like to do so. <br /> <br />
