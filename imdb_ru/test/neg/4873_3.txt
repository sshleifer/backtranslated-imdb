MST3K aft. This is so bad that it is really worth seeing for this very reason. There are some funny things in it, such as a mysterious device, on which a bad guy is seen working on the whole film - this turns out to be this tiny helicopter that flies, carrying and firing a machine gun, almost without reeling, but shot down with a bag with balloons ( the kind that they release at political conventions). Many other wonderful touches of this kind. Stars Charlie Sheen. There is one scene where he spends five minutes recording the conversation, only to accidentally drop a micro cassette in Potomac. If they had played Emilio Estevez in that role that they would never have had.
