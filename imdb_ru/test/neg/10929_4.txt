This is a rather simplistic novel. A girl finds a boy, a girl loves a boy, a girl loses a boy, a girl finds a boy. Colleen Moore is an outstanding ingredient in this recipe, demonstrating an amazingly diverse dramatic / romantic performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. Equally good are the special effects in aerial combat. <br /> <br /> Moore plays a French girl whose mother turned her field in the British air squadron during World War I. She is a "daughter of the regiment", beloved as a younger sister. This mix includes replacing the downed Gary Cooper flyer. At first they hate each other, then they love each other, then the entire squadron is sent on a suicide mission. Cooper returns, but falls in the village, and the Red Cross unit deletes him. Moore searches for him, he is told at the hospital that he is dead, then wanders through the streets until he calls from the hospital window and they are reunited. <br /> <br /> This is a nice little novel, but hardly more than that. Recommended for fans of Miss Moore and Mr. Cooper
