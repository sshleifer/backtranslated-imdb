I do not remember too much about this film, except for the fact that there was an obvious gratuitous destruction of lamps (lamps). Almost every battle scene included the unnecessary and senseless destruction of useful lighting fixtures, even if they were decorated with cheese, cylindrical shades in the style of the 70s, to match the time in history. In one case, the hoarse destruction of the lamp occurs in a home fight between the brothers in the living room and the dining room of their mother’s house, and the lamps are taken out in both rooms. However, the worst damage occurs a few moments later in the bookmaker’s office and includes, among other things, the tilting of the lamp with a ceramic horse head base, which, therefore, disintegrates, and a strong cylindrical dent in it fights Later, this lamp also collapses when a guy shoots, causing further damage to the plastic-coated ceiling lamp. <br /> <br /> Although this film encourages a particularly wasteful attitude towards lamps, it should be remembered that lamps, regardless of their cheap construction or clumsy appearance, are still valuable for the lighting they provide. However, if you ever feel the need to break a lamp, I highly recommend this film.
