Because she, too, is now the target of the killers. Julia needs to find out, friend Kevin or a friend, and reveal an ominous secret before the killer strikes another blow, ”reads the DVD cover briefly. <br /> <br /> This thriller quietly falls apart, but sometimes it's interesting. The background telephone scene of Stalker Shaun Devine (near a policeman plot) and Mr. Lowe's violin (rest wounds) are tensely played, but at the beginning it’s hard not to miss the fact that one of the supposedly sophisticated killers deliberately twists his foot in red paint at the scene of the murder. Unfortunately, this is not a difficult plot point, and there is the worst story stumbles in motion. Silent "is a good way to spend time, if there is nothing better, or you are in love with Law and his film colleagues. <br /> <br /> **** Dead Silent (1999)) Roger Cardinal ~ Catherine Mary Stewart, Rob Lowe, Arlene Aguayo-Stuart, Larry Day
