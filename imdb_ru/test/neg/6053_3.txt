I did not hear anything about this project until I saw that it would be launched, so I looked at it completely unbiased. And, well, things, the cast is full of strong players. <br /> <br /> Sorry. , , it's horrible. I do not mean that it is not good; I mean, this is extremely bad - sometimes it’s so funny, but basically it’s just boring. His strongest attraction is that attractive people are as naked as US network television allows, but this is teasing and has no meaning, and having nymphs as reserve characters cannot justify a few hours of bad television. <br /> <br /> There are two main problems that actors cannot overcome. First, the script is * terrible *. Yes, amending the myth of Hercules (which, first, of course, is not the only monolithic story) is traditional, but this version is relentlessly boring and too often stupid (and sometimes quite unusual), with a terrible career, bits borrowed here and there (and several parts that seem to belong in different films), and a truly awful dialogue. The dialogue is often unbearably bad, in fact, to such an extent that you feel embarrassed for the actors. Sean Astin, apparently now typed as a second banana, seems especially burdened with one terrible line after another. There is no consistency of tone or atmosphere and a bit of cohesion. <br /> <br /> Secondly, most of the special effects are really bad. Really bad. Sometimes there is a decent part of CGI, but basically, again, you feel really embarrassed on behalf of the actors. I have no idea what the budget was for this project, but it looks like crap compared to the “Battle of the Titans” or even “Hercules: Legendary Journeys” and does not even differ very favorably from the old Lou Ferrigno and Italian. "Spaghetti" films of Hercules. Just painfully miserable. <br /> <br /> There are many other problems - the story is unnecessarily complicated and cannot be kept up with, and Hercules himself is not presented as a very interesting character. Almost everyone who does not have a European accent tries to fake something like this, which is not just amateur and outdated, but never made sense, firstly: the drama does not get better just because the actors use British accents, after all. But the horrible script and equally terrible effects flood it all at once. <br /> <br /> For the sake of justice, “Hercules” was obviously conceived as a four-hour miniseries, but truncated (for this airing, in any case) to a three-hour television film. I don’t know what they cut, but perhaps the edit made the situation worse. I don’t think you could make Hercules good by adding to it, but that doesn’t mean that continuity, say, has not suffered from network changes. However, I will not watch the American version.
