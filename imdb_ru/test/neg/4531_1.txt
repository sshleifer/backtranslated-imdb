<br /> <br /> After the wit and vitality of Highway 61 and Roadkill, I expected this film to shine, but it was so bloated and self-deceptive as a parody of hard rock stars. The tempo dragged on, which was not helped by excessive hallucination, the characters were flat and not memorable, and Art Bergmann was not Jello Biafra. I had to poke myself so as not to fall asleep.
