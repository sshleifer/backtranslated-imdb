A woman who is engaged in art, begins a passionate affair with a man named John. They make love wherever they are, and they play sex games. The problem I encountered was that it was all they did. In this film there was no plot at all, or I simply did not see it. Hot erotic passion was the best thing in this film, but I wanted something else to happen. Perhaps he could be a serial killer or she could have a secret. I just needed something, and all that was there was a bunch of love scenes. Not that it was bad or something else, I just wanted more things to happen in the film. Perhaps a colleague, too, slept with him. Anything! I was very upset that this was all that was. Mickey Rourke was so hot back then. I wonder what happened?
