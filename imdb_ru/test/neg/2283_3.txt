I bought a cassette with this movie on the recommendation of other IMDb users and must say that I was very disappointed. I am a college professor and showed this film to my class; they voted unanimously for the fact that this is a terrible film. I think that if you like the old Dark Shadows series, then maybe you will like it. (I liked Dark Shadows when I was a kid in the 70s, but now I think it’s just awful.) The first half hour, at least, have some loyalty to Wilde's novel. After that, the story sharply deviates from the course, at least in comparison with the MGM version of 1945 (which received two Oscars). Nigel Davenport as Lord Henry is truly the only thing that can be watched during the whole performance. Many other actors play poorly, the music is melodramatic, and the film looks terrible. In fact, this is not a film at all - it was clearly captured on video and has a claustrophobic BBC look. The opening scenes are particularly poorly lit, women's costumes are terrible (men look good), and many characters — including Dorian — seem to have a 1970s rather than Victorian hairstyle. The film includes Wilde’s many conversations well, but the off-screen text in Dorian’s voice contains a lot of garbage, which is directly contrary to Wilde’s character. I'm a big fan of Oscar Wilde, and I'm afraid that he must have flipped over in his grave when this monster was accomplished. His only improvement over the 1945 version is that homosexual overtones are definitely more obvious without being tough. I have not seen any of the more recent versions, but if someone is interested in having the story well told, I would recommend the 1945 MGM to black and white over this one.
