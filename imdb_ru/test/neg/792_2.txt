I thought it was worth seeing this film, since I am currently making a film about a mysterious box, so it would be great to see how this film took and developed the idea of ​​a mysterious and unexpected box. <br /> <br /> I was expecting this movie very much before I went to the cinema. with actresses like Cameron Diaz, you can expect the actress, especially her, to be great. the action was a kind of disappointment for the film, the accents of the characters changed throughout the film, which made it incredible. <br /> <br /> The very idea of ​​a strange box that can fulfill your dreams, but destroy others, is such a brilliant story, but I feel that the director let her down, this film had the potential, it could be much better than was <br /> <br /> This film had nothing to do with it. it was too confusing and needed a steady plot. no one wants to go to the cinema and go out, thinking that I just watched “I don’t understand at all”, sometimes it can be exciting and make people want to watch it again, but this film made people want never want to hear about the movie again . while watching, I noticed that half of the spectators had gone to the finals. I feel that every person was disappointed in watching this film because of high expectations and because of the slow parts of the film. <br /> <br /> Let's throw the bad moments aside ... but I liked Scene, where the son is in the bathroom at the end. it was unexpected, it reminded me of a horror movie, and the way it was combined made me imagine it, and how terrible and scary it would be to be in that position. the lighting and effects made him look great, this scene looked a little more 1990s than 1970s, as it should be in this movie. <br /> <br /> This film was confusing because there were a lot of different details in it. The parts you expect will be summarized at the end, where everything is clear, but it is not, it completely contradicted the audience’s expectations, even if you leave the film on a hanger, not giving the audience a reason why everything can work and do really well, it was not, it was a creative, unusual film that I thought he could be better, disappointed, he didn’t like it, I wouldn’t buy it on DVD, to be honest.
