This show demonstrates the depth to which the drama sank before the watershed of British television. With these boring scenarios, mediocre play, bad stories, terrible dialogue, everyone has to watch a DVD of any old ER episode to see the excellent drama in the hospital. <br /> <br /> None of the actors involved in this show seem to be able to act! <br /> <br /> If you want low-quality, but easily perceived television in the style of a soap opera, this is the show for you. Personally, I like something with a lot of meat on the bone. Unfortunately, as with all other UK license payers, I finance this slag.
