For those of you who don’t remember movies - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/ - it came out in '79 (I think it’s been a while, so naturally Nunzio decided that he could just repeat) say he wrote it - yes, that's right!). <br /> <br /> Acting so far overboard - “tough guys” walk with shoulders bent forward, giving the impression that they are bigger than they are. in fact, the “hero” also seems to passionately snort and roll his eyes, like a buzz to express anxiety / anger to the celluloid eye. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of racial message here, from a Sicilian point of view (keep in mind this is about the 3rd generation downstream ... the original worms arrived in OZ after the war and during my childhood - yes, I am Australian. So Vogg-yiness is very diluted - they even sound like real blue Australians - there is no “accent of dago” anywhere (there is another slang for you, nun!) <br /> <br /> Maori with Sunnies (Sunglasse s) at 4 am - must be cool to be blinded by the sun in the middle of the night, and it looks like Redfern ... it's on the tedious the end of this film. Nunzio tried to copy the taste of the Warriors, but left too many holes in the story. How about coincidences? <br /> <br /> The warriors had a gang of guys with baseball bats, white face makeup, haunting heroes at the station and fighting with them - the gang of the Nuntsios is prosecuted at the railway station by a gang of guys armed with whitish masks. The warriors lure into the room a gang of girls who attack them - a crowd of Nuntsios wants to crash into the house of friends who are inhabited, yes, a gang of girls - the Warriors have almost too many copies about here. <br /> <br /> I am saddened that people do not want to see other movements from the OZ because of this joke - what about Mad Max - Commander and Master of the World? Not all films are shot by such bad actors that they have to finance their films. <br /> <br /> As for the other actors in this series, they seem to have borrowed their reply from the “nuns”, because they are all just as bad as the others - don’t worry about this movie! I can't get my money back - so save yours!
