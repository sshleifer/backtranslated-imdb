I have never seen the other two Ninja films, and as far as I know, they are known, but for some reason I watched this one. This one starts pretty fast, as this ninja goes for a super kill. It is almost impossible to stop, because it requires a lot of bullets to destroy. Although he is not counting, since he ultimately possesses a woman, and then he continues his methods of killing, using her as his tool. The other ninja gets into a fight, and apparently the only way to kill a ninja is another ninja, so he volunteers. This leads to a big battle at the end when the dead ninja returns to his body and they fight in the whole war. It sounds better than it turned out, but at least it was not boring.
