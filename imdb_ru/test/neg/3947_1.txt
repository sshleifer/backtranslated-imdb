I did my best. God knows that I tried to love this Swiss cheese from the film, but the story was too full of holes, big enough to drive a cart. The action as a whole was even, and the characters are so nice that you regretted that they died, like the recently spattered cockroaches scattered to die their horrible deaths. Overall, however, it was not very scary. In the end, we saw eerie fast moving figures in the background, starting with "The Brood", why, when / and it was scary, then not for long. This film simply never decided the main points of the plot, and this is the work of the author. Naturally, you expect the director to understand that the story does not make sense. For example, who was the secret room behind the closet, why did the bloodthirsty ghost not die when she got the nails, as prescribed in the book they read earlier? Why did the computer say “game over” for character Frankie, even though he lived? This list has no end. I am not very pleased to recommend this film, because it makes you feel that you have wasted your time, and in really scary moments there was not enough return.
