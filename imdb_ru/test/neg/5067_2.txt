This music is completely unrelated to the film, occasionally appearing as the Wagner bombing and the rush of the Lone Ranger, otherwise it is completely absent. Acting, beyond the two principles, does not exist. It would be a great student film. Russian soldiers are just models trying to act. Constant interruptions with the angles of blasting chambers and monochrome clips of people were quite annoying, but this is only a personal feeling. The storyline is no worse than others, in fact, no worse than most, completely ignoring logic, reason and reality. At least no one walked in front of the machine gun for three minutes without a hit. The three top bad guys were polite.
