Although the acting was excellent, I spent the whole movie waiting for the nasty boy who caused so much grief to many characters, got his final enemy, and instead everyone else suffered except him, and he got the job of her husband, whose wife is death , running away from his friends, beats the girl he overdosed and tried to rape. Even his friend gives money to his father, but the butterfly effect does not fully return to his work. <br /> <br /> This is a very dark movie, as every character that is influenced suffers from endless depression. It seems that none of the normal ways to help is effective, and the only thing that the authorities seem to do is hand out stress pills. <br /> <br /> If this is normal behavior in Finland now, I will never go back just in case if such an immoral butterfly affected me, and I would be as destroyed as the characters in this film.
