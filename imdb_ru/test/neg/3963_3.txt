You know that a movie could be much better when an animal - in this case a small dog - is the best actor on the screen! The acting in this film is so bad, so amateur that the dog hesitated, watching it. He (Grow, Our Golden Retriever) may have done better than the people here. <br /> <br /> By now, this is almost a banal story: a child finds an animal, one parent does not like and is not wanted, but the “pet” saves children, and now he is a hero and an official family member. Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> I remember that this film was a great success, but until the mid-90s they did not bother to see it on VHS. I was shocked how everything was bad. Why so much fuss over the movie? Is it because in the early 70s there was so much dirt that a good family movie appeared in the crowd? Maybe. In the decade of the 70s there were not so many useful entertainments, and many people loved little cute stories about animals. Who could resist this cute dog? Not me. But the film I can give up: this is a class B storyline with a terrible game. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for lovers of small dogs, and I mean “lovers”, because even the average pet owner will fall asleep trying to watch this movie these days.
