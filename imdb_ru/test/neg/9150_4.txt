Yes, it is true that it was Jessica Alba who led me to this film, because without her I would never have chosen him. <br /> <br /> But I find it long, boring and, most importantly, non-original. All this time I thought the story was full of cliches, and the direction is very boring. It was therefore surprising to see that the director and the writer are one and the same person. I pay attention not to forget all his next films. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s a pity because all the good things were at hand: Malaysia is a wonderful jungle, it was the British Empire, and the cast is wonderful: Jessica knows how to open her soul and at once she found the right film . Bob Hoskins shows a lot of experience, and he had to win an award for this role. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing is that it forces me to open a world map to find this island, because if you assume that this will happen in South Asia, you do not know where exactly! Ah, a small plane flight with red lines in the Indiana Jones film !!!
