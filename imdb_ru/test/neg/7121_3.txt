I liked the first Grudge, I watched it in an empty theater, and, frankly, I was shocked. Never before have I heard the unique sound of chilling sounds, it really captured. <br /> <br /> However, there were some good jumps in Grudge 2, but the storyline was very dirty and not quite believable, and everywhere, with several scenes (like a woman urinating out of fear, or another woman drinking a jug milk with a jug of milk, which again tears it all up), which actually did not make sense, and did not help to increase the creep factor of the film. During these scenes and several other people from the sold-out audience, they actually laughed out loud. It was a good indicator showing how there was no thrill, chill or goose bumps in this film. The game was decent, the emotions are believable, so I take off my hat to the actors, but the erratic plotline and the lack of direction were what I couldnâ€™t shake during the whole movie. I was annoyed more than anything else: all the same old mouthfuls of a vicious mouth, a couple of quick unexpected scenes that made me jump, but overall I was very disappointed.
