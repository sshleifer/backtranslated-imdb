I never left the movie before. I entertained this idea a couple of times, but this time I did it, I snuck in to see the end of another movie, but I had to go back and see the end of Rage as I waited for my friends. They told me that I was not much missed while I was gone. I was completely offended by the whole movie in such a grand manner that I cannot even describe it. My instinct of instinct prompted me to leave the theater. It was an internal reaction to a terrible movie. The plot centered around the brutal actions of some reprehensible adolescents against vulnerable and worried others. There was not a ray of light, nor a responsible or handsome person who could provide contrast. I found that even the “good guys” from the movie did nothing for me, they were stupid, stupid, tearful, or simply unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> Repetitive graphic suicidal images were too exaggerated, unnecessary and disgusting. (Not "I easily fell out of my head," but rather in the image of disregard for humanity). And besides the repetition of this scene, in slow motion, from very many points of view, other visual aspects (interesting camera work, etc.) Had potential, but sometimes became annoying. I am a person who loves movies and trying to find good things about them. I can usually find something good to balance a not-so-good movie. I'm not saying that there was nothing good in this film, but I say that, whatever it is, I can't remember it because of all the other crap that drove me crazy. I am also very sorry about this. Perhaps the best parts were clips from the classic original.
