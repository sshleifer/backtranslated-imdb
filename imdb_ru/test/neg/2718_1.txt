As Joe Bob Briggs would say, this film is largely dependent on the talents of the actresses, and not on their talent. In the early 1990s, the show "babies in bikini" has very little money to buy it, in addition to showing beautiful women, almost naked. Joe Estevez, Martin Sheen's younger brother, proves once again that his film career will be far from his brotherâ€™s. <br /> <br /> Avoid this if you do not like to look at beautiful women in scanty clothes. This is the only thing that redeems it.
