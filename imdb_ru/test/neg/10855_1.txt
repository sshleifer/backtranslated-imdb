Perhaps this is the worst and most disappointing film I've ever seen. I spent four years at two universities and I know that there must be a good film about this experience. This is not so “Act” terrible, and the plot does not exist. <br /> <br /> Here are some of my one-year hostel cases. <br /> <br /> 1) A smart guy who unconsciously got off with a transvestite. 2) The best friend of a pair of two girls - one with a huge chest, and the other with the nickname "brick". 3) A couple that fucks too loud. 4) The guy who gets all the girls 5) The guy from Northern Ireland who is very difficult to understand. 6) McDonalds in bed. 7) Curry every night for a week. 8) A student beats up, a couple of my comrades went to the hospital. 9) Discarded joint that started the fire. 10) Flood 11) A guy who wakes up on the floor and discovers that every piece of furniture was taken from his room. <br /> <br /> And if I can make this list in 5 minutes and in real life, I’m sure that several writers can do more, much better. <br /> <br /> And for a movie named after the song Sleeper, where is the Britpop soundtrack?
