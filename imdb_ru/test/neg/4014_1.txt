I only saw the episode with the minimum wage, but I am not going to watch the others, how can this be? Morgan begins to theatrically complain about his terrible situation, living on the minimum wage, at the very beginning of the episode, and the complaints never cease. Ever Fortunately for the viewer, his skinny girlfriend is just as annoying as Morgan (if not more, annoying). <br /> <br /> And then, to top it off, they go to the movies and buy bottled water for 2.50 and then go to the restaurant to eat all the time, until they, naturally, * drum roll * complain on the fact that they are poor. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t care if other episodes can be better than these. No one should be forced to watch this shit.
