It seemed I found the trailers better than the movie. They did their job and interested me in viewing UNKNOWN. Interest declined early. Simple room in the scenery. Five men wake up in a chemical warehouse, not knowing why they are there; not to mention how the hell did they get there. Confusion and paranoia breed fear and distrust. Men learn that the kidnapper is going with plans to kill the hostages. Now men value each other, trying to determine whether all the victims and who in fact may be one of the kidnappers. Cast: Jim Caviesel, Greg Kinnear, Joe Pantoliano, Bridget Moynahan, Barry Pepper, David Selby and Adam Rodriguez
