Several people crashed on a remote island. Then they are captured by a mad count who lives there with a small group of servants; while in the castle-castle lives the unhappy wife of the count-leper. <br /> <br /> Harrowâ€™s Underground is a largely hacker movie. Amateur actors all moan in the film, while in the background constantly playing an annoyingly persistent account. The various parts of the action are all shot in an incredibly non-energy way; in fact, the film is generally sluggish. It just seems to stretch and continue. And although the final is not so bad, by this point you will be hard to take care of. As an example of the gothic horror of the 60s, this is a strictly basement example. Unfortunately, I can not recommend it really.
