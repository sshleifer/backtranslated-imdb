This stupid adaptation of the drama mindlessly sneaks through the plot of Dickens's wonderful book, replacing the emotional impact with hasty transitions and any external places with drawings. Of course, this is not the fault of the actors and the film crew that the budget is so low, but you have to question the meaning of doing it in the first place, when there is neither time nor money to make it fair. Michael Hordern's Scrooge is too soft from the very beginning, because of which his transformation lacks strength, and the lack of reaction from him when he sees visions does not help. Other actors range from acceptable (Clive Merrison, Paul Copley) to optional (Bernard Lee) and to the point that they are going to forget their roles (John Le Mesourier). Honestly, he doesn't even bring points for the effort.
