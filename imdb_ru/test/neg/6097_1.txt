A holiday on a boat, a married couple, an evil waiter and a shipwreck are the reasons for the start of this movie. <br /> <br /> I like boobs. No questions about this. But when the main character enters into an alliance with the one who currently has the most fish, mostly having sex with them and playing the role of a constant victim, my anger just rises to a whole new level. Take two guys (a husband and another man), put a woman with a clean bomb in the middle of them, place them on a desert island, subtract all her moral problems, share a whole bunch of moral problems with men and mix them in a large bowl. arguments, fish and lighters Zippo, and you get a piece of junk like this. <br /> <br /> The game, I would say, is good. There is something, but not as much as I could see. The main female character makes me sick. This is due to her lack of moral values. The man with the fish attracts her attention. Despite the fact that one of them is her husband, she does not see a problem with the betrayal (Manuel) of another man, because "I have to do it in order to survive." How can you justify sex with another man for fish when your husband is 30 feet away? And he won't even benefit from it? The female character has absolutely no problems to justify everything she does. If she did not get approval for her actions, she was a victim. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to watch this movie. This is a movie that will make everything you see this year enjoyable.
