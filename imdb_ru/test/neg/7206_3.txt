Well, I gave it three three! He deserves only one star, no questions asked. <br /> <br /> If you take a serious look at the film and take it as a legitimate B-Horror film, then yes, it will get one star. But I believe that in the first minutes of the movie we are dealing with shit. <br /> <br /> With this film, I and the friend with whom I watched the film could turn it off and put on something more “Hollywood”, but instead we just decided to break the whole film apart from beginning to end . We laughed so many times that it was almost as if I was watching a comedy. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible ... The effects and deadly episodes are so bad .... The story is complete shit ... ... <br /> <br /> But the fact that they are trying to make a serious movie horror .. Priceless! <br /> <br /> The most memorable part for me is when two characters enter the supposed “dark basement”, which is brightly lit, and they pretend they can't see, bumping into bones hanging from the ceiling, bahhahaha , just awful ... <br /> <br /> So if you want to laugh, How crappy is this film, and also the fact that it was made in 2004, than to watch this film .... <br /> <br /> Wait, why am I writing so much? no one knows about this movie ... i doubt that anyone even read this hahahaha.
