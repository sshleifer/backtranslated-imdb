An interesting concept turned into a slaughter ... <br /> <br /> My first feature from Jeffrey Wright (Romper Stomper), when I first showed interest in it, seemed to me an interesting concept ... <br /> <br /> Shakespeare + Australian film + gothic setting + Melbourne gangster <br /> <br /> A very strange mix that turned into a catastrophic piece of Australian cinema that gave my country a bad name ... <br /> <br /> Pros: - Interesting concept. <br /> <br /> Cons: -Loser of a good cast. -Dumb and silly plot -Curved camera angles -Not many different locations - It is difficult to use Shakespeare's diologist> <br /> In general: the worst attempt of the Australian film “Shakespeare”, “Stick to Baz Luhrmann” or “Slider” (ATTENTION: this film is dangerous)
