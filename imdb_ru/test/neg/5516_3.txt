This can hardly be compared with the space adventures of its time. This is Star Wars and Star Trek. And although I'm not a Star Trek fan, I admit that this movie is fading from Trekkies. In fact, I would put “Back to the Future” in the best light in terms of space and travel. <br /> <br /> The story of a boy who was captured by space raiders (pirates). In a clearly fake and uninteresting battle, the captured boy is friends with pirates and even helps them. And slowly, one by one, these raiders die off. In the end, the boy returns home, and the last remaining pirates flee with serious injuries. <br /> <br /> The game was not so great. But what is really obvious is the complete lack of interesting dialogues, effects and plot. The way they got 80 minutes of this, I do not understand. <br /> <br /> If you want to take a picture because it takes space, continue. But be careful. "D"
