This is not a very good movie. I can’t believe that after fifty years this film won the National Award when there were such precious stones in the Marathi cinema that were so systematically ignored. This is a very overrated film, which is very, very lucky. He received a national award, collected a popular opinion and is now going to represent India to an international audience. Anyone who knows at least a little in good, high-quality cinema, knows perfectly well that he is not even nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> I can't figure out where to start. There is so much wrong and lack in this film that it is surprising that he was even awarded the National Prize. The fact that this film is recognized as the best film released this year demonstrates the prejudice of people who hold the reins of Indian cinema, and a miniature understanding of people blindly appreciating this film. <br /> <br /> Selected topic is excellent. It is important that such films be made ?? but only people who can handle them. Sandeep Sawant does not match the task ?? not even close. His direction is nervous, confused. There is no clear thought process. He tries, but is not able to explore the depth of the characters, especially the grandfather. He is not able to show the initial horror, anxiety, and then hopeless detachment and yet the irresistible courage of his grandfather. He wastes our time in the hospital when we had to show the time that the couple spends together. He tries to cram everything without any priorities. He does not understand his subject properly, and this is really against him. <br /> <br /> However, the cast also does not help Sawant. Worst job ?? Amruta Shubash. She is a terrible actor and a terrible choice for this or any sensible actor job. How did she get "Ti Fulrani"? Extremely lucky and / or extremely powerful and / or extremely pitiful casting. Having said that, she tries her best to do even the terrible work in this film. Should her MSW act go to a more responsible actor ?? Sonali Kulkarni. Amruta Subhash did not understand this. MSW's work is under constant emotional stress, but it is important for them to design a calm, strong appearance, as this encourages patients. Asavari from Amruty Subhash seems even more frightened and needs support than the people she works for. <br /> <br /> The second worst ?? Arun Nalovade. I have never seen a more wooden face in the Marathi film industry (although there are many of them in the modern Hindi cinema). He is a producer and therefore chose himself; without a second thought, without consideration. Any good actor would jump to play this role, even if he had to pay the producer for it, but Arun Naladeh would not allow anyone else to do it. Due to the ambitious and stupid, he helps to make a film more than all the others combined. His acting game lacks research and even basic acting skills. My choice for this role will be Vikram Gokhale. <br /> <br /> Music is not inspiring. The film is technically not enough. This could well be the work of the FTII project. <br /> <br /> On the other hand; brilliant performance of Ashvina Chitale. It is surprising that such a young boy could give such a respectable idea. He disgraced many modern actors. Perhaps unintentionally, but he brought his own innocence into his character, and this made him unforgettable. In addition, Sandip Kulkarni really gave a very believable idea. Really do your best, and it shows. The script is also well written. <br /> <br /> “Insufficient budget” cannot be a strong argument for praising this film. Shortage of dogs from all Marathi films. In films about cricket and Hindi, all the money is taken, and the rest remains to fight for waste. This is a sad state of affairs, but still not enough reason to compliment any immature film that comes out. "Doghi" was a great movie, and it was also made on a limited budget. “Great Dads” also lacked technically, but it was well developed and well made. He was full of details and was supported by the wonderful performances of all that made him a rich cinema. Why didn't it get honored, is it so very deserved? ?? only proves my point of view on the bias of judgment. <br /> <br /> Lack of research, not funds - this is what makes Shvaas such a bad film.
