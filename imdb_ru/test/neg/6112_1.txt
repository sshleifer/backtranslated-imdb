A good friend of mine said, "The monkey is funny anytime, anywhere." There is one exception to this: GOING BANANAS. It's just the worst movie I've ever seen. This is worse than PLAN 9, worse than STAR YUKKI. It's horrible. Talking monkey gag grows old after about three minutes, and believe me, that's all there is. Make sure you have a group of people to revive you after you go to the TOXIC SHOCK from GOING BANANAS, the worst movie in history.
