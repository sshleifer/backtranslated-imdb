Sometimes changes in novels, when they turn into films, are not only necessary, but also useful. However, in the case of Northanger Abbey, this is very, very bad. Not only is the story itself torn to shreds, but the satire is almost completely absent from the film, and its mixture of romance and intrigue does not even affect the biting comment that Austin put into her work. This is not at all amusing and not satirical, but turns the characterâ€™s passion for his fantasy world into a drama. <br /> <br /> This also affects romance. It is tortuous and aimless. Chemistry and interest are never established. The reasons why Tilney attracts Catherine are completely absent in the film, and viewers are wondering what he sees in her at all. <br /> <br /> We hope that soon we will get a more accurate version if Austin is satire.
