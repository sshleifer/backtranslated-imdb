Has there ever been one of those evenings when you couldn't sleep and just turned on the phone to see what was happening? That's how I came across this prank. As for me, it would be better to throw me and turn away in the 97 minutes I wasted with this film. <br /> <br /> In his attempt to “be real,” the characters in this film put forward as such gangster stereotypes that the story should have been a prerequisite for the film of the Wayans brothers. Dialogue? You are welcome! Looks like the white man tried too hard to write this movie. <br /> <br /> Installation was awful. One of my “favorite” scenes is a car chase through narrow lanes. However, they pursue the characters that are being pursued, and they ride through the park with the baseball fields in the background. <br /> <br /> When any of our "buddies" are filmed in this film, it miraculously bleeds through clothes that do not have holes, which is more than I can say for the plot of this predictable load .... baking soda . <br /> <br /> Indie movies can be great, even if they have little budget and effects, but they still have some cinematic integrity. If I could give him 0, I would. If you watch it, I hope it is by cable, because even the cheapest rental will be too expensive to pay. In fact, 97 minutes was too much to pay ...
