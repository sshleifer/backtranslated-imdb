Where to begin? This film is very interesting if you are new to a great game of rugby, however, if you live outside the US and watch the game, it's funny. Different rugby traditions such as "Haka", which is formed by the New Zealand "All Blacks" and only All Blacks. The Hack leader is usually a member of a team with the best Maori pedigree. This is one of the most important rules of the modern game, and the author used it incorrectly. The film itself is pretty well filmed, but the bad script and the widespread performance greatly let it down. Whereas it is based on a true story, it has a lot of clich√© in the storyline. I highly recommend that any American interested in rugby watch this movie, and then watch what rugby is on Youtube, because the rugby shown in this movie was distorted and distorted as much as possible.
