This is a very bad movie. In fact, it really is a much better quality than many movies. He had a consistent script, worthy of directing, kinematrpahi, and I saw the worst game. The zombies were great, obviously they were Romero's zombies, and it was a really interesting story about zombies. Obviously, this is not Oscar material, and if you don’t like movies about zombies or bi-movies, you probably don’t like it, but if you like this movie, then you really like it. <br /> <br /> Eastwood's main client is faking a western character. pretty good, although they never explain how he can heal himself from shots and zombie bites. But if he has more than dialogue, then where his bad game is really obvious. <br /> <br /> It was a good ending, at least I thought so. Romero must be flattered if he ever saw it.
