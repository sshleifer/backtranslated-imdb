I was delighted with the movie, looking at the promo, and went to watch it FDFS. The film was terrible, to say the least. <br /> <br /> The first scene is good, and while they are not going to London, everything is ridiculous, but the pace slows down slowly, and there is nothing funny in it <br /> <br /> Manoj Joshi’s subplot is sometimes fun but undesirable and adds boredom. <br /> <br /> Part of the drug is funny, especially Govinda’s monologue <br /> <br /> The film continues and continues aimlessly, as a small child wrote. <br /> <br /> The interval makes a turn in history, but by that time I had lost hope. > <br /> The second half starts well, but how everything happens makes you laugh. The whole corner of Arbaaz-Jackie is half baked. And why don't people identify them? <br /> <br /> The climax is quite funny, although it is stupid <br /> <br /> Priyadarshan is not at all in his elements, from this film he began to make craps, and his films became bad and bad Music is good, SIGNAL, TERE BIN stand out, and AFRIN is also a cameraman. I am good. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar has white color in his bristles and looks old, but he plays well, although he played this role many times, but thanks to his natural comedy, he looks tolerable, Govinda looks out of shape, bad and his action, with the exception of a monologue, is too boring th Govinda seems to be too strong for him to return, and Priya can not use it. Paresh is fine, but on the whole, simply repeating the act Manoj Joshi is funny in places. Sharathi Saxena is fine. Shakti Kapoor is gorgeous. Jackie Shroff looks overweight and acts in a dream.
