Oh my God! It can be a very interesting film, and in fact it is. I would like to give him 5, but I give 2 for my vote. What for? I saw it in the theater! Watch this movie on DVD or on TV! Shooting is really very bad !!!!! He shakes all the time, in a completely tasteless frame! <br /> <br /> It is very interesting to watch this very interesting movie in the cinema. You quickly get seasick, and you need to make great efforts not to tear at the place of your neighbor! <br /> <br /> This is really a shame, because the story is edited in a non-linear way, which is quite rare (and a very good idea!) for a documentary. <br /> <br /> Watch it at home!
