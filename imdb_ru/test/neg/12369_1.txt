San Franpyscho: 1 of 10: So you want to make a film about a serial killer. But your budget does not exist, your camera equipment is outdated, and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and main character in really bad films) and Todd Bridges from the film “Different Beats”. There are probably ways to make at least a watchable movie. Brothers Kayroz have no idea. <br /> <br /> First, most of the cast seemed to be chosen in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Esteves look like Oscar fans. In fact, how hard is it to play a priest or an imperious mother? Of course, in a city the size of San Francisco there are several professional actors who are ready to work for a few dollars and get a credit for the screen. Obviously, Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger, who play these roles, have other talents, such as a landskaper or a waitress, which they have to adjust. <br /> <br /> Joe Rosetta as a murderer (yes, the serial killer is simply known as "The Killer") is also pretty awful in terms of the mentally ill method, but I’m almost ready to give him the advantage of doubt because his character is written with zero style or personality. A boring, almost ridiculous serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the Kiroz brothers seem to have originally planned this as a family movie ABC of the week. There is no nudity or violence to talking about, and rating R is clearly for stimulating adult style. the move twists like an 85-year-old woman behind the wheel with twisted glasses and the turn signal turned on. The only occasional horror comes from illuminating Estevez's face with a bright light, which gives the impression that his lower jaw was removed. <br /> <br / > I didn’t expect a good movie when I shot San Francisco, but I didn’t expect boredom too.
