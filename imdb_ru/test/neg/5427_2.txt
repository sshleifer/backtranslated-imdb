Ugh this movie is terrible. The script is stupid and, of course, Chase does not tell Zoe that he does not love her !!! As in every episode ... I will never understand Zoe 101 (show) Also, why the hell is Daddy Logan so SET. And it's only about Zoe and chase about other characters. It's always the same thing in every episode that Quinn does, and the invention of something goes terribly wrong with the invention, and Zoe's brother is always involved in it. If you have not seen, do not waste an hour watching this, because you are wasting your time !! Maybe it will be interesting for an 8-10 8-year well, but I can't imagine anyone older watching this backward film. But what can you expect from Nick ???
