Not much time passed after Halloween provoked an explosive blow, and the category was cursed by continuous mediocrity. Back in 1983, the genre was already fighting for the release of more than three decent sentences a year, and by the year 88, the film about the stalk and the slash had become pretty much a whipping boy in a horror movie. By that time, all major studios already knew that the repetition of a tired formula was no longer a profitable direction, so independent and mostly inexperienced directors could continue the legacy created by John Carpenter. Despite the fact that in the 88th there were still an impressive number of items falling on the shelves, most of them were made poorly and in general they were completely unattractive. With that said, there were several stones among the rubble. The violator Scott Spiegel, in his uncut, was an excellent classical class, while the Evil Dead Traps proved that the cycle had not yet fully exhausted its style and scope. William Lustig's maniac cop was successful enough to launch the franchise, and two years later, Dead Girls and Mirage were the last seductive sips of life in the sick category. <br /> <br /> This was a permanent release of Schlok, like the Berserker. , Bloody Lake and Rush Week, which cursed the film slasher to eight years of obscurity. Finally, it took the high budget brightness of Wes Craven's Creek to provide the necessary resuscitation. Not hearing anything about the Demon Warrior before I unexpectedly stumbled upon it, I immediately assumed that this was part of the low garbage that led to the fall of the slasher phase. But given all this, the film boasts an intriguing premise that is conveniently located next to the Scalps and Camping del Terro, as another long-awaited addition to the catalog influenced by Native Americans. <br /> <br /> The truck stops on a forest road and goes outside. two ridiculously dramatized cattle. Humpback lumberjacks appear on the screen for about ten seconds, and then an invisible threat kills them. Then we meet a troupe of five young people who are heading to the same place to find a place to shoot at shotgun targets at some local animals. The area belongs to Neil Willard and is passed on through three generations of his family. His grandfather stole the land from an Indian healer who was rumored to have cursed the property. According to legend, every ten years, the Warrior of Demons with extreme hatred of humanity pursues the forest, reaping revenge on those whom he considers responsible for the theft of a tribe's home. It would not be so much fun if these myths were a lie, so regular, like clockwork, the maniac killer discovers the taste of blood. Will the children be able to stop this ghost killer? <br /> <br /> “The Warrior of the Demons” is best described as a larger (but still depressingly cheap) reissue of the scalp of Fred Deer Ray. The ghosts from both films are almost identical, and the director even adds a scalping sequence to confirm my suspicions. It all starts promisingly with some kind of a clear Friday, 13th-style first-person cinematography and a couple of shock shocks that were delicately composed by director Frank Patterson. Thomas Kallavej did a good job with photography, and the tribal drum score makes a refreshing change compared to the more traditional garbage synthesizer of the late eighties. The prosperity of the unknown is combined with a pair of authentic directorial jewelry, and there are even several attempts at humor. The killer looked successful eerie in the clothes of a demon, and the inclusion of a bow and arrow as the main murder weapon was a deft touch of the director. <br /> <br /> The notorious slasher of Fred Olena Ray was known for his harsh and authentically disturbing atmosphere. Unfortunately, despite the fact that the movie “The Warrior-Demon” is shot twice cheaper, it never comes close to a film that imitates so desperately. It is rumored that most of the actors were drafted from Baylor University of Texas, and they were not even paid for their inclusion in this function, therefore, of course, it goes without saying that the dramatic acts are terrible. I especially liked the cheerful John Langione ?? “Italian” Native American (do not ask), depicting as many emotions as the trees in the forest that surrounded him. The warrior began with some credible glimpses from the director who actually made me believe that this could be the long-awaited inclusion in the Slasher index. Unfortunately, the poisonous cocktail of the disgusting actor’s game and the finale, pulled right from Stupidsville, seriously changed the original plan, which I had in mind for rating. It's a shame that the playwrights were so scraped off from the bottom of the chatter, because at times the Warrior of Demons showed flashes of potential. <br /> <br /> In general, is the Patterson film a mixed batch of ideas ?? some were good, but mostly they were stunningly mediocre. Since it was released at a time when the slasher genre was moderated in order to avoid censored happy censors, in fact there is no mention. Even the scalping sequence is relatively tame compared to the Deer Ray graphic. The Warrior Demon has a strange moment of trust, but not often enough to justify a purchase. Not as bad as the aforementioned Berserker, Blood Lake, and others. But is this also not really good ??
