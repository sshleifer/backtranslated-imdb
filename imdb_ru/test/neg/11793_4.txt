I understand why people hate this movie. And, I hated Project Blair the Witch, so go figure it out? This production is about the same as it is, and yes, they insult your intellect, trying to make it seem real. I really liked the storyline of Madame Lalori, although it is most likely invented. But the main reason I like this film is fake or not, when ghosts start attacking and abducting them, I have a chill every time and have to look back because it seems to me that there is something with me. I know this is my imagination. but hey, more than half of all this horror in today's movie theaters and DVDs doesnâ€™t give me goosebumps, so it causes terrible delight. Not for everyone, as skeptics will hate it, not for beagles, as with the PG-13 rating there is no blood. And women are very annoying! You would like ghosts to film them and experiment with them before all this is said and done. ** outside *****.
