It's really sad to see a once great director, such as Deodato, play with a secondary film like this one. This film was so terrible that it actually put an end to his career. The box is lying, this is not an “erotic thriller”, damn it, in 97 minutes of the film, Charlotte Lewis hardly shows us one nipple! I thought it would improve as soon as William Burger appeared (in one of his last roles), but his character was killed rather sharply and unconvincingly. This film fails in almost every way. The music of Claudio Simonetti is little more than noise, and the plot had no meaning at all. For some reason, Lewis is terrorized by ghosts who attack with the help of phones. (?) In the end, all the characters seem to have forgotten the previous 90 minutes of hell they went through, and laugh casually when they torture evil spirits to someone else, the ex-Lewis guy. What kind?!? This film has brought little for me, except that it angered me ... and exhausted me to a pulp. To really have fun in the 80s Deodato, take a look at THE BARBARIANS or ATLANTIS INTERCEPTORS, let it rot on the shelf of the video store. Argento can do better than this!
