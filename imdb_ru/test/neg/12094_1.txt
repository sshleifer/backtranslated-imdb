I did not consider something here for quite some time, but after I was lucky enough to sit in this trash masquerade as entertainment, I had to express my thoughts. <br /> <br /> Usually, no matter how bad it is, one part of the ransom, whether it is an actor who was fine, a scene that was passable, an attractive cast, or a pleasant general moment. Unfortunately, this is not the case, as the film starts off terribly, with the ridiculous shootout that was so poor that I thought it was a practice, and the two jerks, also known as boys in blue, chatting next to school. br /> <br /> One of these idiots was Daniel Baldwin, who not only starred in this, but actually sent this rubbish, and, unlike his brothers, cannot play for toffee. Not that he was here on his own, since everyone in him seemed to belong to an actorâ€™s school of trained chimpanzees. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, of course, for me, I only watched this masterpiece for an hour, how the DVD didn't work and probably was made by the same fools that it produced. Therefore, if you have nothing to do except watch the dried paint, make sure that it is just as boring and ideal for getting rid of unwanted guests.
