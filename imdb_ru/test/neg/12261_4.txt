The reason I gave this movie 4 was for several reasons, but this movie was not so bad. firstly, the editing, which I sometimes found too bad, the script (or the fact that they had one) was not very good, and if it were not for Nunzio La Bianca, the game would have been nonsense but all this aside I know it like the whole movie), it's not that bad for a very low index. low budget movie. If they got more money, a bit better actors (but these were scary, so it was good), and a slightly more detailed script, this film would be awesome. Someone should tell me that this guy was greatly influenced by the warriors of Walter Hill. I mean this movie is exactly the same as this. Anyone who has seen both of these films will agree with me.
