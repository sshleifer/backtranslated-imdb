What can you say about such a pathetic movie? <br /> <br /> - A very bad game! The main actress seems to know only one expression: fear mixes with weakness. Like a poor beaten dog ... Another actress (the one that plays evil) looks like Ozzy Osbourne's twin with a terrible red wig. Other actors are so pathetic that they should not even be described. <br /> <br /> - There is absolutely no plot. The story begins with opportunities, but it’s not going anywhere: we don’t know anything about the meaning of “11:11”, or about who Raiden really is, except for the simple “she’s evil” or “she’s a child of Apocalypse” ... which is not an explanation. We don’t know why parents were killed, what danger grows and why Sarah was chosen. While the film continues, we just watch pseudo-scary scenes with bad music. Moreover, the end says nothing: we simply see two possibilities, as if one of them was a bonus scene or a directorial plot ... There is no plot, therefore interpretation is possible. <br /> <br /> “11:11” is just full of cliches! It is so obvious that I could not stop laughing. For example: a deserted library or scenes in the bathroom, ghostly silhouettes coming from the wind ... there is even a trendy "little scary girl", like in "Dark Water" or "Ring". Of course, the main character mocks at school and looks like a stereotypical gothic girl (dark hair, red lips, skinny, black clothes). Is it an obligation to make it trustworthy? I do not think so. Sarah’s psychology is so underdeveloped and so typical that it doesn’t make her trustworthy or appealing. <br /> <br /> - A terrible direction: as I said, nothing original, everyone has already seen it a thousand times and is used here without any real purpose. <br /> <br /> - There are some funny inconsistencies. For example, I don’t know if they teach “ghost science”, “paranormal phenomena” or something else in American universities ... In Europe, this is really not the case: teachers talk about negative energies or use “intangible” creature sensors. .. funny. In addition: how can you watch a movie shot in the sixties with the Super-8 camera on a computer screen without spending hours of time digitizing (in the movie they watch it immediately on a computer screen) And as you can, on this old film, highlight the tiny detail, then zoom in and see a perfectly distinguishable face I wonder if the director ever tried to digitize an old similar film ... <br /> <br /> In the end, “11:11” is just worth seeing, if you like to laugh at silly movies, or maybe if you want a mustache sleeping on the couch ... But this is an expensive way to fall asleep!
