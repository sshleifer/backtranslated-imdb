He who fights with monsters can take care not to become a monster. And if you look into the abyss for a long time, the abyss also looks in you. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is from the aphorism of Nietzsche 146 from "Beyond good and evil."

If you do not give it to them, they will probably die of boredom and LSD, and what not. <br /> <br /> This is where the passion game of hate comes from.
