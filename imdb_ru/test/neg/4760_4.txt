Susan Slept Here was Dick Powell's swan song as a performer on the big screen. Of course, he shot several more films and often appeared on television until his death. It is a pity that he did not perform with his play "The Bad and the Beautiful." <br /> <br /> Frank Tashlin has made so many better films, and I'm still not sure that anyone has made him do it. The premise is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is a screenwriter who wants to do more serious things than the fluff he writes. He had the idea of ​​a juvenile crime film, so two friendly police officers from Herb Vigran and Horace McMahon placed 17-year-old Debbie Reynolds on their doorstep. She is not a very bad child, and they do not want to put her in the system. So they give her to Dick Powell for Christmas. <br /> <br /> I mean, is there anyone who doesn't see the problem? The term jailbait immediately comes to mind. In addition, Powell has a girl, young and sexy, Ann Francis. Why Debbie Reynolds is some kind of competition here is outside of me. <br /> <br /> Susan Spalla got one Oscar nomination. The song Hold My Hand, sung in the background by Don Cornell, was nominated for the best song, but lost to Secret Love. <br /> <br /> Powell and Reynolds have some funny moments together, and Elvi Moore, both Powell's factum, and Le Tremayne, as his lawyer, also laugh. <br /> <br /> But this is not enough.
