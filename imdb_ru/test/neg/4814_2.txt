With No Dead Heroes, you get such stupid lines as this horribly bottomless action movie you need to see to believe. William Sanders is rescued by his friend Harry Kotter during mining in Vietnam, but he is captured by the enemy. Fast forward to ten years ahead, and now Harry is a Russian operative with brainwashed brain and mind control microchip implanted in his brain. His new Russian chief is Ivan, who is played by the obscene hilt of Nick Nicholson, who, I might add, not only does not try to speak with a Russian accent, but also looks more like an employee of a Kentucky filling station with his stained teeth. What is even more absurd is the fact that he was the dialogue coach for this film. Soon, the CIA re-recruited William to track down Harry. He teams up with Barbara, a freedom fighter who infiltrated Ivanâ€™s camp in El Salvador, and soon both of them blow half of South America. Some scenes are so horribly disgusting that it is surprising why there are no more worshipers in this film. One such scene is the sudden making of love in the jungles of William and Barbara, accompanied by the most inappropriate background music that has ever been heard. Who will be completely undressed in the middle of the South American jungle? There is a rape scene that also uses the Blood end theme on Satan's claw. No Dead Heroes is a champion in magic in films of all time, because one shot leads to multiple killings. In one scene, Harry shoots a rifle from behind a stone and kills seven guys. I had to rewind it and count. It's hard to find a movie that recently received full HD resolution from MGM. Track this movie and look at the sheer stupidity that follows.
