What is Fox's fascination with dysfunctional families consisting of mean, disgusting, spoiled children and parents who are determined to be cool and not parents? I'm sorry I do not understand. In one episode, which I could barely watch the belly, one of the children who demanded a bar mitzvah participated, with the intention of receiving thousands of dollars as a gift. Of course, an idiot mother decides that her precious junior junior should have the biggest and best party of all, and she throws away 20 giants at a big event without any problems. A crappy, mentally retarded, crazy teenage girl gallops back and forth between wanting to be a Jew, and then a Catholic, when she sees "nice" religious mentors. <br /> <br /> One border “warming” moment in the whole episode, when the putz of his father, who was constantly convinced that the bar mitzvah was exclusively a scheme for making money, saw that his son was learning his Hebrew lessons, deceive themselves, thinking that perhaps his insidious offspring to be sincere about the right to become a man of dignity. This warm, indistinct feeling immediately escaped from his chest when he informs the youngest that, since he does not have a razor yet, it is necessary to perform a certain “procedure”. Bar Mitzvah is canceled, and the mother goes away for a few thousand dollars when the child refuses to comply. <br /> <br /> This show is rubbish, and I am saddened that I will never come back in 23 minutes, I wasted my life looking at this piece of shit, because there was nothing else on TV ...
