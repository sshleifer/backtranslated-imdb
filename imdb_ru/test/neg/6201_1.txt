I didn’t know what to expect when I started watching this movie, and by the end of it I was tearing my hair out. It was one of the most miserable films of this year ... in fact, in the last ten years. David Dhavan should just quit his career as a director. I have yet to meet one original script, on which David Dhavan worked. It was a complete beat with Hitch. I have nothing against remakes as such, but this one is so lousy that it makes you even hate the original one (which was pretty decent). I do not understand what actors like Salman and Govinda saw in this scenario. I read somewhere that it must be Govinda’s return. If this is true, then only God can save his career. Salman just went over the handle. Govinda, whom I consider to be a very high level actor, was completely wasted. Katrina Kaif and Lara Datta had nothing to do with wearing designer clothes and smiling without rhyme or reason. Please stay away from this!
