There can be no worse criticism for the film than the word “boring”. <br /> <br /> Some of the “bad” movies are very funny, some of the “funny” movies are really bad, but being “boring” means that no one will ever buy a DVD to watch it again and again. <br /> <br /> It looks like it was a movie that used the drama class from Antarctica, they were too busy running to warm up instead of playing. The lead actor spoke almost in a whisper, a hoarse voice, a devil, he seemed to be about to seduce someone, and he didn’t care who. <br /> <br /> The film can not earn, if it is boring, I hope that this dies quickly, you will never see death again.
