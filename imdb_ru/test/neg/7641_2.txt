... I have no choice but to use it at least once during my review of Respiro. Among other things, what defines the claim is, in my opinion, the lack of emotional sincerity on the part of the author. Respiro seems to be made with too far-fetched and self-conscious intention to be artistic, symbolic, spiritual, provocative, metaphorical ... even mythical. But fortunately for all true artists, the predisposed formula for achieving artistic beauty and depth does not exist. Stunning natural places (yes, these remote areas of southern Italy look exotic even for most other Italians), beautiful actors and funny, bold, spontaneous performances with a handful of attractive children do not surpass the meaningless film, except for a rather succession of images, Nevertheless This insincere and vain, and ultimately, an empty film is an art that succeeds only to a very limited extent, perhaps in some cases by chance. I admit that conceptually pompous ending has a certain visual poetry. However, I believe that this was achieved in ways that are more related to the beauty of the Sea of ​​Lampedusa and the strong symbolic power of bathing and water (linking it to such a mythical, mystical, religious, archetypical, etc.) Crealese talent. <br /> <br /> Valeria Golino is extremely irritable and suffers in her role as Grace. For a mentally unbalanced woman of modest and provincial descent, she most likely has a trendy wardrobe. Her flattering, airy dresses with a floral print and attractive, sun-kissed beach hair could decorate the pages of any summer edition of Vogue. The fact that she was a "psycho", in a sense, could be nothing more than a fashionable addition to her fashionable behavior and appearance - it seemed to me that her "state" to the depths of the soul. Golino's two-dimensional stereotype about an innocent, natural woman-child, misunderstood and oppressed by her backward community, was tedious and annoying at worst, leaving me indifferent and indifferent at best. I agree with the reviewer from London, who wrote that mental illness is very poorly served by the cinema - during the whole film we never had a feeling of Gracie's disease, and we have no idea what is really wrong with it (except for its being) . tedious stereotype of the "free spirit"). We do not know why she was given injections, and she is obliged to contact a specialist in Milan. This general way of writing a mental illness is one of the main signs of the overall superficiality of a film. <br /> <br /> Another rather offensive aspect of Respiro is determining its location. I struggled to find out whether this film should be set now or in the past, seeing how its goal is to make even the admittedly backward part of Italy (for comparison) seemingly ten times more fanciful and more convenient than really primitive than it really is. Again, this gives a trifle and a complete lack of sincerity on the part of Crialese. Some non-Italian viewers will happily take in the picturesque backwardness, the cliche of a proprietary, macho-Italian, as if this were common, so they would be interested in continuing to view my country as one of the culturally disadvantaged sometime in the 1950s The question I would like to ask David Ferguson, a reviewer from Dallas, Texas, is this: is your country mentality stuck in the 1950s? No? Ok, then why should I be?). Unfortunately for those who still want to look at Italy in such an anachronism, this aspect of Respiro is actually funny and strange even in the eyes of the IT Italian viewer. The delicate incestuous tension between Gracia and her eldest son was as tedious and predictable as the sexist but loving husband of Fabrizio Bentivollo. I especially hated the scene in which Gracia joins her husband and male friend in some banter over a bottle of beer, to the embarrassment and displeasure of her husband. According to this film, this is not the place of a woman to engage in a man’s conversation. Ah, but our “sweet” “free spirit” is too good for this place and does not understand the repressive, unwritten rules of the Lampedusan Patriarchate! Not only does this scene depict something so fake, it should be enough to discredit the credibility of the entire film. In addition, he fully understands the wrong end of the culture that he is trying to portray, clearly showing that it was written without a clear understanding of the place or its population. I would challenge anyone who knows modern Italy to say otherwise. <br /> <br /> For a truly accomplished contemporary Italian director who, in my opinion, deserves to be among Italy’s greatest famous cinematographic past (which, alas, is not the shadow of his former self!), look no further Gianni Amelio - especially Lamerica, Così Ridevano and his last, La Stella Che Non C'è. Unlike most modern Italian cinemas, sadly derivative and stagnant, Amelio's is a fresh and independent creative voice. Despite my disgusting review of Respiro, I am now more than willing to believe that the latest Nuovomondo Crialese, which is now on display in Italian cinemas, will be worthy. Therefore, I look forward to enjoying it, although it will not be too shocking for me if I do not do this (given my feelings for Respiro!).
