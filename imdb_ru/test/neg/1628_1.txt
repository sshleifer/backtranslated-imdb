Nobody wanted a sequel that nobody asked in the film. Obviously, there are too many flaws in this film to name them, so I’ll just concentrate on the game. Miles O'Keefe would have been better suited to play Asian girlfriend Tong for the sprint, mainly because he wouldn’t have a dialogue. Lisa Foster demonstrates her emotions, dullness. Charles Borremel contributes to his life by stopping every five words. And finally, a bright guy like John Saxon ...... no comment is required. <br /> <br /> See "Conan the Barbarian" if you need, but don’t waste your time with this low-budget loser.
