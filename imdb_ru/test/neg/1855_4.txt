The real surprise of this lightweight movie is how a similar cast was put together for just a boring boring novel. Presumably it was a well-known snowball rolling down the slope, gaining speed, size and shape. One can imagine that by the time Miranda’s agent contacted Miranda Richardson, the conversation went like this: “Do you want to make a film in Dublin as directed by Neil Jordan? Michael Caine and Michael Gambon are already in the game! This is a boring “comedy” in which Michael Kane and Dylan Moran try to make a well-planned bustle, where Moran must imitate the London gangster gang (whose arrival is inevitable) in order to get a significant amount of money from the local kingpin Michael Gambon. The rest is simply unforgettable noise, which, fortunately, ended rather quickly. In some places, Moran is a little fun, but on this testimony is better suited for living on a small screen in such popular comedies as The Black Books. Kane does not experience any difficulties in his role and gives a stable job without being overloaded. One can only imagine what made him subscribe to this film - it could not even be in the summer in Dublin, given that many scenes look positively autumnal in the background. Gambon actually steals the show, and anyone who caught some of his performances in the spirit of "Do I have news for you," finds out that he is an amazingly funny person. But on the whole, the result is disappointing, and it seems like a lifetime ago that Neil Jordan was making quality films like Monet Lisa.
