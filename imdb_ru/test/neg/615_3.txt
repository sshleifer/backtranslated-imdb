This is a movie that really makes me cringe. In 1951, MGM and Looney Toons made some of their best cartoons — with amazing animation, exceptional backgrounds, and wonderful stories. Then, in the late 40s, a new style of animation began to appear (for example, the TV series "Rabbit Crusader") - an animation with an extremely simplified design for saving money. Unfortunately, the cynical trick of the Columbia Picture worked !! Instead of the public hating cartoons (as they should have been), many accepted them, and the Oscar people (AMPAS) actually gave the film an award for the best animated short film - giving legitimacy to a low product. Unfortunately, in dollars and in the world of Hollywood's feelings, it soon began to penetrate the products of legitimate studios - leading to pretty crappy cartoons. Later it got worse, because in addition to lousy animations and backgrounds, the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults. The mind and style of classic cartoons are gone. And in this tragedy, I partially blame Gerald McBowing, one of the grandfathers of cheap cartoons. The story is not so bad, but the animation is terrible, and listening to the child constantly says “Boeing Boeing” is pain.
