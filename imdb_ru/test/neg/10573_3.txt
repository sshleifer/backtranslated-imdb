I thought it would be funny. I did. I do not know what happened. But I think that most of the problem, unfortunately, falls on the casting. I do not know who this child is, he could have been a very good person, but he was not suitable for this film. And the cast was great, which makes it even more obvious. For example, there would be a scene with him and his love interest, and your mind just started to get distracted, but then Keith David started talking, or Leslie Nielsen, or Marion Ross, and it’s like someone turned on the light, and suddenly you can pay attention again, and you think it might not be so bad. But when they return to the main characters, the light goes out again. <br /> <br /> Spoofing material available in the superhero genre is abundant, so the fact that most of the jokes were mostly farting makes you wonder who wrote this thing. I mean, there were a few funny moments, since I remember laughed a couple of times, but now I don’t remember why, and it was just a few days ago. <br /> <br /> Really, I give him to accept or leave a rating, but I think that most people should just leave it.
