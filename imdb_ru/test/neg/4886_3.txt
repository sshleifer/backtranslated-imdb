From late teens to the 1920s, Stan Laurel was a solo actor in films. During this time, Laurel was definitely NOT among the higher echelons of talent, and his humor is not as good as his contemporaries, such as Lloyd or Keaton. However, for short second level comedies, he created a decent niche. As for the quality of the films, they were very different. Some, such as DR. PIKL AND MR. PRYDE was awesome, while most of them had average to below average quality. <br /> <br /> Frozen Heads is a weird movie. Like many of the films he shot for Hal Roach that he distributed to Pathe during this period, the costumes were absolutely first-class, and the film looked very beautiful. However, despite this and with the support of people like James Finlayson, one thing they forgot to include in this film was humor. It seems that none of the jokes work, and the film looks almost like a drama, not a comedy. Only really stupid inscribed cards betray the typical movie that it should be. <br /> <br /> My advice - try to watch all of his films Laurel and Hardy, and then watch solo films. In addition to DR. PIKL, try to see SOILS, DIRT AND SAND - his two more tolerant solo shorts.
