This film is crazy. I believe that the original of this film, “The Mask,” was a terrific movie that is worth buying and watching a lot. I firmly believed that they should make a sequel, but when I saw this, I thought again. <br /> <br /> This film spoiled the very idea of ​​“Mask”. Mask mode? Is the child flying in the room? My younger brother, who is seven years old, did not even laugh, and he likes these children's films, but it was worse. Load of shit !! I am telling you now, please do not watch this film, it’s a waste of money and a waste of time. Instead, you could be really fun! See "Mask", but do not repeat, DO NOT watch this junk. Thank.
