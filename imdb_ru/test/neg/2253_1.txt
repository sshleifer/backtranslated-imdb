Tarantino's previous films were from a guy in love with other films. This one is from a guy in love with his own letter. This is not inglorious, it is disgusting. <br /> <br /> I absolutely hated Inglorious bastards. The whole point of the film is to entertain - if you call beating people’s heads and scalping them, it’s entertaining !!!! - and if there is one unforgivable sin that can make a film, it is extreme boredom or disgust. <br /> <br /> A film is simply a collection of endless and painfully boring and disgusting scenes of people speaking different languages ​​at the tables. There is even one scene where 3 people talk at the same table for almost 45 minutes before, fortunately, they were all shot. I wanted to be killed in 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to shut F ** K. <br /> <br /> This style of talking at the table is Tarantino’s hallmark, but in other films I really cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking . Here I don't give a damn. All Quentin films show tremendous confidence, especially Jackie Brown. But here in every scene there is a pervasive feeling, Tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film. <br /> <br /> Is it violence? Of course, there is torture and scalping in abundance, but you must remind me. Fortunately, the film was so thin that I don’t even remember if I saw it earlier that day, until I saw the MSNBC review title. <br /> <br /> He has no tricks, and obviously he is dying to write a novel. But do us a favor with QT and free us from the film. <br /> <br /> I got out of this movie halfway through, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone to watch, no matter what kind of quarantine fan he is. <br /> <br /> I give it 0/10.
