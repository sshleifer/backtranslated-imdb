Hindi remake of Mrs. Doubtfire is starring and directed by Kamal Hassan is a somewhat cheesy version, and not as good as expected. <br /> <br /> Kamal Hassan is clearly struggling with Hindi dialogues, even after all these years, and even one scene cannot cope without much effort. The guy is older and should give him a rest. Hassan does not bring anything new to the role or character, as, say, Dustin Hoffman does with Tootsie, or Marathi actor MacKindranath Kumblee does with the character Mavshi (aunts) in "Moruchi Mavshi" (aunt Mora, comedy game). /> <br /> What did the child do when playing with firecrackers when it wasn't Diwali? Most of the romantic “cross-links” of Chacha — against Amrish, Pares, and then Johnny Walker — seem superfluous for the main storyline. Tabu bathing scene was unnecessary. A family from Northern India, but the Maharashtrian chacha needs to be reminded of the night Karva Chauta. Yeah, right. <br /> <br /> In this film, the subtle acting abilities of not one but four actors, namely Tabu, Om Puri, the late Amrish Puri and Pares Raval, are lost. <br /> <br /> See the original Mrs Doubtfire - clean, fresh and crunchy with fun, not at all like the Chachi 420.
