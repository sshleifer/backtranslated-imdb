I will never return to the three hours of life that this film stole from me. <br /> <br /> The film is a psychedelic trip with drugs disguised as an important creative process. I would like to know what they were about when they made this film. <br /> <br /> This is also the most historically inaccurate film of all existing; 2001 came and went without any events or predictions. <br /> <br /> Characters are unlikely, the design is simplified, and everything just rushes without any sense or logic. <br /> <br /> And the final is probably the worst of them all: it should be thought provoking, but the only thought that came to my mind was: “What is happening, F $ * K?!” <br /> <br / > I would say that for those who are looking for serious entertainment purposes, AVOID this film at all costs and choose a science fiction film that is not stuck in its own @ $$.
