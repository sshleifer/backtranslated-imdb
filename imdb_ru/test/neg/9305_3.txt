I know that everyone said that this film was complete shit, and I agree with them. I spent several years seeing this tell other people that it was crap. I recommended that they not see it. But when he appeared on television, we saw an ad. I turned to the family and said: "I know that this is sad, but I think about it." My sister turned to me and said: "Yes, me too." And you know what? That was funny. <br /> <br /> This is by no means a good movie. This is absolutely a waste of time. But it is a good waste of time. You may still think this is crap and fair enough, but I thought it was a really funny comedy. I did not like a couple of pieces, for example, when the car came under fish, but other than that I thought it was good. I liked to sit there and choose all the famous Australian faces: Flacco, El MacFuest, Harry MacDonald, etc. <br /> <br /> So, if you like to waste your time, watch this movie. Otherwise, see a drama or something.
