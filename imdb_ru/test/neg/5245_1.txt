GOOD: Techno music accompanying medieval sword playing. In addition, the film looks smoother than most b-films, but let's face it: Quake or Doom have more atmosphere. <br /> <br /> BAD: Unreasonable plot, no acting, and an absolutely incredible universe. I can usually see the potential of even very bad movies; Hell, I love a good B-movie, such as Split Second and the like. But this has only boredom and clich√© to offer ... Absolutely predictable from beginning to end. Oh, and I forgot the lousy special effects, they look more like an old Playstation game than any of the myths! Using a classic poem to sell this sucker offends me! CONCLUSION: <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: Just boring. If you want to see Lara Croft, buy the game, it is much sexier!
