I don't know how people can watch it - the only people who like to watch it are those who have no feelings and emotions, and they like to watch people die, burn at home, car crashes, children die, and the actors are killed every week . This is the most absurd thing on television, and I still do not know how it pulls in the ratings. It is so depressing. I can imagine the writers sitting and saying: “So who will we kill next week?” Or “whose house will we set on fire in a few months?” <br /> <br /> television at the moment and I can't understand people's motives for watching this depressing pile of shit anymore
