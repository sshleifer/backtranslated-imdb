You must pass this on to writer-director John Hughes. With huge success behind a teenager and a high school student, he managed to turn around in other areas of comedy, finding a great ally to comedian John Candy in the deal. Here, the infuriated adult Candy gets better after she agrees to look after her brother's smart children; This is a valid formula, designed to appeal to both cynical teens and their parents, and it is not surprising that the film became the winner among theater audiences. However, Hughes relies almost entirely on Candy's charm to set the script, and ultimately one can get tired of repeating gags with a star front and center. The children are sitcom-smart, the other adults are shapeless clots, and Amy Madigan is too tense, too bloated, playing Uncle Buck's girlfriend. Later he became a TV show, which is due, as the material has already been improved by television. * 1/2 of ****
