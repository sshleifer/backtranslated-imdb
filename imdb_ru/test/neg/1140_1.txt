I watched the first 30-40 minutes of this film on TV and I can agree that this is the worst of the series. Not funny, even Randy Quaid can't save this mess. Eric Idle was not funny in N.L. Euro.

The only funny scene is when they are at the airport, and some guy in Santa costume goes to the camera and shouts: “Has anyone lost it?” When he lifts the prosthetic leg ... <br /> <br /> 1 / 2 stars from ****
