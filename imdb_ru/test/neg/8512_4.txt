Shirley Temple’s films for The Twentieth Century Fox are not negligible because they are poorly made (after all, Darryl F. Zanuk directed most of them); they do not retain much of the “classic” status among movie fans, mainly because they are muted by the frustrated optimism of Hollywood during the Depression era. The audience of the 1930s was reassured by the joy of the fact that the poisonous, often orphaned solar girl looked stupid compared to her (they were upset and they squeezed their hands while she pulled back) (which musical sequences always contribute to support the content), and its time (always too perfect) and exaggerated reactions can cause most modern viewers to roll their eyes. No one can be blamed for their annoyance at the performance of the Temple here (shouting lines at the top of her lungs) or the perversity of her dance steps screaming with a crowd of sailors at the Cod Ball. However, the fantasy aspect of this particular story, previously filmed in 1924 from the book of Laura E. Richard, is enough to enchant those who are in a proper sugar spirit. Shirle seems to have been pulled out of a shipwreck by a government appointed lighthouse keeper, but when a truant officer from the Council of State finds out that Taik is not at school, she threatens to take the child. In fact, it does not matter if the officer with prunes has a point of view that the Temple does not rise properly (a woman turns into a proverb almost immediately); it is immediately apparent that the Temple can control itself, taking care of itself and its elderly guardian in the transaction (as well as the local widow who picked up the captain). The temple is not the only one who rehearsed too much; January Guy Kibby is set up to react with eyes wide open, so the question often arises: did he take pictures of them all in one day? The dialogue is permeated with metaphors on the embankment ("You can not throw trout!" ... "Well, do not give up!"), And something in the whole enterprise seems strangely confused. ** from *** *
