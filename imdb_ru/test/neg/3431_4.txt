This (very) low-budget film is interesting if you are a fan of John Krasinski, but otherwise disappointing. At least it was short, so I did not feel that I had spent too much time. John's scenes are funny enough, but the attempts at “deep” scenes with Lacey Chaberre make you disgusted. It starts with the fact that it seems that it can be a funny movie, but some characters are so outlandish, while others are too serious to just fall through. Don't get me to the final. It was incredible and didn’t even fit the rest of the film. I will say that I was not bored, so I rated it above three. John Krasinski fans will love to see him with a bandana and stockings on his head and eat Cheez-Its. Oh, and do not forget to check out the deleted scenes of John, they are better than those that were actually included in the film.
