I put this car aside for Robert De Niro, Eddie Murphy and, in particular, Murphy, for the first time, but after seeing it again, recently, I see that there are some very funny pieces in it. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that this is the best comedy of all time, but in fact, what can you do with an already exhausted subgenre? Directed by Tom Day tried to make it a satire of the clichés of comedy friends and the media. At the beginning of the film, the executive director of the cable network asks: “How is this different from Cops?” It was then that I saw him in a new light, which I had not noticed before. <br /> <br /> The idea is to show all the elements of a comedy of friends and turn them around. De Niro's reluctance to star in the series and partner with Murphy is one of all the police films you could think of. You can say that De Niro is actually playing himself by asking, “Why would I do another movie with a cop?” Chase Renzi is portrayed as a Hollywood phony, but if you look at her opening scene again, she just does it to save your work. She somehow sees the absurdity of what she does, but she wants to succeed in spite of this. One line says: “Who doesn’t want to be on television?” Maybe it’s too much that, in fact, it’s a lightweight movie, just meant for entertainment, but it really gives him a bit of a spin, which I hadn’t noticed. <br /> <br /> As for Murphy. You should applaud him for making him look so funny. Trey wants to be a star so bad that he is ready to sell everything he faces. Murphy was a big star, and maybe it occurred to him that everything was so fleeting. <br /> <br /> The plot with a pistol is, of course, rather boring. Sequences of actions are not something special, except for the end, which required a lot of effort from both the actors and the team. In the villain I noticed one thing: he is dressed like a pop star of the 80s. George Michael comes to mind, and this adds to the general circle of the media. <br /> <br /> So, I broke it for the first time, but what the hell; if you're going to do it, why not indicate how ridiculous it is, and De Niro and Murphy ventured to do it.
