Rude, innocent, non-smoker, non-drinker and non-biker, but Jeremy Slate (a good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (a good actress) make it idiotically feasible for a bad biker movie, post-biker (feat). They knew it, we knew it ... Adam Roark and Slate wasted ... but they lived. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10. Best performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is the only one who will really catch the final biker film about exploits after RUN, ANGEL, RUN (which also has good actors such as Don Stroud, etc.). It was over. They knew it. They tried to make a living. But Jocelyn Lane (from two bad Elvis films, TICKLE ME and something bad) in yellow and leather colors is a modern hot chick with J. Slate fighting for honor. It's worth a look, but it sucks. But check it out. It is well worth not biker, not smoking, not drunk, like "biker" with hot chicks.
