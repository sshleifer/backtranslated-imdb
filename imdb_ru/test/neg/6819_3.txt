Of course, this film had funny moments with the people in question, and I know that the film should not be completely believable, the film made it too outrageous, for example, such a girl would never have come out with such a guy like that in a million years that the people in the film had dim performances, the acting was so bad. In addition, the plot is bad, they could not have better script writing, at least, and more attention was paid to comedy, the comedy was also a bit dry and very boring after the first few jokes, it was like 10 minutes laugh, and then old. this end will end if you want to get a dull game mixed with a silly plot and romance, and watch this movie.
