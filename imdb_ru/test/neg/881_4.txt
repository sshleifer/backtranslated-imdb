The stars of Richard Gere and Diane Lane in a romantic movie about girls with a finale that I'm really angry with ... let's say, this is not my cup of tea, just like the novels in the store dime is not my cup of tea. > <br /> In the plot, the doctor stops at the hotel and meets a woman with whom he has a deep but brief romance. He leaves to meet his estranged son, and she returns to her life. <br /> <br /> Well-acting and well-made directors forgot to get a real storyline. These are things from a novel about the store that make women swoon, and men shake their heads in disbelief. I would not be so negative about the film as a pointless novel, except that the film goes to the final reel, which is outside the left margin, to be completely incredible. Why should certain types of movies do such stupid things? It really messed it up for me. <br /> <br /> If you like romance, try, but wait for the cable.
