The man stopped making sequels to great films. Initially, it was a great movie in which there were fights, sex and one of the coolest characters that graced the screen in the 90s. The story is believable, as if you were in bars in the south, you would know. But here comes this piece of junk Roadhouse 2 Last Call. Let's only hope that they are serious about the name and will never again make another Roadhouse. There is no charm to the characters of the original, and the story is not believable. “History” is more of a fighter like Stephen Seagal, who, although Roadhouse 2 is a film “B,” is still not clicked, as some action films “B” still sell the film, no matter how stupid it is. The only reason you shouldn’t buy this film is that we finally figured out that one question remained from the original Roadhouse. Patrick Swayze's character Dalton, Dalton - his name or surname? Well, I will save you $ 4 per rental. Dalton is his first name, like Dalton Tanner. NEVER MAKE ANOTHER ROAD !!!!!!!!!!!
