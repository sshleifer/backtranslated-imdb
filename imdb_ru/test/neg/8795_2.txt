<br /> <br /> To make it short and pleasant: I hope that this film will not be considered fruitful work for the "Asian generation" of American film production. the action was irregular, relying on stereotypes, elevated voices and exaggerated eye error to convey his message. Chris Chan Park doesn’t go deep into any of his characters, allowing them to remain caricatures of evil / frustrated / distant / uncommunicative Asians. these images do not make characters mysteriously attractive; it makes them confused and not sympathetic. I like to think that we Asians are harder than that. <br /> <br /> I left the film unconvincingly. not being convinced that these characters had a close blood brotherhood with each other, to go to all that they did to help their friend. I am convinced that the main character had something other than a superficial attraction to his girlfriend. Convinced that hard-working immigrant parents will not pay for their son’s college tuition. Were not convinced that all the characters were even necessary, that is: Janet, who was put to sleep in the back of the car and quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> the storyline, which, in my opinion, had the potential, was not allowed to enter into its rights for two reasons: 1) flat characters to which I did not have sympathy / intimacy, 2) the plot was overshadowed meaningless scenes not related to the sequestration, such as the sequence of a show / donut shop with Amy Hill Ridiculous and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> I recommend Park for his efforts, as I’m sure it took a lot of hard work to even produce the film, and I’ll even give him the advantage of doubting this time as a new director / screenwriter, but I’m sincere I hope that next time he will go a little deeper. the fact that the film is one of the first of its kind about Korean American experience does not mean that it is automatically good.
