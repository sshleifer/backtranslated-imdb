Half the mystical thriller and half shattered fantasies of a fragile mind, “The Guardian of the Border” is a fascinating journey that soon derails. Strong images and an irresistible prerequisite are soon overwhelmed by an incoherent plot, a tattered dialogue, an amateur game, and the wildest and most excessive phallic images in recent memory (here the fish is definitely not just a fish!) Obviously, this is the first Slovenian feature film made by a woman - Miss Weiss must have been determined to prove that she can be as frank and impartial as any man.
