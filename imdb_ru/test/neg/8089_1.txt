Here is a spoiler: At the end of the film a little piece of you dies. You will spend the rest of your life looking for this missing piece, but he is gone, gone. You will wander through the streets at night, peering into the windows of your neighbors when they sit down for dinner. Friends and family will try to determine exactly when you turned into the walking dead. You will answer their questions and problems with a blank look and mumble about a runaway testicle. When AMC will inevitably make Tomcats "movie of the month", a series of mysterious murders will happen in your city. The next morning, you wake up on the kitchen floor with a light taste of brains in your mouth. Then you climb into the living room and on the sofa. You will look at the wall, wet yourself a little, and then start laughing insanely. Because as soon as you are inside, Jake Busey in thongs is really damn fun.
