The DVD for this movie belongs to Alpha Video, a company that almost always produces prints of the poorest quality. In defense of Alpha, it is often the only print available but specializing in public domain and cheap films. If you can find another imprint of another company, try it first, since the imprint for this film is fuzzy and faded. However, compared to most Alpha DVDs, this one is superb - especially since the sound is pretty clear (and Alpha never includes subtitles - even with movies with terrible sound). <br /> <br /> A man met with a lady for a long time. One night he is a bad boy and spends the night with another woman. Soon after, he tells his bride about it, she forgives him, and they get married. <br /> <br /> Very soon after the wedding, another woman calls him - she NEEDS to see him and just tried to commit suicide. When they meet, he learns that she has an STD, and she wanted him to know that he, too, can have this now. Then, although there is a nurse there, and they treat her for a suicide attempt, she somehow finds a gun and kills herself! This makes a huge mistake. He does not speak to his doctor, nor does he speak to his new wife. It takes some time, and now she and the child are infected! At this point, the doctor meets the guy and tells him about the importance of getting treatment, and they show him rooms filled with terribly infected people (in fact, they were just films of people with STDs that they included in the film - most people have syphilis). <br /> <br /> In a sense, the film is very progressive. This raises a serious problem, and it is interesting how the film encourages couples to NOT wait for the wedding, but to marry quickly and succumb to these sexual urges - but only with each other (not at all bad advice). On the other hand, the film never says exactly what it is about. They never use the terms STD, VD, or the like, and do not even call a disease. Often this refers to syphilis, but in other cases it is about herpes or other STDs - the information is simply not very clear or specific - A VERY common problem with such films of this era. The audience at the time must have been confused by what she saw, and many more naive ones probably needed some of their “quick” friends to explain all this to them! </ i usually could not see such colorful films in Hollywood films). Many of them are hysterically amusing, because they are too overdone, and the information is not accurate. The most famous examples are REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS (both from the same two-bit production company). Compared to how stupid and stupid these two films are, this cheap movie looks like it should be in the Criterion collection !! <br /> <br /> Interestingly, there are strange people (I would definitely be among them) who like to watch movies, because they are often so bad and so badly made that it is very fun. This, however, is not so bad, and the message is not confused, and the film about the victims is not as grotesque as some of these films. While the message really should have been more explicit and useful, for a 1933 film, this is pretty good — despite the sometimes bad play and the ridiculous suicide scene. Remember the kids - just say no to suicide! <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, the “two years of treatment,” which they talk about in the film, were in fact the norm for syphilis as far back as 1933. Nowadays, it is much more treatable - like the rest of STDs.
