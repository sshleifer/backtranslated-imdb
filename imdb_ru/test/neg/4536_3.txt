The director is the same Gene Ishimoto, who temporarily removed Neoedision and flixer.com from business (the once-promising online movie community) due to his directorial style and filmmaking method in his next film, Girl's Best Friend. <br /> <br /> “Hole” suffers from this style of filmmaking “Look at me, I am the director”, which becomes almost the standard in modern Hollywood to the detriment of the content. <br /> <br /> “Hole” actually begins with a unique concept, but this concept and the promise of fascinating content will soon be destroyed by the cinematic “look at me” director's style. <br /> <br /> There are some funny moments that still shine through pretense, but it hurts to look short. <br /> <br /> How sad it is when a new generation of “directors” decides not to be a servant of history, but to try to dominate the screen and beyond. Heck, they don’t care as long as they make a deal with the studio, a house on the beach and a new car, content and presentation are minor issues. <br /> <br /> The really sad part of all of this is that Hollywood perceives the “look at me” attitude so strongly that the whole aesthetics of filmmaking is changing. Instead of presenting the story in a simple way that puts the story in the first place, today's directors become “experimental,” that is, “look at me.” <br /> <br /> This is me or I the only one who was actually delivered from the opening minutes of the Seine SWORDFISH minutes. This film continued to rise above the Seine's directorial attempts to create the film "Look at me." Unfortunately, this short film by Mr. Ishimoto does not have. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 Elec Tv rating.
