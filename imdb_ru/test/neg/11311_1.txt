I left the theater, and I was only 10 years old. That's how bad it sucks. The plot was terrible, and the game was worse. Leslie Nilsson should be ashamed of herself and the person who made this film. I was only 10 years old when I went to see this catastrophe with a friend, and even at such a young, innocent age I never laughed at the film. We (my friend and I) still laugh at how bad the movie was. We ended up going into the movie “R” in which my parents were. Bottom line - this movie was damn bad. Mr Magu - more like Mr Ma-who? This film could hurt me for a lifetime if I watched a popular cartoon on TV as a child, but fortunately, I never saw it, so I was spared from torment, but I never return those precious moments of my life I wasted.
