I will begin by acknowledging that I really like militants (military or others). I am a boy. But this fight was terrible. I saw it for free, show or hbo and still feel that I paid too much. It was a long episode of the general hospital. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1, only because 0 or 0.1 was impossible. How and why 59 others would rate it from 5 to 6 points. If they are not the whole family of actors or teams. <br /> <br /> Maybe this film was so bad that many came to the rescue ....... repetition, but at least 10 lines seems silly, because what essentially amounts to warning ... ...... in the hope of saving others a black hole at 2 o'clock, this film represents Believe me, stare at a blank wall, they will be more active.
