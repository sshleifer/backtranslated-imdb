This movie is a bad movie. But after watching an endless series of bad horror films, I can say that it is a little different from many that I have seen. Not in the plot, which is a rather ordinary slasher story, but rather in how the scenes are cut. The murder weapon gives us a lot of meaningless conversational scenes, but they go on much longer than in most films of this type. Because of this, some of the victims seem a little less like cardboard cutouts. Just a little. It was difficult for me to understand exactly what was happening at the beginning, and I continued to wonder whether certain events were sequences of dreams. My favorite scene is when two guys run from the killer and hide in the car. In the glove compartment, they find a gun. "Thank you, Lord!" one of them exclaims happily. The head of this guy suddenly becomes like a mannequin's head, and it took me enough time to think, â€œWhat is this? Then BOOM! The head explodes, and I realized that it had to be one of the guys in the car who shot him in the head with a shotgun. I like this scene, but the film is very bad. 3/10.
