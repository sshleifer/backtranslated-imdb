I was the one "selected" to see this movie in the preview. <br /> <br /> First you need to know that this movie is based on the video game "Far Cry", a really good game for its time (2004). secondly, you should know that the registrar of this film is a great juve. this is a person who shoots video games (siege dungeons, bloodrayne, postal, etc.) and makes films of them (VERY terrible ....). <br /> <br /> I still remember when I saw Ball "Royal swords: the siege tail of the dungeon." there were such terrible mistakes in this film (for example, 3 scenes that were played at the same time, 2 in the daytime and one in the nighttime .....) <br /> <br /> so let's move on to the “distant cry” » . if you expect cool action, forget it. really cheap tricks and a plastic helicopter are far from real action. if you expect a cool story, forget it. Focusing on a good story of the game, this film is a laugh. Playing actors makes a movie in many ways a fun, but not very good way. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to watch this movie for free. so make no mistake and pay for this garbage. This is one of my favorite movies for the bottom 100. !!!!
