What should have been a dramatic tale about life on the Murray River turns out to be a stupid, juicy novel about an English refugee (Sigrid Thornton with an Australian accent) who falls in love with the steamer Larrikin (John Waters). <br /> <br /> The first half of this four and a half hour mini-series demonstrates some promise, but it soon collapses as it becomes predictable and subtle. The plot needed some real inspiration and spark to animate the film. The early release of Gus Mercurio did not help, since his character seemed to me the only interesting one. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the longer TV version has more depth, because of course there wasnâ€™t in this video translation. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 27, 1993 - video
