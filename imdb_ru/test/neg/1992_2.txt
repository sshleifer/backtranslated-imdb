Cowardly and cynical, the Hospital represents the nadir of a special brand, Paddy Chaefsky, dedicated to celebrating the status quo disguised as satire. <br /> <br /> Thanks to wild director Arthur Hiller, this ridiculous script becomes visually ugly. This is an inappropriate presentation that it deserves. <br /> <br /> Only the magnificent performance of George Scott in the vile role that he was supposed to play keeps the Hospital from complete disaster. <br /> <br /> However, ironically, Scott’s performance is a disservice to viewers. His magnetism makes them watch when they can turn off the VCR and clean their wardrobes, look at the clouds, or watch Baywatch repeats. <br /> <br /> Of course, anyone who emotionally invests money in the installation — modern medicine seems to be out of control — will feel deceived by a grim return when Chaifsky shows that the system works just fine, that leave your carpet. <br /> <br /> While the first half of this film gives some entertaining black comedy, everything turns out to be a red herring. However, before this becomes clear, Chaafski gives Scott some good words as his middle man, middle male, white man. <br /> <br /> Bitter, alcoholic, impotent, Dr. Scott Dr. Herbert Bock alienates those who know him better than anyone, and he has a desire to continue to alienate them. In Chaefsky’s worldview, all this, of course, makes Boca a magnet for a hippie chick, half the age. <br /> <br /> Playing a collection of adjectives, long-legged, long-legged, reckless, and almost without a bust, Diane Rigg fights as a "girl." British Rigg is mistakenly considered a southwestern free spirit, but any other actress will fight too. Like the rest of the good actors who were wasted, Rigg could not overcome the script, which does not interest any character, except Boca, or any philosophy beyond banality. <br /> <br /> For George S. Scott fans, this is another turn of the star and worth seeing. For fans of black comedy, turn it off after the first 45 minutes. For everyone else, do not worry.
