This film is, in fact, a how-to on how to be a well-connected pedophile. I am amazed that so many people - especially other gays - saw this film and read the book, and nobody realized that if Weber was not an influential photographer, he would be in prison, taking time to abuse the child . Poor Peter Johnson. Weber took this poor, naive (albeit incredibly beautiful) teenager whom he found in a training camp for middle school fighters in the Midwest, brought him to his home and took thousands of his homoerotic photos, many of which were completely frontal Nude throughout Johnson's teenage years. This is not art. This is child abuse. Worse, Weber made a lot of money out of it, and poor Johnson will have serious “problems” for the rest of his life. Weber's depraved love for the boy is absolutely terrible, as is his talk about famous (and not so) famous people when he tries to complete Johnson's "education". Terribly, and then just boring. The only thing I can say about the film is a fascinating study of self-deception. But I can't help but wonder why no one ever thought about the impact it had on Chop Suey himself (Weber's nickname for Johnson).
