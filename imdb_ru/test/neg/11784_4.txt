Irwin Allen put all his talents into this: he co-wrote the script, the producer and director of this cartoon "epic" about the nuclear submarine and its efforts to reduce the ring of radiation surrounding the Earth. The potentially exciting story doesn’t take off, despite the eclectic cast. A variety of players from Walter Pijon and Joan Fontaine to Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden are interestingly mixed and give a dash of color, but this crude science fiction is pretty silly. Good for a few random laughs, but Allen didn’t seem to know the difference between a strong, hard adventure and meaningless nonsense. Later popular TV series. ** from ****
