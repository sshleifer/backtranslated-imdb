I had high hopes for this film. After all, Ocean 11 was a really great Hollywood product. The quick jokes, the incredible star power and the harsh script made him one of the funniest caper films I've ever seen. Of course, the continuation continued with all the money made, and I, for example, was excited. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, this film just shook me. Surprised by how badly wrong things can go. This film was all for this; return of the entire original cast, the same director, news stories about crazy antics on set and behind the scenes. How could this go wrong? <br /> <br /> It starts immediately with one of the most clumsy and unnecessary introductory sequences and goes down from there. After a rather silly short scene between Pitt / Zeta-Jones and Clooney / Roberts, the film spends a few minutes watching Andy Garcia's waltz from scene to scene, telling each individual member of the original eleven Danny Ocean that he wants his money back. Believe me, when I say that these scenes are intended only to complement Andy Garcia’s work time, because without these ridiculously awkward frames, his screen time would be WELL for less than five minutes. <br /> <br /> This leads me to another serious problem. I had with this movie. The pace is so unevenly upset that the characters completely fall out of the story, and only sometimes return later. Bernie Mac's character is excluded from the script at an early stage and never returns, with the exception of two short scenes without dialogue. Garcia appears in the first few minutes and returns to an exceptionally short scene at the end. Roberts appears about 5 minutes at the beginning, and is not even mentioned until there is about 20-25 minutes left. Even Clooney himself spends most of the film in prison. <br /> <br /> All this would be an excuse if the movie were funny. Totally. 90% of jokes are completely flat, and those who work, at best, deserve laughter. The "plot" is undoubtedly worthless, and the feeling left me feeling left me. At some point in the film, the team gets a job worth $ 2.5 million out of almost $ 100 million that they need to collect before Garcia’s two-week term. Some characters even admit how absurd it is to spend time on this work, but they still do it! More than 30 minutes of the film revolve around this work, which they don’t even have to do, and there is a feeling that this part of the story was simply added to complement the running time. In addition, the equipment they use to cope with this work is VERY costing millions and millions. Just wait until you see what they are doing to cope with this work, and understand that it will cost much more than $ 2.5 million. Obviously, because of this, they have to perform several jobs to earn money. The beauty of the first film was one big fraud and how ingenious and confusing it was realized. Here they get so much work, in so many different ways, that they rush through them all, because their explanation will make a film lasting several hours. <br /> <br /> We all know that going into this movie will be a big twist at the end. Such is the nature of caper film. The turn at the end of the Twelve Ocean made me laugh; not because it was funny, but because I could not believe how I was deceived. I will not give it up because I know that most of you will be foolish enough to throw money to watch this movie, anyway. <br /> <br /> What I will say is that it takes most of the two hours you have already experienced completely inappropriate. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled to see this film, after completely adoring "Ocean" 11. I left the theater, feeling that I was the victim of a really great fraud caused by the actors. and the crew of this film tricked me into thinking that this film was really worth seeing. I never gave 1 to the film on IMDb.com, but for the first time for everything. Consider yourself warned .... 1/10
