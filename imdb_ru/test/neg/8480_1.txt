There was no need for this film, plain and simple. The original, although hated by some, was something really interesting to me, mainly because it was before Jim Carrey began to lose his connection, and Cameron Diaz was, well, in general, “Smuuuuuuu!” 'Enough . So why make a sequel / prequel? Fair? Knowing that Jim Carrey would not do this should have been enough to understand that it should not be created. But then they just make mistake after mistake. Jamie Kennedy. Why is this person still allowed to breathe? Writing and story: terrible. Why would I want to see a child in a mask? Also, why would I want to see it fly? Ever? How did someone think this is a good idea ?! Acting is despicable, in fact, almost everything in this film. I'm trying to keep calm, or IMDb probably won't let me post it. Bottom line: do not watch this piece of garbage. Take the original, see how good Cameron Diaz looked and how Jim Carrey had a career and laugh. Do not waste a second of your time.
