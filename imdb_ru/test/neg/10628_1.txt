There are enough comments on the movie itself. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say something about the German version, which I recently saw on TV. It is heavily chopped. 103 to 76 minutes! As a rule, the bloodiest scenes are cut out for German television. I understand the reasons for this, but this film was something else. They not only cut out “bitter shots” - they cut out entire sequences, sparing only glimpses. For example: "We must attack THEIR" - one 5-second shot of explosions in the camp - the main character runs away. <br /> <br /> When the attack on the island begins, it is no longer possible to follow the plot line. All sections create something that is a chain of erroneous, scattered scenes that no longer have any meaning. <br /> <br /> I could not wait for the end, spending 60 minutes on this nonsense. /> <br /> I think I would give the original version 7/10. The German version costs only 1/10 <br /> <br /> Get it on DVD (and first check the lead time) or forget it.
