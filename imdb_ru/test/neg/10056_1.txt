Filmed in Arizona by a mostly foreign team, "Nightkill" is one of the most awkward crime dramas I've ever seen. Robert Mitchum (wearing a cowboy hat) will track down the recently widowed Jacqueline, hoping to find out if she had a hand in the death of her husband. Wardrobe Jacqueline belongs to Dale Evans, and her dog's name is "Cowboy" ... it seems as if someone is confident in the American myth that all Westerners speak and dress like John Wayne's descendants! The screenplay of Joan Andr√© and John Cayce might have worked better if he were perceived as a parody; This mystical thriller just plays manual, and director Ted Post sleeps at the controls. Do not get carried away with the art of video boxing about how Jacqueline screams while taking a shower. She does take a shower in this film, but this is not significant (nor does it promote a dark conspiracy one iota). NO STARS from ****
