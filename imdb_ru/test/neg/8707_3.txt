If you are a Christian or a Jew who hopes to see the exact biblical (or Torah) image of the events in Exodus, you will be disappointed with this film. In typical Hollywood fashion, people who are not even in the Bible are “created” to support the characters and play a big role in the film. Jethro’s role had completely changed, and he became nothing more than an incredulous father-in-law, instead of the shepherd priest who gave Moses excellent advice. God is largely removed from the film, and instead, viewers have the impression that Moses must find out for himself. Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> This film is a typical humanistic twist in biblical things and an attempt to place greater responsibility on Moses for trying to understand what God wants and what he should do. Those who know well the book of Exodus, will see not only inconsistencies in the film, but also obvious changes in the events. Most importantly, they will see the almost complete lack of dialogue between God and Moses, which defines everything Moses does after the burning bush. Far from being alone, as shown in the film, Moses is guided by God in detailed and direct communication. <br /> <br /> Obviously, even Hallmark cannot recognize the direct role of God, and without his spoken words to Moses many events do not make sense. To compensate for this, Hallmark really changed some things. For example, after the golden calf, God harass people, and they must look at the symbol of the serpent to live. The symptom creates a civil war instead, and the Israelis choose the parties and then kill each other. Of course, Moses wins. <br /> <br /> In this film, there may be minimal value for non-believers, as this may cause them to seek answers, but believers must stay away. Perverted events and changes make it dangerous for anyone who does not know his Bible. Read the Exodus for yourself; nothing replaces.
