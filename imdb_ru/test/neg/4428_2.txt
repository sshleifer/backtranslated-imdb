Director Luo Wei, as you know, read the racing newspapers and dozed on the set - tells us something about his "approach to making films, right?" Reviews I read fall into two categories: 1) this film is so bad funny, or 2) this film is so bad that it is boring. <br /> <br /> So let's go back to what we all agree on - this film is really bad. <br /> <br /> I vote for category 2). This story is almost incomprehensibly complex, and it is even more rugged and distorted by the surprisingly poor camera work and installation. Still, Lo Wei was so in love with her that he slows down so that we can all have a long look at it, whether we like it or not. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Luo Wei was upset that day (or two) when this film was made - he just wanted everyone to suffer, the actors, the crew and the audience alike. <br /> <br /> Rid yourself of the torment.
