Not as well done as the Guinea Pig films that he was inspired by (Flesh and Blood Flowers or Devil's Experiment), and not conveying any real philosophy, this feature of the video, which hardly has a duration, adds hardcore sex (censored with mosaic) to his inspiration. The special effects of makeup, which include cutting the abdomen and darkening, are quite good if they are not illuminated. The amateur sense of production is a distraction. Everything looks cheap and lazy. The lighting is sharp, sound and installation sloppy. The simple story includes porn actress who ends up starring in a real snuff film. As soon as she gets tired of the abuse, the real violence begins. In the scene of the hero of the film, the actor cuts the belly of a woman in a close-up graphic, shoves his dick into it and continues to do its job. I did not find the shocking "psycho snuffers." On the contrary, I discovered that it was a desperate attempt by amateurs to find a single “guinea pig” and its bloody kin. Interestingly, this was spread by Aroma, a leading producer of fetishes.
