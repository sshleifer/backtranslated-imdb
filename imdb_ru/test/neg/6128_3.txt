This is Charlotte Armstrong’s second adaptation of Claude Chabrol for the screen: the first was “The Break” (1970) (from the novel “Balloon Man”), and it’s really a pity that no one cares about it. Shabrol sleeps, and I urge any of his fans to see him. <br /> <br /> The Chocolate Web wasn't such a strong detective story. I read it 20 years ago and forgot about it. First, good things, and then, in the end, disappoints. This is an intricate film about Shabrol, in which elements of flourishing are mixed (around 1969) and many other things that happened in the eighties, for example, “Pulet” au vinaigre ", is not one particularly memorable piece. <br /> <br /> Part of the frustration comes from the actors: this is a terribly bad meeting: Jacques Dutronk plays like a zombie, Isabelle Huppert shows himself to be somewhat limited actress, finally quite vulgar. He worked in "une affaire de femme", he is not here. b They are soft and unremarkable.Actors from the past, say, Stephen A Drang or Michel Bouquet (both in the “breaks”) were brilliant and contributed to the then unique atmosphere of Chabrol. <br /> <br /> The story itself is no different: beginning as a kind of “serious” “la vie est un long fleuve tranquille "(besides, the character hints at a very funny movie of Etienne Shatlieza), the movie stretches and continues as a ridiculous psychological drama after that. We will not congratulate the young pianist, who after everything she learned about her evil mistress, agrees to drive on a dangerous road. <br /> <br /> Because he makes too many films, Shabrol often produces turkeys. To watch one of his films, you should select this one of all his things to capture. <br /> <br /> It seems that the bourgeois satire of Chabrol finally gave way to indulgence. In the “break,” Armstrong's first adaptation is the average detective story that Chabrol has completely surpassed — he should have Ar Odran say: “They have so much money!”. Here Shabrol lost its bite, its strength.
