I am truly amazed that I received 88% for “Rotten Tomatoes” and the nomination for the best foreign film on the Oscars. Rating 7.3 on IMDb ... this is not so surprising given the way IMDb users have voted recently. I simply cannot get into the film, in which the actual facts about his main character are clearly distorted, and not at all in such a way as to make the film artistic, but rather to make it melodramatic and less boring. What turns out to actually make it very boring for anyone who expected to see a serious and reliable interpretation of the life of Genghis Khan. The contrived and overly dramatized Mongol often echoes the film “300,” a film that cannot be happier if its ridiculous inaccurate; but unlike the 300, the Mongol perceives himself seriously. It is the stoic seriousness, mixed with obvious inaccuracies that makes it really the most boring film I've seen this year; perhaps the most action movie or biopic I've ever seen. The characters were written pathetically. Honestly, I doubt that Genghis Khan was as boring and passive as shown in this film. What is funny to me, because if I think that something needs to be changed for the sake of theatricality, it turns a boring person into an interesting person. The romance between Khan and Borte is also boring, simple and stupid. In addition, without giving anything away, the Mongol contains one of the stupidest scenes I have seen in a long time — where there should be a good 20 minutes of plot development, the film just skips ahead without any explanation. It was like something from the Saturday Night Live monastery parodying epic action films with a terrible rhythm. (I mentioned how seriously Mongol perceives himself?) Meanwhile, it stretches like no other film I have ever seen. Even now I could swear it was three o'clock. After about 45 minutes, I checked the time, being almost certain that it was almost over. In addition to some beautiful landscapes and quality games from Asano (of course), Mongol is, frankly, just a disaster. It completely failed to entertain me or enlighten me anyway. I would never give this film a second chance. And not to seem racist or patriotic or anything else, but give me a crappy and senseless American epic over the Mongol any day. At least, then I know what I get, unlike Mongolian, when reviews and ratings made me believe that this is really something worthwhile. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing is that I hated the Mongolians, this I have friends who, I know, without a doubt, just love it.
