There must be some kind of harassment to punish producers for funding such stupid scenarios. I feel that some kind of criminalization of a bad movie can prevent more films created by this idiot. Of course, there is an interesting set of characters in it, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen a more cardboard game from the whole cast, as in this unique shit. This director should be somehow punished for not bringing at least some presentation to these people. Thus, detachment is a topic (no, in fact they beat you on the head), this does not mean that each character should repeat his lines, as if they were on NPR. Did I mention this movie was crap? Finally, I’m not sure what connection memories can have with incurable bone cancer, but I’m pretty sure that if you were completely dead, your cancer would continue to grow regardless of this. This film is an insult to cancer patients, medical workers and not retarded people. Oh, and finally, bumblebees fly because they produce enough lift for their mass, flapping their wings like any other flying insect. I absolutely despise people who present false knowledge as a fact. Next time do a little research before using a silly delusion as a prerequisite for an entire crazy movie. ONLY CHILDREN BELIEVE IN JESUS!
