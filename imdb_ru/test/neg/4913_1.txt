Aksar is a terrible movie. Scenario, history, acting skills are ridiculous. Dino Morea plays a man who pays Emraana Hashmi to seduce his wife. Yes, it is as funny as it sounds. Both Moray and Khashmi offer an incredibly and surprisingly bad game. Udita Goswami plays an aggressive, capricious and evil wife. She is beautiful, but she has no acting talent. There is one hit song in the film, "Jhalak Diklaja", written and sung by Himes Reshammia. I could never understand the hype around this song, because I never found it particularly good, although it is striking. The film should be a thriller, but instead it looks just like a comic strip, thanks to terrible directing and writing. Avoid this cheaply at all costs.
