By the time the HellRaisers franchise reached its fourth film, the room was already a bit thin. Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) is a future scientist who, while a prisoner tells stories of his prisoner, about how his ancestors (all played on Ramsey) first built an evil puzzle box. how his pedigree dealt with the indicated box. The film is filled with a lack of continuity with respect to other films and a lack of consistency in this. Yes, this may be due to a combination of rewriting, mass cuts of the original version of the film or what you have. But I see the film as it is, and not what it was or could be. And as it is now a mess. Of course, the franchise will continue indefinitely with a direct sequel to the DVD, but this one was pretty much a deadly nail because it has chances to get a new one released theatrically ever again. <br /> <br /> My rating: D-
