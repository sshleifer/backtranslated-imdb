... this one is simply not worth the cost of a movie ticket. What these filmmakers have done cannot be properly called filmmaking; Rather, they simply selected sixteen students of a certain variety (although not as wide a variety as the surveys suggested) and broke up with them. The results, to be frankly frank, much more boring, self-deprecating, exhausting and unpleasant, granular than truly insightful. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, moments of recognition and identification of a kind. perhaps only in a documentary, but in general there is not much more truth here than in The Hooligan or, for that matter, a worthy television documentary of the same kind. The film, although it is full of talk about sex, sexual diversity and racism, does not bring anything on the table that could be useful to anyone who seriously thought about any of these problems. And although certain segments serve absolutely no purpose other than to introduce a little (admittedly desirable) comic relief, most often the five-minute limit does not allow one to be emotionally connected with one of the students. An interesting idea, but a thumbs up for the CHAIN ​​CAMERA.
