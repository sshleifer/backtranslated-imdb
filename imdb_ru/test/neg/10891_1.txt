There are films that are so bad, they are good. In addition, there are films such as “Rest Stop,” which should never have been done, because they are simply terrible. <br /> <br /> Bad actions, unattractive characters, a predictable plot, and a supposedly supernatural twist that adds nothing to the story are key failures. Some decent special effects are the only things that deserve attention. <br /> <br /> I can’t even force myself to write a draft of the plot, because all I really want to do is warn you not to waste your time and money on this film. Do yourself a favor and don't even bother with this movie at all. It is 1.5 hours of your life that you will never return. <br /> <br /> 1/10
