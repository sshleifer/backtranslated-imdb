Well, at least we have to admit that big Hollywood horror producers are finally getting smarter and more insightful. Instead of waiting patiently to buy the rights of Asian horrors and subsequently remake them in America, they now found that they could simply hire Asian directors and instruct them to make their own completely new ghost story right in the states. It is like killing two birds with one stone; way guys! "Messengers" are largely identical to any other supernatural chiller that has left the East since the days of the "Ring". Roughly speaking, this means that this is a boring, long film, in which there is no blood, but there are many false scares and embarrassing weaknesses in it: “Have we scared you already?” Moments. The Pang brothers (Danny and Oxide) had previously made an extremely overvalued "Eye", and it became a tradition for them to build a story with clues and hints at a point where it becomes almost impossible to live up to the expectations of their curious. audience, but they don't seem to want to change their formula anytime soon. And they are also dishonorable enough to recycle the same old and repetitive ghost themes over and over. Restless spirits of previous residents, trapped in the walls of a remote rural farm? The family of the main characters is separated by the unprocessed injuries of the past, so they first need to restore faith and trust in each other? Give me a break! Add a videotape and a curse for seven days, why not? Even attempts to make you jump into your place are too déjà vu and do not frighten anyone over the age of 7 years. Slamming doors, dirty and gradually growing stains on the walls, ghostly appearances, noises from the cellar ... The endless abuse of such cheap tricks almost offends horror fans. "Messengers" revolve on the family on the way to a new life in the country, like the producers of sunflower. The family situation is kind of unfavorable, because the personal tragedy (which is not revealed until the end of the film) led to the fact that their youngest son stopped talking, and the parents did not trust their disgusting teenage daughter. Soon, the children experience a strange presence in a remote farmhouse, but they fail to convince their parents to leave. This pretty much completes the entire movie. Little Ben sees things, but cannot speak, and Jessica is constantly under attack by supernatural forces, but no one listens to her. The main premise of the "Messengers" is very derived from the immortal classics of Stanley Kubrick "Shining", only it lacks a constantly ominous atmosphere and an alarming tone. The script takes itself too seriously, although it is fairly easy to predict the final outcome, and the complete absence of violence and bloodshed is unforgivable. At least, the “Eye”, in the end, brought several genuine shocks, while the happy, happy, joyful finale of the “Messengers” was simply pitiful. The only positive elements I can think of are beautiful rural filming locations, adequate editing work and promising young acting talents (and beauty) by Kristen Stewart. And there is a strange, but unfortunately underdeveloped supporting role for William B. Davis.
