It is best in the middle when most characters are excited and follow those they haven't had before. At about this point, we see Susan Sarandon’s stately breasts (even through a veil). Oddly enough, Beverly D'Angelo, who is not shy of nude nature, shows nothing at all, but Aida Turturro? of all the people ?? does. On the other hand, the less they say that Walken plays a homosexual, the better. The film itself has a small plot; Theatrical dialogues and “normal” dialogues often overlap, and I would not think that this is a good idea. Life in the theater: who cares? Sometimes in the dialogue something happens, but the film stretches with a stretch.
