I don’t really mind the factors that others here objected to — actions, coverage, and so on. For the most part, these things were performed well enough to carry the film and spell out its points. In the end, it's just a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I was disturbed by the points themselves. Because it is a deeply moralistic film, and its morality is very tasteless. In fact, this is a fundamentalist Christian morality, and this is a fundamentalist Christian film. Look at the "sins": <br /> <br /> * Persona Sutherland chose a child at school when he was a teenager, which led to his accidental death. <br /> <br /> * Baldwin's character is used. Men's tricks, beliefs, and attractive looks make quite a few women, some of whom he has filmed. Oh, pigs! How unlucky he is that women are such passive, shapeless creatures that they have no complicity in this matter. <br /> <br /> * The character's father Roberts returned from Vietnam as a drug addict, so ashamed that he was caught shooting, that he was killing himself. What a terrible sin! Why didn't he just become an alcoholic like everyone else? <br /> <br /> * and Bacon’s character chose another student. How awful! The fact that he himself was a child does not seem to mean anything. It seems that children are judged divinely by adult criteria. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe many people support this level of moral absolutism. It seems that in the comments to this film it seems to have gone unnoticed. Is everyone just buying this stuff? At least, human laws refer to children differently than adults, recognizing that their ethical meaning is partially formed. This film has no such doubts, and I find it rather undesirable. The same applies to the fact that women are helpless, fluffy creatures in front of the evil lusts of young people. Or that a Vietnamese addicted veterinarian is so shameful that suicide is the right choice. Pathetic.
