Grudge 2 ... We'll see. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Japanese horror movie, not a horror or an evil killer. I liked the first and original Ju-On. I feel that much more justice could be done for this. Aubrey existed only to fill what was “discovered” in the final (which, if you’ve already seen Ju-On, you already know the whole movie), everything that really was a complete remake of Ju-On Just closer than The Grudge. Although everyone may have thought that arriving in America was a bit interesting, it was expected, because the house that burned down at the end of The Grudge left a second thirst for a new conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Save your $ 6.50 and wait until it is released on DVD, rent it, look and decide if you want to buy it. This movie is good for falling asleep at 2 am. But overall, I would say 4 out of 10. Sorry Grudge fans, it’s just ... They just failed in that.
