Dante would be upset if he knew that his masterpiece is played out of dolls !!! Also the actors who played the puppets are sold out. Due to the fact that the puppet game does not work, it simply does nothing. No one really cares who the puppet was. people only care about who played the title role, like a real movie. it's just annoying how you could mock such an amazing person and his faith in this stupid little movie. It must be a crime and ... I can't believe you ruin such a book. I thought the film was absolutely ridiculous and should be destroyed !!!! This completely destroys what you intend to get from reading. You just make it a big joke.
