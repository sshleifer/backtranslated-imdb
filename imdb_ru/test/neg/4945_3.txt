I watch this movie when I write it. It took about 45 minutes from the beginning of the film, and there was so much back and forth and an empty drama, I do not quite understand what this would lead to. No facts, just enough to leave your assumptions. The game of the main daughter is painful. How was it ever done ??? Not the best of life movies.
