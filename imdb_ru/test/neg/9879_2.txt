From the creators of Underworld, we are definitely the worst werewolf movie I've ever seen. This is basically a reconstructed version of Underworld, but it lacks vampires (not so much), cool effects (BIG deal) and generally almost everything that can be done correctly to create a decent film about lycanthropy (the biggest deal) of them all !) A twenty-year-old lycanthropic chocolate maker named Vivian currently lives in Romania since her family was tracked down and executed in America many years ago for being a werewolf. There she belongs to a small society (or a pack) of werewolves and is apparently chosen to unwittingly marry the pack leader, Gabriele, whose son - some toad with a British accent - takes on the task of hunting outside the pack. Apparently, they were discovered in other countries earlier and want to stay in Romania, avoiding negative attention, therefore, of course, such activity is considered prohibited. Vivian falls in love with an American artist who does not notice her participation in the group of bloodthirsty predators. When they end up discovering a secret relationship, things become erratic, when someone is killed, and the person is forced to participate in the deadly tradition in which they let him go in the forest and hunt - giving the pack a chance to turn into their "wolf." consists of a big jump before they catch fire and land like a wolf. Very gentle effects. The whole movie is like a tamed underworld with some kind of dirty, romantic montages and very small action. Watching it in the theater, I could not wait for the end. zhasno boring disappointment. Avoid!
