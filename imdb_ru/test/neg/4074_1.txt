This film was embarrassing with its clichés, bad game and low production value in general. It all starts badly with a long-haired 3-star general calling the Master’s hero a “major” when he clearly wears silver oak leaves of a lieutenant colonel. But what was most troubling was the team of soldiers on the Neptune Atoll. How can you lose touch with reality? They were all flight experts at 747, and the scenes of the soldiers digging the ditch were beyond the comics. <br /> <br /> WARNING: THIS MOVIE IS DANGEROUS FOR YOUR Intellectual Health! LOOK AT YOUR OWN RISK!
