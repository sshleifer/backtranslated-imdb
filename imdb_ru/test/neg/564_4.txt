Committed to fictitiously documentary style, the disruptive agents of the late 60s and the alleged detractors of the main government were arrested and given a choice. After sentencing for their wrong actions, there is a choice - to go to prison for 7 years or spend three days and two nights in the desert of southern California in the Park of punishments. In a 100-degree heat, prisoners must walk more than fifty miles to the American flag for their freedom. US and state law enforcement will follow two hours later. If the dissidents are captured, it means prison. <br /> <br /> This pseudo-documentary film features: Carmen Argenziano, Catherine Kittner, Mary Ellen Kleinhall, Stan Armstead, Scott Turner, Patrick Boland and Kent Forman.
