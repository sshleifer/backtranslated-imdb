“Drop, while ahead” is a phrase that they will never learn. A typical scenario of a Hollywood sequel: if the first film was just shocking, the second one - no, expect the third film to be the worst that will appear on the screen this year. Even worse - the prequels, whose events have already been explained in detail. If you have not seen the first two films, you will not like this one. It's like starting to watch “The Lord of the Rings” or “Star Wars” with the latest film of the trilogy. So "apart" this movie is not. <br /> <br /> Remember in the first movie about the revenge of Lucian? Remember the second about the long-lost wild brother? Well, if you saw these two 5-minute moments and glued them together, would you get ?? 5 minute prequel But the creators of the ether thought that these 5 minutes were vital historical events or simply wanted to give work to some actors, actors and film crews and, possibly, make some money in the process. “I have a lot of money, I make films for a living, and I'm bored. What will i do? I know! I will make a movie. ” Anyway, do you get this 5 minute prequel and stretch it for 90 minutes ?? This is the film. And you know what will happen to the main "immortal" characters, so there is little waiting. By the way, the whole drama of the film is in those 5 min. The only thing that made my eyebrow rise was the murder of my mother at the beginning of the film. Sick. The rest was a Braveheart remix. If you need a comedy, first watch Braveheart, and then this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I am going to rant a little ?? the film put me in the mood. Who invented the “vampire versus werewolf” concept? He is older than me and aged just as quickly. And why are vampires like gothic girls in the heat, and werewolves like crazy bears? Hiding bad movies behind splitting fails. Isn't it time for us to get any sane werewolves with a vertical posture? How can their immutable werewolves even multiply if they tear them all apart? And why didn't vampires rule the world with all of their own strength? Blah blah blah ?? What a waste.
