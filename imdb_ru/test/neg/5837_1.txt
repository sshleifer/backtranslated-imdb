I like sci-fi movies and even low-rated films meant for television, baskets, films that I can still find interesting. Well, I found it in the trash can and brought it as a choice for the movie evening with a group of friends. <br /> <br /> I was literally * amazed * for bringing this film. <Br /> <br /> From the very beginning, acting skills are poor, the plot is soft, the plot is almost absent. All this leads to the fact that the right film actually:. Soft core porn graphic film <br /> <br /> The film began with a prison woman, where the prisoners are all sexy women working in some kind of mine. First, the clue that this film is NOT serious: attractive women in prison are forced to do physical labor. Yes, right! No difference. : P After the “conspiracy” continued, it was overshadowed by the meaningless scenes of people having sex. In the middle of the movie, my friends and I stopped watching, it was so stupid. The next day I thought that I would give the film one more chance and watch the rest. I looked another 15 minutes and gave up again. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a decent sci-fi movie or even a sci-fi movie about monsters, DO NOT SEE the deadly goal! If you want to see a low-budget, soft core of porn that is light on the site, then see Lethal Target.
