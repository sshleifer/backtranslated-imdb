Fun !! I would swear that Ed Wood wrote this. Terrible. I loved every frame. Bad movie fans, this is your trophy! I will watch it again. Words cannot explain how interesting this film is. Pare's career must have gone low, but I really think he is heading towards Leslie Nilsson. He was perfect for that. Awful, just awful !! You will like it !! Make friends, a lot of beer, and you will have the time of your life. This is the MST3000 party waiting to appear. Enjoy!! It is worth renting! You like a Colombo-type cop and comic embossed coroner. A bad guy makes you laugh on the floor. He is also in another Pare movie, Komodo vs. Cobra, and he's just as good there. I don't know what the budget was, but they will return it, because this film is destined to become the best unintended comedy of the year.
