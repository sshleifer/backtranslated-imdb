I really wanted this movie to be liked. In the second film of this series it was stupid, the feeling of the drive in the film was funny (of course, I was also drunk). I watched this film with great expectation from such an experience of high cinematic fun, a la Mystery Science Theater 3000. I WRONG !!!!! This film is a terrible waste of the film, and I liked the second one !!!! From the effeminate villain with the frightened wig of David Bowie to the tasteless, disgusting villains-women with laughter who could remove the paint from the garage door, it was all just a painful mess. I really felt bad about Sue Price because the material was shorter than its height actress (that pretty much says it all). A terrible, terrible movie (this is not a recommendation).
