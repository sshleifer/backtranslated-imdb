Shortly after this film was released, Salman Khan was given a 6-year sentence. (Read on to find out why I mention this.) <br /> <br /> And I breathed a sigh of relief. Not that I was happy that he was jailed for something, because he was a celebrity, but I was happy, because it meant that there would be no more films of Salman Khan, no more of his history and no more a lot of advertising (read replay). <br /> <br /> This movie has no meaning. <br /> <br /> A scene where a child belonging to a family member makes a rocket with an activated voice. According to the script of the film, he will pursue anyone. But ultimately he will only find Salman Khan of the Naked Chested. Well, that is exactly what happened. <br /> <br /> Rocked is activated in another stupid way, and you need to have an IQ of 0.001 to believe it. Then he pursues Salman Khan, who was on his water scooter, and the pursuit continues, if he has not finished with all the possible stunts that he could show to a stupid public. (In my opinion, all those people who gave this film 5 and higher, if they are not paid for it.) <br /> <br /> Another breathtaking, incredible scene was at the end, when all the preparations for Marriage were made , and Salman Khan with Govinda in Disguise comes and stops the marriage of another of these highly undesirable songs. Later, although everything is done and ready a simple confession by Govinda and Katrina Kaif to Father Katrina and Bingo. It's all right, and Govinda is marrying a Picture .... <br /> <br /> It made me wonder if it was so easy to convince why they didn't do it, tortured us for so many hours and didn't spend my money. <br /> <br /> This film should be avoided, and do not even think that there is any scene in it that is worth watching. The plot is too cut off from the characters appearing from nowhere and eventually disappearing ... for the former Chut, don ... What a waste of characters. <br /> <br /> After this film, I made a promise that I would not watch Salman Khan Films for the rest of my life, unless he won an Oscar ... (hahahah ... which means I would never did not look)
