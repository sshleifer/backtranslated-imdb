... when was this movie. <br /> <br /> What a bore. Attempt to humor, but in fact not too good. Several good ideas were put forward, and the cast and wardrobe was fine. <br /> <br /> I was expecting more, unfortunately, I could no longer put up with it, disconnected halfway and threw out the tape, went to the rental store to get my money back ...
