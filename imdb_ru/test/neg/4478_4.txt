I had high hopes when I entered the theater - when I saw the trailer, I was just as bloated as the next person, who saw how great talent was involved in creating a story with a beautiful premise. <br /> <br /> However, it is disappointing to see that this talent is devastated by the poor composition of the songs - the words are stocky and crappy, probably because it was composed with a more western theme. It is not difficult for me to imagine the same melodies with French or English lyrics. In “Mandarin” they sound just weird. <br /> <br /> Musical subjects were also badly cut off — too fast to be fun, and the shots of the painful looking actors lasted too long. <br /> <br /> Special effects - another disappointment. Suffice it to say that it’s quite obvious where the special effects start and stop. <br /> <br /> This is not “Moulin Rouge” and not “In the mood”, despite the occasional (and very similar) theme of a slow waltz. In general, the hour is too long to tell a simple story.
