Endless repetitions about the evil World Bank, the IMF, globalization and the Americans are blamed for all the problems of Africa - and the film is long, about two hours, but it seems longer. The French have actually occupied Mali, the country in which the film takes place, for centuries, but they are only minor bad guys. <br /> <br /> None of the heroes will know enough to really care about what happens to them, they are completely marginal for a sermon that goes on and on. There is no plot, no character development, no humor (with the exception of a few blows to Bush and Wolfowitz, but this is almost deceiving, it's so simple), and production values ​​are mediocre - there is no redemption. <br /> <br /> It is amazing that a film can preach on such a big topic for two hours and bring real information to zero. In the Irish ballad "I was dying, and then there was a famine" more content. <br /> <br /> The film is boring, the subtitles are difficult to read, there is no real film content in the subject, and the propaganda is relentless. <br /> <br /> Skip this one.
