In this spaghetti western, there are three main American actors who take away a bit of the typical aura of spaghetti. The story is about the amnesty that the governor of New Mexico gives to all willing criminals to give them a chance to start a new life. Usually this kind of opportunity is limited by past events, but in this film it looks more like a murder license, because even new crimes (for example, threatening the governor) are forgiven. The story is an endless chain of murders, where almost every character has only a goal to deliver more corpses. Only a few lead to endurance. Clay McCord is plagued by nightmares associated with a children's event, where it is not surprising that he killed many people. In the midst of perpetual confusion, this kind of thinking lacks trust. Compared with the same films, such as BANDIDOS, for example, I didnâ€™t like any of the characters in this film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the weak content that is targeted at certain clients, this film is well shot, the plots are somewhat detailed, and the action is average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
