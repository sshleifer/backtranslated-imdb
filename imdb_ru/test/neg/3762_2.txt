I bought the "Rocketship X-M" on DVD in two packages with "Destination Moon". Now I understand why distributors have done this: no one who has ever seen this film would have bought it on their own. <br /> <br /> I cannot understand which school system was a reviewer who claimed that RXM "is great in its predictions about how space travel will take place ..." Run straight up and then turn right 90 degrees and move around faster and faster until you reach the speed of escape ... I don’t think I remembered this from the Apollo program. Never mind that astronauts should be weightless as soon as they turn off the engines, gravity changes direction every time they pass through in the engine room. Going to the moon, but “missing” it? No problem, it's just a jump and a jump (with help from divine providence), and you will be on Mars! And it's good if you want to start life on Mars, considering the state knowledge of the planets in 1950, it was an excusable agreement for storytelling, but can you make them look at least a STRANGER alien? These Martians looked like extras from the cast of “10,000 BC” I can make some scientific mistakes but it will not cost him iem with a second-class disciple is above average. <br /> <br /> And this is in addition to the screaming holes in the plot: 12 minutes before the launch (as you were reminded) with the constantly aching voice of the PA saying "X minus so many minutes"), astronauts give a press conference! I think because of the temporary crisis, Dr. Ekstrom did not change into a coat and tie before heading into space. And how convenient that, although they planned to go to the moon and had space suits for this, they brought hiking gear (and rifles!) In case they were on Mars. They were lucky that they landed anywhere, since it is obvious that the method they developed for landing was for Dr. E to look out the window and tell the pilot (Lloyd Bridges) to tune the throttles from time to time. A note for XM-2 designers: how about giving a pilot a window seat? <br /> <br /> Just like in previous comments about casual sexism, which delighted Dr. Lisa (Osa Massen), they condemn them all to constantly repeat their fuel calculations, but hey, this It was the beginning of the 50s. She was there to fill her sweater, not a useful feature. <br /> <br /> Rocketship XM is known for being one of the first films that said, "Oh god, we're all going to blow ourselves up." with these "atomic bombs", but you can see that this is not losing 77 minutes watching this recluse. By the way, this message could have a little more impact if the budget had money for the actual sets of the ruins of the Martian city, and not just matte paintings. <br /> <br /> I can appreciate “good” bad science fiction, for how the “future” looked unique, and also for the inherent (albeit indulgent) humor that can be found when we look back at the naivety of the audience 60 years ago, but this film must have been offensive even then. Rocketship X-M is not even suitable for MST3K style lighting. Sometimes bad is just ... bad. <br /> <br /> Anyone want to buy a DVD? I use it only once, I swear.
