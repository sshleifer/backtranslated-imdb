I love Juan Picker-Simon! He is my favorite director of bad movies, and throughout his career he has been incompetently trying to cash in on every successful modern trend in horror and fantasy genres. After the big hit "Superman", JP made his own and funny "Supersonic Man", he picked up a brutal madness in the films with insane "Pieces", and he really outplayed himself "Returning Aliens." “Spielberg’s SF blockbuster’s unofficial and completely ridiculous continuation. The Rift is clearly inspired by a series of lucrative underwater monster films such as The Abyss and Deepstar Six. From start to finish, you can entertain yourself by discovering all the stolen ideas and shameless robberies of these (and other) classic works. When the completely new and bizarre type of submarine disappears near the deep rupture of the Danniequin, the second mission with submarine designer Wick Hayes is sent on board to find out that It came with Siren One. In the dark depths of the ocean, a rescue mission discovers an underwater cave where the government is secretly experimenting with mutant sea creatures. Monsters are quite aggressive, but there is a danger among the crew members and a government enemy ... "Break" is a film that can be forgotten, but there is still genius in it, although monster models are very clever, and blood and blood fans will not complain either, since the atrocious attacks are rather terrible and merciless. The action is very wooden, although many of the acting names can definitely get better. It is advisable that you simply enjoy the clichés and bloody effects in the Rift, because if you start thinking about the script, you will find that it makes absolutely no sense.
