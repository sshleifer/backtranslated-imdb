MGM tried to connect and find young people with the Divine to show themselves and try themselves as leading men. Gable and Garbo had chemistry at SUSAN LENOX, but it was a lousy movie. Here, INSPIRATION, there is no chemistry between Garbo and Robert Montgomery, and the script is also bad. What were they thinking about? A modern, fast-talking Montgomery with a smart click and the long-suffering Garbo? This is a story like CAMILLE. A young student falls in love with a woman of the world and pushes off, learning about her past, rejects her, takes her back, rejects her ... you get a picture. Garbo is quite plausible as a model of the highest Parisian artist and feels at home, although she is bored, her life is at the top of society among her artistic friends and their dissolute morals. Suddenly she is fascinated by this innocent. She finally gives her life for him and plunges into poverty, only that he be saved and installed in his own house. Ironically, he intends to marry and keep her on the side - so much for his pure moral ethics earlier. <br /> <br /> Scenes are incredibly dull and boring, and nothing much happens. Only Marjorie Rambo, like Lulu, is able to give life to the cause: “Unfortunately, weak women have a strong appetite” and “Odette, where is your sting?” <br /> <br /> Only for Garbo fans.
