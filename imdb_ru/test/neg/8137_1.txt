Barbara Payton is supposed to be the sultry sexy young hot wife of Chickie, the owner of the old men plantation somewhere on a jungle site set up in a cheap studio in Hollywood. Raymond Barr wears his work shirt with the top button unbuttoned, while the sturdy, stocky brigadier of the plantation, with whom Mrs. Payton wants to blow up the joint. There is another girl, some kind of peasant slave, with whom Barr used to fool around, but he gave her an old emotion, so the obligatory squat old woman Vu-du tries to come up with a good spell to impose on him and Payton. I only watched it partially, because it is really terrible, so I couldnâ€™t even see the star of the show - I believe that this is a gorilla, into which wow-du-ha turned someone or someone else ..... what difference. I give this half star out of ten possible. It is not even polite, just very bad.
