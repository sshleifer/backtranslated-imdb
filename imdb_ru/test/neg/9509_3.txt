Admittedly, the only reason I watched this film - since it has been about ten years now - is because of Jan Holm; I was intrigued to see his image of my second favorite character in this play. In any case, this film is as sandy as everything that Old Zeff created after Jesus of Nazareth. But some of the best parts of the game were left out. I understand the direction / editing option, but I donâ€™t think it really makes the game fair. Maybe I'm too purist. I would have to direct people (who read this far) to the Bran version, if I did not despise his tendency to over-dramatize. All the same, he plays better than Hamlet, Gibson. But didn't we expect Gibson to show himself as an actor? Now all he did was prove that he wanted to make films in extinct languages. <br /> <br /> ... Perhaps the only action worthy of Shakespeare here is Scofield as the Ghost.
