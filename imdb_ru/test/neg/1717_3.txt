I read all the reviews for this movie straight to the video. I can agree that the film does not have the quality “Armageddon” or “Deep Strike”. However, if you are looking for a way to skip ninety minutes or so, then this is a movie that you can tolerate. <br /> <br /> I started watching the movie early in the morning as I was doing some kind of geek stuff. It was very nice, because I could switch between what I was doing and watch the movie without missing a second. This is a predictable film, and for some veteran actors (for example, Dennis Hopper), acting is not up to par. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that I paid only $ 2, and as the old adage goes: you get what you pay for! If you are looking for a movie with a deep meaning that will make you watch it again and again, then this is definitely a long video. On the other hand, if you are looking for something to pass the time, there is nothing wrong with Tycus (which was accidentally called Comet: Final Impact in Mexico, where I found this video).
