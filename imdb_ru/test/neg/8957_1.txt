It was a terribly bad movie, and I literally gasped when I first saw the Blue Screen puppets. Imagine the worst Blue Screen special effects you've ever seen, make them somehow much worse, and then combine them with poorly made rubber dolls and Play-doh dolls that look like something from a semi-retarded preschool art class. Then add the screeching, Yngwie Malmstein-Esquire, melodic solo guitar solos that sound too loud and too long. In general, the film is absolutely terrible and makes "Feders" look like "Rashomon." This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, with each quantifiable metric that gloomily descends, almost like a swamped poop in an eternal, slow whirlpool of a broken Rest Stop toilet. However, films like Actium Maximus should not be missed by fans of a bad movie, even if they watch videos on YouTube or elsewhere. This film is a little revelation if you can survive the trip. I think this director may be mentally ill, although that is a bit humiliating. Watching the way he discusses a project, you feel that he truly believes that he has created something wonderful. I guess he is a Star Wars baby of gonzo filmmakers. What a mess :-)
