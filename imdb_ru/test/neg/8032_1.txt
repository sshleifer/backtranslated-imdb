This film is just smelly. I know that some people will say that anyone who thinks that this is bad, "just does not understand." I like Wenders in the film American Friend and Wings of Desire. But this is complete rubbish. The main character is so annoying that I don’t care what he does. He, as was said in another review, bounces like a little annoying monkey. I just could not bear it or force myself to care. This is the case with most characters who seem to be struggling to be stupid or strange. I liked Mel Gibson’s character and Milla Jovovich’s characters, and I’d like them to focus more on them. Milla, of course, is beautiful, pathetic, and you really feel her and what she went through and why she is what she is. I see the Gibson character almost like Frankenstein. I would just like him to save Milla and destroy the hotel with all the useless boring characters who lived in it. Milla Rating 10 movie rating 0
