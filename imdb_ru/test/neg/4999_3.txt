Well - I put him "3" only because they clearly did not have the money to make this film, but I feel that he deserves an estimate of "2.3" which he had when I got here. I actually help raise his rating, despite the fact that I'm bored for the past hour and a half. I will save "1" and "2" for cheaper articles of shit. At least, the creators of the Rise of the Undead did not spend so much money. They managed to spend 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The film is too claustrophobic for me. The entire film takes place in the same building, in dark rooms and corridors. In such an environment there should have been more action or character development, but just a lot of meaningless conversations. I did not recognize any of the characters. There is a schoolgirl and a gothic chick, but we will never know more about them. None of the characters look really cute. <br /> <br /> A terrible movie, shot with a zero budget. No scary special effects. No waiting. There is nothing interesting here, guys. I admit that I downloaded it from the net. It was free, but I throw it away. <br /> <br /> Excuse the filmmakers. Lucky next time. This one looks more like a soap opera than a zombie movie.
