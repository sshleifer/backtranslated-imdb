If this film was awarded the Lumiere Prize for Best Film in French, then what kind of garbage comes out of France these days? <br /> <br /> An important question - what is the economy of African countries? as economic hostages were international organizations that should help them, namely the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. About 40% of the government budgets of several African countries pay off Western debt, while their people suffer from disease, dehydration and illiteracy. <br /> <br /> ... but this question was addressed in the most dry manner that could have been thought up by a person drier than the Sahara, which surrounds the country of Mali, in which this film takes place. More monotonous and devoid of action than any documentary I've ever seen (and I'm a fan of the genre), one “witness” after another plays in this “process” that is “captured” in a film condemning the world Bank and the IMF. Some critics may place colorful visual passages in the film, but they were irrelevant and did not have additional sound when they were on the screen. They were better at the coffee table than in this movie. <br /> <br /> Even movie characters say something like “This process is boring” and “When will it end?” Everyone in the theater laughed. Did these people read our thoughts on screen? <br /> <br /> Danny Glover briefly appeared in this film. This is a television film as part of Bamako, and it was set in Morocco or Mali. It was also more ridiculous than any spaghetti western I have ever tried to avoid. The only redemptive part of these five lost minutes is the case when a Caucasian bad guy accidentally shoots an African woman carrying a child and shows no remorse. Perhaps this was to symbolize the insensitivity of the World Bank and how it inadvertently kills Africans. <br /> <br /> And the last technical farewell shot: it was difficult to read the subtitles on the screen with such a large number of light colors, and a black outline was enough for the subtitles themselves. <br /> <br /> I have already summed up the film for you. Do not be deceived by deception. No need to watch this movie. You will never get these two hours ago in your life.
