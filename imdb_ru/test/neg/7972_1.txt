Christy Swenson plays an elite hired girl who is supposed to have faked a television reporter for a group of bad guys, but as soon as she sees this poor guy at home playing with her children, she decides to spoil the whole project and the television reporter's life will be spared. The life of an assassin is exhausted, because people who wanted this reporter to kill now want her to die for not completing her assignment. This is the basis for the film entitled “Higher Sanction”. <br /> <br /> Supreme spending time is more like this. We see how the Swanson character beats, beats and kills men, much bigger than she. And she is always one and a half steps ahead of the group of murders, who for some reason cannot end this super killer. Giving up one woman and beating all these men makes the movie so hilarious. It's too predictable when you realize that Swanson’s character will win anyway, which will make the film dull and inept. <br /> <br /> Kristi Swanson is a worthy actress who, in her youth, was always sexy and light-eyed. However, the Sanction is not one of her best efforts.
