Why did they turn the cute TV show Rugrats, which we all know and love, into an unsuccessful attempt at targeting teenagers? They should not do this. All ages follow regular holidays. When I heard about this, I thought, “Hi. They filmed a movie about the movie. Except that they really grew up as a teenager! It will be better. ” When I saw this, it was as if I was watching As Told By Ginger, except that they made him suck. Great job. <br /> <br /> When was Tommy the director in the Rugrats series? Never. Basically, all the episodes of this series about Tommy's love for directing. I don't like it. I rather watch scenes that change every episode. Not the same thing over and over. In addition, when in the old series, each character had its own side of the story? Never. This series did it. I did not like that everyone broke up. I do not want to see the side of the story of Angelica. I hate her. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this show if you like As Told By Ginger and Rugrats.
