This * should * have been an amazingly funny movie ... but it didn't work. (In fact, I stopped watching it halfway, which I rarely do ...) - Bill Murray plays Jack Corcoran, a secondary motivational speaker who bequeathed the elephant to his father (whom he allegedly thought was dead before he was born); Then he has one week to move the heavy pachyderm across the country. His adventures on the road are only slightly fun at best. Jane Garofalo's considerable comedic talents remain largely untapped. Anita Gillette impresses with her small role as Jack's mother (who has many explanations), and Pat Hingle stands out as the former circus partner of Jack's father. - Perhaps the second half of the film was better than the first, but I find it hard to believe in it ...
