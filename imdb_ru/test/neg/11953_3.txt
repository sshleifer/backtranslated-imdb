This is the best Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I've ever seen! I attach too much importance to this film! My best guess about the reason for creating this film is that someone wanted to demonstrate someone's martial arts skills, but I realized that you can't just shoot a guy fighting with another guy and get people to watch it, so he left the story fights behind ... and people still haven't watched it. <br /> <br /> The plot line of this film was a thin onion skin. This game was stupid and stereotypical for any Kung Fu movie. Dubbing was literally the worst I've ever heard. It seemed that if you played a small role in this film, like a fat man or two guys trying to catch the main character with the help of the network, it didn't matter who ended your voice. It could be dyslexia with slurred stuttering, and no one would say anything. But besides all this, the film compensates itself with several amazing scenes of struggle. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were definitely what this film was about. But the incitement to the fights was completely absurd! In most cases, the guy either jumps out of high grass, or looks at the main character from a distance, and then attacks him. But as soon as the fighting began, everything was somehow balanced. However, only two things really interfered with the fight. Those constant "wooshing" sound effects that were added to each punch or foot or sword beat, and poor editing, which made 25 percent of the fight VERY nervous and changeable. Someone will be in the middle of a coup back, and then suddenly he will be on the ground, he will be kicked, and then he will immediately stand on his feet, blocking the blow. But while editing the cut and paste was more unpleasant than anything else, it didnâ€™t have much impact on the whole movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was not a very good movie, but I was not waiting for a great movie. A great movie is not what you should expect when you see the cover of a box like this movie. Everything I saw in this film was a way to miss the boredom for an hour and a half. I rarely say this, but it was only one of those films that are useless to you, so you watch it when you have free time. Enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it! Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. <br /> <br /> Scott
