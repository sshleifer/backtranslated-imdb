You have to be a fan of the little man, but I found Burlesque on Carmen boring, inconceivable and not at all funny. <br /> <br /> Chaplin retells the story of Carmen and plays a big role, like Don Jose. This is a story about men and women whom they love, although it is unclear why you need to love a woman like Carmen, because she plays men against each other. <br /> <br /> As I said, I did not think much of that. Chaplin made dozens and dozens of the best films, so you can leave this on the shelf. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I'm curious, what's the difference between this movie and the 1915 version ... or is it just an IMDB error? <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10.
