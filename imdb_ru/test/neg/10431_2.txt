Plodding, perhaps it should have been a name. Bad dialogue is delivered at a snail pace. All symbols have one dimension, with the exception of one. Unfortunately, this character has some of the worst traits, and he doesn't seem to fit into this two-hour scramble. Growing up in the seventies, this film seriously lacks detail, atmosphere, and authenticity. Surprisingly, this was done by Kelsey Grammar, someone who should recognize the keen dialogue and consistent story in the script. Cameron Richardson is the only element that covers this film. Robin Trower's music is also a welcome addition.
