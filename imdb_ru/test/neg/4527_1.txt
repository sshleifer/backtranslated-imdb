This film is in the same league as Ishtar. A lot of wasted talent. Who allowed this bomb to escape? When Siegfried said that he needed to give an example with reference to a nuclear bomb, I said: “Please, let this be this theater!” Do not waste your time. Not even worth the free rental! And where did they get these shills to fill out the comments section on IMDb? I can't believe that anyone who has ever seen the original series liked this abomination. Steve Carell is not a physical comedian. If they had made a comedy and made a direct fighter out of it, he could have passed. What the hell was the goal of the dance scene? Also, the fat jokes and links were tasteless. In this film, the chance to reach the lowest common denominator was never missed, and the scenes just seemed to end, as if no one had thought them through. Just awful! Save your time, if not money, and give this film a pass!
