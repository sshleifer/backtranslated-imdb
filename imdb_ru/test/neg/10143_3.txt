Does anyone else think that the Reba is essentially the robbery of Rosanna? Just look at the characters from two families: Connors (Roseanna) and Hearts (Reba); the blonde-bombed older daughter (Becky Connor and Cheyenne Hart), who is married to a moron (Mark Healy and Van Montgomery), a sarcastic brunette younger daughter (Darlene Connor and Kira Hart), younger brother (DJ Connor and Jake Hart), and a strange relative (Jackie Connor and Barbara-Jean Booker Hart). <br /> <br /> And here, of course, the biggest resemblance is Reba Hart and Rosanna Connor. Reba tried to copy the sarcastic and tough mom in the style of love, not giving her the same attractive qualities as Rosanna. Or maybe they made her * too * cute, because Reba Hart seems to be swaying between evil and scary (hence Wan's line to his wife Cheyenne “I'm not afraid of you, I'm afraid of your mother!”) And be cute and caring with a little transition between them. Rosanna, at least, managed to understand that she was cruel to be kind, because she was always stingy and sarcastic, and whenever she tried to open up, it was difficult for her. No matter how inconsistent Reva's character is, she finds it difficult to be believable. <br /> <br /> But even if the characters were not completely cut off from Rosanna, nothing could save the show from the secondary in the plot. The authors are trying to give meaningfulness to the show, but they really can't put off banal jokes long enough to have any impact. And you better believe that jokes are commonplace; it is as if they were written by a twelve-year-old child who thinks that any joke is ridiculous. Although sometimes they release something funny (I do not pretend that I did not laugh at a few episodes), these gems are too small and far apart to make Reb witty. <br /> <br /> In general, “Reba” is a very mediocre show with obvious robberies of “Rosanna”, plots of sub-pairs and sub-pairs humor, and (let's face it) a terrible game. The show could have been a little better, in fact, if they replaced all the actors, especially Reba herself, who is better in the community than in the prime-time sitcom. <br /> <br /> I give it 3 out of 10, just to be fair to the good jokes that make it.
