This film descends like a square peg into a square hole. Poorly made peg. The peg is so cheap that it could not even be made on a production line in Mexicoâ€™s Chinatown. In fact, when you try to press a peg into the hole for which it is clearly intended, it crumbles into sticky, disgusting pieces that smell like rotting fruit and don't wash off. Quigly is such a binding. <br /> <br /> This film is so horribly awful that it could not even be created. Such a film must have been the result of some kind of accident in nature; a strange creature that was frozen somewhere in the corner of a dank office was rotting and growing until it was too big and scary to look at it. Only science will be interested in such a thing; anyone who does not want to study it will extract it from this world. <br /> <br /> It comes down to this: if you like first-year violin concerts, racism or Coke Zero, it's just being your birthday.
