From the very beginning, this film pulls and drags. Awkward overlaps explaining history, monochrome play, boring decorations, a total lack of humanity, inspiration or style. The actors look like they are woozy. Potentially interesting story is completely gone. Of course, someone realized how bad it was at some point in its production?
