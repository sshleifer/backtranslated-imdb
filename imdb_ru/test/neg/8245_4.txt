I break my head, but I can't think of another movie, just like Gwangi Valley. Western with dinosaurs? What could be more natural? You have to wonder why John Ford and / or John Wayne never tried it! <br /> <br /> The plot ?? In search of a mythical miniature horse for its circus, TJ Breckenridge (Gila Golan), So Kirby (James Francis) and the rest of the characters / characters fall into a strange, lost valley. There they find not only a miniature horse, but also other, more formidable creatures. Dinosaurs rule this place. Wouldn't that be an attraction in the circus TJ ?? in a T-Rex cage? <br /> <br /> I cannot say that I consider Gvangi Valley to be a bad film, I just don’t like this film, like many others who have posted comments on the film. There are some parts that I actually find almost imperceptible. In the first half of the film, it seems, nothing special happens. I didn't have to be bored, but I really wanted something to happen. Plodding would be an adjective that I would use. To top it all, there is a very contrived love story in the film. It seems compelled, as if the authors decided that the male and female leadership simply had to come together. But Gvangi Valley is not a waste of time. There are moments that I really liked. Who does not enjoy the scenes of cowboys on horseback trying the lasso T-Rex. You just do not see such things every day. The creatures of Ray Harryhausen are impressive. There are some really cool pictures of Harryhausen miniatures interacting with people and horses. Perhaps this is not the best of his work, but the effect is very good. Nevertheless, at least, in my opinion, these good moments are not enough to overcome negatives. As much as I would like to do this, I must evaluate the “Valley of Gvangi” 4/10.
