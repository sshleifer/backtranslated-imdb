Sorry for that. But if you have seen this “epic”, you will obviously be aware of a complete disregard for the actual text of the Bible. Now, I'm not quite the next in line for holiness, but I know the basics. And the basics were like that. God wanted to wipe out everyone from the face of the earth, because he believed that they were corrupted to such an extent that they could not be returned. He chose Noah, the raw diamond, and his family, to be spared because of their pristine ways. Noah builds the ark in accordance with God's instruction, so that he will lodge it, his family, and two of each creature, while he floods the rest of the planet. This is the basics. In this film, other people roam around the sea, such as hawkers and pirates. But I thought that ALL were destroyed. I think NBC leaders have never been to church. I am told that there are other inaccuracies, but, being an average Joe, I have no idea what it is. Sorry. Returning to the film, he was inaccurate, as already mentioned, the cast is smelly, but some effects were good, I will do it. But in general, I saw a better and more delicious rendition of the story, made in the form of a small scene on the Simpsons. God help the NBC leaders on the Day of Judgment. 3/10
