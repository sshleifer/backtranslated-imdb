Four young elementary school students witness the killing of one of their classmates during what they consider to be just an innocent game. The killer is a strange boy named Milo Jider. Sixteen years later, the four survivors of the event reunite under happier circumstances in the same city where it happened. They believe that Milo drowned in the river shortly after the murder, but they soon learn that the demonic killer Milo also returned, being still a little boy, unchanged even after almost two decades. <br /> <br /> The cover for this movie makes it look really awesome (I still expected a bad movie to come out of it). When I insert a DVD into the player, a menu appears and the movie still looks cool. Unfortunately, this film is not the only thing that excited me. The film is your usual attempt to make a slasher film, and when I say “medium”, I mean, like all other low-budget slasher films that have never met with open arms for most members of the horror community (I'm talking about you ). fan of horror). In other words, you can approach any horror fan, and most of the answers will be “that sucks.” <br /> <br /> What mistakes did the movie make? First, the DVD cover makes Milo look very dark, but they blow it all up, showing their face in the film in many different scenes. He had the potential to be a very strange character. Secondly, the back cover says to Freddie, Jason, Chucky, etc. collect things and leave, because Milo is much better ... why the hell do you want to say something like that when it comes to the name of a low-budget slasher that clearly failed? I mean, it only raises your expectations from the movie, making it difficult to impress you. In the last attempt to attract attention, he says (in very large letters) "From the creator of Anaconda." Simply shows how low they will attract as much attention as possible to the film. <br /> <br /> Blood in the film sucks, the director gives you a few disgusting corners when Milo attacks someone. Music is not so bad, and I never fell asleep during the movie (congratulations). I'm still trying to figure out what Milo really is. Best of all, he is a zombie, if someone else knows, tell me. Rest assured, I will not lose sleep, thinking about it.
