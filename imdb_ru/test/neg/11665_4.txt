It turned out to be more like a film about female romance-indecision than I hoped it was ... just a tense thriller. Yes, the last 20 minutes were tense, but most of the previous 75 have borne in order to be simply tiring. <br /> <br /> Rooter Hauer was a little depressed, not playing his usual tense character. Natasha Richardson looked pretty silly most of the time, and her character was very unattractive. <br /> <br /> The story is so-so. It's not as bad as I do it, but it's definitely not something that I would watch again, and the back of the VHS describing this film is misleading.
