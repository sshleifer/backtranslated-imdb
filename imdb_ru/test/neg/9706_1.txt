I went to see a suspect that I hate it, I did. Everything about it was wrong; as if they were shooting another book. Very good places and houses (if not a little mistaken - yes, even the house was not suitable for their parts). Kira was too modern, boring, and, frankly, it was unpleasant for me to watch her. If everyone else regarded Darcy as a sexual god, the author would find him sexually frustrated and inadequate. Bingley was stupid and crafty (he should not be like that), and Bennetts were destitute and, for some unknown reason, farmers are wrong and ridiculous. The very idea that Mr. Bennett will open the door in his night clothes with the rest of the family dressed in underwear so that in the middle of the night is stupid. They had servants. Mr. Collins was not repulsive and fat, just stupid and unpleasant, Georgina Darcy was ugly and old, and Miss Bingley wore a sleeveless dress that! As if! This is historically inaccurate, and even the end is unsatisfactory. I could go on for a few days. I hated him so much that not only did he not look like a book, but I was also afraid that for many it would be the first experience of this great novel, and he would give them the worst idea of ​​it. The BBC version is so excellent that it's not even funny, and everything connected with this version offends its memory. In short, if you have to see it, make sure that you first read the book or see the BBC version, otherwise you will be taken along a deceived path, that this is what it looks like and what does not!
