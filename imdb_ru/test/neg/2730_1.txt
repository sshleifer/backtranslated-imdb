I got under this bunch on Wednesday afternoon, when my mother-in-law was looking at her. I can’t come to terms with someone who basically does a remake of a crappy high budget Hollywood flop (“KERNEL” with washed actors like Luke Perry). If the high budget failed, what makes people think that the film "SAME" in two years without a budget will not go anywhere? I laughed for most of the movie because of how crazy it looked like (in fact, I was shocked that it was shot not in Legal, but on the air), and how it was basically a CORE script that was just reworked bad that you saw the “Core”, you know why doing worse is ridiculous, because CORE ALREADY was so bad that it was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you like to laugh at REALLY bad movies, this one will be right in your alley. The only thing I can say is that I would like Luke Perry to make a career because he is not a terrible actor ... he just gets terrible roles. Crappy, created for television films that will only be shown on full-time television, is almost a step closer to the end for him, if not 90210, he would have a career.
