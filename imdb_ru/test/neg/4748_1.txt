With this film, I really hoped that the idea was to fill up the incompetence of the first AVP, but still, to my horror: Requiem is much worse than I could have imagined. <br /> <br /> My hopes were in the first moments of the movie on the Predator ship, and I almost sighed with relief when I finally saw the Predator’s home world (a one-time digital matte picture, but still nice to finally see it ), and then, of course, people (if such badly written characters can be called such) ... <br /> <br /> One has to wonder why it is impossible for Fox to make a good film from Aliens and Predators. At the very least, prospective filmmakers could do their homework. <br /> <br /> Characters are set up just as we expected from the worst Friday of the 13th sequel. The pizza delivery scene was defiant, like any other character interaction scene that followed it. Bimbo and non-actors do not make for a REAL film, they make a cheap film, and Aliens 1-3 and Predator were good because they were shot above the concept (remember that the 1st "- this is the film" B ") made as" A "film) The Strauss brothers really missed an opportunity that could be fixed, just knowing their roots" Alien + Predator ": in the films" Alien "and" Predator "we get to know the characters members of a large group (Alien: Oil Refinery Workers, Aliens: Marines, Nobleman 3: Convicted, and in Predator films we usually follow part of the main character of the unit: Predator, Arnold - Special Forces, Predator 2: Danny Glover, Police), and it's easy to see where the creators of both franchises started to make mistakes: in Alien Ressurrection y do we have pirates ... or something, do we have avp ... researchers? ... with weapon ?? and, of course, in AVP-R we have a cliche for teens. What is here to identify with? Conceptually, the idea of ​​returning a convict to a small town and returning to a war vet seemed an approach for the hero of the First Blood fighters, but, like many things, never paid off. <br /> <br /> Film creativity is equally devoid of the rhymes of the mind. There is no point in moving forward to action, only small sequences that create the most insignificant levels of tension or interest just to cut them off as soon as they become interesting ... take the viewers out of the film at every step. The action scenes themselves, although they are often deceived in trailers, are so darkly lit that it is impossible to say what happens during the fighting scenes when they finally happen. In fact, the film is difficult from many levels. Bad actors combined with bad directing and a cruel script (which, as I myself noted as a screenwriter, struck every wrong note and cliché that only the most talentless writer devoid of ideas could unite) WRITING, if you can say so, doesn’t even concern the quality video and does not show the slightest respect for the well-established knowledge of the previous entries in the series. Why does Predalien suddenly get the opportunity to shoot at other people's embryos in the throat of a pregnant woman to use as an incubator for the chest bubbles? More than likely, because a dead brain writer needed a way to have more aliens to fight a predator (and given the accelerated growth time even more than the first AVP: as quickly as possible. Why should there be a meaningless conversation between cardboard cutouts on sticks? ) (referring to the intended characters) replaces the actual character development? (Remember, a character is determined by what he DOES, not SPEAKERS.) Why does the sheriff lead civilians into a cache of weapons? (Isn't he an officer of the law?) How does a bimbo of all people know where they are? Why is Predalien waiting for the Predator VERY SLOWLY to take off his mask before attacking? Why do aliens still fall into this nasty series of post-Alien 3 with the habit of hissing all the time, so that their victim learns how to run? How the hell did this series turn into a character saying: “People are dying ... we need weapons!” (The way this writer even works is beyond my power and reflects badly on an already destroyed Fox. Artistic reputation. It's like each one of those who participated in the creation of this film suffered from a mental disorder or was really inept at every level of the film making process. <br /> <br /> The effects are rather lousy this time, the aliens look like men in costumes, and ADI just lazy in the design of their creatures. like the modified remains of the Resurrection of the Aliens, with the same bulky muscles in their hands, as if they had not learned from this film that this is not a good design and not suitable for processing. Again, in this state of darkness everything is not wrapped up to create a secret or atmosphere, but simply to hide how bad the creatures look, and just like in AVP, Wall Winston is sorely missed when the Predator’s fake face is revealed. <br /> <br /> We list too many flaws, so I’ll just say this: don’t waste your money on this film, Fox’s fans are indifferent, as this cheap and dirty film shows. I felt bad when I took my girlfriend to see him (although it was for free) and then apologized to her. This is one die-hard fan who has done away with the franchise. <br /> <br /> Note to Fox: What we really wanted was not a pointless slash film, it was an adaptation of the original Darkhorse comic, It was better than everything you prepared for this franchise in 1993. <br /> <br /> Signing.
