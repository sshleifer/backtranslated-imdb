Uh-uh ... so, they even had writers for this? Maybe I'm picky, but I like a little dialogue with my films. As for the films, slasher, it will be quite a bit of character development. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, The Prey does not provide either one or the other, and if you think I'm hyperbolic, you just need to see for yourself. Scene backstage, we just make the actors stand around, looking miserable and awkward, left behind by any meaning of the script. If you do not call each other's names when they are separated in the forest (naturally), then the only cases when these people say something significant are when one character explains Orion's constellation (obviously plagiarism from Funk and Wagnall; flickering slasher, no? ) and another paraphrases an old campfire story that doesn't even have anything to do with the plot (wait, what is this plot?). In other cases, The Prey has the ability to shoot characters using a microphone with a boom microphone far enough. so we can't exactly hear what they are saying. So we get whole scenes where the actors grumble! Intentionally! Seriously, I saw more dialogue in a silent film. It was as if the filmmakers sat in a bar somewhere in Cukamong Ranch during the heyday of the 80s' madness, and one of them looked at the other and said, “Hey, I have a really great idea for a bloody oath to decapitate. all feature around this. "And ... well, they did. <br /> <br /> To be fair, Prey probably had some kind of writer. I mean, someone had to write down a sequence of scenes and tag diaries. Nevertheless, I am fully convinced that there was no editor at all in this film. There are obvious pauses, boring tables and zero sense of rhythm. The filmmakers have nothing else to do in the “scenario” of the filming, so they fill the work with comprehensive taxonomies of flora and fauna inhabiting a forest in which our wild and crazy teens are chopped and chopped Kami. All these creatures were shot in direct midday daylight with utmost restraint and without any attempts to photograph in the atmosphere. If it looks like a science film, then it’s the way it is. I am pretty sure that this is all shots from a full-scale show - all what's missing is the stifling narration from some alderman from National Geographic. <br /> <br /> More exciting shots that were mercifully spared from the floor of the cutting room: a scene in which two men discuss sandwiches with cucumber and cream cheese and another scene in which the auxiliary person Well played banjo for as much as one and a half minutes! Fifteen minutes! This is a lot of banjo to start with celluloid from the very beginning, not to mention the insertion into the final version of the film! Way guys! Brevity and brevity - the real victims of this massacre. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, over the past 25 minutes, the film is gaining momentum (comparatively) in which most of the slaughterhouse is concentrated and where an excerpt from the Music for Strings, Percussion and Celeste by Bela Bartok creeps in. The great Vaudeville, Jackie Coogan, looks funny, like a fat, awkward park ranger (this was his last role, if you can believe it). And there are some pleasant bloody moments, including tearing tears in the neck and the aforementioned decapitation. The makeup used for the killer (Karel Struiken, aka “Lurch” from the films about the Addams family) is also quite effective and makes it look like a strange hybrid of young Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. In addition, if you like a stupid ending with a straight left field, you need to check how they wrap this puppy. I promise you will spit. <br /> <br /> I usually like movies of this level of incompetence, but the first three quarters of Prey are so boring that they are pretty much boring. spoil the rest. In general, this is largely a pale and tedious business, and, although it’s not so bad, in fact only weakened supporters should see it. Why do we do this for ourselves, anyway?
