This is a good time to say how well I think about this site: it gives me the opportunity to talk about all the disappointment that I experienced in two hours, waiting for something to happen, something will be said, will be shown to be inspired subtly, for a symbol, an idea, whatever. No, just long, endless violins alternating with a tired piano. Tired voices, tired actors and bored characters and situations. Boring is the long death of the mind, and this film, from this point of view, is a public enemy. How many thousands of live hours will still be stolen by thousands more innocent viewers. I do not demand a refund, only for the time and time of the people I invited to look at it ... oh God!
