If there was a point in this film, I would not have found it. A very depressing film that allegedly tells about the final evacuation of residents living in the area of ​​the dam on the Northfork River in Montana. The problem is that there is no Northfork River in Montana. There are several northern forks, but they are branches of other rivers, which are divided into northern and southern forks. <br /> <br /> The first scene of the film is a coffin jumping up to the surface of the lake, but the scene is never linked to the story, and the viewer remains to reflect on its meaning. But much remains for the viewer's assumptions in the film. Another example is when a team of dam staff responsible for evacuating residents arrives at the dam headquarters, another group of people leaves. Some unheard-of remark is made about these people, which makes no sense, and there is no explanation in the film explaining this. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into several stories, and the film continues to switch back and forth between stories, which is quite embarrassing. And the stories are strange. In one of them, residents of the same property refuse to evacuate because they live in a house that is built like Noah's Ark. <br /> <br /> Another meaningless story tells of a sick orphan who dies, and in some way he is sharing his presence with a house full of ghosts and in a shelter at the same time as a priest. If someone can understand what the ghost told about the author, he must have explained it to them. <br /> <br /> The landscape was sharp and the sun never shone. There are snow mountains in the far distance. I guess the goal was to set the mood. The time period is set by the fact that all evacuators drove Ford sedans of 1946-48 era, although the events were supposed to occur in 1955. The game was mediocre. When I saw the bill for this film, he said that Darryl Hannah was in the picture. If she had been, I would not have recognized her, but I believe that she was a ghostly lady.
