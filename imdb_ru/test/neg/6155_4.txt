Combine good casting, bad writing, good orchestral score, bad dialogue and a good idea of ​​a story with great potential, but never realized, then you have Slipstream. <br /> <br /> Just bought a movie for a dollar, it's worth it, but not by much. <br /> <br /> Nice to see Mark Hamill again. <br /> <br /> There must be a decent sequel to fix the damage from the original. Or, at least, give him due attention, which he should have received in the first place. <br /> <br /> Bershtein's assessment demanded your attention from the initial titles, but long shots of slip planes and even longer disclosure of interesting plot points drowned his attention, getting points. <br /> <br /> Watching this film is really easy, because he is the producer of STARWARS and the director of TRON, as well as an amazing cast, but this is true. And it is not so much. <br /> <br /> Favorite line - “We're going to do it, ha ha! ... (BOOM!) "
