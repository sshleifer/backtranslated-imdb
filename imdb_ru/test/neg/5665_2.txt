Due to boredom and great curiosity, I decided to check out this show today, as my four-year-old niece loves him. I should have known that this is a show that may appeal only to a four year old. The show was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> First, the show just wasn't funny. The track of laughter worked in the most inappropriate times, which was very unpleasant, especially since none of the jokes were funny. The laughter track worked at some point when one guy, the cameraman, said: “I'm going to polish my lens.” How the hell is this funny? Parts of it (for example, drums for meat), which were supposed to be funny, were just stupid for those over eleven years old. <br /> <br /> I have a feeling that four-year-olds are not the target audience, However, since I have a four-year-old niece who watches this, it worried me when I watched this: not very good behavior . In the episode I watched, he shows how Sam steals Carly's sandwich and pushes her to the ground, just so Carly can get up and do the same with her. I would not like to see how my niece behaves so rudely. I also do not like the idea that two young girls make a web show where they distribute personal information ... If it were real, there would be freaks everywhere. <br /> <br /> This show is likely to be kind and funny with someone eleven years old or younger, but someone older than that, just stay away from it. I will give it two stars, because, I think, I understand how it can be funny for a child.
