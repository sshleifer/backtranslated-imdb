When I went to see this movie, let's not say that I had high expectations. But only because I had a faint hope that this full-length feature would have at least some of the fun and wit of the television “Da Ali G Show”. <br /> <br /> But, as you might expect, this cannot translate half an hour of a telecast to a 90-minute film. The movie had nothing to do with, and it used only the toilet and sexy youthful humor. In fact, I should have quit it halfway, but I was stupid enough to think that it might somehow improve by the end, as far as I was wrong. I loved the show, but I hated the movie. This film is only for those who find fellatio in dogs funny ...
