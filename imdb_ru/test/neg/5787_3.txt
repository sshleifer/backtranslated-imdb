The current head of the elite submarine destruction team of the US Navy is called upon to do ... everything they want is obvious. <br /> <br /> Charlie Sheen was appointed an officer. Already the storyline is incredible. Michael Bean is his immediate commander, but he keeps Charlie on a rather long leash, and one of the guys pays for it early, after being killed by Charlieâ€™s patented stupidity. The rest of the team spends their free time committing war crimes. Basically this is an exercise in casual shooting and thin paper ethics, these particular seals may be better suited for use as crash test dummies. <br /> <br /> Some good battle scenes oppose stupid trials.
