I have never seen a movie that annoyed me so much. This is a film about stupid people who do stupid and horrible things. This is not a funny movie. I must say that the storyline is terrible. I did not have the patience to look at it so that I could see only half, but that was enough for me. Characters are not very inspired. Just terribly annoying. This movie is about a stupid guy who is trying to contact his tyrannical boss's daughter. When he finally manages to talk to her, she asks him to go to her house that night to watch her fatherâ€™s owl, and he thinks that she invited him to go to a party with her and be at her house at 6 pm. He is very disappointed to learn that he only needs to take care of the owl and that she has a boyfriend. After her father leaves the house, leaving precise orders about how to take care of the house and his beloved bird, a secretary appears, a renegade son, and all sorts of NOT funny things happen in the house. But he finally contacts his boss's daughter. TRUST ME, THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!
