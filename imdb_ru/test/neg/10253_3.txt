I readily admit that I watch a lot of really bad movies. But very few that I can think of are as bad as "When women had tails." These are nasty epic proportions. What was supposed to be a sex comedy that a group of cavemen discovered a woman for the first time was instead a boring, lifeless affair without a single laugh. The comedy is very weak. I suppose if you think it’s funny to hit someone in the head, you might find a laugh or two. The guys in this film make Three Puppets look like high art. And just not enough plot to hold things together. It seems he stretches and goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Well, you can ask yourself: “If everything is as bad as you say, why didn't you rate it below 3/10? Good question! And I have two answers. Firstly, the film is not without curiosity. I find it a bit interesting in the Italian film “A Million Years BC”. with Raquel Welch. I'll give "When women had a tail," a point for its historical "value." The other two points are simply the presence of Senta Berger. I know that this is not so much an explanation or justification of the rating, but what are you going to do? This is the best I can come up with.
