I had this DVD to watch, I thought I would see a biography about Goya, but the film was about everything except Goya. This film tells about a young woman who the Holy Inquisition took from her family, allegedly because she practiced Jewish rituals (just because the poor girl did not like to eat pork!). The rest of the film is about torture, humiliation caused by a bad script (I can’t believe JC Carrier is because I couldn’t believe this film directed by Milos Forman) is focused on a religious man and a young man. woman and that's it. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Goya, I forgot, plays a completely secondary role - it could be the role of John, Paul, Peter, Manuel, Joaquim, Jose or anyone else. Very disappointing - one of these films, which will be forgotten forever (if it has not happened yet). Rent a "Rose Name" if you want a film about the Holy Inquisition. And I do not know what you should rent if you want to watch a film about the Spanish artist Goya. Maybe the director of good caliber, not Foreman, still has to do it. PS: Spanish artist Goya - the main role that is lost in the plot - is depicted by a Scandinavian actor, which makes this film even more difficult to take seriously. Maybe next time we should send Javier Barden to play the biopic of the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch!
