I see a sample here. If you watch a film on Mystery Science Theater 3000, most likely, if you go to IMDb.com, there will be crowds of fans of this film, but it was chosen to be on this TV show, because it was very bad. Sorry, but I read a lot about the Rocketship X-M, as if it were some kind of significant sci-fi film that emphasized realism. Well, if that were the case, I could write for a few paragraphs that even with the knowledge of the 1950s, this film is completely flawed. Gravity can be the first obvious observation, or, as MST3K did, “selective gravity” as a hermitage, as well as what happens when they are immersed in their death and just stand there, looking out the window, um, will not the ship have an upward effect? this scene? I would like to think that they started with good intentions, and that it exceeded the budget or something like that, but I think that this film was just raw, like in the movie “from under”. Just compare it to “When the world collides”, which was released in 1951, to see the true place where this film takes place, there is no comparison. The film gets 2 or 3 by itself, not even funny to watch by itself. He gets 5 or 6 as an episode of MST3K, since there is no action or a lot of jokes, just bad, bad, bad, oh, I already said, this is bad.
