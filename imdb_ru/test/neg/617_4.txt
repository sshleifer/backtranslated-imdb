“Felonia” is a bi-film. There is no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you look at the cast of actors, you can have high hopes for its entertainment potential. This film is filled with all those wonderful characters with whom you grew up, those with whose faces you immediately recognize, even if you probably don’t know their names. Surprisingly, the filmmakers were able to bring all these people together in one project, almost the same as they decided to reunite the actor of the B-film. There are even a couple of really top-notch actors in the cast: David Warner, whom most people recognize from Titanic (although my favorite role is Jack the Ripper in Time after Time) and Lance Henriksen, who many remember as a bishop in Aliens . These two actors did an excellent job in their long career and made some very good films. <br /> <br /> However impressive this collection of actors may be, their talent is never fully displayed on the screen. The Felony screenwriters spent a lot of money to put together the cast of the dream team, and then missed their great opportunity because of one important factor, the common denominator of all B-films: the stupid script. <br /> <br /> Let's start with a silly premise. The bad guys get on tape, committing a horrible murder, and they tirelessly pursue the film crew to get a video and destroy the evidence. But honestly, why? In the time they needed to find the film crew, it was possible to make a thousand copies of this tape and send it to all law enforcement agencies and the media. The criminals do not seem to understand how useless their efforts are, and they say that the theft and destruction of one original video will solve the whole problem. Stupid ... but I guess if the bad guys were so logical, there wouldn't be a movie. <br /> <br /> Then there is a dialogue. This is sometimes silly, sometimes cliche, and sometimes unbelievable ... everything you expect from a B-movie. Of course, I have always believed that strong performances can overcome many shortcomings in the material. This cast includes actors who are definitely capable of strong performances, and although some actors are not good actors at all and have achieved the status of B-cinema deservedly, we can hope that a strong part of the cast will be able to instill life into their parts. However, it is disappointing that few actors in this film really take the film seriously enough to give it a better chance. There is not much inspiration in these speeches, but again, this is a boring scenario. Now, I admit that some of the more prominent actors in the cast can add a certain amount of pizats to their roles, but, frankly, even the most beautiful actors I mentioned earlier seem mostly disinterested and not involved in <br / > <br /> Talking about this story ... even if the acting skills were high enough so that the dialogue seemed a little less stupid, he still would not buy out "Felonia" from the fact that its author performs the false cunning of low-budget action scenarios in: with so many plot holes, like a piece of Swiss cheese. You can watch this movie a hundred times, but you still don’t understand how things are going. In an effort to create uncertainty and always force the viewer to guess, the writer adds all sorts of surprises and unexpected twists to his script and ends with a mosaic, but when you get to the end, you find a bunch of pieces that are simply worthless and others are missing. I admire a good thriller that makes me wonder, but making plot twists that exist only to confuse you and that do not fit the rest of the story is amateurish. There were so many things that were never explained, and in the end I felt extremely disappointed. If you decide to watch it, be prepared to get confused. <br /> <br /> I didn’t even mention all the other stupid things in this movie, but I won’t worry. The funny thing is that, in spite of everything I said, I must admit that I cannot give Feloni 1/10 stars. Although I can not understand exactly why, in fact, I found this film somewhat attractive. Stupidity can sometimes be fun, if you are tuned to it. In addition, I really like some of these characters, and although their performances are somewhat elusive, given their talents, I still enjoy their meeting. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that I appreciate this film from the position of a serious moviegoer. It is possible that I completely missed the point. It is possible that all the time the filmmakers wanted to make a B-film. Maybe nonsense is all completely intentional. If this were the case, and if I rated it on these terms, I would say that Felonia is a classic in the genre of mocking action films. Fans of bi-films will love to see all their favorite actors together in one film, they will get some laughter from the script and will be entertained with a healthy dose of weapons, explosions and car chases.
