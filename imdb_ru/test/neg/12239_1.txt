Sorry, you know why. It hurts me to watch this movie. I went to the theater with friends to watch this film, and still did not give him the pleasure to watch him completely (I left with about 20 minutes left ... hoping that God can make me at least momentarily comfortable).) now, even these bad ones ... when I watch them, there may be a small part in the film, where I sometimes feel some joy because of perhaps a quirky joke or a good line ... this film is On the other hand, I am always I felt embarrassed and angry with myself, especially since I spent on it de ngi. It was poorly written, badly directed, poorly filmed, and definitely badly acted ... <br /> <br /> please, for the good of humanity, do not watch this film, even if your some guy who wants to say that he saw every movie ... just not ...
