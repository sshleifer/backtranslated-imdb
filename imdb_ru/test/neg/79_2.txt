No, no, no, no, no, no, no! This is not a film, this is a reason to show that people are dancing. This is just not good. Even the dance is slow and not as exciting as the mediocre Dirty Dancing, not to mention any other good dance film. <br /> <br /> Is this a love story? Is it a musical? Is this a drama? This is a comedy? The point is not that this film is a bit, but that this film fails in everything it tries to be. As the film develops, the film becomes even more meaningless. <br /> <br /> Acting badly on all sides, the script is definitely trying to tell us something about the relationship, but fails miserably. <br /> /> LOOK AT A MOMENT - When Patrick Stewart comes on stage and you think that a movie can get better when it brightens up the boring atmosphere. For a second.
