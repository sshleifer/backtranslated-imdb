In addition to the beautiful pictures thanks to the New Zealand cinematographer Alan Bollinger, this film is not worth watching. <br /> <br /> The storyline is so fragmented and lost that it is difficult to understand what is happening at the moment, only when you think that you are following, the direction changes again, like a lost bipolar puppy. <br /> <br /> A musical score is terrible, relying too heavily on extremely emotional pieces that try to make the audience feel a certain way, as if the instruments acted like a sheet of a queue of emotions? "It is sad here"; "Feel shocked here"; "It's scary here." In addition, repeated samples, used over and over again, leave the audience on the verge of laughter. <br /> <br /> Gone is the time of the silent film, where musical instruments were the only voice image ?? but you would not think so, watching the "Queen of the river." <br /> <br /> The voice acting was so overwhelmed that the question arose whether this film really needed any accompanying shots. It could be easy on the radio, although even then it would be difficult to follow the story. <br /> <br /> And the stolen ideas from Jane Campion’s Piano are too obvious to be overlooked. Not only are beach and forest shots almost identical to those in Piano? Is it possible that something of this comes down to Alan Bollinger’s camera work on the latter ?? but the voice-overs and levels are amazingly close too. And who could forget when the character of Holly Hunter trimmed the wings when Sam Neal cut off her index finger. Does this remind you of when Wiremu amputated his “trigger finger” and, surprisingly, also with an ax? I thought so. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not recommend this film for viewing, if you don’t put on headphones and just watch the situation.
