MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. This movie was the worst movie ever. I couldn't even watch it all be so bad. This film is actually worse than the killer stuffed, which says a lot. It was worse than terrible cartoons, which, at least, sometimes funny. Even the blood in the film was not good. The shooting was fake, and the acting was even worse. Please do yourself a favor and skip this. If you see it at the box office, run the other way. There is nothing good about this movie. If you want to watch a good scarecrow movie, watch “Scarecrow Night” or “Pumpkin Head”. If you want to watch a new crappy film, then watch Scarecrow. I rate this movie as 0.2 out of 10. This is how awful this movie really is. Worst movie ever.
