I am a big fan of the northern exposure. "People in the trees" is a complete fake northern exposure. There, city residents from New York were stuck in a remote, deaf city (Marin Frist / Joel Fleischman). She does not immediately meet with the locals (Jack Slattery / Maggie O'Connell). There is only one pilot in the city who is not often available. There is only one radio show. And the whole show is about strange people with sincere and strange relationships. Too many parallels. Just like the Northern Influence, with the exception of one obvious demographic change in each character. I'm bored. Give me something new to think about. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the text is pretty good. But if it was a school project, he probably would have received the seal of plagiarism. <br /> <br /> People who love this show may have been protected from the devotional creativity and hard work of Joshua Brand and John Folsi.
