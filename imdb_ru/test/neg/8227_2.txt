Filmed in my former hometown by a couple of college kids, this film is about an eccentric named Luther. Luther, recently released on parole (the parole council tells us about this in one of the most ridiculous scenes of all time), runs madly at the local grocery store Kroger, eating the old woman's neck with metal teeth. <br /> <br /> Luther runs to the farm, where he eats a guy, hijacks a car, binds an old woman, he is followed and killed. Oh, and the chick from SUPERBOY is getting naked.
