I watched the first 10 minutes, and I was bored to death. So, I move forward to the end. This film must be the worst of all low-cost science fiction films. Bad game, cast, instructions, imitation of Lara Craft, plot, plot, everything! Throughout the film, I think that there can only be 6-7 people in the whole cast, but only two of them started the whole film. I was expecting something like a Star Marine, but it was not at all close. I was fooled by the movie title and the picture on the DVD cover. Don't waste your time watching this boring and bad movie. If you think about it, I wonder why they even bother to make bad films like this at all?
