In my opinion of this film, the whole part of the video of this film was absolute rubbish !!!! However, the soundtrack that was used contained the music of a great heavy metal-rock band, I recognized this music as a band called Firstryke, and the album was "Just a Nightmare" and it was very well written !! and I'm curious to see what movie lovers think about it, if I can remember how far I will be grateful for the feedback, I collect old movies and obscure sound tracks of movies. This is a very laborious hobby, but very useful. I saw the music of this group being sold in Germany online for fifty dollars per album. Not bad, hugh?
