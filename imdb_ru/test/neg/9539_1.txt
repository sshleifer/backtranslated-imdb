.... where I assume this film has come from. I mean, in my entire young life, I watched a lot of B films, and I wouldn't even classify it as B film. I remember watching movies in my high school media class that are superior to this one. <br /> <br /> So the package ... a bunch of dance numbers and stupid nonsense. Women in bikinis who are not even so good to begin with, dance first and sing. There are guys with hairy chests and girls with fangs that are in the sun. I mean, I can hardly make a coherent sentence, just thinking about this movie. According to most people on this site, “Manos in the hands of fate” and “People of henchmen” are the worst films (classic MST3K :-D) ... I was one of them. Then I saw this movie. Usually I don’t try to spoil the movie too much, but the people who did it really deserve it. This IT is bad and IT is unbearable, and I assume that the director or actor in the film is the only person who rated it ten.
