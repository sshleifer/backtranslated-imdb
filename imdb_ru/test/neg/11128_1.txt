When I drove home after work, I bought some films for my four-year-old twins. I bought this film, which will appeal to my children. I watched it with my children. My 10 and 17 years were going to vomit. In this film, dad acts like a moron. My children watched it every day. Once they threw away all our films. I sold the movie "Omoz Jones" on ebay. My rating: F ++++++++++++++++ I prefer to be on the list of the worst dresses. <br /> <br /> My children now hate this stupid movie. If it gives an idea that microbes can communicate with each other. I wonder how dumb the movie sounds in Japanese. I broke the CD in half when it annoyed me to see it again and again. No offense, but the performance of Brandy and Helen was the best
