These days there are a lot of such films. This zombie film falls into the main category of "cheese", in contrast to the more subtle dawn of the dead and the day of the dead. In all fairness, these two films were large studio releases with large budgets. But these were also good films. A low-budget film can still be good, if only it stops accepting and using the worst scenarios. Whoever wrote this film must have been drunk all the time. <br /> <br /> This film had such special effects and a very uneven storyline. One of the main differences from other films of this type is the time it takes people to turn into zombies. In this case, it seems that they die in seconds, and then turn into zombies. However, with the ease that this "infection" spreads, you may have zombie blood all over you, and you don't even risk getting infected, and believe me that people are infected with blood. The main problem I encountered is that our two main stars from time to time walked around dozens of zombies and received nothing. When everyone else is surprisingly quickly turning into zombies, these two were filled with zombies when they were even unarmed and could get out of it without any problems. Our hot chick even survived a rocket attack on the building in which she was located. At that moment I was laughing at the load. Without a weapon, there are about 10 zombies on it, and the rocket hits the building, but does she manage to get out without a single scratch? Well, of course .... <br /> <br /> Whoever advised these people how the special forces were behaving obviously never spent time in the army. They should first see the movie “Blackhawk” to at least understand how they behave in combat situations. <br /> <br /> One of the soldiers was a fat overweight. LOL, it was good. The other continued to walk toward the zombies, thinking that they had survived, even lowering their weapons at one point. These guys are fighting with zombies and behave like soldiers from the movie "Stripes". SWAT, lol ... <br /> <br /> Then they go so far as to try to explain the zombie girl in the rubber room, and everything becomes very confusing. The explanation is confusing and does not even follow the first film. That made no sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the jokes against Bush. At first, the military lady told them that the order had passed from the vice-president to the president, and at the end it was the vice-president from an “undisclosed place” who gave orders. It was the best part of the movie for me.
