I'm a big LoG fan. I thought the first two episodes provided the best comedy this country had ever seen, and the third episode, though different, was amazingly dark and creative. The idea to see Tubbs, Edward and Briss on the big screen made me wait for something on July 3. And yet everything went wrong somewhere. The writers had no history, no real ideas. The set in old England showed brilliant glimpses to which, as we know, the League is capable, but these scenes did not fit well into the film. Jeff provided the best of too few, mostly bad jokes, and the speeches of Lipp and Briss were big disappointments. If you love the League, save time and money and watch the episodes from the show again. And again. Great disappointment.
