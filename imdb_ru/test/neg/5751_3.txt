At the beginning of the "Quarrel" we met with three pairs of seemingly unrelated characters. To make the situation even more confusing, we are informed (by the names on the screen) that the action takes place in three separate periods (between 1999 and 2001). It takes a lot of time, but in the end we come to see how the three couples are connected: Mark Austin, a young man at the age of 20, gay and HIV positive, alienated from his conservative parents, Elizabeth and Rev. Robert Austin. <br /> <br /> Mark is now a vagabond and arrives at Kyur Beach, North Carolina, in the seaside town where he meets George (keenly played by Michael Kelly), the owner of a gay motel, and they eventually get involved with each other. Meanwhile, Mark's own mother, Grace (played by Bonnie Hunt), reached the point where she decided to find a son, whom she refused to adopt when she was 17 years old. Similarly, Mark’s adoptive mother also decided to track down her estranged son because she misses him (despite the concerns of her husband, the homophob minister). <br /> <br /> The “quarrels” about which we are told are based on a true story, and perhaps this is its Achilles heel. Director / writer Tim Kirkman does his best to create scenes fraught with dramatic tension, where very little can be found. Take Mark and George - they are both sensitive souls with whom there is little to argue about. There is little stress when Grace encounters the director of the Adoption Agency, who is legally prohibited from giving her any information about her lost son, as well as in a little conflict with her mother, who denies that she disapproved of her when she became pregnant in her teens . , There are no sparks between Elizabeth and Robert, because the good Reverend insisted from the very beginning that he was not going to put up with his son. <br /> <br /> “Loggerheads” are similar to “Brokeback Mountain” in the sense that same-sex couples are good guys, and straight men (for example, the policeman on Kure beach and the reverend) are villains. The film’s biggest disappointment is the lack of interaction (and therefore no dramatic conflict) between Mark and one of his “mothers”. Mark is already dead before his own or adoptive mother can make peace with him. <br /> <br /> Kirkman's theme is at the same time a call for tolerance and a call for family members to express their sincere feelings before it is too late! Kirkman's feelings are mostly good, but they do not contribute to good drama. The quarrels are moving at the speed of a snail, without providing any new revelations (or expectations) on topics such as AIDS, adoption and homophobia. Ultimately, “Loggerheads” fails due to lack of originality.
