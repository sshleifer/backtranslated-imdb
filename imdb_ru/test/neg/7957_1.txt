Mop-cats copied this film from a 1974 Hindi film called “Call Girl”! Call Girl had an identical storyline. The way the main characters fall in love, then rebel and culminate in both of these films! Call Girl is better than Water, at least in terms of storytelling. It was not as painfully slow as water! Water, on the contrary, does not progress at all. The goal, perhaps, is to make the viewer sympathize with Kalyani forever! Are Indian directors any better than just being good copyists these days? Well, they call it "being inspired." In their language it sounds like this: “I am inspired (without any quotation!)”! :)
