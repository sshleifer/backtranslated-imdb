This is a half-deliberate memoir of an “international person” who has witnessed various political upheavals in the past 30 years. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that this film would provide a unique opportunity to look at politics and war. I also hoped that it would be touching and touching. However, I was disappointed with this film. “Chico” seemed fragmented, and the main character, Ricardo, spent 10 to 20 minutes in one country. As one would expect, a detailed plot cannot be developed on such dates. Excuses for moving to another place were often casually explained. The result was a disappointing collection of fragmented clips shot in different countries.
