Critters 4 begins, and I quote "Somewhere in Kansas 1992" and the replay of the last minutes Critters 3 (1991), when the recurring character Charlie McFadden (Don Keith Opper) is about to shoot the last two remaining Critter eggs in the Universe, which we know , will mean the disappearance of the entire Critter race, which is contrary to some intergalactic zoological law or something like that. Charlie's friend, the bounty hunter Ug (Terrence Mann), is now known as Tetra's Advisor and is a high-ranking official in the intergalactic council and orders Charlie not to shoot the eggs, but instead to put them in a capsule, which will soon land nearby. in fact, he lands very quickly nearby, and Charlie does lay eggs in him, but he is also caught in a pod, which, I believe, the cryogenic ally freezes him, as it has never been explained. Then Critters 4 informs us that we are “Somewhere in the Saturn quadrant of 2045,” where the rescue ship collides with a pod drifting in space (the captions have just run out, and Critters 4 is already stealing whole ideas and scenes from Aliens (1986 )). Rick (Anders Howe) decides to demand unidentified, in any case, them, a pod and try to earn some money from it. With the help of his team, Ethan (Paul Whittorn), Fran (Angela Bassett), Al Bert (Brad Dourif) and Bernie (Eric DeRe), the pod was successfully restored. They contact the intergalactic council, and Tetra's adviser says to go to an abandoned space station where they will trade for a capsule and its contents. Tetra also specifically tells Riku so that he does not open the capsule. So in a true horror movie tradition, Rick opens the capsule, thaws Charlie and Critter's eggs, which hatch, kill Rick and run to the space station ... <br /> <br /> Co-producer and director Rupert Harvey I thought that Critters 4 was a pretty useless movie and it rounds off the Critter series with whimpers rather than an explosion. The script of Joseph Lyle and David J. Shaw is predictable and cliché, a space station with an unstable reactor that will explode in a few hours, the main characters are just a way to escape at an early stage, so they are stuck in a race. not time to save themselves, constant quarrels and disputes between team members, people part and loser, who turns into a hero and saves the day, a yawn. A lot of plot devices seem to come straight from Aliens, and this removes the sticky scene from garbage from Star Wars (1979). Characters are no better, and you probably don't give a damn about them. While other Critter films can be described as comedic horrors, part 4 cannot, it seems deadly serious everywhere. Critters 4 is also incredibly slow, adventurous and boring. It took more than 30 minutes before the eggs of Critter hatched, and after this short sequence, there was almost an hour before they were seen again, why make the film Critter and almost do not show them? This cannot be due to expensive special effects, since they are in any case like puppets in gloves, o & how can Critter just a few hours ago control an entire space station and set a course to Earth? How do they even know what the Earth is? Why did Kapatin Rick somehow want to open the capsule? What is this thing about a female scientist and about an alien rubber that is mentioned only once? Why does the intergalactic council so much want Critters? Why only four people? Why is this beautiful looking space station completely abandoned again? Critters 4 looks cheap everywhere with soft, dark unimaginable sets, and it even steals Android footage (1983) for its ships and space scenes, Critters 4 was obviously so low-budget that the filmmakers could not afford any optical effects and that are needed with Android look seriously obsolete. For the most part, only two Critters are used, although some of them begin to hatch, but already quite late when this happens, for most of the film they are barely visible, and the effects for them are the worst of the entire series. Forget about blood or blood, as Critters kill only two people for more than 90 minutes of running, which was not enough to keep my weak interest. The game is also quite bad, with Angela Bassett's excessive melodramatic reaction to observing several Critter eggs, especially those cowering with dignity. To take a look at Critters 4, this is as cheap and unsightly as you might hope to (not) see. In the final of Critters 4, the universe is finally saved from the threat of Critter, let's hope that it will also save us and our local video stores from the threat of part 5 ...
