Corey Chaim plays a child who teams up with a dog to kill a giant troll and OSA (Michael Ironside) killer with 30/30 and homemade bombs (which plays plausibly, given Haim) but disappointing adaptation of a decent story. Corey Chaim, of course, is terrible, but the sheer impulse of the film, as well as Ironsideâ€™s impressive presence, make this film at least modestly effective. However, the plot is ridiculous, and it would be better if we could see a monster or at least more blood. At least it's something else. It is also likely that this film will be the latest film for teens, which will show how a teenager makes bombs. <br /> <br /> Matt Bronson 2/5
