Everyone knows that late night movies are not Oscar contenders. Good. I mean, I admit that I was a bit tipsy and bored and thought I would get to some skin-max. This is pretty bad when the information on the TV program channel makes fun of the movie in the description. It even gave him half a star. Honestly, I sat and threw it all, because this guy was soooo bad. I could not stop laughing. I mean the words coming from the lips of these people, and how they tried to be serious. Most of the time, I think people on the screen tried their best not to laugh. In fact, I think they were laughing in one scene. In any case, the film does not make sense. It was like one episode from a soprano with a fat gay guy. Only Soprano is a great show. But it was awful, I mean, not nude, just a sex scene from the 90s. You know who uses shadows and silhouettes instead of flesh. I gave him two reasons why this film makes a good film about drinking. I mean, with all the cheese, it helps to get the wine. If late at night, and all that is on TV, this is the same guy Tony Little and his exercise bike, then I suggest Tony Little.
