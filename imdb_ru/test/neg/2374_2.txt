I have always said that there is nothing better than the original form: comics. I was right again. This, like all the other films about the series Asterix, was not impressed. The creators of this film do not understand that the success of all other similar comic films (“X-Men”, “Superman, etc.”) makes it successful that they all deviate from the original comic versions and adapt them to make them more watchable the film deviated in the sense that this film was a cross from two books by Asterix, viz. Asterix and the Great Cross and Asterix and the Normans. In addition, uncharacteristically for the Asterix series (except Asterix and the Secret Weapon), love interest was presented to one of the main characters. All that was done in the end was the creation of a childish immature storyline. There were very few funny parts, and they were far from each other. In general, a complete waste of time and money for this, not to mention theaters, even at home.
