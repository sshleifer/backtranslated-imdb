One could make a better film to portray the tragedy of Bosnia. Some parts are very effective, and the film gives a good idea of ​​the suffering of people, especially children, but in general it is less like a movie and more like a documentary. Woody Harrelson is very good, but the rest of the cast has performed well without being unusual. Care must be taken to get a general idea of ​​what the war has done to the children of Bosnia. If you are expecting a good and exciting movie, Welcome ...... will be a disappointment.
