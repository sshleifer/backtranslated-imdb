This is one of the funniest bad movies I've ever seen. I can not believe whoever wrote the above review was serious. Perhaps he was associated with this. This means nothing. There is no waiting, the action is terrible, the direction is hopeless. Music score (?) - three banal notes, played up to nausea. The plot (?) Should have taken all five minutes to write. Dialogue is what a 10-year-old would come up with if he were asked to do homework. The only (a little) redemptive feature is the actor playing the psycho himself, who grimaces magnificently, trembles and screams, and, therefore, is sometimes funny. The only reason you find yourself on the edge of your chair is because you suffer from a weak bladder. Do not waste your time.
