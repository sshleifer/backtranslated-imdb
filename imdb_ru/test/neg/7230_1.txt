Wow, the character shares my first name! Nick! This film is as bad as the first, if not worse. Well, at least there's a real octopus in this movie. A real octopus that looks better in this movie. Better, I mean, "longer" acting is pretty dry, and hard to put up with. Just so you know when this ninety-minute film ends, you not only get rid of your couch, but also gain the ability to breathe back. Not only that, but you understand how stupid you are and then commit suicide, knowing how terrible life is after watching this movie. Indeed, it shows how much desperate horror films are today, more crap, how it is implemented, and where the hell have real horror masters been lately? This film was supposed to be the last straw so that we could return cinematic geniuses to a horror movie that could make some really GOOD modern horror films, this film bites.
