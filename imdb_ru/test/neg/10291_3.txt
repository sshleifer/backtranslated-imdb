This film was * good * relative to its first parts. <br /> <br /> We have a story from three perspectives. So let's find some tips and complete the story. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait ... none of this matters, because the FBI guys are bad guys! Although it was a great turn ... it was almost a horrible turn. I immediately lowered the film's rating from 7 to 8, based on the last 10-15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else understand why the turn is so bad? Yes, this is a good shock. But this is bad, because it has absolutely nothing to do with the previous hour and twenty minutes. There is no connection with the killers. <br /> <br /> Killers in about 5 minutes of this film (as killers), and two FBI agents in only 15 minutes of the previous hour and twenty. /> <br /> We understood ... observation ... Oh, the killers are voyeurs. That does not make sense because they have been described only in limited terms as simply psychopaths. Both the hour and twenty minutes of observation that we observe of these three stories go out the window, because everyone will die in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> All this makes the ending even more ridiculous. Oh, they killed a group of FBI agents in the beginning ... which FBI agents sleep together? All in the same room. To be found and killed by amateurs, and then to imitate people who know nothing about being FBI agents? A policeman 3 feet away obviously cannot hit a standard police pistol that can fire a few shots. I hate films that try to make you feel that this can be real when they make absurd jumps, they think we will believe. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that the film ends 10-15 minutes after they are shown as murderers with a girl standing somewhere in the field ...
