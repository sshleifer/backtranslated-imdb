"Shadows and Fog" is definitely one of Woody Allen's weakest films, right there with "September" and "Hollywood Finale" (although Allen did nothing equal to the horror of "Everything Else"). <br /> <br /> “Shadows and Fog” is a tribute to Allen's German expressionist style of filmmaking, bright and stylized light and shadow, and ... you guessed it ... a lot of fog. But you can say that Allen was fascinated by technique and a travesty and forgot to make a film that everyone would care about. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, he starred in the film Husbands and Wives in the same year, so it was different. not a complete wash for him. <br /> <br /> Rating: D
