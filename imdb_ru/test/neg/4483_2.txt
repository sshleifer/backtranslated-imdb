Well, let's start with the good: beautiful landscapes, Channing Tatum is easy to look at, Amanda Seyfried has beautiful hair, that's all. How much of this movie went to the installation floor? Probably plot, action, good dialogue and a point. Awful game, terrible jerky dialogue. Let me tell you how bad it is: my friend, who always cries in the movies, got to the part that was supposed to cause tears, and she laughed so loudly that we thought she was crying! It seems that the film wants to hit too many problems - wars, losses, autism, cancer, but it fails so miserably to cover any topic satisfactorily. Make sure you have something to eat, and you can send text messages to your mobile phone!
