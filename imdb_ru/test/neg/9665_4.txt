We picked it up as part of a Brentwood kit called the Broken Skull. This film, shot directly on video with widely varying quality of sound and lighting, acquires a hyperactive quality that can inspire the viewer to a feeling of nervousness, confusion and irritability, and not to a good, “evil dead” method. <br /> If you don’t go into spoilers, what at first seems like a simple ghost-revenge story becomes more confusing and bizarre. Although there are some interesting ideas here, the overall effect is likely to make you scratch your head and say “hm?” <br /> <br /> This is a very, very bloody film. The effects of blood range from full bloody headgear to stupid effect. Video Toaster, which you need to freeze to believe. The level of the effects of fangoria in this film is really amazing and probably should make the hounds happy, while making someone with a weak constitution feel a little nauseous. <br /> <br /> Broken skull This is also a very noisy movie. He has not only ambient noise (captured by microphones and not replaced in the post), but also a lot of yelling. No, no, I mean a lot. Many-many! Characters scream, scream, howl and scream, talk insanely and laugh. Reduce the volume if you appreciate your eardrums and your nerves! But you can't blame the actors for their enthusiasm, they really eat up the scenery, and sometimes the effect is quite interesting. In particular, the actress who plays a certain Vietnamese immigrant copes with all of the above with great pleasure. <br /> <br /> In fact, very few actors were wooden. Some of them may have been a bit overdone (oh, just a tiny smidgen!), But most of them are definitely fun to watch as they leave. The cast is ethnically diverse and is grateful to the directors for this. However, two white women of middle age are two of the most vicious and irritated characters since the days of the seller in the classic MST3k “Rude Man”. Just watch how they look at all the other characters, it's fun! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the Headcrusher cannot become an icon of horror on a par with Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers or Freddy Krueger (or even Leprechaun). but we can definitely say it ... it was a movie.
