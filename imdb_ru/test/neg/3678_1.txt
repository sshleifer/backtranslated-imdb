I can't remember the worst movie I watched. A total waste of time for actors and spectators. If you prefer to sit at your TV and think when this movie ends, then this is the right movie for you. so that people believe that Moscow has some mysterious past. But I must say that I did not expect anything else from Rade Serbedzija, but I expected more from Vincent Gallo. It is true that there is some camera effect, but even that is too bad. Again and again the same pictures. A complete waste of time.
