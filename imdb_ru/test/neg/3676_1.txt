This film is full of fights. I love Val Kilmer and I was very surprised at the beginning of this year with “Felon” (good movie!). The whole DVD box is misleading. Val Kilmer, being declared one of the main people in this film, is in the film for about 2 minutes. Even the summary on the back of a DVD is not quite right. It could have been a good movie, but the direction was terrible, and the plot was about as thin as a piece of paper. Usually, when a movie is terrible, you can sit back and laugh at it. Although this film is so bad and boring that I actually fell asleep (which I never do during the film). AVOID ALL COSTS!
