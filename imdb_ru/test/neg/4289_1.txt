The only thing that makes this watchable is that Coryâ€™s performance as a crazy killer is free. That which remains is the most impossible story of revenge and marital discord. During the scenes with the walkie-talkie, I had the feeling that Cotten was squeezing sweet potatoes, not a communication device. Another interesting thing about this is that Alan Hale (Skipper from Gilligan Island) is not so fat yet, and he can still lower his arms below the waist. In addition, there is nothing special to recommend.
