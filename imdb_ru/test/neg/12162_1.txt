First of all, the nature in the film is beautiful, and there is some Mongolian music. Well, the horses looked Mongolian and camels, but that was all that was Mongolian in it. Oh, a Mongolian actress plays a game at the Borth, albeit a flimsy performance. But she is pretty, which slightly compensates for the lack of performance on her part. <br /> <br /> But I didn’t understand at all what is the meaning of this part of the 1.30-hour fantasy created by Mr.Bodrov, which is painful to see. The plot completely lacked a sense of cohesion. There was no logic behind the development of the plot. In fact, there was almost no story, just a few loosely connected scenes with a group of guys in "Mongolian" clothes, speaking some kind of pidzhin, which should sound like Mongolian. Most of the actors were Japanese, Russian or Chinese, most of the scenes were shot in China, Kazakhstan or Russia, and there was a lot of disturbing pathos about what it means to be "Mongolian." The dialogue is primitive, and the dialogue scenes are slow. The battle scenes are ridiculous. All supernatural pathos is lame and, obviously, exists only to make up for the absence of history. <br /> <br /> The Japanese actor looked like a wooden doll, and, looking at him, no one would understand how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes. For most of the film, he looked sleepy, soft, tough and pitiful. <br /> <br /> And I don’t even want to start with the historical significance of this piece of cinematic trash. To see half of Chinggis Khan’s film as a slave, to see how his first two children were born, to see how his wife sells herself to a Tangut merchant ... my blood begins to boil. And where is the beautiful story about the friendship of Temudgin and Jamuqi? From this you can make a great movie. Where is the story of the Temujin uprising? About his childhood, about his relationship with his family, with his brothers, about how he fought for survival among the powerful enemies of his family? Where is Wang Khan, who helped him a lot? Where is the image of life in the steppe, the life of nomads, their traditions, their relations with other nations around them? <br /> <br /> Where is the character development? We absolutely do not understand what Temudzhin unites with Jamuha and what separates them and most importantly, how Temudgin became Chinggis Khan, how he, outcast without wealth and military power, managed to unite the Mongolian tribes and create such an efficient organized military machine that crushed one nation after another and created the largest land empire in history. All this can make some interesting and dramatic stories with complex plots and deep characters, but, unfortunately, we did not see any of this in Bodrov’s work, we didn’t even look at it.
