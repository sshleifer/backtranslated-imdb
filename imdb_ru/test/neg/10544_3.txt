The venomous Avenger, a horribly deformed creature of superhuman size and strength, has returned in this sequel, in which everything is basically wrong. Toxie goes to Japan to find his father at the suggestion of his psychiatrist, who is in collusion with an evil corporation that just wants the avenger to leave to get a stranglehold on Tromaville in his absence. With new actors for Toxie and his girlfriend, who have a different name, a much less gloomy, much more comical tone and plot line that cannot hold a candle in front of the original. Even with a completely uncut version, which can be obtained only if you buy the Tox Box DVD bundle, blood is the only thing suitable for this. And if you come across ANY other version, forget about getting pleasure from it. While the first classic is on a low budget, it just isn't. <br /> <br /> My assessment: D + <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Erica Shikkel has a very fast slip; Phoebe Leger goes topless; one nonsense becomes completely naked; and a few additions to the bath scene show different amounts of skin. <br /> <br /> Tox Box without a DVD director. Extras: introduction and commentary by director Lloyd Kaufman; Second commentary with director Lloyd Kaufman, Troma editors Gabriel Friedman and Brian McNulty; Toxie on Japanese television; Interview with the editor-in-chief of Fangoria, Michael Gingold; Interview with Mike Mayo from Videohound; the same damned radiation march that is on EVERY THROME DVD; Clip from Lisa Gay; "Toxi 15 Years Later" 2 PSA; Test intelligence Troma; Trom Studio Construction Tour; Lloyd Kaufman autobiography; Photo gallery; Theater trailer; and trailers for: "Toxic Avenger", "Toxic Avenger 3", "Protection from temptation", "Nuke 'Em High Class", "Sergeant Kabukiman New York," Thromo and Juliet "," Bloodsucking Freaks ", &" Surf the Nazis must die
