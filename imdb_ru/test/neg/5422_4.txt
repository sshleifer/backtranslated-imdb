I bought this film for a couple of dollars at “Stock Sales” once when I was just looking around. The cover looked pretty good (in color), but the film is black and white, (I wish they did not try to catch us in colored covers in black and white films, but this is a common thing worth paying attention to!). <Br /> <br /> When I looked at it, I was pleasantly surprised. It turned out better than I expected. I was disappointed that it was B & W, but the effect is pretty good, certainly better than, say, "Invaders from Mars", which has crappy effects, and it's great to see John Banner in something other than Hogan's Heroes. <Br /> <br /> Overall, this film is not so bad for class B and is certainly worth two dollars in terms of nostalgia. This is not my favorite fantasy, but not the worst. It's okay
