The first thing I want to point out is music. Nothing is as surprising as the haunting theme of the Ogre's Holocaust Ruggero Deodato or the waltz masterpiece from The Tale of Two Sisters, but I will not allow this to stop me so early in the film. <br /> <br /> It must be assumed that a woman who studies her hypothesis for her doctoral dissertation, that cannibalism has never existed as an organized practice, you might think that they should take into account that they are wrong and, accordingly, prepare for the trip? Or why go at all if you already believe that the hypothesis is true even before it was tested? It is incredibly ignorant and makes the film seem much more unrealistic and poorly written. <br /> <br /> It really looks like a film by Ruggero Deodato, just not prepared at all. No weapons, no decent hiking clothing, just nonsense to the end. <br /> <br /> People do not go on such trips to college without months of planning and preparation. <br /> <br /> But I retreat ... <br /> <br /> For our brave but stupid adventurers, things are not going very well, as they tend to miss the bustling iguana, and their ferret bait falls out of the truck is almost a demise, then fall into a muddy pit, well, I think it's time to go. <br /> <br /> Okay, then they flip a coin to see if they keep going or forget it all. How does this scene generally make any sense? Are all their beliefs based on a coin flip? After they must have spent the time, and the money, and the preparation, just to leave. It only gets worse. Definitely one of the worst actors, screenwriters and music ever invented for the film industry. <br /> <br /> Mike talks about how he and his friend were seized by cannibals and placed in cages in mud pits with leeches 3 inches long to suck their blood. It seemed to me interesting, because if you remember the first cannibal they encounter in the jungle, the man whom they mistaken for a simple native sits on the ground and eats such leeches ... Interestingly, are they the same? In fact, although this film is simply terrible, because the script is terrible, and the action does not cause emotions, given its content. They simply agree to leave themselves, and not to be eaten by cannibals, as if this is not a very important decision. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Mike is insane, but, as in the first film, in which they belong to the aborigines with such terrible behavior, it is simply unrealistic. <br /> <br /> In the film Ruggero Deodato it is easy to feel that the Americans got what they deserved, while the natives can hardly be blamed for the film that once again struck the Americans. <br /> <br /> And because of this, the film seems somewhat meaningless. We already understood the meaning of the first film, so why was the sequel filmed? Name of Lieutenant Rizzo ?! Could it be worse? Often with such films, when you watch the cast, you find that they really haven't been shot in many other films, and their biographies are almost non-existent, so you can imagine that I was surprised to find Giovanni Lombardo Radice in this film who was in scorsese gangs in new york. Now Lieutenant Rizzo looked familiar, and I discovered that he was in the 2002 Spiderman movie as the tiny role of a captain in a tug. Reminds me how William Shatner went from being an admiral on a USS Enterprise to a police officer in a car. Irony, sometimes irony is obtained. Shatner never could understand music correctly, until his recent album "Has Been", which is really good, just like Bono from U2 could never get a proper haircut, and Dan Marino could never win any Super Bowls. <br /> <br /> Sometimes Irony is just as sad as Christopher Reeve, Superman can’t go irony. Although this man will always be a legend, because he was such a wonderful guy, I was still distracted. <br /> <br /> At this point you can say that it’s pretty boring to me to even discuss Cannibal Ferox. <Br /> <br /> Cannibal’s Holocaust message was about who the real savages are and what is really evil? What do savages do in natural life is unknown to our moral testimonies, or what do we do with evil intentions? The message of Cannibal Ferox is as follows: "Be careful what you are looking for, because you can just find it." I will say this for the ogre Ferox. When Gloria returns and writes her dissertation, arguing that cannibalism does NOT exist, she saves others who are curious and go where angels are afraid to go, but overall this film was really bad. <br /> <br /> *** / 10
