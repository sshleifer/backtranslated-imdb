First of all, I love Steven Seagal, this man is a genius. But recent films make me think: is he not trying anymore? His latest films show little effort from Seagal. In Out of Reach, it's too obvious that its strings are duplicated. What Seagal is doing in this film is not only a slap in the face to his fans, but even more to Jean-Claude Van Damme and his fans. In Stage 2 or so, when he prepares to jump into the drug dealer's penthouse to steal valuables and money, he shows that he has installed a gun and hooked him with a neon sign. Perhaps you say to yourself: “Yes, so what does this have to do with Van Damme?” It's good that this scene was stolen from a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie called Order. Hire both, look at both, compare both, and you will lose respect for Seagal. Not only did you die today was rubbish, but I dare say, an insult. Seagal's aikido movements are still good, but why is he not filmed in such wonderful films as Marked for Death or Above the Law, he still has movements and attitudes, I just wonder, “Why Seagal, why?” . In his new films there are such idiotic scenes that have nothing to do with the storyline, and such idiotic storylines to the same. I hope that the upcoming film “Black Dawn” will be another “Out of Wounds” or “Beyond Justice”, because his last chains of films, especially “Today You Die”, really made me think about whether he has any material for create more great action films such as Double Team. Please don't watch this movie, if you don't hate Seagal, if you like his movies, don't watch him, it will make you doubt his future in the action movie genre.
