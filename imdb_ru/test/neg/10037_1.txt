In addition to the fact that this is just a horrible movie (imagine you are giving a video camera to a regular high school drama club), you need to grow up to people who think that there is something “real” in this legend. This is the 21st century. Guess what: ghosts don't exist. Most people find out about it from their mother when they are about 5 years old. You guys should seriously grow up. <br /> <br /> The fact that the fraud was committed almost 2 centuries ago does not make it a fraud. The fact that a large number of inbred mounds from Tennessee believes that this also does not. Go to college Or at least finish high school.
