The discovery of MORTE A VENEZIA is reminiscent of Duran Duran's music video with classical music, and this is the highlight of the film <br /> <br /> “From Theo's Perspective?” <br /> <br /> From the point of view of everything, but especially excitement. I doubt that there has ever been a slower and slower film than this one. Yes, well, this is a European art house, so I did not expect Charles Bronson to deal with the crowds of bad guys, but even in this case, I was expecting some kind of entity, if not the actual plot. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Professor Gustav Von Ashenbach in Venice. Gustav visits Venice and rides a gondola, Gustav eats at an expensive restaurant, Gustav looks out the window of his hotel, and if you want excitement, Gustav has a memory <br /> <br /> It’s bad enough if it was a whole movie, but it gets worse because Gustav notices a cute teenage boy. So, you have a middle-aged academic attraction after some teenager whom he saw, some old queen becomes obsessed with a stranger. Great idea for a movie? I don’t think that since Gawd’s fame also remained a yawn of fest instead of some grubby predecessor of gay porn. <br /> <br /> I noticed a lot of people who praise this film tried to intellectualise it. I can only be monosyllabic and unassuming, in my opinion, and say that the only implication I could relate to was Gustav’s physical and emotional disintegration, but this was not caused by the tender beauty of the teenager — it was caused by watching such a boring and ostentatious film
