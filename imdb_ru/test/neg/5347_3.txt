Chip Fuz is an absolute genius, and the end result of the projects is truly amazing. Co-hosts do a good job. I especially enjoy watching the “project” get together. The end results are much better than when they left the assembly line, which is with mechanical and cosmetic achievements today. However, I am somewhat annoyed by the fact that the “projects” seem to be the property of the already rich and / or famous. It is too bad that those who get an overhaul, can afford to undertake an initiative. Let's take a look now, Vince Neil of Motley Crew is preparing the car for his friend. Hello! If he (Nil) were a true friend, he would pay to restore his friend's car. Well and a joke! In another episode, the seemingly wealthy middle-aged girl got her friend '56 named Betsy to be ready. A husband of 30+ years was behind all this. The pair looked like there was no money in short supply. What a disgrace. I guess the bucket guys, like me, will have to save for a day that never comes. I happened to own a Ford '53 project chip. Will anybody pick me?
