I just have to comment on this movie, because I gave it 4 ratings, and in my opinion, this is pretty high for a softporn movie. The actual plot is a kind of deception (which would have expected otherwise), but Khafron is very incredibly funny, and he transmits everything in a cyborg voice, so itâ€™s easy for him. The one who wrote the script was definitely wit! I must have laughed loudly ten times, and this is not the reason anyone would have taken this film. The only softporn movie I saw that had some value besides beautiful women (and believe me, Emmanuel is amazingly beautiful ... just look at the cover!) <br /> <br /> Any movie that can amuse me considering how bad the plot is and how bad the game is, also considering that the film was not made for artistic entertainment, so to speak, in my book he got at least four points. I mean, whoever watched it before the Stop! Or will my mom shoot?
