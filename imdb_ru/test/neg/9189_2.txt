First of all, I'm not a fireman, but I'm in some kind of para-fire fighting unit (guys who are called if an earthquake collapses, and more SAR people need a real fireman), so I did some training and simulation but I no experience in real life. <br /> <br /> But still there are some moments that one notices as completely unbelievable. I can understand that they removed the mouths / nasal parts of the masks and that there is not enough smoke, because otherwise the public will not see anything. But some things defy logic: <br /> <br /> - There is no second mask attached to oxygen. How the hell do you want to save people through smoke without one? <br /> <br /> - Strong people. No, it is not. I would shout too if someone would tie me with a rope in such a way and hang me from the building. If I could scream, that is, and not lose consciousness from lack of air, because the rope squeezes my lungs. The second time, when they come down from the jack, it’s better, but still strange. <br /> <br /> “Aim high”. No, damn it, no. You always fight fire as low as possible. You do not fight, you want to spray the fire, you want to extinguish the fire, and it is below the flame. <br /> <br /> - There is no discipline. They run like a chicken. And they shout all the time, instead of using the radio and observing discipline. <br /> <br /> - No tactics. Why don't they work in teams of at least two? You can still be separated, but it takes much more than if everyone just ran alone in search of victims. <br /> <br /> - Do they really enter buildings without water? In Europe, firefighters will never enter a burning building without. <br /> <br /> - Firefighters on the roof. WTF they think they do there without safety lines or water? - exploding rooms. Wood and brick do not "suddenly explode." <br /> <br /> The camaraderie and other non-fire parts of the film are the best moments. This is a lot of kitsch, but everything is in order. I will give this point for this.
