I can’t believe how this evil deed could capture the hearts and minds of different layers of “bright young people” of its era, but I’m sure that I wouldn’t want to. In my opinion, this is an inaccurate, poorly acting, poorly written script, a pretentiously directed piece of gumpf. Short excursions into imaginary reality clog any humor to death. The situations are unconvincing exaggerations that make the already fragile characters even more incredible and disgusting. Romance is boring, the end is unsatisfactory and destroys the only sensible message about drugs in the film, and the simple plot (Consciousness and Me, Fear and Loathing) is checked to the extreme by an uninteresting movement of the film. In short, this film is a blatant visual attack without a hint of skill or initiative. I condemn it in a heap of ashes of history and pray that it will remain there.
