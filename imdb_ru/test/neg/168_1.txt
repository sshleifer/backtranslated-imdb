This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, probably surpassed only by a horrible and completely pointless Blueberry. How can Harald Zvart even put his name on this shit. I feel that every ounce of respect for him quickly dies away. <br /> <br /> What is it about this movie that makes it so bad? This is history? Yes. Are these actors? Yes. Is this the whole "look" of the movie? Yes. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the story, my goodness! She is as penetrated and predictable as all that one would expect from a drunk 14-year-old who is late in writing her article “What I did this summer.” The pleasant atmosphere that the creators are trying to achieve, just completely drowned while we suffer from yet another embarrassing turn to history. <br /> <br /> I know that actors are amateurs, and therefore we cannot expect them to be of the same quality as professional actors. But in order for this to work, the characters MUST be charming and / or funny (preferably both), so that the audience does not object to bold actions, or perhaps it even adds to the characters. In this case, even close is not a child! You start with dislike for the heroes, and by the end of the film (I think it will take about 90 minutes, although it looks like 4 hours), you have a strong desire to hurt someone, so that you get these pesky stupid guys to mind! It must not be possible to find the attempt of this film with a good sense of humor, if you are not really such fools. Their previously mentioned lack of talent and credibility with regard to acting, only causes stupid and too simple scenes to fall to the ground. Even the family of the people involved will have a hard time finding it, but very, very embarrassing (I would prefer my sister to fool herself on American Idol). <br /> <br /> Finally, why cram a bunch of inappropriate Norwegian celebrities? They look even more out of place than the actors, if possible. These famous cameos only reinforce the feeling of cheapness of the film and are in themselves a fairly transparent image in the dark, trying to improve something broken before it appears. <br /> <br /> I can't even stress how I would rather see how the paint dries than ever watch this movie again ...
