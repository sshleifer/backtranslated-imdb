What a disappointment. The storyline is very simple - “good guys sometimes do bad things, and bad guys sometimes do good things” - dressed in racial settings to make it look smart, sophisticated and meaningful. This is not true. There is no subtlety in it. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens is wired, and then repeated in case you missed the explanation. <br /> <br /> For a movie like this, you need to convince and move the audience. must represent the ambiguity of the characters and their motivation and actions; It’s not easy to present it as a sequence of 180-degree changes in the actions of each character. <br /> <br /> Halfway through, I really wanted to spend more time on it, but I thought I would stick with it if I improved; a big mistake i had to stop then - it just got worse.
