I love the work of Stephen King, and the book was great, but I was very disappointed when I bought this movie on DVD. It was one of the worst B-films I've ever seen. It seems that they had a tight schedule, and he took only one shot per scene, even if it turned out to be bad. And where did they find the actors.
