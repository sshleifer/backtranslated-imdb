The entire production of this invented Disney family movie (ad-exec gets its teenage daughter for a horse because she “wants one more than everything else in the world”) is just an excuse to make a major climate horse show at the end. , All other ingredients (an advertising campaign about pills for the stomach, Kurt Russell as a potential boyfriend for a boy, Lloyd Bochner as a potential rival to Dean Jones due to his attachment to Diane Baker) are put off towards the end just to show the horse. More than half of the paintings are full, and even worse: they are whiny and unpleasant. The baby is a nanny who cries on the couch with a dog in her arms, and, as usual, she gets her way. * from ****
