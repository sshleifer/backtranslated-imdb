This is absolutely terrible. It is everywhere and nowhere and makes no sense. I never understood what was good about Jeff Garlin or Sarah Silverman. Bonnie Hunt is so much higher than this shit that she must have been a personal friend with the people involved, because she could not read any part of this so-called “script” and thought, “Yes, I want to do it!” In most films, I can find at least one or two things that can be exchanged or funny. There is a ZERO of this. It is so stupid. There really is no other word to describe it. Perhaps this is the biggest waste of money to create a film that I have seen in a long time. Skip this at any cost, you will be glad you did.
