After the mysterious death of an old friend, a group of teenagers found themselves in the possession of "Lost", a video game of survival in horror, based on the terrible story about Erzebet Bathory, known as the Countess of Blood. soon they are killed one by one in the same way as the character they played in the game. When the line between the game world and reality disappears, our heroes must find a way to defeat the evil countess of blood. “Stay Alive” is an incredibly poor slasher film without the slightest concern. Director William Brent Bell has no idea how to shoot horror movies. almost does not exist, and the story does not make sense. The dialogue is completely bad, and the actions of all the people involved are embarrassing. Stay Alive is easily one of the worst mainstream horror films of 2006.
