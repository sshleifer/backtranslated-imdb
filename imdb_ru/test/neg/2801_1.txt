This is possibly the worst of the worst. I'm a big fan of the horror film industry and I can believe that this film was shot. Acting was juvenile, and the story is completely idiotic. Camera work was also minor. One scene that comes to mind is outside the store. Night, and you can see the moon, but all the characters have shadows that cast on the wall. Street light was not visible. One character is gutted at some point, but he manages to emerge later after removing himself from the post. Come on !!! It seemed to me that I was watching a performance in high school. I kept expecting the characters to wave to their family members from the camera and say “hello, mom.” I can only give two positive comments ... it ended and it was good for a laugh. Please do not rent this movie !!!!
