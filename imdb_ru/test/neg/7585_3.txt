I chose this DVD from the trash can at Walmart because the cover showed one of the planes I flew in Vietnam (C-123k). I didnâ€™t fly to Air America, but I knew that I was a C-123 pilot, I knew a lot about who flew, including those who flew to my reserve unit home. I am not a film critic, but I am surprised at the subconscious motivation of directors and screenwriters who make such films. The best part of this movie is to go to the operator. Flying shots and stunts (although fully animated) are superb. The film begins with the beloved fall of Hollywood in 1969. But the fact is that Nixon did not start Air America, he did not start a lie. Johnson was in charge of Air America, and Nixon inherited lies, war, and Air America. It is wrong or inaccurate to portray Nixon as a liar on the subject of Air America. All presidents inherited the lies of their predecessors. No one was smart enough to fly the C-123, stupid enough not to know what they were joining. This makes Downey incredible. The C-123 was a sturdy airplane. It can easily fly on one engine or two auxiliary jet engines. Three puppets shooting at a duck with one shot are more likely. The pilots who flew with Air America were civilian employees of the CIA, they were not reckless soldiers of luck. They had good reason to behave and to believe in the future if they survived their extremely dangerous work. They were given a double retirement age. They were not required to sell drugs or weapons in order to get a good pension. Doping was legal and lifestyle in the SEA, as it is today in Afghanistan. If individual pilots tried to make money on the side, it was not the policy of the CIA. The CIA waged a war against communism, not against drugs. The writer based his story on "war stories." Pilots love everyone who buys them beer and listens. A writer and director who had a particular craving for Vietnam and Nixon. Watch the movie and remember how it starts - he blames Nixon for what has existed for years. Remember, he did not become president until January 20, 1969. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is a jungle landing. Air America pilots deploy aircraft where designers never thought it was possible. They had a lot of funny stories that could be shown. Instead, the director decided to use an oversized rubber scene to show how stupid the CIA was. This scene shows that the director and writer got into some kind of experimental bar talk, and a joke on them. <br /> <br /> MDS Fort Valley, Va.
