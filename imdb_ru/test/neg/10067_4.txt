From the rich imagination that brought you the irresistible HERCULES (1983), its even more ridiculous continuation occurs (read more stupidly): immediately we get another cumbersome prologue of the “beginning of time”, which even manages to completely contradict the same events as in first movie!; Soon, a condensed installation of the highlights is followed by a super-similar sequence of scrolling credits. Narratively, here we have four rebel gods who steal the seven most important (but poorly animated) blows of Zeus ?? a crime that, on the one hand, causes the moon to climb the course of a collision with the planet Earth! Faster than you can say "cronyism", Zeus (once again played as a bearded man, relatively young Claudio Cassinelli) sends his champion ?? who is now rightfully taken its place among the elite due, as is believed, to the omnipotent tasks performed in the first film? to find it blooming lightning and prevent disaster in the store. <br /> <br /> As soon as Hercules (Lou Ferrigno ??, as if you didn't know) touched the earth's surface, that he comes in contact with two attractive girls (Milli Carlucci and Sonya Viviani) need him to pull out them out of trouble!; the first one (who later became an Italian TV presenter) seems to be able to talk to small people (!) ?? who look weird like the tiny sisters from GODZILLA VS. MOTRA (1964) !! Just as they can fool as many unused shots from the first film as possible, the divine quartet of villains resurrects the good old King Minos (again William Berger) from his skeletal sleep and again pushes him to his eternal enemy. As a rule, Hercules meets with a number of potentially deadly enemies, including the Gorgon. the terribly underestimated episode, which was supposed to lead to an infallible claim of plagiarism, forced the filmmakers behind the much more outstanding film “The Battle of the Titans” (1981) to watch this film (complete with the same “reflection in the shield”) and preceded by a muscular, allowing the audience to talk about their tactics before performing them, as if to show us how clever he is) !! And to make it clear that he is carrying his influence on the sleeve, Cozzi makes Hercules and Minos turn into a space version of King Kong vs Godzilla for one of their battles, and later King Kong comes into the fight with a large snake, a clash broke out of classic 1933 original. I swear: this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth! <br /> <br /> As in the case of the first film, the cast is full of old reliable authors, such as Berger, Cassinelli and Venantino Venantini mentioned above (as a sorcerer with really bad hair day) and and the next stars. not only Carlucci, but also Maria Rosario Omajo (as the younger Hera!), Serena Grandi, Pamela Prati and, once again, Eva Robbins (whose costume here easily surpasses her appearance in the first film); for what it is worth, the Pinot Donajo score is reworked for this from the musical signals shown in his soundtrack to the previous film. If you still adhere to this review, you must have already realized that this is one of those films that are so incredibly bad that the reviewer is forced to choose which course to choose: reject it with one unflattering offer or spend an undeserved amount of time dissecting limitations. I'm sure I threw away some of his inept actions, but I wouldn’t forgive myself if I hadn’t mentioned any loud laughter in the whole film that almost made me fall off the chair (yes, even surpassed for me the above-mentioned animated titanic duel), namely the decor of the lair of the rebellious gods, which has the form of a giant marble teapot !! <br /> <br /> At this stage it is quite possible to wonder why I gave this film (and its predecessor) a rating instead of a (not completely unjustified) BOMB; In the past, I had various lengthy online discussions about whether a star rating of a particular movie should reflect the overall artistic quality or its pure entertainment value ?? but these are two cases in which I considered it necessary for the latter to deliberately influence my final rating. I don’t know: maybe it’s because I’m in a state of “sword and sandal” (with some more than 10 respectable examples planned for the coming days!), But in the end, it’s not typical for me to decide to add these two films to my dvd collection just based on the fun i got with them in this recent re-visit ?? and that in itself should mean something, no?
