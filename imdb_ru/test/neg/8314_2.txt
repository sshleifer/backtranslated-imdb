“Death Machines” use a fairly decent prerequisite for an action movie (unstoppable fighting vehicles for the destruction of martial arts sent to destroy opponents of criminal authority) and turn it into an unmatched mess. I have rarely seen such a breathtaking combination of a tiny budget, a bad game, and an incoherent script, released in the form of a so-called “movie”. This is probably the worst martial arts / action movie I've seen in recent years, eclipsing even the Holocaust Ninja (in which, at least, there were good fight scenes). <br /> <br /> The real “star” of the film is the white “Death Machine” (this is mainly his car), so it appears in a much larger number of scenes than its two cohorts. He is in good shape and looks good, but, as an actor, he is almost there - remember Chuck Norris in the Octagon, only without any energy or emotions. This is obviously a deliberate choice on the part of the actor and director. ... but you have to be Arnold to deal with such things, and this guy is not Arnold. <br /> <br /> The film (and the director) cannot find the time (or budget) to shoot scenes that would answer the basic questions she initially posed, for example: who was the dark figure giving an Asian lady with marble mouths her orders? How did the "gang war" end? Why did an Asian with brown lips decide to kill her zombie killers? And what the hell happened to leave her assistant dead, and she kept the katana like a broom? <br /> <br /> This, however, takes time to shoot a completely extraneous brawl in a bar in which the sailor (well, he looked like Popeye) destroys the bar, because the box with the jukebox does not work. This is only related to the rest of the film, because in the process he also knocks out the “hero” of the film, a bartender / karate student who fell victim to the first main task of “Death Machines” (his arm was cut off while they killed his teacher). This is followed by one of the most relaxed "love scenes" between the hero and his girlfriend, which I have ever watched. There is no point in this - at the end of the bar fight, she frowns at his splayed limp body, and then they fall into the "tasteful" shadow montage of sex and love, which looks as if it was obtained from a Hallmark card. By the way, we will never see a sailor again. <br /> <br /> And wait until you see a showdown between the homicide detective and his captain - it sounds as though the director and screenwriter have never actually seen the movie scene placed in the police station, but heard of them from second hand. and decided to include some, not knowing how they work. <br /> <br /> The film tells how a bad cast and public actors of the theater indulge in no decent direction. The three "Death Machines" seem like clods; The “hero” knows his lines, but cannot carry the film, given that his character is an ineffective weakling; his girlfriend is a vacuum of charisma; and all the other small details are barely noticeable. All this makes the film rather bad, but the “lady dragon” does more to drag the film to the underground vile territory than anyone or anything else. She looks ridiculous; her tiny expressionless face overcame her skyscraper wig, she wears a red silk dress like a robe, and talks to a terrible naughty delivery that screams "it takes time with a dialogue coach." Poor lady - she was clearly coming out of her element and, as far as I know, never again appeared in the film. <br /> <br /> Add to this a low-cost soundtrack for a single synthesizer that never shuts off and doesn’t play anything that is suitable or interesting; crappy film and lighting; to fight choreography strictly from hunger; and in general everything is sadness and lack of energy in the blocking and stage business ... and you have one bad movie. <br /> <br /> I got it as part of a 50-DVD movie compilation, so probably watching it cost me about 50 cents. It was not worth it. Fe!
