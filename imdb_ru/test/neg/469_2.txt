How to go to Charles Darwin’s fantastic intellectual journey and turn it into a film about tiptoes. His main and original ideas and their radical influence on Western thought and capitalist society are not affected, with the exception of two short scenes, one of which states that he "kills God"; pure demagoguery to make a movie emotional. And the rest of the film comes down to this goal: it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes with loud music that you have to cry on. Anyone who actually reads The Origin of Species is well aware that there was no violation of God in Darwin’s work; on the contrary, trepidation and respect, and a revolutionary new view of things, have increased. A good film about Darwin can be educational, thoughtful and deeply inspiring, even in a religious sense - but that would be contrary to the intentions of the soap opera of this film. This is a click that is meant to make people cry out of fake sympathy, and then feel transformed, although not able to understand why; he quickly uses the great name of Darwin only as a marketing influence, since at a party you can create a famous name to create an impression. It is sad that the scenery and costumes are so good: production values, with the exception of writing, were clearly high. Look, if you want to cry, because of the loss of intelligence in American literature.
