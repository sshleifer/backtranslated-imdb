My resume refers to the fact that this film has 1,479 votes - only 21, which makes it not subject to inclusion in the notorious list of IMDb Bottom 100 - 100 films with the lowest rating on the site. With an insignificant score of only 1.8, this would put the film between # 38 and 46 on the list - talking about a very dubious achievement !! My score of 3 is not so bad - but it does bring the film closer to the horrible list. <br /> <br /> As for the film, the once-cute Aaron Carter was shot in it - another pre-packaged and forgettable pop star of the 1990s. When he first appeared on stage, he was a cute kid with a few songs that teenagers and teenagers liked on Radio Disney. His songs, appearance and image were carefully prepared and created by marketers and did their job, which led to huge sales of albums. Unfortunately, by 2005, sales were in decline, and Carter had reached an awkward stage of life - something ALL children of his age would sooner or later encounter. Simply put, he is no longer cute in this film and is at a very difficult stage of life. I suppose now he is a gorgeous young man ... but in the Pop Star he is no longer the heartbeat he once was. Here he is just very normal ... a death sentence for a child in his position of "pop sensation". <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the film has several episodic roles from some of the other former teenage heartbeats over the past few decades - including roles for David Cassidy and Leif Garrett - two guys who also know what it is to disappear from the spotlight . Cassidy managed to collect the pieces and create a niche for himself, and Garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after fame was something of a joke. I hope that in the future, Carter will take responsibility for Cassidy, and so far, fortunately, he has managed to avoid the negative publicity and court speeches of many former pop idols. I was not delighted with the film, but I seriously wished him all the best in this department. It is not his fault that he was advertised on radio and television in the early and mid-1990s. <br /> <br /> In this film, Carter doesn't need to strain - he plays a pop star. Nevertheless, despite the fact that he earns millions and loves girls, he has "none of this." He is quite dense - mainly because he has little interest in learning. The problem is so serious that his mother decides not to attend his home anymore - forcing him to go to public school. The problem, however, is that he quite passionately loves to take tests ... and it is difficult to make assessments at school. Thus, he came up with the idea to find today a smart girl who, naturally, would be forced to help him at school. He chooses a cute but bookish Jane (Alan Austin) and pretends that she really likes her in a sad attempt to make this scheme work. <br /> <br /> This plot, by the way, is not bad and could work even though it looks like an episode from a show like "The Brady Bunch" or the comedy series Nickelodeon. Of course, this is predictable, and you KNOW that the formula will mean that she will eventually learn his plot and be hurt, and he will eventually understand that he really cares about her And by the end of the film everyone will be forgiven and they will to be a real couple. But, given the good acting and competent leadership, it may be worth it to teenage fans, because predictable is not always bad. And as it turned out, it is NOT exactly where the plot went ... but it was terribly close. <br /> <br /> There are a few good things in the movie that I liked. Seeing Tom Bosley and Stella Stevens playing Jane's grandparents was very nice - their role was quite sweet, and it was nice to see them again. Also, the 1970s, made for television movie star Andrew Stevens, appeared in the film - it was nice to see him again - although a part of me hated him, as he looks so great after all these years, and I always look a little out of my 45 years ! He did a great job, and it was nice to see him in the same film as his mother (Stella). <br /> <br /> As far as Carter is concerned, with his many previous television experiences, he was, unsurprisingly, quite good. Although his relationship with Jane didnâ€™t seem very plausible, he and Miss Austin did everything they could. The film was not great, but they really tried, and I think that most of the problems with the film were in writing - with a better and less formal plot, it could work much better. Plus, the whole angle of "test-phobia" seemed rather far-fetched ... and rather insignificant. Who cares if a star of a mega-millionaire starts to worry about passing tests at school ?! In general, not a rotten film, as the current rating implies, although there is not so much to attract a wide audience. People who grew up in love with Carter will surely enjoy the movie. Older people are likely to care less than really young people who probably have not heard of it. For them, the film has no meaning of nostalgia. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie ... Leif Garrett gives Aaron advice. I wanted to shout "do not listen !!" but did not!
