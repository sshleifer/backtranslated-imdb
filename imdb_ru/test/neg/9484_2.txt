Wacky movie, with a wacky storyline. It seems they threw every imaginable cliché into a blender. I especially liked the part where two teenage girls make the French president clean the water. Because we all know how much America is dedicated to environmental protection. Kyoto, anyone ?? And the French chef, who obviously has never seen or tried a hamburger ... That's why people think that Americans have no culture. It is also the fact that we meet with your children when they come to Europe to “see the world” (that is, to eat at McDonalds in foreign capitals). They are not as stupid as the two jerky children in this film, but they have about the same cultural enlightenment and good manners.
