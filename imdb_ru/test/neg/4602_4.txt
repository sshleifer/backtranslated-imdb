Obviously, this film was made for a new generation, which may or may not have an idea about the work of Charles Bukowski. The autobiographical character of Henry Chinaski in the Bukowski stories was brilliantly depicted by Mickey Rourke in 1987 in the movie Dragonfly, also starring Faye Dunaway. Anyone who has seen Factotum should definitely see Barfly in order to better understand how Bukowski wrote his character. “Factotum” lacks the fat semenity of Bukovsky’s script and the fearless hopelessness of his lonely hero. Unintentional humor, which flares up in Shinaski's grim despair of misadventures, does not work for Dillon, as was wonderful for being overweight with dirty, blood-soaked Rourke. Rourke's character transforms the pain and pleasure of the previous night's bad behavior into a place for another horrible, ugly day in the life of a drunken unknown misanthropic writer. Dillon's character misses these marks in favor of a pompous, handsome, relatively neat writer who barely passes at any time in Chinaski's story. The scruffy heroine Dunaway Wanda is the perfect complement to the unhealthy Henry. Women in Factostum cannot hold a candle in front of the “unfortunate goddess” Dunaway, and the use of more polluted sexual themes in Factostum turns out to be a gross distraction than the tip of a hat to a raw and uncompromising image of dysfunctional relationships. I was stunned by how many exactly the same scenes were used in Factotum (Marisa Tomei, who buys all the things and entrusts them to the old man, is an exact copy from Barfly). <br /> <br /> If you want to see the best stories about Bukowski in the film, watch “Barlitz” and “Love is a dog from hell” (also called “Mad love”).
