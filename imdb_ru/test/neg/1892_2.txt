I'm not picky about films, oh, I saw so much shit that I could watch anything. Maybe that's why I watched this to the end. I am also a big fan of role-playing games, but this film is a shame for any self-respecting RPGer. Video recording of the gameplay, made with a security camera, will make it more realistic than this film. Lines, cuts, audio, everything is wrong. In some scenes you can see that it was shot on some photos when !!!!! (spoilers ahead) !!!!! running people do not interfere with people sitting next to computers. I mean, would you continue your work if there were ninjas around you? Oh, and jokes about pirates, this is the worst movie in the movies !!!!! (end of spoilers) !!!!! At least, at first it looked like a documentary, and now it looks like an experiment with a home video. You can find the best movies on YouTube. Bottom line: do not waste your time and money on it, it is as bad as it comes.
