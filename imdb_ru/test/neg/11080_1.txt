Sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says, "stay out of this film." We all need to pay more attention to this little voice. It could be the worst movie I ever enjoyed, or it could be the best reason to remember that your DVD player has a fast-forward button. Made with a budget somewhere around $ 1.99, "The Cave" is obviously a quick, cheap, made to combine a bunch of scary caves, a lot of dark, claustrophobic spellcreens, unknown threats and "Descent". A few years ago there was a similar multitude of similar films that used sea vessels instead of caves. Everybody had scary boats / submarines - a lot of darkness, claustrophobic adventurers, unknown threats ... everything is the same, old. “The Cavern” is really “The Blair Witch Project”, only this time we are lost underground and not lost on it. Add a flashlight with discharged batteries, a cow skull with monster tusks glued onto it, and one of the silliest "turning" climaxes ever put on film. In doing so, let me convince you to listen to me, a quiet voice in your head. I am your friend. I want you to have a happy life. Stay away from this movie.
