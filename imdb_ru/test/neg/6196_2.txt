This film is similar to many “fresh” directors (close-ups and a focus on the emotions experienced by the actors). The essence of the film was presented from many sides and is well expressed by a relatively inexperienced actor. The fact is that "believe in Jesus Christ and the Morman church." Oh, and if you read or hear something contrary to the teachings of the Prophet, it’s just hate. (Fuel for hate)
