As in many films with young children, it all starts with “very cute” and pleasant ... and then, after about half an hour, it becomes the other way around. <br /> <br /> This certainly has a place in this story of time travel (which I usually love), where an adult meets a child who is really eight years old! Great background and great lead actor in Bruce Willis film, but ..... <br /> <br /> Baby Grow is an intelligent and tearful child, and Willis Grow grows up when Russell became abrasive with his constant cry . Is it entertainment? No thanks. <br /> <br /> Young Breslin became a very good child actor, participating in many films, including “The Cat in the Hat,” along with the more famous child actor: Dakota Fanning. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is disappointing, especially with all the good press that this film received when it was released.
