Oh, we ... Park Yurrashika received kormanuiz. As usual, the plot is very thin — from dinosaurs 1 foot high, which weigh 150 pounds and leave more traces than they are, to an inexplicable science that uses lasers to control dinosaurs and birds that have chickens in cages that are large enough for big dogs (I saw chicken coops, they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes). And all this in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of the film. All male actors are weak-minded (thinking that grizzlies can be useless in the desert, constantly throwing objects to kill a predator), and female actors look as if they have just come from a model for Fredrik from Hollywood. The predator itself is the worst thing since the times of the Hobgoblin (from the film of the same name), it looks like they had a version with a hand-made doll and a plastic model for moving frames. If you want a good movie to sit around and go through the MST3K style, it's gold. If you want good filmmaking and good acting ... don't watch Roger Corman’s movie. Acting gets 4 out of 10, some players at this stage tried. Story gets 2 out of 10, it looks like a drunken story-telling session that went bad. Special effects get 2 out of 10, I have seen worse, but not much.
