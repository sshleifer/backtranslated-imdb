I am a big fan of Amy Adams and have been for many years. I'm also a big fan of musicals. That said, this is not a very good film at any level. It's pretty boring, and overall the game is very bad. Amy Adams is embarrassed to watch the act with Scott G. Anderson because she is in another league when it comes to acting. All performances are very amateur. Musical performances are pleasant, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Scott G. Anderson is just a bad actor! I assumed that he was shot in this film because he has a great voice, but this is not the case. He has a middle voice and he sings on the keys, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I think I understand why Amy Adams starred in this film with a vocal that I just didnâ€™t want. I could rant about the other bad elements of this film, but I will leave it at that.
