I love documentaries. They are among my favorite movie genres. Before watching this movie, I did not see one that I didn’t like. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this film is excellent. The performance is well done. In the beginning, I sometimes laughed and smiled. However, with the continuation of the film, he became increasingly tedious and annoying. It could be something special if the subject were not so indistinct, childish, inept pots. I appreciate his passion for the movie, but threw your nagging. If you have little money, you may not need to have many children or spend so much money on alcohol. Perhaps you should go to film school or at least graduate from high school. Perhaps you should live your life and get perspectives and experiences that could add to your vision. <br /> <br /> There are so many people with interesting, funny and sharp stories. Seeing this guy who was chosen for any of them is nothing but nonsense. If you want to make a documentary about the director, why not make a movie about someone from China or Iran, the director, with real problems? <br /> <br /> Two recent questions: <br /> <br /> Who takes the young child to the “Apocalypse Now”? <br /> <br /> How many times did this guy say "man"?
