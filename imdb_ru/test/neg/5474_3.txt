The people of the devil personify what turned out to be one of the last breaths of the occult obsessed horror scene of the 70s shortly before the onset of Halloween, tore up the rule book, set it on fire and kicked it, shouting through a glass window. <br /> In short, a pair of enterprising Greek filmmakers imagines their chances of combining the new film franchise with the incredible double act of the female, wise conversation of the American investigator Milo and the sultry but kind-hearted priest of Father Roche. The exiled nobleman was involved in some satanic poker game, offering the tourists a very disappointing scarecrow of the Minotaur as a sacrifice, and only Milo and Roshe can stop him! <br /> <br /> Or something like that. <br /> <br /> Reality, however, is terribly boring, frustrating, and crammed with missed opportunities. I strongly suspect that beginning filmmakers spent most of the budget on getting Donald Plessaus, Peter Cushing and Brian Eno (for the soundtrack) and hoped that this would be enough to shake the audience in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. Devil people look beautiful with confident, camera work and fantastic locations. Ino's score, although basically it's just one chord drone, which he probably launched in the afternoon, is quite atmospheric, and the film is full of the resounding reckless play of the 70s, including the Australian kind from Fawlty Towers and superstar Jane Lyle of the Island of Death But the positives end there. Cushing mooning on him, looking as if he had a corn-cob in his ass, and Pleasans is trying his best to try, but he still doesn’t work. Worse, Milo's character is terribly fragile and unlikely. Good, so it does not look so good. But from there the film simply refuses to go anywhere. There are hints that the locals are obsessed, but, to be honest, they never do anything except shuffle their eyes with glass eyes. Perhaps they are just tired? As soon as you are sure that something comes to mind, Milo and Roche will ridiculously interrupt the Baron's satanic party with ridiculous ease, sending him to a meeting with his creator. The statue of the minotaur is silent and hey presto! Satan is defeated. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right. <br /> <br /> Reckless optimism that Devil People may be the first of a series of films is finally played up with the last line of Roche's father a few seconds before. ridiculously hasty ending. <br /> <br /> “Who knows Milo? Perhaps one day I can again call upon you to help defeat the Antichrist. ” <br /> <br /> I'm sure you'll call any day, Donald.
