Grande Ecole is not a tricky study of blended sexuality, but, if you need it, a movie for an X-rated channel. Although I suspect there is nothing in this movie that could spoil a willing viewer, the plot is just an excuse male and female and male connections, taking place in an unconvincing context of competition between the Paris school for future leaders and the main school for those who want to get a higher education in the humanities. Similarly, there is a cultural clash between French youth with high and low status, as well as social conflict with the participation of indigenous French and Arab immigrants from North Africa. All that is missing is a woman-to-woman communication, which could be easily organized with nothing more than a small twist in the plot. <br /> <br /> Acts on a slightly higher level than in a regular pornographic film - but “Grande Ecole” is, to be blunt about it, no more pornography with artistic aspirations. I am not offended by sex. It is simply repeated and, soon, boring. Where is Heys's office when you really need it?
