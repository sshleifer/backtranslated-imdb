A cheap and joyless film about robberies with poor performance, a lot of picky emotions (for example, “Chau Yun Fat” in “Better Tomorrow”) and some cheesy cliches thrown at an abandoned factory, ready for several bad judo videos played by John Even squibs look awful. At no stage of the proceedings is this similar to America. Three old winchesters don't make a country. The Mustang even has a shaky right front wheel. The plot, as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like killing mercy. It could not come soon enough. Even jewelry from a robbery looks like the cheapest jewelry from junk. The terrible dialogue and hopeless replay of all those who were shot, complement the real waste of time and space. Worth a look if you want to know how not to make a low-budget movie cliché.
