It was hard for me to sit through it. Every turn and predictability is predictable. You're sitting there just waiting for it ... waiting for it ... and yes, there it is! As you predicted at the very beginning of the film. Or 10 minutes. And so on. <br /> <br /> Smart letter? Not. <br /> <br /> Torture porn? No, there is no nudity. Other reviews call this torture porn, most likely written by people on hard drugs. Unfortunately, there is no torture and nudity (yes, no nudity). <br /> <br /> There is no expectation in this thriller. The only good part of this movie is the ending, but I'm not going to spoil it. <br /> <br /> I give him 2/10. 1/10 is going to be a terrible B-movie. In this film is better to play.
