Hercules fell into the same category as many promising television productions, which could become really cool classics just to become a sad joke. <br /> <br /> I really like Kevin Sorbo and his supporting cast, but I donâ€™t care about the direction the show took, as their film equivalents also. I believe that the show would have been much more successful if they kept the same format as for the films. <br /> <br /> I looked at the beginning and lost interest along the way. Subsequently, I ran into a strange episode, but my attention was focused on bringing it to a commercial break.
