Most of the comments on this film are positive, so I decided to try to restore the balance. I came out of this film, wondering what was going on. Now I know and still think this is a bad movie. I initially devalued the sequence of dreams, because it seemed too obvious. I was glad that I had a free movie ticket, or I would have asked for my money back. Reviews and critics of the film love this film, and this only confirms to me that most of them prefer to sound smarter than tell how viewers can enjoy the film. 8+ rating of this film is misleading. After 20 years, this film does not compare with these great people, such as the Godfather. The film does have good performances from both presenters, but this is not enough to save the film. (and not lesbian scenes!)
