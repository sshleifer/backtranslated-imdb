Not being a fan of westerns, I watched it primarily because I wanted to see Lucille Ball in something else other than the role of "I love Lucy" or "Lucy Shaw." Here she plays Kristin Larson, a salon owner in Arizona in 1868, who is going to marry an unscrupulous local Indian agent (Dina Jagger). Ball's game was fine — nothing more; she didn't blow me up. For me, this turned out to be successful, since this role was very different from the one I used to see her - there was very little outrageous physical comedy, which she later became famous, although the film tried to maintain a softly funny feeling everywhere. (The typical funny line is “there are two ways to deal with women - and no one knows any of them!”) I did not find the whole story so convincing, although I appreciated that the Indians were shown as victims by an Indian agent. There are typical shooting and lots of horses - in other words, your typical western. As for Christina, we can guess from the very beginning how her planned marriage will end; it's just a question of how she gets there. If you like westerns, it will be pretty typical with the addition of humor. If you are not big in the genre, this will be missed. I'm not big in the genre. 3/10
