Jeff Fahey has such watchful eyes and a vague, insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous; therefore, it’s really impossible to call him a good guy, the audience is just waiting for his character to split and start to hit people. Drew Barrymore, who just performed her famous role as “Poison Ivy,” was supposed to make this film just as a favor to director Phadon Papamikael (he was a filmmaker on Ivy); playing a character named Daisy Drew (!), she immediately ran into him, which is why we have no one to look at except Jeff Fahey and Shaun Young (who didn’t have a single thin moment on the camera since “Blade Runner "). This meaningless script by Michael Angeli relates to a police sketch artist who draws his wife's face from the testimony of a murder witness, and although this is not a bad idea to plot, he will be much better suited for an hour-long television series. This television film lacks inspiration (starting with the casting) and shorter surprises. * from ****
