“The Tragic Hero” is a film that definitely tries to imitate the classic film “The Godfather”, paying particular attention to family, crime, loyalty and revenge. In addition, this is part of a two-part series, as was the Godfather (at the time). However, this film is far from the level of these classic films and actually looks worse than the other Triad thrillers released at the time in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons is acting. With the exception of Chow Yun Fata, acting is usually incredible and unbelievable. The audience tends to find the hearing humorous simply because the inability of the actors to maintain any degree of seriousness. As a result, we find the film is not too emotional or emotional, because we don’t really care what happens to these characters. <br /> <br /> Another reason is lack of attention. The narrative tries to incorporate many different plot elements into the film, but this leads to parts of the film becoming underdeveloped and also lacking a real sense of coherence. The spectators are sometimes lost in the process that we watch, not knowing what the character’s motives are. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film really is a decent shootout, but again, since we are not interested in characters, we don’t care who lives or who dies; The scene loses its intensity and intensity because of this. Other action-plots are rather mundane in nature, with the feeling that they are too manageable, and not freely flowing. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is strictly average and not recommended for the general film. viewer ... Only fans of the hard genre and Chow Yun Fat fans can view this movie for viewing.
