I'm not sure that this film could ever correspond to the first one, even if it appeared in the original seven (despite the fact that four were killed). It just has no spark and chemistry. All the actors look tired and look like they are just trying to get paid. <br /> <br /> It is interesting how Yul Brynner is "magnificent" in the original film, but cruel and unconvincing in this sequel. However, when he appeared in Westworld and Futureworld in the 1970s, his character (in identical black pants, shirt and hat) raises the same mystery and presence in the 1960 film as Chris Adams. <br /> <br /> This is nothing 1966 to watch, even by cable.
