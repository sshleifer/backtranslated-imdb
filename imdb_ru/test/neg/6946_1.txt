This film is not even suitable for a $ 1 store in a grocery store. <br /> <br /> I only bought it because Terrence Howard was there. I think he could not be too choosy about his roles at this time. <br /> <br /> The film itself was hard to live through. They seemed to cling to a straw with a plot. The Party of Guys was supposed to be the most boring thing I've ever seen. In one minute they talk, and in the next they read verses? Even the arguments were hard to follow. Most actors lacked depth. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what they were aiming for with this, but they definitely didnâ€™t hit the target.
