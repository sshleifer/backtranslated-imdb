The film quickly gets to the main stage of persecution with ever-increasing destruction. The first really bad thing - the guy hijacking Steven Seagal would have been beaten to a pulp by driving Seagal, but that would probably put an end to the whole premise of the film. <br /> <br /> It seems that they decided to make all kinds of changes in the plot of the film, so just plan to enjoy the action, and do not expect a consistent plot. Reverse any sense of logic that you have, it will reduce your chances of getting a headache. <br /> <br /> I really hope that Steven Seagal is trying to return to the type of characters that he has portrayed in his more popular films.
