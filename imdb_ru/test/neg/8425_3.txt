After reading so many vivid stories “Serving them all my days,” I went out and bought it for Christmas. I'm afraid a waste of money. I was looking forward to something in the same league as Return to Brideshead, and several other great productions of British television, but this is definitely not one of them. <br /> <br /> The characters are too good to be true, tied up on a very predictable plot and with the most banal and conspicuous script I've ever heard. Yes, he has his moments, but they are very thin on earth. The lead actor is interesting, mainly because of his strange resemblance to Anthony Andrews (Sebastian in "Brideshead"), only dark. But his undoubted talents are wasted on a character who is unbearably important and picky. His barbiness is explained by the effects of his experience on the Somme during the First World War. He makes early episodes centered around his nervous state, better than he plays later in the insanely pure, socialist virtue. <br /> <br /> Women are absolutely incredible, as in unreal. His first wife is annoyingly vigorous and cheerful, a girl, a perfect sophisticated whore, and the last lady is a jumble of political nonsense. The most interesting characters are Howarth (Alan MacNoton) and one of the other masters, named Hobart, I forget the name of the actor. <br /> <br /> The arrogant script preaching is typical of Andrew Davis, the writer. , in his early years, and becomes tedious during the first two episodes (this mini-series is 11 episodes long!). For episode 4, I just wanted to go through the damn thing. <br /> <br /> The music is equally tedious, basically it consists of one melodious piano melody and choral performed by the guys during the credits. No cost was spent on location settings, which gives some visual relief in other ways with the painful viewing. <br /> <br /> I like stories of this kind, as a rule, and I am very disappointed with the wondrous nature of this series. If you want to see something exciting about World War I and its consequences, there are many other more beautiful cars that can be rented or bought. One of them comes to mind - the 1998 Unknown Soldier. The characters in this performance in “The Masterpiece of the Theater” are real and fascinating and touching, in contrast to the two-dimensional dolls in the movie “Serve them all my days”. Regarding movies about boys' schools, stick to "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" or "Tom Brown's School Years." <br /> <br /> I know that this is contrary to the overall favorable view of this mini-series, but I strongly recommend that you think twice before offering Acorn Media $ 80.00 for their set of 4 DVDs, 2 of which on My set had insurmountable problems with freezing and skipping.
