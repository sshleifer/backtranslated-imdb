My God. They started with such a huge potential - a bunch of pretty girls from the women's society, walking almost naked, a check. Then to the bar where the 80's cheese turns into a label, check. Next morning, go to the state forest park, check. A group of girls and their professor, hooligan bikers, a guy from a department store and that dud of them live, acting like a local drunk - makes for a good counting, checking (and speaking of counting, notice the strong similarity on the DVD cover for a foreign horror film - Body Count! Aka Camping del Terrore). A strange Indian in the forest performs some kind of ritual, hmmm, well, I will let him slide, check it out. And then, oh brother, everything from there down. Terrible. The head of a monster of Lochnes in a pond made me go berserk.
