I really liked the Millennium series, in which Lance Henriksen starred, so I bought this movie. Obviously, at some level it was a mistake. Mutant / Monster films are usually very bad, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> The main idea itself was not completely failed (but, nevertheless, this film would never have been successful, even with a good director and actors), but as it turned out, this is just a B-class film. Scenes that should be scary seem to me more ridiculous, and the creatures are not credible. <br /> <br /> However, watching this movie with a group of friends in a hectic mood makes this movie as bright as it is. unintentionally funny.
