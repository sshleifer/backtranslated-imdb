Oh, another movie with motorcycles, a detachment of angels of hell and Steve Lame, as a not very cool car driver. This film does not rely on history, but it drinks a lot, smokes weed and a lot of retarded actions. Steve's performance of a dying cat during his serenade "I love what I know" made me vomit for several hours. Bicycle chick Linda (rrrr) figured out with all! Fats played better than anyone, because he only grunts and makes sounds. I also dare to try to understand what Banjo says. "You spoil the private stock." This is the writers. <br /> <br /> I liked the final. What could be better than a climax than a lighthouse! You must see this to hate. <br /> <br /> Die Jeter, Die !!!
