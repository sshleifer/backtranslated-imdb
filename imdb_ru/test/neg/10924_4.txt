Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. Animation and voice acting were ideal for this type of film. <br /> <br /> For the first 20 minutes of this film I laughed out loud; mostly in concept. After that, the joke became thinner. In a 15-20 minute animated short film, Lil Pimp would be a classic. Instead, this film consists entirely of one joke, which lasts too long. <br /> <br /> The weather, voiced by the ridiculous, has some rough and amusing one-line texts. Unfortunately, this is all that the boy's house rat is good for, since he no longer contributes anything to history. In the end, I felt so bored with his remarks, as well as the rest of this film. <br /> <br /> I’m a big fan of South Park and other adult animation movies. I also play several online pimp games, so I'm not indifferent to stories about pimps. The transition from a little boy to a little pimp was brilliant; but after that, history and dialogue became redundant and predictable. <br /> <br /> I give this film five points. It is worth watching the great concept and voice acting. Just don’t expect much else, otherwise you’ll be very disappointed.
