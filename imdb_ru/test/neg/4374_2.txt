Chuck Norris acts as Danny, the policeman who killed the awkward serial killer, however, when this killer escapes, Danny knows that he is the only one who can stop the terror. However, Danny is fraught with secrets, he knows that the arrest was terrible, and even more luck is that Danny survived, the final battle is now underway, but is Danny ready? Immediately in my description tells what the problem of this film. Norris plays a stupid hero who is still suffering from psychological trauma. In the hands of the best actor, this concept would be interesting and could be a great thriller. In the hands of the Norris thriller, it just makes him ridiculous and hopelessly unerotic. Also on board are Steve James from American Ninjas and Ron O'Neill from Superfly, but any attempt at character development is defeated by a cruel script. In addition, there are almost no actions here, and I have always preferred the Norris film, in which there are more fights and fewer conversations. Given the ranking on this site, I should not be alone. <br /> <br /> * of 4- (Bad)
