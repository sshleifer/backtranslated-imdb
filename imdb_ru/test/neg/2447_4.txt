The standard film "Outbreak of disease in a remote area; The expert who is in the area takes the responsibility. ” There are only a few deviations from the norm. One of them is that the children were quite reasonable from the very beginning. Usually they are monsters who repeatedly glue together the works, until at the end they redeem themselves. Another reason is that the local healer / sorcerer, who is usually an early obstacle, will never be completely discounted or redeemed at the end. Perhaps, since this seems to have been done for the faith-oriented channel PAX, they did not want to seem too biased towards believers. Finally, there were no evil local politicians / entertainment industry jokes trying to hide it all. The absence of these stereotypes was refreshing — if we have the PAX channel to thank for it, I might have to try a few more of their suggestions. Besides this, however, this was a fairly standard material. You have seen it all before.
