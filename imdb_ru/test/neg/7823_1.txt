Not just the money we paid to rent it or actually go to the movies. I'm talking about how big production companies spend so much money on things that are really boring, and do not talk about absurdity. With the millions that they usually made in the movies, because I don’t think that the actors here will work for free or for a small amount. For this money, imagine how many good independent films you could make, or maybe one good Hollywood film. It's just to snatch you, but not anyone, just the majority of teens who want to go and watch Ashton Kutcher’s film, simply because they are his fans. I really do not know how anyone with common sense can actually act in such a film. If you look at it in perspective, the actors are of the same quality as this film. So I would not be surprised, in fact, I could not expect more.
