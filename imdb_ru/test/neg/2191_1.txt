I read all the other comments that made this movie a great movie. I have not seen anything about the superiority that was claimed. I thought it was long and boring. I tried to watch it twice. The first time I fell asleep, and the second time I got to six minutes after the end and gave up. I believe that it was my fault with great anticipation, but I do not think that this would completely destroy the film for me. The film was just soft. It was nothing exciting or unique. The plot was not half bad, the sequence of actions was not, the dialogue was imposed, and the film went on forever. I would not recommend watching this movie.
