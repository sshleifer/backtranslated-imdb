I've been waiting for this movie since Lost World came out. It didn’t bother me that “The Lost World” wasn’t as intelligent as the original, and here I was just hoping for a good monster movie. It was all about "Dinosaurs eating people." However, even at this level it was disappointing. <br /> <br /> For a start, there were not enough people to eat, and although I would keep it secret how many people ate, it was not enough. In addition, although there was no lack of diversity in the dinosaur community, there were almost no dinosaurs. And many dinosaurs, such as the Speak-back-and-has-baton-on-tail osaurus, simply made cameos and didn’t really think about how cool they were. <br /> <br /> (START SPOILERS) Then there were pterodactyls. The numbers I read rated their weight at about 15 pounds, while the film made them look closer to 300. Worse, they couldn't eat anyone or even splash them on the rocks, dropping them from a height. There was no end to the end of the film either, it was just unexpected loans. (END OF SPOILERS) I wonder if there was a 40-minute film in the edition in which I had seen. <br /> <br /> My only conclusion is that they taught pterodactyls to slip their long beaks imperceptibly into your pockets and get your $ 7 rental Carnosaur series; at least you will not be disappointed.
