I argued between this film and 2012, but I chose Inglourious Basterds because of its surprisingly high IMDb rating. I must say now, what a disappointment. I expected a certain amount of unwarranted violence, but I also expected many witty dialogues. I received a huge dose of the first, but not enough last. I felt cheated. The relationship between violence and plot is very important, and I think this is completely wrong in this film. And the plot? This is so believable or really all this interesting. Save your time and money. I can not believe that this rating speaks of the bloody and cruel tastes of the modern masses.
