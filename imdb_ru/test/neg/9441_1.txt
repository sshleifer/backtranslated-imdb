This film has absolutely no redemptive qualities. It’s not even worthy of being in the “so bad, it's good” category — it's just bad. He acted badly, shot poorly, wrote poorly, poorly directed, terrible sound recording, and everything is just incredibly amateur. I do not know how it got release. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone PLEASE tell the lead actress that if you play “crazy people” it doesn’t mean that you have to mess around with your hair all the time - in a film that usually caused irritation, was probably one of the most annoying things of all. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I think this is the only film ever shown by a Nazi hijacker ...
