Poor Casper Van Dien, his career went far away from Tarzan and the star paratroopers. <br /> <br /> In “Meltdown,” he is a police officer who happens to meet television journalist Stephanie von Pfeten, and her brother is a scientist who is trying to deal with a quick comment on Earth. But in the runaway business, even a small blunder causes some real problems as the Earth’s orbit fails. <br /> <br /> From the survival of the Earth, we are going to the survival of Van Ding and his immediate family. , Ryan McDonell, the boyfriend of his gangster daughters, actually turns out to be useful, especially when he suspects that the guy he knows as a crooked cop could do a lot of harm to Van Dien’s group. <br /> <br /> My only question is here. Why did they not have Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton and the rest of the crew to cope with the unpleasant comet? <br /> <br /> Pass it on to people.
