I find it surprising that so many people (probably Poles) voted for this film, who gave him such marks (mostly dozens). Well, the film was good, funny, but on the other hand, nothing special. The only good thing about Kiler is dialogues that are not all-inclusive for non-Polish. The script is primitive, acting (with the exception of Jerzy Stuhr in the role of Fish) - is terrible. This is too much ado about nothing - fortunately, it is not in the top 250. P.S. The sequel "Kilerow 2-och" ("2 Kilers") is on the way, and this is exactly the same story.
