If you have never read a book and are not going to read it in the future, keep watching the movie (6/10). This is a good fantasy film with well-made computer graphics, good acting, beautiful setting and fantastic above average story. <br /> <br /> If you read a book like me, about 10 times or more, and you really like it, don't expect too much (or better: don't expect anything at all). The story is completely different from the original book. This may explain that 1/10 of people from 40 or more (like me) voted for the film, and much better from people who, most likely, have never read the book before and therefore do not expect anything. <br /> <br /> Most of the differences between the film and the book are not really needed and change the setting (in my opinion, much worse): <br /> <br /> - The magic in the book works with rituals for classical magic effects. (Changing the weather, creating illusions, turning into animals, ...) In the film, magic looks more like a “Jedi school for the Middle Ages” (TM) (wooden sticks instead of lightsabers). The fact that the devil is similar to Emperor Palpatine (after Part III) does not really make him better. <br /> <br /> - The mill in the book is not completely cut off from the world, as in the film. The book tells the story of Dresden, which Krabat visits once with his teacher, and he also visits some nearby villages to celebrate. (This part could be changed to cut costs.) I also don’t understand why in the film the mill is on the hills and the nearby cemetery is in the high mountains. <br /> <br /> - The whole environment is the usual mill of medieval fantasy style. Everywhere dirt, dirty faces, not a neat kitchen, only very rough houses. The book never offered such an environment. <br /> <br /> - In the book, the master tries to make Krabat his successor, but Krabat rejects. Krabat lies somewhere between admiration, distance and quiet rejection. In the film, Krabat rejects the master always openly, as a stubborn schoolboy. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in 1647, not in 1720. Because of this, the master cannot tell some stories from his youth, probably around 170x. Well, the stories are missing in the film anyway. <br /> <br /> Also, some explanations given in the book would be useful and would not cost so many minutes: <br /> <br /> - In the book, all the work done during the day does not require effort, and work at night - this is a normal job. This explanation is not in the film. Sometimes boys sweat, and sometimes they are happy. <br /> <br /> - The book explains why only a few Gezellen try to resist the master: if the master dies for some mundane reason, release Geselen and save your magical powers. If the master dies in opposition, everyone will lose their power forever.
