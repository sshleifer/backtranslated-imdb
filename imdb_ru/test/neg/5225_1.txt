I gave this movie a rating of 1, because it is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This film was shot in 2003, and I saw films of the 60s with the best special effects. I would like to go into details, but the words can not describe how shoddy this film was. I could have done better with a home camcorder and 20 dollars! I pray that Chuck Norris will never make a movie again. Now, if you think that I am shooting this film because it has a Christian theme, you are mistaken. I like the fact that I.L. Chuck decided to make a film that at least tried to make God look good, but why did he make such bad viewers like me suffer from such a crappy movie? This whole film can be described in three words: DRAW DICUL.
