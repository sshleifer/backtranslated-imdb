I really do not know why I am writing this. I think most people agree that this film is bad. Well, let me say this: <br /> <br /> When I first finish watching movies, I like them. Then, over time, my opinion about the film changes. it happened with End of Days. I liked it when I first saw it. I thought it was interesting. But after a few weeks, my opinion changed. So, to solve this problem, I looked at it again in the house of friends. Well, this is bad. <br /> <br /> I am a logical person. If I see a logical hole in a movie, I try to ignore it. If I see two, then I get annoyed. More than two, and I'm cleaning. End of Days made me forget after the second viewing. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the film is a bit depressing. Everything about it is sad. Everything from the acting skills of Arnold to the colors of the film. But dark movies don't bother me, but something else helped ... <br /> <br /> If Satan can regenerate his wounds, how can you kill him in his mortal form? If you shoot him, his skin grows back. If you cut off his head, the new one must jump out. So the question is: what's the point of even trying to kill him? I will tell you why: because this is a stupid film that has a reworked villain. This is not the devil, my friends. This is a man resembling those villains of Bond who hand out the whole scheme to the heroes. <br /> <br /> As I said, it’s worth a look, but I don’t see it twice, because it's crap.
