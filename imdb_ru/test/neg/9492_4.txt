Douglas Sirk’s inaugural “female picture” weeping towards Universal, based on the unpardonable preaching, dogmatic, didactic novel by Lloyd S. Douglas (author of this other favorite shit, * The Robe *). Rock Hudson in the role that catapulted him to fame is played by Bob Merrick, a drunken playboy who costs innumerable millions and is more interested in chasing skirts and speedboats than in obtaining a medical degree. In the first scene, he destroys his boat on a beautifully photographed lake. The accident nearly killed Merrick, and therefore he needed a rather mysterious "resuscitation machine" to support him. .. Meanwhile, the beloved surgeon Dr. Phillips throughout the city, finally, was dead with a heart. Since the local hospital can only support one resuscitator at a time, Phillips dies so that the louse can live. When Merrick finds out about this, he tries to apologize to the Phillips family, especially to the widow (Jane Wyman, her hair brushed and dressed in the highest hope), but in fact anyone and everyone who knew the surgeon spits on Merrick, like a cobra brace. One doctor from the hospital staff even calls it a “complete waste” of the fact that he was a playboy instead of a surgeon like Christ. Hippocrates might have something to say about it! <br /> <br /> In these early scenes you will find typical Sirkian iconoclasm: the director rubs his face in the troubles of the middle class, mid-century America, who finds himself rooting for the playboy from nowhere to put the cushions of a parrot under the pranks of these moral hypocrites . But, alas, no: the destructive plot of the novel should go on, and Merrick soon finds himself turned by God under the guise of puffing Otto Kruger, an artist who claims that Phillips made him the best man and even the best artist. (Why do we not see any of this amazing art?) We learn that the unbearably ubiquitous Dr. Phillips would often refuse to pay for the medical services provided (although it was never clear who exactly had the right to these “magnificent exceptions”). This should give our hero a completely new outlook on life and an example of personal behavior. Kruger is even trying to make it all sound very illegally exciting: “As soon as you start this thing, nothing will come of it! It's an obsession ... A SUPERMATIC obsession! ”So Merrick tries it again, pestering a widow with apologetic overtures, but he somehow makes her knock her car down. She loses her eyesight. Apparently, Merrick will have a few more points of intersection to pass by before he can be considered a decent guy. <br /> <br /> But Sirk continues to sneak in his revenge, even when the film is becoming more and more moral. The most obvious point should be the presence of Agnes Moorehead as the head nurse of the hospital, the friend of Wyman and the unresponsive lover of lesbians. Notice the disappointment on Moorhead's face when Merrick, finally redeemed as a doctor, appears to save Wyman's life near the end. The homosexuality of Hudson himself, who at the time was a secret in Hollywood, also brings a great ironic effect. He and Wyman - Doudi and fifteen years older - generate absolutely zero erotic heat in their scenes together, which, by the way, are purposefully small, presumably because any other scenes between the stars hopelessly expose the whole enterprise. (We are sure of one thing: if Rock Hudson was obsessed with something, then this is, of course, not Jane Weiman.) This is a chronic case of “Tea and Sympathy”. Sirk seemed to like to correct his noses by the fact that this gay actor, who was attractive to innocent women of that era, coolly drifted through these elegantly colored “female pictures”. In fact, the director worked with Hudson 6 or 7 more times to achieve the best effect in the continuation of this film “Everything that allows heaven”, which beat Hudson with Wyman, but was also accompanied by a realistic storyline. In Obsession, meanwhile, we must endure how God / Kruger favorably looks from the observation window to Merrick and his medical team as they prepare to save Weiman’s life, in tandem with notes of swollen vocals from the raw Hollywood choir. <br /> <br /> But in order to understand why Sirk is considered an author, look at the scene in which Wyman explains to her adult daughter that she can distinguish day from night. Here the whole frame turns black: the daughter is barely visible, and Waiman’s face looms faintly against a background of weak light. She goes on to say that she hates the night, because "I know that dawn will never come again." A great, frightening moment that deserves a much better movie than “Magnificent Obsession.” <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of 10.
