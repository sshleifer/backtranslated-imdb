I thought it was an incredibly boring movie! I heard that the director cannot speak French, so he left his actors to tell what they wanted ... Well, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi, as usual, is great, but I can't say the same about other actors. They have nothing to say, especially Bruno Todeschini. <br /> <br /> They all seem very tired, this is one of the plot of the film: tired of being together, living abroad, living as a whole; so they spend half the movie sleeping in a hotel room. After a while I felt sleepy ... <br /> <br /> I gave 4 because of some very beautiful scenes, including the last one.
