Like most viewers of this film, I am an avid reader of books. In the first two films, the main characters were Buck, Ray and Chloe, but in the second sequel they play a minor role in the presidential efforts of Louis Gossett. "World at War" is based on his meeting with Buck in a series of books. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this film is as terrible as the first two. Amanda appears out of nowhere and suddenly plays an important role (I will not disclose her if someone else has not read the series). Other illogical traits I really really want Cloud 10 to make a good film “Left from behind,” but unfortunately it looks like the bad first 2 in all respects.
