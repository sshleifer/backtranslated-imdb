“The horrors of the masters: sounds like this” happen in Seattle, where Larry Pierce works as a manager at a computer software call center, losing his 6-year-old son Michael (Nicholas Elijah) because of a rare heart disease, which, in his opinion, has hypersensitive hearing. Larry hears it ten times: from people typing on computer keyboards, people whispering around the room, people tapping on the floor with their feet, dripping taps, and eventually even people breathing become unbearable for Larry because he is constantly bombarded by shrill noise. In the end, Larry decides that there is enough of him, and if he cannot stop the noise himself, then perhaps he can stop hearing them with the help of big smart meat ... <br /> <br /> This is a joint production in Canada and America had the 4th episode of the second season of the popular TV series “Masters of Horror,” written and directed by Brad Anderson. It seemed to me that “Sounds Like” - a certain Miss Scenario was based on the story of Mike O'Driscoll, and I am genuinely surprised by the number of very positive comments he has here on IMDb at the moment, for a start it would be very difficult for me even to describe it like a horror movie, and it's more like a weird, sentimental drama, until the last 5 minutes, when Howard Berger, Gregory Nicotero and the guys from KNB effects really get to work. Larry has this strange, inexplicable ability to amplify sound and noise from the beginning, so this episode ends with 55 minutes of exactly the same repetitive buildup that leads to a bloody ending, although it's too late to save the episode. It is rather slow, and although it is well written, is it not to be a topic of horror, and I am a little puzzled by who it should appeal to? <br /> <br /> Directed by Anderson copes, but he just keeps repeating the same thing over and over again until there is a single drop of blood in the last 5 minutes. There are no horrors, no fear, no tension and absolutely no atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Technically, this is very well done, has good performance and does not look like a cheap program created for television. Acting is actually very good, and it's a pity that the story is somewhat limited. <br /> <br /> Sounds like, this is one of the worst episodes of “The Masters of Horror”, many people like it, and this is normal, but it is definitely not for me. Another Master of Horror, another disappointment.
