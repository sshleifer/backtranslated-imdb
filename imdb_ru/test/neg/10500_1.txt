I usually do not give films "1". Although I am a ruthless critic, I try to find everything that makes a film worthy of attention (that is, watchable). The main thing I'm looking for is a consistent plot. If it has this one, I can watch it! Let me start by saying that it doesn’t even deserve to be called a movie, it’s more like a primary school project ... terribly wrong! And I saw every sci-fi film that ever was filmed. <br /> <br /> I read reviews by professional critics many times, which said: “This was done for television ... (and so on and so forth),” and I continued to say, “Yes Okay, I wish they would think about REAL criticism. ” Well, this is worse ... much worse! This is really the worst “thing” I’ve seen that lasted throughout the entire film (if I REALLY thought it was a film, it would be my new worst film of all time), and I’ve seen every movie shot by Uwe Boll! This movie makes Uwe Boll look like Francis Ford Coppola! :) I would prefer to watch Jaw Revenge all day, and then look again ... even 5 minutes ... there was one good scene, and that was the END! ;-P Good enough, beating the works of Ron Hall, now for serious criticism. <br /> <br /> The script is poorly written, the dialogue is made in a wooden manner, the effects are more pleasant than in the Power Rangers show, and do not even turn me on to transitions of increasing the scale of the screen (ugh). Someone actually watched this thing, edited it, and then said, “OK, let it go”? I'd rather burn it than let out! In conclusion, all I can say is: “Thank God, DVD and VHS players have a Stop and Eject function!” My advice ... don't give it up, if you do, you will be glad that you also stopped thrown away! :)
