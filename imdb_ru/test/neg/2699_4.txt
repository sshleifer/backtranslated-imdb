I went to watch “Coming Out” with high hopes, because the directorial “Shower” made such an impression on me. Despite several failures in the makeup, “Souls” ranks first on my list of the most beloved films in the entire history of insight into family relationships and, as a rule, a great game and direction. And I have seen it at least three times. <br /> <br /> But “Leave”, in my estimation, did not work out. It seemed like a meaningless exercise, and I was so tired of the unbearable personality of the main character that I could not wait to finish the film. I confess that I fell asleep six or seven times, but it was only a few seconds at a time, so I think it’s still ok to write this comment. <br /> <br /> I admired my parents and sister. The way to use all the real characters in the movie is good because I have never seen it before. <br /> <br /> In addition to disappointment, I will still try to see any film with the name Yang Zhang, simply on the basis of the beautiful “soul”.
