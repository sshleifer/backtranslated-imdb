This is a completely average film with several semi-serial combat episodes that make the plot a little better and remind the viewer of the classic Van Dame films. parts of the plot are meaningless and seem to be added to use the time. the final plot is a very simple type that does not force the viewer to guess, and any turns are obvious from the very beginning. The final scene with jar backs does not make sense because they are added and seem to have little to do with the Van Dam character story. In fact, you should not look again, a little disappointed in the final production, although it is obvious that it was shot with a small budget, some frames and fragments of the film are of poor quality.
