I work at Memorial Hermann Hospital (TMC), and also work at the Texas Children's Hospital, Women's Hospital and West Houston during Allison. First hospital shots are sadly suburban. Texas Medical Center has a daily population density similar to Wall Street !! There are huge skyscrapers, professional buildings and hospitals. TCH was the largest children's hospital before it doubled, TWICE! Methodist, with its 1,500 beds, is one of the largest hospitals in the world. The skyline of the Texas Medical Center is larger than that of Memphis. However, the best photos that Hollywood could collect were some kind of crap hospital in the middle of nowhere (except for the real hospital photo taken a decade ago). In addition, they combined several real characters and portrayed them all in one (super-nurse). I actually know a medical technologist working in a blood bank. Two of them actually work at that time, but only one pregnant MT is shown in the film. There was a pregnant MT and another MT, which took rolodex antibodies to precious patients (the alloantibody study for more information). I will not mention their names (confidentiality). In real life, the laboratory was not a nurse. Hollywood combined these two technologies (most likely to save time and money). In the film, military helicopters (the truth) were supposed to deliver our children (NICU and PICU) to UTMB right up to Galveston! Why can you ask when we have the largest children's hospital right down the street? Because Texas Children's Hospital refused to accept them. You read it right, they are REFUSED !!! Working with them, I was ashamed. Needless to say, I am no longer associated with this facility. Any other comments will repeat comments already posted by people who actually live here or have experienced.
