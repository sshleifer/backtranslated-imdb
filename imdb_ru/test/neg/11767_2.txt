If you can come to terms with this, this movie should make you laugh a few times. At least for me. I will mention only one of my favorite elements: “underwater shots” of “fish”, “swimming”. The sound that accompanies these shots is also great. <br /> <br /> One final note: William Catt is actually quite a decent actor. I hope he gets another day in the sun; To look at him as the “Greatest American Hero” was a funny part of my childhood a couple of decades ago, and has not been seen since. He seemed a bit depressed in this film. Someone will give him a fun job at a good show or something like that.
