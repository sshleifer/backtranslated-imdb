Before going further, I must admit that I only saw the first episode of this show. If I had time, I could watch it every week, at least to see how the season ended. However, from the very beginning it was clear to me that the version of Martha Stewart's “Pupil” simply “does not fit”. Martha Stewart made a career as a happy housewife, homemade diva, like Oprah Winfrey and Julia Child. Only after her scandalous legal problems and subsequent imprisonment did her public image reflect the true rudeness of her character. Of course, she was irresistible for a while, and this entire series raises an interesting question about what it means to be a woman in business. Should it be cold and hard? Shouldn't she? <br /> <br /> But the truth is that by the time Stewart came out of prison, her attempts at public return, although justified, had never intended to capture the interest of the audience for a very long time. Perhaps the true return would have worked if she had returned home peacefully and waited a year or so after her often outraged ankle bracelet had been removed. Instead, she frantically dived with two episodes at the same time, the other - her syndicated daytime series “Martha”, very similar to her old show, but more massive, with such famous guests as Bette Midler. Of course, even at its peak, Stuart has never been mainstream, so it’s too much to ask the American audience to immediately accept her foray into a reality show. Maybe America wants Stewart to come back on her own, and not become a reason for her. <br /> <br /> The show was basically a tired repetition of Trump's “Disciple”, which still interests me, depending on the tasks, the cast and Trump’s dismissal (often controversial - probably for this reason) . The letter was, of course, not cliché, but at least disgusting. The fact that Stewart never says: “You are fired!” - mentioned on the bulletin board on this site - this is especially upsetting. Producer Mark Burnett should be admired for being honest with Stuart's imprisonment when he tries to make her a hero, but the truth is that anyone who looks can say that she is basically trying to show his pretty businesswoman. And again, Stuart has never been given due attention, he lacks the pleasantness and recognition of Oprah Winfrey, as well as the remarkable, charismatic "resilience" of Donald Trump. Yes, it may be a tendentious assessment of her character, but I mean that it is more about the nature of her business. <br /> <br /> Stuart was not fired, but I wonder if they really always wanted this to last only one season?
