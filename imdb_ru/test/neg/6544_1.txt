This low-budget indie film redefines the word "bla." Most of all it will surprise that this word can really be found in the dictionary, defined as “nonsense ... uninteresting, boring, lifeless.” The film redefines this word because I would have to add to these four words: “PC crap”, “pretentiously at a miserable level” and “meaningless”. <br /> <br /> The film is trying so hard to be "" and "in touch" with the modern behavior of beautiful people who are fighting for what I say and "think" (do they think?). There is almost no plot to talk about, although there is one to sleep on. The most charming and politically correct things about this are how a white woman befriends a young black stallion, a black street saxophonist with a penchant for very wise advice and advice, and a fat black psychic. Isn't it great how races can eventually get along? ... Ahhh ... In the end, a woman reads "poetry", which is nothing more than one of her boring "dear diary" entries. She gets a standing ovation (!!!), although in real life her listeners would most likely not fall asleep in a deep sleep. But this film has little to do with real life, although this is where it should occur. In real life, her reading of “poetry” would have received applause only if it made sense to include juicy, sexy details. "And then I rubbed his huge cock on a sweaty, impatient pink little vagina ..." Hooray! Worse, the main actress has a dozen scenes in which she either bathes or hangs out with someone, but they never had a reason to show their breasts, which obviously was the only thing that kept this mess. <br /> <br /> The black guy and the blonde, which are about a meter high, are connected: they look like a cheap version of Rodman and Madonna (as if the last two are no longer a cheap combination). Nicole Eggert, mentioned by Howard Stern in her book Miss America, is blonde. Stern writes about Eggert that she took out her implants. However, I believe that when they took her implants, they also mistakenly sucked most of the meat out of her flesh and muscles, because she looks hungry here. <br /> <br /> A saxophonist in one scene develops like an angel. wings; he looks like Al Roker advertising cakes with angel food.
