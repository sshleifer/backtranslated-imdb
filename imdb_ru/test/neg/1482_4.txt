I was Stan in the movie "Dreams Come True". Stan was a friend who worked in the factory with the main character, and eventually he had to break his arm in the mechanism and make him scream (where was the ambulance?). The acting role in this film was for the most part rather bad, mostly with local actors from Fox Valley, Wisconsin. I saw the movie on the big screen. He played 2 nights in 3 cinemas and was something special to see himself on the big screen. I may be biased, but overall I liked it. Also the soundtrack was the band Spooner, which later became Garbage. My brother Steve Charlton was also in the film. He played Swenson, a man who comes to the door on crutches to talk to the police.
