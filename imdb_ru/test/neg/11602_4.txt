It was Hitchcock's third Hollywood feature, and it looks like he was not yet established in the sequence, moving from the faithful adaptation of the classic Rebecca novel to the spy thriller in Foreign Correspondent, and now in this romantic comedy in the spirit of the “worm” “1930s film yo <br /> <br /> Hitchcock’s formal method, on the other hand, has by now established itself in something inconsistent, so much so that he could not (or at least did not want to) deviate from it. Then it was unreasonable for him to go beyond the limits of his usual genre, and the romantic comedy was especially inappropriate. Rebecca was really great to see that Hitchcock was limited to his producer and source code, forced to turn his technique into a heavy gothic drama, but for Mr. and Mrs. Smith there is a huge discrepancy between form and content. In other words, Hitchcock was not Ernst Lubich. <br /> <br /> First, let's look at the romantic corner. The best love scenes in Hitchcock films were wild, passionate and a bit dangerous. "ever fell in love with someone you shouldn't have?" the situation and he was great in depicting this. This is what makes a much earlier film, Rich and Strange, one of the few non-thrillers of Hitchcock that really works. However, the hitch is not so good when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story. It takes a light, gentle touch, but Hitch doesn't have one. <br /> <br /> Secondly, take a comedy. Of course, Hitchcock movies can be funny ?? Lady disappears, probably the best example? but only when the jokes were scattered throughout the story. The Master of Uncertainty simply lacks a comedy director to create a film with funny bones. Does he cut scenes like in a thriller? fast opposite angles of talking people, inserted close-ups of arms and legs, shots from the point of view ?? but does not take into account the comic timing or focus on the jokes. For example, a business with a Carol Lombard dress cracked in front of us is shown to us with a few close-ups, but they are more confined, as if he reveals some important plot point, and have no comedic effects. Sometimes the Hitchcock style is roughly the same as comedy? for example, the location of characters on a stage in a club where Robert Montgomery is trying to make him look as if he is with an attractive, sophisticated woman at the next table ?? but these moments are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Even the actors Mr. and Mrs. Smith do not meet the standards. I'm not sure that it was the strength of Robert Montgomery, and he is boring here. Of course, it was precisely in this that Carol Lombard's power in Queen of Screwball was, and although she clearly plays well, the scenes are simply not suitable for the comedy. Even Jack Carson, who could be fun when he was really allowed to let go in front of the camera, couldn’t cheer up at all. Of course, none of these wonderful comedians are helped by the script, which, firstly, is not exactly bursting with laughter, even if the main story is a pretty good premise. <br /> <br /> The only complete thing on the comedy that Hitchcock did after that was “Trouble with Harry”, and it worked because it affected his usual anxiety. However, it was only when the story could exist independently of humor, when the basic framework was unknown? How does this disappear in Lady or family plot ?? that Hitchcock was able to play well comedy.
