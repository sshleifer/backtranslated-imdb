If I had to choose the most depressing film, try to be tense, I saw that it would be this one. I know how good the original should be, it would be better if it were better than this. The film is so gloomy and depressing, but it is also not interesting to watch it - I saw depressing films like “thriller”, which were saved due to the expectation of opposition and the smoothing of dark quality. Vanishing didn't have it, it was so anxious to watch from the very beginning, and there was nothing positive to make this film a classic type. I think that another IMDb poster correctly said that this genre had just seen thrillers made much better. I completely agree - I would recommend to skip this one - maybe someday I’ll see the original, but I doubt it. I give it 2 out of 10.
