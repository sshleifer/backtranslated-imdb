Except for the beautiful stand for Clara Evans ... this show was pretty bad ... so why did I watch it? Too much coffee and had to relax before hitting the bag. Watching BB dress up in his worst Big Chief outfit was funny at best, and funny at worst. <br /> <br /> I could improve the Skeltor and the special effects for my Dell. <br /> <br /> Boxlietner has seen better times, this guy is a year younger than me, and he is more and more like the Scarecrow from his TV shows that appeared in the early 1980s ... Women's sweets should return to acting school, although Evans is 40 years old and plays a 17-year-old girl (she was already over twenty, it was great) ... The science fiction channel made it better ... but for us, people who donâ€™t go outside I think we more we need to take what we can get ... after all that distracts you from lighting CNN, MSNBC and Fox at Election 2008 these days, that's a good thing.
