According to others, this is a ridiculous horrible movie (NOT FILM!). It's not bad, it's funny, it just hurts to endure. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak is quite hot, but there is one scene in which she is in the bath, and you can see how the bubble is covered with a film under the bubbles. In addition, she is getting fatter. <br /> <br /> Wrestling scenes are so bad that they cannot be seen if you know or care about martial arts or even decent choreography, and editing / effects are terrible. <Br /> <br /> There is no return, it does not go anywhere, and it sucks.
