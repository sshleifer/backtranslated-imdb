weird.this is a television movie, but the rating on the box says it has a rating of R. There is nothing in the movie that could remotely claim a rating of R. In addition, the movie is very slow and meaningless. The idea was good, but nothing was done with the storyline. It simply was not developed. She's a bit creepy, and the acting is actually quite good, better than the film deserves. ever there were other films dealing with the same concept that were made better than this one. I haven't seen too many Wes Craven films, so I can't compare it with any of his others. as for the film itself though, I think it is poorly thought out and poorly executed. For me, I can't give Chiller a higher rating than 3/10.
