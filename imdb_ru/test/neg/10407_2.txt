Louis Gossett Jr. returns to the well in the role of Chappy Sinclair, who goes to Doug Masters (played by Jason Cadier, who plays Jason Gedrick, who wisely refused) to teach a new group of recruits, but this time they find corrupt Air Force pilots who are in toxic waste. This is a series that only gets worse with each subsequent entry, but there is not a single zip code or even action to make it even worth seeing on the cable. Iron Eagle IV is directed with such indifference that the air battles begin as if we are watching a playstation 2 game played by two teenagers with a lobotomy. Awful to watch, and Gossett Jr., who made his share of the turkeys, seems to have hit bottom here. And I saw the Cover-Up, Firewalker, Aces: Iron Eagle III, Toy Soldiers, and Jaws 3D. What is mysterious in Louis Gossette Jr. is that he seems to be like Christopher Walken in his quest to do something while he works. As I look at my post, Oscar will win. Some of his best films include Iron Eagle, The Punisher and The Chief. Given that in the last two films, he starred with Dolph Lundgren and James Belushi, we can say that three guilty action films are involved in his quest for better work. Of course, Enemy Mine and Diggstown remain his best win after the Oscars. <br /> <br /> * of 4- (Bad)
