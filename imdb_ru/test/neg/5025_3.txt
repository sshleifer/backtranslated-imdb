Rossini once described the work of rival composer Wagner as "some wonderful moments ... and some horrible quarter of an hour." Inuyasha also seems to be described in this way. It has many big episodes, but in-between the innumerable filler episodes. The entire series consists of approximately 175 episodes, of which I would say that at least 125 is a filler or some similar plot (I did not bother to count and would not be surprised if this number were actually higher). <br /> <br /> Some of these episodes of filler are actually quite pleasant, although many of them are rather stupid or boring. However, persistent deviations from the norm begin to deplete after the first few seasons, as the plot eventually progresses in difficult crawling for most of the series. Character development also slows down dramatically, and in later seasons the composition becomes completely unchanged, which leads to more and more stale jokes (especially a monk whose ironic features begin as slightly humorous, but become tiresome when the jokes associated with them) appear repeatedly) . <br /> <br /> However, this does not mean that Inuyasha is a bad series. This is simply not a very good series, as, for example, the Neon Genesis Evangelion is usually considered. Like what you can see at the end of a hard day, it's nice, but you can't confuse it with high art.
