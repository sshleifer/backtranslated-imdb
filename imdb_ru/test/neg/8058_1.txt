This film was incredibly bad ... It's terrible, but the violence is too great to such an extent that it looks extremely fake and predictable. Since everything is shown to you, there is nothing left for imagination. And the plot ... what the plot? There really is not one! The pace is incredibly slow (despite occasional acts of violence), and the script should have been written by a crazy 12-year-old child who kills kittens for fun. So this film was banned in 31 countries? I could understand why ... not because of blood (boring and trite), but because it was a terrible movie. It should have been banned from existence. Avoid this like the plague. 1 out of 10
