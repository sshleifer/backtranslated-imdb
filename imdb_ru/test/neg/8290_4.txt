"Graduation Day" is the result of the success of Friday the 13th. Both of these films are about creative, bloody murders, not about obscurity. If you like this type of film, I would recommend “Graduation Day”. If not, I would not. There is nothing new here, just the same old murders. <br /> <br /> Although I gave the film 4 out of 10, I will say that it is not a repulsive film. It is watchable, if you are interested, just not creative.
