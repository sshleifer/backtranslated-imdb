Can I just start by saying that I'm a fan of bad movies. And this is a really bad movie. The front panel indicates 100 passengers, 3000 snakes, but I think that more precisely 12 passengers and about 20 snakes. <br /> <br /> Snakes do not do anything particularly interesting, in fact, the whole film is just a blunder with a small case. Although sometimes due to pulsating hands and green mucous vomiting, strong bloody gusts occur (in bad films there must be green goo, isn't it?). <br /> <br /> But then the end comes and literally slaps you from your seat in hysteria. and for this this film gets a boost to level 2 *. <br /> <br /> There are certain films in the world that you want to show to your friends, just so you can watch their reaction when a certain event occurs in them. <br /> <br /> For example, the appearance of “Big Man” in the R. Kelly film “trapped in the closet” “LINE” in “Shark 3” (you will know about this when you hear this) “Shark Shark 3” In almost every scene of “Troll 2” The end of “Dracula 3000” (just for complete distrust and confusion) and the end of this film proudly sits in this category, It is worth it to sit down. So get drunk, stone yourself, whatever your poison, and watch this movie with a few friends. <br /> <br /> Simply put, if you like bad movies, get it, but don’t confuse it with Snakes on a Plane ... no relation. <br /> <br /> And don’t pay for it more than five ...
