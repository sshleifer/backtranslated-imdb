it was absolutely the most tragic heap of movies I've ever witnessed. Not only was the name completely abnormal - because the film had nothing to do with piranhas - but the action was as empty and unwieldy as trying to actually make some kind of plot. when you watch this movie, you can't help but spend every waking second on questions when you have enough, and it's time to turn it off. Unfortunately, I waited until the end in my case. these are two hours of my life that i can never return.
