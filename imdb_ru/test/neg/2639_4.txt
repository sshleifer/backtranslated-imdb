The typical story of an evil child following people. I suspect that Antonio Fargas (Huggy Bear from Starsky and Hutch) and Vincent Sciavelli did not want to emphasize this junk in their resumes (in fact, Schiavelli left this life mostly with a good resume). Sometimes I want the killers in these films to simply follow the idiots who decide that we need a new one of these films every month (note: this comment should not be taken seriously; I just think that the slashers have lost touch). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is one movie that you will try to avoid. From ninety minutes to two hours I will never return.
