I just can not believe that the people who made and played in this film really took it seriously. The SNL parody looks more real. Everything was ridiculously false. Stupid firefights, ridiculous fistfights, dialogues, lush background music and even Bo’s blind eyes. If it were announced as a comedy, it would still make more sense, but it would still be bad. I can only see this as “entertainment” if you have a room full of stoned college students who look like it was Rocky Horror. Imagine some of the things you saw on “Burning saddles,” for example, Mongo knocks a horse down or an old woman gets hit in the stomach. Now imagine that the producer wants you to take these scenes seriously, and you understand the essence of this disaster.
