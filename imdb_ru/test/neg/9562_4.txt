The reality of the mafia environment is absolutely canine, where the gangster is killed for showing any signs of weakness, because they become passive. I have no problem with the human side of the gangsters, but Bugsy goes too far towards soft, funny men. The film is enjoyable, but itâ€™s just light entertainment, not a biographical film about a man who, although fascinating, was extremely dangerous and fearsome. <br /> <br /> Everything in acting is good, and the direction is very convincing. Places and times are very well presented, and the topics are very interesting. Did Bugsy really want to kill Mussulini?
