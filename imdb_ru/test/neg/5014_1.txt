This film was such a waste of my money. it was disgusting and anxious. Frankly, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. who thinks about the movie where the girl is blowing her dog ?? seriously ... it was a waste of my time. I continued to watch the film, hoping that it would get better and the plot would appear, but this did not happen. I would rate the movie F-. This film should have been rated R for its disturbing nature. I would never let children of any age watch this movie. this movie sucks. this movie is terrible this movie was a waste of my time. I could spend the night spending some time instead of making this film. This film was a waste of gas money to get to the store, and definitely a waste of two dollars to watch it. almost no one should watch this movie. this film should be banned and burned.
