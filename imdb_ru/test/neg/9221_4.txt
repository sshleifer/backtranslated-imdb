This is a silly movie with lots of singing and dancing. Act on average, but the letter leaves much to be desired. There are memorable performances of Buddy Epssen, with a short but outstanding game of Gypsy Rose as the bitter wife of a rich playboy. Absolutely incredible image of student life, which ends with a magnificent exhibition of Alice in Wonderland on skates. Many pieces are worth seeing, but donâ€™t be afraid to fast forward through individual parts of the film.
