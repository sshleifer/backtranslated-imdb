TV director Veteran Ted Post tells us about a sad, confusing, and ultimately meaningless story taken from column B of the Harold Robbins Big Book of Plots. Against the misty skyline of Phoenix, post-Charlie Angles, Jacqueline Smith makes a stellar turn as “a woman whose eyes are always mysteriously shadowed,” while James Francisca James Francis copycat idle around the edges. <br /> <br /> Mannix goes to the west, insults the monkeys, models lean toward classic cars, and Sybil Dunning constantly pushes to the background until the end of the hyallo style brings all this sad confusion to a bitter end. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and Bob Mitchum is also there. Somewhere.
