This film looks great, and this is where my praise ends. “Love is a great thing” came out in a very schizophrenic year of 1955, when senseless rubbish in color like this coexisted with a stunning art fair such as Kiss Me Deadly. When in the mid-50s there was a tendency to create small socially significant films, such as On the Embankment and Marty, other directors felt the need to adhere to the indisputable, indulgent melodrama that classifies so many other films of that decade, and Love - one of the last. <br /> <br /> This is a film of the 50s, in which Technicolor is used with maximum brightness, and the lighting is invariably bright; even scenes in a dark room or at night are brighter than a typical sunny day. I never want to hear this song again, because it sounds often enough during the entire film to last someone’s whole life, and I certainly don’t want to hear it performed by the piercing, piercing ear of the choir that publishes it. at the end of the name. Jennifer Jones and William Holden are tolerable, but in fact anyone could play these roles. The role of Jones is terribly written - her character is incredibly inconsistent, and it seems that whenever her hero is required to make a decision about something, the writers throw a coin to decide what that decision will be. <br /> <br /> People will undoubtedly tell me that I take this film too seriously, that I am unromantic, and so on. But I loved “Everything the heavens allow,” released the same year and Cornball in its own way, with the exception of Douglas. Sirk is able to transform melodrama into an art form, while Henry King (director of "Love") does not. <br /> <br /> I can usually enjoy a bad melodrama, but in this case I'm just bored. <br /> <br /> Rating: D +
