When I watched this movie, I felt as though a plastic bag was slowly approaching my head. The game was terribly suffocating, and it was a bad game. The brightest actor act in the whole film was the guy who was supposed to play in the laid out state in a coffin. I felt nothing but relief when it was over. I expected this film to become a real tragedy, with some deep psychological intrigue in consequence. Everything around was stupid, without a beginning, without a climax, without end, just hung out and continued, and the plastic bag continued to deteriorate. Let's really here. This is a terrible movie.
