It turned out good and looks interesting. However, attempts to create emotions between characters are so irrelevant that they really cut off the horror and are an insult to serious viewers. The story based on “I went with a zombie” is probably much better, although, unfortunately, I have not seen it yet. “Ritual” looks so fascinating and could be a great movie about zombies and voodoo, but in fact it turned out very bad, which is a shame. It's hard to say what's wrong with that. I think there are too many inept scenes, and it's hard to believe, for example, the love story between Alice (who is called Alice Dodgson, as the girl who allegedly inspired Lewis Carol to call her character Alice) and younger brother. Absolutely nothing was created between them, and then eventually they got married. In any case, it looks great, and it was worth seeing - but the film is so poorly executed. 3/10.
