Like Tinto Brass (“Caligula”), the people who shot this film cannot tell frankness from eroticism. No growths, just throw naked women on the screen; no, that doesn't work. If close-ups of female genitalia do not suit you, prepare yourself to take your eyes off the screen in many places (I have often done this). The mentality of the film “all women are whores in the soul” is offensive, and the “story” is by turns absurd and boring (escape is the most boring part!). But halfway there is a random scene that appears out of nowhere and involves one of the (female) prisoners and one of the (male) security guards in a naked fight contest that she wins with a pair of judo movements. Although the choreography of the fight is bad, the whole scene is undoubtedly catchy. In fact, this scene and good cinematography are the only two reasons why I give this film out of 4, not 0.
