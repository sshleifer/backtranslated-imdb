I watched this piece ONDEMAND, because the description was partly outlandish. This film stinks of cocaine, the opening scene alone should have cost at least five-digit hits on the film. It is a racist, homophobic piece of garbage that lasts as long as 1 hour and 22 minutes without any direction. I'm a little confused that there are good reviews. I will not tell you the storyline, because, as far as I can tell, there is no plot. I am almost sure that everyone came to the set every day, made giant lines, dressed Loretta Sweet in deep cleavage to show as many pancake fragments as possible and shouted; allowing actors to improvise in cocaine madness. Like a real beer, this film almost led to my liver failing halfway through. Save your money and instead see Strange Drink.
