This film clearly had good intentions. In the end, there is a dedication to someone named Kelly, who, as a spectator, I can only assume, found himself in a situation similar to that shown in the film. She may have made the “wrong” choice. This dedication is the ONLY redeeming quality of Love and Suicide. <br /> <br /> The film becomes unbearable from the first episode. As soon as the viewer is already annoyed only five minutes after the beginning of the film, after that ... it will be pretty cool. I know that the film was low-budget, and the pictures from the camera were actually pretty good ... unfortunately, everything else was awful. Acting, plot, sound quality, image quality ... acting. Sorry, but the game is terrible. Beyond the horror. As if the actors are trying to behave like people acting. This is the only way to describe it. As I watched, I actually depicted the script with the thought of the direction of the scene. None of the movements was natural, and none of the characters' reactions to each other fit. In short, time off. The timing of the entire film is far away. I am not a director, so I know the limits of my knowledge, but I really feel that there must be a SOME way to pass the time ... until they explained that the prom was not too far away, I got the impression. maximum month. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is really a shame. This movie really could be powerful with a little adjustment. All moments in the film in which we have to feel something are obvious, but only because the installation is obvious (which is bad). Moving scenes completely collapsed. For example, when Brother Kay takes his hat and puts it on his head, we must feel the understanding he has for her, the innocence and protection of her brother's love ... for some reason it just doesn’t go off. There are much more similar scenes (for example, ALL battle scenes), and all they do is remove them from the film. All of these things, taken together, Love & Suicide are one long, cheesy, low-budget commercial.
