It seems that some viewers suggest that the only thing that can make the viewer dislike this film is graphic violence. In fact, violence, both alarming and caricatured, is the last of Oldboy’s profound flaws. Characters are one-dimensional, underdeveloped, primitive. “Intensity”, an obsession and the goal itself with this director is provided with the cheapest means. Let's not confuse the senseless adrenaline rush with artistic value. By the end of the film, it seems that all the cards have been exhausted, so the script becomes almost unintentionally ridiculous in his attempts to find new levels of "horror" to continue to "shock" the audience, which already numb the stupid soap operas of the "revelations" are already served in large beams. It is hard to imagine that someone, even a little vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of Asian cinema, was fascinated by this pompous garbage. Imagine Homer Simpson hesitating in front of the cinema: “Should I go or should I buy five ice cream cones for the same money?” Be smart, Homer, go get ice cream.
