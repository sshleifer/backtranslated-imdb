Let me first say that in the past I was a big fan of Carlin. I think George is one of the smartest people and the best comedians on the planet. what made George so great in the past was his ability to look at things in his own way, and to give us his unique perspective on these things. it was not always funny, but you always respected his opinion, because they were presented in such a clever way. but you're all sick, it's just a long rant. he gives us no unique point of view no matter what, he just gives us a long list of things he was going to do. there is no understanding, there is no trick, just an elderly person complains one hour about what we all complained about. and on top of that, it wasn't even funny. All of you are sick, addressing stupid people who cannot cope with something more advanced than something simple and direct. I do not mind stirring up the anger of comedy, but George could have done much better. I really hope that the next George Carlin show will match the quality that George has shown in the past.
