Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from the book by Franz Lidza. Young mother Selma Lidz (Andy MacDowell) is struggling with a very serious illness, and her self-proclaimed husband and inventor Cid (John Tururro) is a bit lacking in the department of emotions. Dissatisfied with the new home situation, their sensitive son Stephen (Nathan Watt) decides that he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny (Michael Richards) and Melvin (Lou Millill) until his mom gets better Stephen seems happier and even interested in his life habits strange uncle; he even decides that he wants to change his name to Franz. The scene from the drama, shot in the early 60s, is a bit comedy ... change it to crazy. Not being a MacDowell fan, UNSTRUNG HEROES assures me of its attitude; although I enjoyed the movie, and it's not a complete waste.
