This distinction should refer to the DUNGEON OF HARROW. At the very least, Ed Wood’s mistaken attempt to make a quality sci-fi film had the dubious “star” power of Bela Lugusi, the Vampires, Thor Johnson, Chriswell, and Lyle Talbot. DUNGEON OF HARROW has no redemptive qualities. What could be an interesting and disturbing conspiracy about a burgundy aristocrat in a leper colony, possibly in the style of DR ISLAND. MOREAU, or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, is crushed by heavy dialogue and monotonous actions of amateurs, whose lines sink like lead loads, into a sea of ​​stupidity. "Special Effects" that took place in someone's bath, doom this film to a bunch of manure. Even the treatment of leprosy is something from the Victorian interpretation of the Bible. The fact that leprosy cannot be concluded from an individual in the final stages contradicts the storyline, according to which the aristocrat Fallon and his lady Cassandra contracted the disease and became the original inhabitants of the Chateau de Sade, destined for madness and inhuman cruelty, It is interesting to note that none of the actors made another film. It is not surprising that talent creates talent; Lack of talent breeds oblivion, where this film should find its deplorable end.
