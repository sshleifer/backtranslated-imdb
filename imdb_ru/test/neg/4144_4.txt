I didn’t want to write off this film on reviews and critics in the western world, I mean, how wrong were they with regard to Asian cinema, which has now become the main diet of the Hollywood monster remake? Plus Jet L is damn cool and he made some interesting films in Asia. Thus, due to impartiality, I was surprised by the average of this film. <br /> <br /> There are some good moments. The story is very clever, using M-Theory as the basis for the plot that there are many universes, each of which has its own version of the worlds, and most likely you. Every time one of you is destroyed, the rest share energy and power between them. The idea that someone can try and deliberately become the only version of himself in all the universes, to find out whether they become God. <br /> <br /> There is also Jet Li, and he's not a bad actor and quite nimble as a martial artist, plus Jason Statham, who is a good actor. As for special effects, some of them are really cool: mixing the time of a bullet and slow motion at a normal speed, look very cool in places. <br /> <br /> Bad moments? Well, Statham’s accent is terrible, and some effects are not as comparable as others, so it’s clear that the money was spent on some basic shots and not on others that were probably considered too short on screen, or they just didn’t have enough . <br /> <br /> For me, a very painful moment is a short-frame storyline that Hollywood has long preferred, which Jackie Chan often said. Shooting close-up combat scenes serve two purposes. It puts more emphasis on one stroke or movement, making it more complex and realistic than it actually is, and also hides what is happening around the camera lens. For example, people with a fake hand or face of an understudy, etc. Chan always said that he was trying to open the camera and show the audience what was happening, let them see people fighting properly, and not large face and fist close up, cut someone caught in frame. Show the whole picture more efficiently and more impressively. <br /> <br /> So close framed shots were more annoying than anything else, you couldn’t see Lee’s impressive combat skills, and it was difficult to see some of the actions. Slow down the notches and output the camera of Hollywood directors! The biggest problem was history, although, despite the presence of such a strong base on which to build, they seemed to lose their plot and concentrate on the battle scenes. There are several serious plot and explanatory points that are simply overlooked and covered by several sentences, but still they could form an excellent and complex development of character. <br /> <br /> All this, too, was held together weakly, and not enough was done from history. All in all, not a very good movie, and its potential was badly damaged.
