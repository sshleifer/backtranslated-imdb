As a resident of Central Asia, I would like to see the prison wells, which closed the power plants to raise prices, also received a prison sentence. <br /> <br /> I thought that the film is pretty good and contains some very informative fragments. While they stuck to how Enron got up and crashed, I found it really interesting. However, when the film focuses on the anti-Bush tilt, I wondered if they were really accurate. <br /> <br /> It is good to note any connection Republicans had with Enron, but the monster was created when Clinton was president. The energy crisis in Central Asia occurred under the supervision of Davis. Both were on duty during Enron abuses, but neither was held accountable. Rather, a lot of time is spent on how Bush was friends with Ley. So what? Ley played golf with Clinton and spent the night in the Lincoln bedroom. Why are democrats given such a free pass in this film? I think that most politicians are a waste of our taxpayers' money, so I am not addicted to any of the parties, but I hate to feel that someoneâ€™s political plans are watching me when I watch a documentary. Yes, politicians deserve some guilt, but I really doubt that the only perpetrators have Rs after their names. I did not find any sense in depicting Bush as an amateur kei, when Democrats received as much money for the Enron campaign as Republicans. As I said, it weakens the rest of the film for me, because it makes me suspicious of the rest of the facts that they post.
