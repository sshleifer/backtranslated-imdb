I absolutely despise this film. I wanted to love it - I really wanted to. But man, o man - they were SO with Sarah. And the living father was pretty stupid. This is straight from the movie "Shirley Temple". <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the BOOK. It's amazing. In the book, Sarah is noble and decent, and she is doing the right thing ... BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT. There is no evil bone in her body. <br /> <br /> In the film, she is angry and angry. She does little things to return to Miss Minchin. In the book of Sarah above such things. She confronts Miss Minchin. She speaks the truth and is not intimidated by her. But she doesnâ€™t do the stupid, nasty things Sarah does in the film. <br /> <br /> I am really very worried that many here say that they liked the book and they love the movie. I can't help but wonder ... did we read the same book? The whole point of this book was in personal responsibility: to behave honestly and honestly, ALWAYS speak the truth and calmly meet adversity. <br /> <br /> Sarah has a happy ending in a book - not the funny survival of her father, but the connection with his partner who was looking for her. In the book, she is accepted by this new figure of the father, who loves and cares for her and Becky. And Miss Minchin - NOT a chimney sweep - this part of the film was really stupid. <br /> <br /> Seeing all this praise for this pathetic movie bothers me. We praise the film, which glorifies petty, evil behavior with the help of a few tips on kindness? Sarah in the book was kind to the bone and full of integrity. I don't even recognize her in the film ... she's not in that. <br /> <br /> Well, Mrs. Burnett is not alive to see this terrible thing. It is terrible and unfair to bear the name of her book.
