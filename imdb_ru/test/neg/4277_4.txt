In this version of Mansfield Park, although it was extremely accurate for the novel, there was not enough sympathy for Fanny, which is crucial and crucial for this Jane Austen story. This was due to the complete absence of acting skills from actress Silvestra Le Touzel. She had no appeal, and at times it seemed that she was either lost in space, or coming out of its depth. The scene with her uncle where she goes into hysterics was hysterical. She greatly exaggerated this critical scene, and I really wished Henry Crawford ever cared for her. <br /> <br /> The polar opposite is the image of Mary Crawford Jackie Smith-Wood. What a wonderful actress, in a very difficult part, to make this character witty and selfish, selfish, but vulnerable to love. <br /> <br /> I have always loved fanny. She is meek, but with an inexorable sense of what is right and whom she considers worthy of respect and admiration. "Fanny" in this adaptation is too meek and submissive, almost without thinking about it until the very end of the series. As much as I wanted this fanny .... I just couldn't. <br /> <br /> I suggest skipping this version of Mansfield Park for a real ... novel. Fanny will not disappoint ... you will love her!
