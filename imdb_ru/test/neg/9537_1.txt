I love bad movies, but this thing is a lot of smoke. From wobbly operators to terrible sound and destructive actions - do not lose a second on this heap. Fifth graders could make a better film, and first graders could write a better script. Want a real synopsis? Ugly chicks in neon bikini dance for too long. A scattered plot, aggravated by a disgusting game. Kits on the spot were not even passable. Church scenes occur in a dance studio, and oh yeah - what with the two tap-numbers that appear from nowhere? <br /> <br /> Oh, and the total number of bare breasts that could not even save this film is 0. Add this to the rubbish heap.
