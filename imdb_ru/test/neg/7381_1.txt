I rented this film because on the cover of the DVD it looked like it would be a funny student comedy, like Van Wilder or Animal House. I took it to my friend's house to watch a movie night. We stopped for 15 minutes in the movie and instead watched Copper Mountain. I do not know if any of you have seen the Copper Mountain, but this is also not great. However, I must say that the Alan Thick Jim Carrey Duo watches made the watches more pleasant. <br /> <br /> I later finished the Puddle Cruiser. This film was slow, and the humor was forced. This film reminded me of some of the smelly ones that I saw on some of my previous college classes. I was wondering: “Did this film allow Broken Lizard to make super-rummers?” Also, how could this film suck so badly? Supertroopers was good, and Club Dread was decent. Do not watch this movie!
