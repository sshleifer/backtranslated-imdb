The Scott collection from the 80s icons cannot save this teen disaster. But then I guess that is why it was only a television film, not a major film. William A. Schwartz (writer) comes up with something closer to the “School of flight attendants,” but this film is more boring. This film is not really stupid, just boring and completely meaningless. The only reason to see this is to see Tina Yoters in a real role after “Family Ties”. After this movie and the equally stupid "Classic Cruise", I think Mr. Scott came up with and returned to the directing of the committees, which was his best move. 4 out of 10
