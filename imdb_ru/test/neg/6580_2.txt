I think Tom Hanks is a good actor. I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were young. I was very disappointed in the film. One character is completely annoyed with a voice that gives me the feeling of a nail on the board. There is a completely unnecessary scene train / slides. There are some characters and scenes that seem scary for young children for whom this film was made. Scenes at the North Pole with Santa and elves might be cute and charming. In these scenes or characters there was absolutely no warmth or charm. Usually it is impossible to turn a short children's book into a feature film. This film gets on my nerves.
