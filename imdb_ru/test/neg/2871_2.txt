I did not think that Haggard was the funniest film of all time, I like CKY and Viva La Bam more. I think a lot of this was just stupid, and he didn't have a plot for the film. I highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this film, but anyone who loves viva la bam, CKY or Jack Ass should see this. I loved many parts of the film, and then there were parts that should have been cut. I think that Johnny Knoxville should have played in the film because he is a much better actor than most people from Haggard and could possibly make this film more funny. I think Ryan Dunn was probably the best actor, and he should have skated more.
