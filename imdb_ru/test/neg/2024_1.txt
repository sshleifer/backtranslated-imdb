Have I seen the worst movie? No, I can not say that I have. It was a pity. If the director is still alive: 1. He should not be. 2. He should be ashamed. 3. God, how I would like to get 2 wasted hours on his $$. <br /> <br /> To give you some tips about the “movie”: <br /> <1. (I'm a man), and I would prefer to make a paper cut on the opening of my urethra before looking at it again ( Seriously). <br /> <br /> 2. There are several well-known names in it (Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Kulio). They do not help, and their film career after this “movie” is officially over. <br /> <br /> 3. Dialogue - the worst I've ever heard. "I want to ejaculate on your bosons." What writer did they have in this movie? Did he still use phonetics and just mixed up his letters to make these terrible sentences? Or did he try to kill the director because of several people who saw it? <br /> <br /> 4. Watch this “movie” backwards. Because I PROMISE you that you do not want to look this forward. <br /> <br /> 5. This “movie” will make Helen Keller stand up and leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 6. The plot of the film is similar to the McDonalds playground for adults. I was just waiting for this so-called “Dracula” to fall into a hole with a ball in a film. <br /> <br /> 7. In addition, I like that in 3000 they still have headphones with wires that go into their mouths. No Bluetooth, no wireless headsets, no chips placed in the brain, but they use headsets borrowed from a telemarketing agency that ceased operations in 1983. reading this.) 8. I don’t know who was responsible for the special effects, but I could do better in my backyard with my VHS camcorder, which has no battery. <br /> <br /> 9. I was a devout Catholic before this “movie.” But since I saw him, I know that there is no God, because if he was, he would not have released this film. Now I am an atheist. <br /> <br /> 10. I will be honest, I can not talk about the ending. The last time I tried to explain this, I fell into a coma. <br /> <br /> People, no matter how boring they are, no matter how curious (or brave) you are, how many people laugh, you THINK you will leave this film, please DO NOT SEE THIS. It literally ruined my life. AVOID ALL COSTS! <br /> <br /> Commentary to the director: I hate you. You ruined my life. After watching, I feel empty inside. My wife and children left me and hate me because I could not speak or barely move when I saw this. I lost my job, my dignity and, above all, my pride. I will never forgive you either in this life or in the next (which does not look good in my new convictions).
