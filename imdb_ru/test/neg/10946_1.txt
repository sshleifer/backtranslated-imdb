This film is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life! I spend my time on it. I completely watched this movie because I took it for me. I wonder how Sunel Darshan could make such a film? it has no continuity. It feels like he just shoots scenes and then joins them in some kind of editing software !!! The music, of course, is good, but the film does not need so many unwanted songs. Kangana Ranaut looks fake, and I wonder what role Selina Jayetli plays in the film? Bobby Deol is good. at least he can act! Upen Patel should take acting lessons and not take off shirts in almost all scenes! The end was the most miserable! <br /> <br /> I watched "Shakalaka boom-boom" after watching the movie "300", you guys can really imagine what I felt about this Bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> I really respect Bollywood, but please directors and producers, be believable, not everything is fantastic!
