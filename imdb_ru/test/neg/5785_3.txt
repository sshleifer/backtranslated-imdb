Pay attention to yourself. Never watch a serious movie with Charlie Sheen again. Great comic, terrible print. In this film, Seals look like a reckless group of Rangers, although in fact it is the most elite army in the world. Charlie Sheen helps to destroy the reputation of the fur seal. Thank you for making such an incredibly select group of people look awful in one of the worst action films I've ever seen. This is a great story that can be turned into an amazing action movie, but why Charlie Sheen? There are opportunities for a very passionate story, but Shin decides to destroy them with “funny” comments.
