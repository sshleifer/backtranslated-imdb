I found “Patriot” in the DVD store and thought it might be a real action movie. No, this is a low-budget film with a ridiculous story. This is without a doubt a cable movie, not for the theater. Fortunately, after 90 minutes the film stops, otherwise the audience should have taken antivirus against sleep. One thing came: it was a good country, the film was shot. You can really feel the American air, but that's about it. I hope Steven Seagal has finally achieved great success. This is not a must see, because my wife and I voted on average 4/10.
