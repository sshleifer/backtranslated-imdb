I suppose that only a certain number of viewers were really interested in seeing how a male hustler works in New York, but I would bet that even these brave souls were turned off by annoying patchwork technique and deliberately muted recording of the sound on the show here; the fact that these inherent "defects" were a direct result of a low budget / underground / experimental film, I would say, does not matter. In any case, for those who are so inclined, the film shows the extensive naked bodies of men, and Joe Dullesandro, for obvious reasons, became an underground ?? and gay ?? icon! <br /> <br /> The episodic structure showing the daily routine of the protagonist Hustler offers some moderately interesting scenes: his meeting with an eccentric older artist (and eventually posing); the one where Dullesandro expresses his views on his unusual field of activity and delineates his particular course of action for a couple of potential "colleagues", including perhaps the smallest of fraudsters ?? nerd with glasses! Perhaps, fortunately, the film lasted just 89 minutes against the approval of IMDb that its total length is 105 (but the latter may well be a mistake)! <br /> <br /> I watched several other Warhol “films”, and this film is definitely not as satisfactory as the most tolerant example I’ve come across, BAD (1977), and only slightly better than MY HUSTLER loves ( 1965), which were mostly stressful to sit. The fact that it was only the first part of the trilogy did not bode well, but, as they say, you should do what you should, and the other two “chapters” should have followed in quick succession ... <br /> <br /> Despite my generally negative reaction, FLESH, nevertheless, is still valuable as a time capsule of the 1960s and as a prototype of the underground scene of that era, both in the cinematographic and in the real world. Recall that the image of Dullesandro from this film adorns the cover of the 1984 debut album of the Smiths eponymous album and transsexual Candy Darling (which looks quite unremarkable here) was immortalized in The Velvet Underground's introductory track. 1969 album of the same name. Although the latter group is my favorite, and one of the reasons for this is that, thanks to their completely unique and innovative music, they describe a way of life that is completely different from mine, but this is indeed the case when I would prefer to experience something then by ear, not visually!
