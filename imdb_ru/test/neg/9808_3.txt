Did Vanessa Redgrave take Mogadon while filming? As if she was reading from a car service center. I saw more life in a wooden spoon. Or perhaps it was all part of the character? Anyway, it was very, very annoying, I always wanted to shake the screen to hurry it. I read the book a long time ago and I didn’t like it very much, except that Septimus went into insanity very well - but I don’t think that Rupert Graves showed it very well, his actions were all on the surface. The connection between his life and Clarissa’s life is also not well done, but I suspect that the attempt to show the sacrifices made by the soldiers to allow people like Clarissa to continue their empty lives. The film is very tiny and has no real unity. Hated it.
