Pretty awful, but not completely unnoticed. Another review mentions "predictable" - and this is almost an understatement. You can make a game by guessing what the next line will be. Each character is a stereotype or archetype. A good guy in a bad situation, a fight between a senior and a junior priest for acceptance and discipline, a repressed, sexually / emotionally deprived woman returning to a small town after a failure in a big city, engaged to a hot, weak thinking youth, irrecoverable bad guys looking for a family feeling — they are all here, and none of them have the slightest, even something new. From the first few minutes you can understand exactly what will happen by the end of the movie. The story is not entirely unconvincing, but directing, acting (even from the cast with some talent) - everything goes without skill. As for the storyline, we all saw it before in a movie called “Sister Act”. It is also one of those films where inattention to small details appears in an even brighter light. (For example: the nurse and our hero drive to the city, but are parked a few blocks from the destination (post office and home appliances store) - and yet they go through empty parking lots for no apparent reason. Or from morning to night during the scene it should happen no more than half an hour. The film is filled with such things, and then points to an incredible denouement.
