This film starts quite promisingly, but it gets a little bit intricate and captures its stylistic appeal. The scenography, the costumes and the music were beautiful - as close to perfection as possible. But the more I got into the film, the more I felt that all these efforts were directed at the entertainment of the director, and not at the audience. Although I liked to watch this, with the exception of a few short musical scenes, I cannot say that I liked it. The director shows a tremendous imagination, but if he was having fun with this film, he could not share it with the audience, or at least with me. I did not feel a whim and was not absorbed in this universe. <br /> <br /> The main reason for this was (surprisingly) Zhang Ziyi. You may say that she tries her best, but she seems to be so mistaken that she leaves almost amateur. She is an able actress, but she has her limitations. I noticed in her game that she had yet to really respond to her colleagues in the film, a flaw that creates a void of chemistry. The language barrier in this film seems to only aggravate the situation. She and Odagiri behave as if they are on different planets. She is also not a very good singer who made me cringe every time she sang, but, fortunately, there were not too many scenes of this. Odagiri was fine, but did not make much of an impression. <br /> <br /> I didn't even care about the characters separately. There really is a lack of performance. It seems the only reason to take care of them is that they look good. Without a compelling love story in the center of the film, itâ€™s hard to care about what happens. The film also circulates background scenes that add nothing to the story and actually distract. I had to rewind, because after entering the plot I could not remember what the hell they were doing in the storyline. There were also scenes in which it was difficult to say what was happening because it was so stylized. <br /> <br /> Basically, I'm just disappointed, because I really like the concept behind this, and there are a lot of things I love. The music and dance choreography are really great. Supporting performances are equally excellent, fantastic in both the acting aspect and singing. It's just too bad that the main actors were so soft.
