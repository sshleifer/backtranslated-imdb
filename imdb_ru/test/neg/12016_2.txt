Seriously! You just have to see this movie in order to understand everything that is wrong with it. He came out at a time when everyone was trying to make family films that everyone would like (Little villains; Mr. Nanny, etc.), but he lacked charisma or enthusiasm. Each character in the film is driven by rage, with the exception of Mother Trixie, who only demonstrates aggravation and fatigue, perhaps in the tired clichés that the film enjoys. <br /> <br /> Simply put, the biggest flaw in the film was not acting or filming, but, above all, the script. The lines we get are reminiscent of the classic Disney, although this film lacks all the sincerity that Il Walt managed to accomplish. Junior's dad (John Ritter) drives you crazy, even without doing anything, simply because he allows Junior to run around unattended, and gives him a stern warning when he writes a 200-pound hippo on the blackboard. <br /> <br /> Junior's grandfather is also especially painful. For those of you who saw the first one, found him nauseous and, therefore, did not see the second one, “Big Ben Healy”, as he is mentioned in this film, is still full of souls. He basically breaks into John Ritter's house without an invitation, settles in Junior's room, although he says he hates Junior and basically does nothing to speed up the film or support the film in any way. Rather, he drops the audience, being a lazy free loader. <br /> <br /> Finally, we get acquainted with a wide range of new characters, such as smug, nasty, Trixie, who carries dynamite in her backpack, which she lights first, then with her hands, the youngest, who simply looks with wide eyes. In addition, Gilbert Gottfried returns in this film, this time playing the disgusting director in the new junior elementary school. If Gilbert Gottfried is not enough to understand the essence, I will say simply: this film smells! <br /> <br /> 2/10 stars, because the actor’s beliefs shine through the film, even if the script sucks,
