From the recognition that he received, I expected more from the horror of the Korean, if it will look in the same capacity as the "Tale of two sisters," according to some other reviews. This film is not the same level, except for the budget spent on special effects. Think Amityville horror. With a tree and a rare dialogue. <br /> <br /> If you have a movie with a limited dialogue, the storyline and characters must carry the movie. This film could be told quite well in a 30-minute short film, 2 hours of which watch a lot of trees and scenes of terror, which make you not only not afraid, but also distracted in the spirit of “What a ...” horror <br /> <br /> Those people who claim that this film has given them indelible impressions should literally experience heart attacks when they are given decent horror films.
