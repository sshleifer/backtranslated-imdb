I must say, I was surprised to find some positive comments on this turkey (needing a feather transplant)! I give him 1 because I think that the idea to make a film about a wild man of rock and roll - Jerry Lee Lewis is worthy of respect, but releasing such garbage is a shame, but “killer” is not. deserve it! It’s good that it happened at the end of his career ... they said that Elvis almost ruined his career with the films he released in the sixties, and it could have done the same for Jerry Lee if he had been released for 15-20 years back! It is based on the book of Myra Gale Lewis, and this is a shame from the very beginning. This is a bad and inaccurate story of her life with Lewis, and there are much better books about the Killer that could make a much better and more interesting script. Add to this a group of actors who do not know whether they are involved in drama, comedy, or a little in both! The rest of the great actor Dennis Quaid puts one of the worst performances of the actor in many moons! He walks through the picture, talking about his “God-given talent”, and, as a viewer, you would like him to show some of them on the screen! Stupid gestures and funny faces, and Jerry Lee must have felt betrayed when he saw what happened to him in this truly horrible movie! The rest of the team is almost as bad ... with the exception of Winona Ryder, who does her best with the crappy lines given to her. It's a “grease” time and time again, and when Jerry Lee rolls around Memphis in his gig, with the radio turned on in the car, the whole city is dancing to the music! Everything in this film is like the cartoon characters of real people ... from the wildest man to Sam Phillips's Sun Records! And it's a hell of a shame! A charismatic and interesting artist, such as Jerry Lee Lewis, deserves the best, and I hope that he took the $ 500,000 he received from the deal, and told the company to go damn ... twice!
