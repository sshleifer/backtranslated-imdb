Perhaps James P. Ley knows what to do with the sound department, if it is controlled by the director. <br /> <br /> In “Fairy Tale Country (2007)”, however, he cannot accomplish anything as a writer or director. /> <br /> In this film there is absolutely nothing, no story, no character building, no events, no atmosphere, no plot, no turns, no acting that deserve this name. <br /> <br /> In any of these departments, this film is billions of light years behind any short film that has some real thinking, even a minute one. <br /> <br /> He has nothing to do with any of the works of David Lynch! /> <br /> I actually think that this can be used as psychological torture or negative propaganda material against the West. <br /> <br /> I recommend it only to my worst enemies!
