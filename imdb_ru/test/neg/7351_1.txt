I agree with the user SpecialAgentFoxMulder that this episode is terribly the worst of the whole show. Now I'm not fond of many episodes of the later series, but this one removes a biscuit! It was not funny and not offensive. Regarding the final, I'm sorry, but it is more disgusting to me than in any other episodes combined. <br /> <br /> I mean, the boys think that they meant well, but the final was so distressing that they believe that the whale belongs on the moon and over the credits we see that she died. What could have saved this episode if the pranksters could admit what they had done. <br /> <br /> It seems that there is no outgoing message. Well, South Park might be guilty of preaching too much, and it's always nice to see the indecent (for example, “Make love, not warcraft”), but this episode was simply wrong! Avoid at all costs!
