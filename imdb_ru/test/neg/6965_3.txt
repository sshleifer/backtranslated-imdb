There is a part of me that would like to give this film a high rating. Considering that it was made in 1953, this is a very bold film about transvestites that quite seriously and sympathetically solves the problem (and offers the viewer a lot of information on this issue) and tries very hard not to stereotype. The film clearly indicates that transvestites are not homosexuals and that in addition to wearing women's clothes they lead a relatively normal life. This is due to the pain of rejection in society - the plot revolves around a policeman (Lyle Talbot), who is desperately trying to understand the problem because of the recent suicide of the transvestite. So, you should pay tribute to everyone who is associated with this film, because he took up such a controversial (in the context of 1953) subject. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, I also regret that this film is absolutely terrible. Trying to depict the pain of Glenn / Glenda (Edward D. Wood), the film falls into stupid (and sometimes surprisingly - again, given the era - sensual fantasies that make history very difficult to understand. The game is wooden at best. None of the dialogues seem real; actors look and sound like people reading speeches written by others. And, worst of all, there was no point in having Bela Lugosi in this film. It was another of the more awkward roles that this poor man played in the final stages of his career. “Pull the strings, pull the strings,” poor poor Lugosi's character continued to cry (in the credits he was called the Spirit, but in reality he looked like a mad scientist). And nothing he did seemed to have a great connection with the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> In terms of artistic merit, the film does not really deserve much more than 1/10. However, for the courage that you just need to put out, I will give 3/10.
