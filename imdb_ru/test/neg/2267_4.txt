If you really loved GWTW, you will find a rather disappointing story. Those who might think that this is just a romantic story and the south are likely to be satisfied with this decent television production (although I think Scarlett’s choice is erroneous). But let me say that, considering the novel, nothing good came of it. <br /> <br /> I read GWTW more than 20 times, and I can really appreciate the adaptation that Mrs. Mitchell made for the film. It took me a while to figure out how good the final was: Scarlett knew exactly what she was going to get Rett back, because she always got what she wanted. But in the end there was no kiss. <br /> <br /> Then Alexandra Ripley came to “fix” this, showing us just how beautiful and powerful Scarlett can be, and, of course, describing in detail how exactly she gets Rett back, even when she had an important love affair with someone else (I'm sure nothing could be further from Mrs. Mitchell). <br /> <br /> The story between these moments is, in my opinion, long and boring. The trip comes to an end, showing the costumes and scenarios just to give us an obvious and completely unnecessary end. <br /> <br /> If Margaret Mitchell came to life again, she would die again at that moment she would know what Scarlett had become after GWTW. <br /> <br /> Of course, it’s not fair to compare this with the original, but it’s not GWTW’s fault. Is not it? Is it good if I do not compare it with the original? May be. Sorry I don't care. <br /> <br /> I would expect a little more compromise to continue someone else’s work, otherwise don’t even try.
