It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Cinematography was boring, with long tiresome shots (for example, a camera on a tripod filming a stage performance) interspersed with "dramatic" angles that did not make much sense for the content on the screen. The editing was terrible, the scenes were combined with the delicacy of the butcher. The plot was based on the fact that the viewer was familiar with the historic night on which Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein. Acting was forced, with the type of character development that caused you great interest in seeing how each of them dies terribly (the sooner the better).
