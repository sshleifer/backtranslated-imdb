Honestly, the people who gave ten to this film would have given 100 per reading. This is the level we are dealing with here. <br /> <br /> The film is not bad, but it is by no means like “OMG, the best film from the days of reading!”. Some people have incredibly low expectations from movies, even those that have indie variety. Personally, I found that my interest in the film diminished after a half-hour mark. The plot defies logic and faith. You should hear a part about why the wife did what she did to "save her husband." Yes, right. I guarantee that you will leave the theater, thinking: "Hmm, now it doesn't make any sense at all." This is one movie in which you really need to suspend all logic and faith. <br /> <br /> Those who said that the music is good probably listened to their MP3 players. In some moments, the film is absolutely killed. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, watch the movie only if you have nothing to do. I give it three, because in the motel there is one long sexual sequence that is decent.
