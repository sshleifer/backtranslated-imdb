I was 19 in 1970 when he came out, and when I heard how funny it was and after reading the reviews here, I finally rented it and looked at it. I never laughed once - a very funny movie - and I usually love Reiner. I can't understand why this seems funny. I had no chuckle. And I love comedies! Well, at least now I know what all the screams are about. Not my idea of ​​comedy. Rent a Navigator or The Love Nest from Buster Keaton - now it's a classic comedy! If you rent it, get a backup rental so that your whole evening is not a loss. Rated 3 out of 10
