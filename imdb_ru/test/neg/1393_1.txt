I love flirt comedy. I like to hear rude thoughts about performing on stage, as they appeal to the audience of their peers with different life experiences, which they had, or things that they came up with or saw that they just thought that it was **** Stupid that they had to share this with someone. <br /> <br /> In the past, there were people who took on a person that everyone could relate to (remember Rodney Dangerfield), or were so damn crazy that it was impossible not to laugh at them while they laughed at others (Richard Pryor). And then there were some suggestive comics like George Carlin, who, despite being crazy, was the smartest guy in the room who encouraged people to rethink what they saw when they walked and understand how everything was fine and how easily they could change something. <br /> <br /> Now this may not have anything to do with Mencia's The Mind, which, as I agree with most commentators here, is a comedy. The terrible decision of the Central to the loss of "Chapelle Show", but it is. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show, performing beats for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time only on racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of inserts. He makes a stage character, an ordinary Mexican named Carlos, who, despite the stereotypes, is just an ordinary mediocre guy. Then he tries to laugh at others, people whom he calls racists, or simply those who disagree with his opinion. And finally, he presents the parodies to the studio viewers and the viewer, telling them that this will help them see his point of view. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia always says that he shows a point of view that people don’t understand. I do not see, however, what he actually does, it not only promotes racist stereotypes that already exist and joke to death, but he stupidly urges people to hear them and do what helps them stay close: laugh. <br /> <br /> Encouraging stereotypes is usually the lowest, but easiest way to laugh in a rack. The best comedians whom I fear Carlos Mencia thinks he is in good company do not need to resort to them. They communicate everywhere and ask you to laugh at the absurd, and not at it, as Mencia calls. As he creates more parodies or “real” situations calling for racism or beating others with his help, he tells us, rather than asking us to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, and not just the extremes of it. <br /> <br /> His show insults the minds of those who watch it. Mencia does not give us a comedy and does not ask us to digest it and take from it what we want (what I don’t like to compare them was the best quality of the “Chapelle Show”), he definitely tells us how we have to watch it and react to it --- that, according to him, make a stupid face and say "Dee Dee!" This is a show with the appropriate name. This is really a show about The Mind of Mensia. This is the mind of Mencia, through and through, and, as such, it is nothing more than stupid entertainment. The show is specifically designed to give its main audience, between the ages of 14 and 24, life lessons on how stereotypes are bad, but that racial strikes are good for Carlos Mencia, and therefore should be good for you!
