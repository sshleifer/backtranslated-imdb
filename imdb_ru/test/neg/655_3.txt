I was delighted to see this movie when it came out. The commercials made him look weird, and I generally like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, and the combination of these two things seemed like an interesting idea to me. Unfortunately, I was terribly disappointed by nurse Betty. <br /> <br /> Personally, I usually found out that graphic violence and comedy are badly combined with each other, and the only directors who ever successfully combined them In my opinion, this is Tarantino and the Coens. Nurse Betty doesn’t have much violence, but what’s happening in her made me feel a little weird when I had to laugh. Of course, for me, part of the problem was that there seemed to be not so many places where they asked me. <br /> <br /> The film also works little like a drama. Betty Renée Zellweger, the protagonist of this story, is clinically insane and it’s impossible to have a direct relationship with her. I’ll say that Zellweger plays this role pretty well, and Freeman, Rock and Greg Kinnear do everything well too. The problem is in the letter; Freeman - the only person who plays an interesting character. This is really very bad. 3/10
