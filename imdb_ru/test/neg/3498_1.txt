This movie was offensive to the PC, predictable and clich√©. I could not imagine a film that best illustrates the short-sighted, narcissistic sermon of today's Hollywood. If you have not seen it, do not worry about it. If you have, show courage and tell people how terrible it is. My wife, a minority in her own right, was offended by the inherent and endlessly racist message of the film. This film has nothing to do with the real world and can add little to any discussion of racism in this country. Instead, it is cheap sensational nonsense that progresses as a deep and thought provoking. What kind of bubble should you live in to think that this is impressive at all?
