I absolutely hated this movie. Despite the fact that the film wanted to convey some kind of social message, it was made in such a cliche and melodramatic way as the Mexican soap opera. <br /> <br /> In addition, the actress was terrible, especially Charitin and her son. This is one of the problems with Dominican films, they use celebrities who cannot even act just to attract the masses. <br /> <br /> I am even more ashamed of the positive feedback, which, unfortunately, means that the Dominicans are simply indulgent about what is being done here, instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry on quality.
