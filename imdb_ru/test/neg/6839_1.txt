Ridiculous terrible. You would think that all the eminent actors involved in this film, at least, will make it believable, but they do not - this is a bitch. <br /> <br /> Characters either run around without a good reason to find out where they are going, or they stand, constipating, when they need to run after their lives. <br /> <br /> Check your higher brain functions at the door if you want to try this movie. Or collect a bunch of your most intelligent friends and hold a session with him "Mystery Science Theater 3000". This is what I did in the second half of this turkey. <br /> <br /> And PLEASE, do not confuse this with the magnificent film "The Day of the Jackal", far superior thriller 30 years ago.
