It was terrible, vicious and full of the worst cliches and racial stereotypes that I have seen in a long time. Seeing how Hayden P tried to act in the "ghetto" was painful (hello, one leg on his pants and several braids downs do not make you "loosen"). Solange Knowles pretty much grimaces throughout the film. Most of the recruitment sequences look like they were shot in cardboard boxes ... what happened to the final ??? And poor Rihanna was simply exploited to make people watch her “act”, which she cannot. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this film “Downs” does not even deserve one star. Please put this tired franchise to rest. Or at least do the following Bring It On IV: cheerleaders against Freddie and Jason.
