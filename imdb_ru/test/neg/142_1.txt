This movie is over! I’m sad to say that I’ll be able to watch the first 15 minutes of this movie and anything else, I’ll have to force myself to sit down and watch the rest of the movie. This is completely stupid and very fake. The robot in the film looks like a man wearing a steel suit, and the acting is really bad, especially the one that plays the character "Alien." Don't waste your money watching this sequel to the popular Gen-X Cops. I would rather sleep or spend money on other things, rather than watch this movie. 1 out of 10. If possible, I would give 0.
