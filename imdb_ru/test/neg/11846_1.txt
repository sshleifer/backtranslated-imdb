First of all, I would like to clarify that I consider this film one of the funniest that I have ever seen. I watched it almost 10 times just because I wanted to convey the delightfully tasteless insides of this film to other unsuspecting victims. It has the exciting essence of hand-recording from the nephew's seventh birthday camera. It contains all the records of the match WWE. And most of all, it has a consistency of face scratched along the sidewalk. This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the almost instantaneous injury of three drunk teenagers in the desert. This scene convinced me that I stumbled upon something big when I took this film from a DVD stand (tied to a box because of a velociraptor pattern screaming the word “RAPTOR” on the front panel). The scene contains such treasures as tomato sauce, spaghetti in the intestines, vain attempts at humor and rubber dinosaur dolls that repeat throughout the film. This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The film contains unpredictable backgrounds and the use of props that make a person melt at the thought that someone might feel so little shame when it comes to making a film. For example, when a truck is parked in the middle of the night near a rocky wall. The very next day they find him in an open grassy area. The driver could not come there, as his face was bitten off by an unnamed two-legged predator (I will explain why it is unnamed in a second). Thus, I can only assume that either Velosiraptor managed it, or livestock that the driver carried, did it, or Jim Winsky did not value his viewers very highly. Hell, in one part, they expect me to believe that they are walking along the main street at night, when there are no gutters on the road, the fire hydrant is not securely located next to the phone booth, and there is only one street lamp. However, I feel obliged to watch and re-watch this film, just to find more things that make me giggle the next time I watch it. This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The direction of this film is terrible. Long long pauses. Strange cuts for characters that weren’t even next to a conversation. People discuss things by chance when they are facing the camera (and, in turn, make them look at the wall). They cannot even give a dinosaur a coherent look, going between calling it a small dinosaur, and using a velociraptor rubber puppet (featuring a very long, thick, disproportionate claw). This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Editing of this film takes a prominent place. This is not a good thing. I am well aware that the film is a collection of scenes from other films that are skillfully collected in one piece of shit, but there must be a limit! Plots end as suddenly as they began. The explanations for the sudden disappearance of the characters are not limited, well, in general, are not explained! And the final, like driving a muscle car into a brick wall without a seat belt. You just never know what will happen, because the film does not follow a consistent structure. This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Now I’ll just mention one scene (the biggest one) that happens near the end. This is a spoiler, but not quite. The final scene includes a showdown between Tyrannosaurus and Sheriff Tanner. This is similar to the battle between Sigourney Weaver and the Alien Queen in Aliens, except that it does not have all the emotional power / budget / epic battle. It consists of the fact that Tanner rammed a dinosaur with a piece of construction equipment. White Ginger Cat For a few minutes, through a series of secretly sliding cuts, the director manages to turn this white lynx into a yellow forklift / crane, like a typewriter. Now, as I said, I know that this film is made from scenes from other films, but which two films require a showdown with t-rex in a construction machine? This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> This film gets 1/10 of the quality of filmmaking, but gets 10 thanks for how much it makes me laugh and have fun.
