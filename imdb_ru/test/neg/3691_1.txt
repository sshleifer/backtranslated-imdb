After watching this film, I decided that it was so terrible that I should join IMDb and write a review to warn other people about possible failures when renting / buying this film. To be fair to the film, there is only one good section in this film, and these are the final credits, because then you know that this shit is good and really finished. I watched it to the end in the hope that I could get a little pleasure from the film. Itâ€™s just that tunnels are bigger than tunnels, and the old man talks to himself (if you watch this movie too many times, you too). As for Val, if he continues to choose such films, he can also kiss his acting career goodbye. It makes no sense to even write about what is in the film, since this has already been done. Keep your money and sanity and keep yourself clean.
