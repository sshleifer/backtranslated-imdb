Jack Frost 2 was a terrible, terrible, sadly pitiful excuse for continuing the great movie. Initially, there was a budget horror film of the comedy about the dead, which was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste. And the snowman walked, killing people and avoiding hair dryers, such as the plague. This, however, was far from the quality of the original. It seems that it even had a lower budget, because for some reason, after an hour in this film, I still did not see a snowman. He gets some revenge if he is always in the form of ice cubes with a gentle voice-over and a little shaking of the cooler in which he rests to revive the character. Disappointing in disbelief, even a lover of a bad movie.
