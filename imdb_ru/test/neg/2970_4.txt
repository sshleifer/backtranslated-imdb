42/100. He is often called "Tarzan in clothing", but he is not in the same league as his superior series Tarzan. In fact, the Jungle Jim series was a substitute for Tarzan for Johnny Weismuller after he began to lose his uniform for a loincloth. In the jungle, Jim is fully dressed. This can not be compared with the Tarzan series in terms of actions, scenarios or quality of production. This is pretty funny stuff. This is the first of the best in the series, and it says little. Too many videos are being used, and this is so obvious. The score is too high, the plot is lame, and the production is so bad that it is sometimes difficult to watch.
