Love Life explores a very culturally significant scenario of marriage between a lesbian and a gay. I found the subject convincing, even if the conflict was a little forced and too easily resolved. For example, Thomas falls in love with Joe too quickly and conveniently for the plot. There are a lot of continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses ... most of all, I got the fact that Joe's hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene. In the end, I was more interested in this film than in motion. Stephan D. Gill has a rather beautiful body and shows everything quite a few times with a porn star skill and abundance, and all too often acts chops to match. Many times, the movie seems like he's going to go full-on porn. Stephanie Kirchen does an excellent job with her work, but her moment of enlightenment at the end was a little tainted for me, since I was in the mood for a good fuss in my heart by the end of this film.
