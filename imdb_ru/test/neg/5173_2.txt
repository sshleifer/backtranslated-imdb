Having more than a few helpers, I suggest checking out the Rise of the Footsoldier, and in the end I came to him last night. Undoubtedly, the story that Colton Leach has to tell (and did so in his autobiography) is a convincing story about the ascension of one man from Terrasny Boot to the associated villain from the underworld. This film, unfortunately, has been compromised in quality by mistakes, terrible accents and terrible play. Ritchie Harnett, in the lead role of the Lich, does a reasonable job of moving from banditry to serious offender, but his accent is everywhere. As his voice provides the narration, this is what in ten minutes drove me crazy. Terry Stone in the role of Tony Tucker provided an unintended comedy with a badly fitting wig (or the worst of all that happened to Barnett), which was so perceptive that it bordered on juvenile and excessive passion in delivery, reducing Tucker to parody. This film was that the events preceding the shooting in Rattenden, Essex and the years of the formation of the Lich, are of real interest to fans of crime and football hooliganism, so sabotage this story due to the lack of credible accents and acting skills left me feeling it was possible missed Roland Manukyan and Frank Harper provide films with only a source of authenticity. On the positive side, some of the films went and built well and held attention. Violence was well delivered, and apart from being overly dependent on red syrup for spraying blood in general, it was realistic. If you liked the movie, then it's worth seeing how Essex Boys tells a similar story from a made-up point of view, as well as with Billy Murray.
