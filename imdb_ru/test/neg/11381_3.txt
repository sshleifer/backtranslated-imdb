The Ghost Son is Lamberto Bava's best movie, and at the same time his worst movie. I believe that this statement requires a little clarification. This is his best because it is well-directed, ambitious, affordable and very stylish, but its worst, because it is a boring, non-original film and, no doubt, a huge disappointment for all true fans of the past efforts of Bava. Let's face it: many fans, including myself, would not be interested in this film, judging by the plot, the famous names attached to it, and even the boring sound. The only motivation here was Lamberto Bava, who brought us a large number of Jally's tangled movies and funny splashes in the past. “Ghost Son” is a little from his film about the return, along with “The Executioner”, and although the latter is certainly not a very good film, it at least justifies the expectations of his fans, with excessive amounts of dirt and blood and sadism. The Ghost Son is a weak and unbearably soft horror film, even in terms of basic ghost stories. The emphasis is too much on sentimentality, and this is bad for an already limited number of horrific and terrible atmospheric moments. The basic premise may contain one or two potentially good ideas, but the film is generally boring and too mediocre. John Hannah and Laura Harring play the main role of a happy couple living on a remote ranch in South Africa and raising horses for life. Joy and happiness could not improve, so naturally something tragic must happen, and it happens. Mark dies in a car accident, but inconsolable Stacy stays at the ranch, where she is in constant contact with Mark's spirit. She even becomes pregnant with her child, but soon after the birth of Martin's child, mysterious events begin to occur. It seems that Mark’s restless and selfish ghost has “captured” the child and uses it to induce Stacey to commit suicide. Despite the fact that all attention is focused on the relationship of the couple, many events and plots are underdeveloped and / or remain unexplained, like the background of the young servant Tandi. Too little action, and the only true fear moments are too clearly borrowed from classic films such as The Exorcist and The Rosemary's Baby (vomiting green slime, self-propelled furniture ??). To speak clearly in terms of the terrible entertainment “The Ghost Son” is a painful misfire, but I must say, this is a wonderful and charming failure. Cinematography is extremely elegant, and many camera angles are really inventive and thought-provoking. A whimsical score sometimes even manages to create an ominous atmosphere, although nothing happens on the screen. There are some wonderful images of South African wildlife to admire, but if that interests you, I suppose you'd better watch National Geographic. Not much to recommend here. Fans of atmosphere-controlled ghost stories have much better choices, and persistent Bava fanatics are advised to (repeatedly) watch Demons, Creepy, or Blades in the Dark.
