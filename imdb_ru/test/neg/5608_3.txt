Simply put, these films have no meaning. Just take my word for it and save time when it's a complete miracle! I would say that the characters are one-dimensional, but that would mean that the characters had some kind of development. I thought Eric Roberts was going to jump out at any second, it was so close to the status of B-Movie. <br /> <br /> The girl from the 70s is beautiful ... but if you are not a fan of her type of pursuer, nobody needs this film. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Avoid ... Avoid <br /> <br /> This movie was right on DVD for the reason ... that ... it was a train wreck !!!
