This is a good movie if it will be made by schoolchildren for their friends. This far below the limits can be called "professional." There is no plot, no acting, and the visual image looks as if you see it through a plastic film. I was so glad that I had the FF button on my remote, 32x worked very well. I understand that everyone needs to start somewhere, but this should not be a reason to bring it to the public. If you have problems with quality and budget - “Open Water” was made for $ 60,000, and more than half went to the guy who provided security in the ocean and trained sharks. And this film looks 100 times more professional, and it was an event in Indian filmmaking.
