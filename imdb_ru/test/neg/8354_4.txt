The daughter of a wealthy businessman who suffered rheumatic fever in her childhood and now suffers from shortness of breath, discovers that her marriage with a charming girl arranged by her father (whom she affectionately calls Darling) even worse, she can only have a few weeks left, and her husband will be able to marry his cunning romantic rival. Clean bed. The script by Paul Osborne (from Jerome Weidman's fine story) reveals redundant memories in the second half instead of a continuation of the plot, which immerses the already soapy script into dark conversations. Why go back when we can understand what is happening for ourselves? This is a "female crying" without faith in its target audience, so everything is simplified. Dorothy McGuire, covered with furs for most of the picture, is not at all a clever, clever heroine; when she is upset, she turns inward and becomes rocky. Realizing that her marriage is basically a hoax, she shies away from her husband as a perfect virgin (well, maybe she and Van Johnson sleep in different beds after all!). Ruth Roman has the best moments of the film as a public shark with its Van trap, but what exactly do these women see in him? Johnson can be charming when necessary, but put him in a melodramatic setting, and he too will become stony. MGM's production is valued just this way, but director Gottfried Reinhardt is trying to add a visual flavor to the memories and is trying to revive the first half hour of the film. ** from ****
