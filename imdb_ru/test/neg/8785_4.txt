Wow. I mean, wait. I mean, wow, wow. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie as early as eight years old in 1996. Then CGI films were rare; and the more so good. In addition, then we listened to things called CD players. But I digress. I used to like this film very much, and until I watched it, I still had very pleasant memories of it. Hi, this is Don Blut! Anyone who hates "All dogs go to heaven" is clearly a robot. But, again, I digress. <br /> <br /> Then I saw it again. It really is not one of his best, I can say now, eleven years later. I saw a lot more movies and I gained a little more knowledge. Now, of course, the voice acting is good, I'll give it to them. The story is in ... well. I mean, we see it all the time. LOT. But it works. Music numbers annoy me. It would be more at home in the eighties, with such musical numbers. In 1996, most children's films had epic numbers, such as The Lion King (which came out about a year ago, but it doesn't matter) or something like that. Here you will find a vaudeville show. <br /> <br /> Animation hurts too. Sometimes changeable, and in others completely changing the style and format with the change of frame, it is really difficult not to notice. <br /> <br /> I still like “All dogs go to heaven,” but it could have been better. <br /> <br /> 4/10
