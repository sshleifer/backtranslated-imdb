This is as stupid as possible. <br /> <br /> The classic case of two-dimensional characters, which always act exactly the opposite of what a normal person would do in the same situation. It reminds me of a scene in The Dread Movie, where Carmen Electra is fleeing the killer. There are two signs, one with the inscription "in safety", the other - "in certain death" (I read from memory). <br /> <br /> And, as in “The Terrible Movie,” the characters always run in the direction marked “Sure death”. <br /> <br /> Why did the girl start to light the fire at the ticket office and keep the door closed? She chose to die in the fire rather than be killed by a guy? Why, after cutting and overpowering the driver, did they put him in a chair and make him watch the wounded man, and not just shoot him or at least knock him out? He ran for their friend and killed him a minute ago, but they have doubts. Oh, a hundred more things ... <br /> <br /> If this film were expensive, you would not be able to drive through a single yard because of the holes. Everything is so far-fetched, sometimes it starts to cause physical pain. <br /> <br /> Add to this ruthlessly replaying “actors” and a small budget, and that's what you get. Looking at the rating and comments, I feel that these people are watching a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is really missing is the infamous red box with the While It Hasn't Been Tools - a film about which unreal plots and stupid behavior of characters are similar.
