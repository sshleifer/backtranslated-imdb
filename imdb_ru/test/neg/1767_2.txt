First of all, I'm a big fan of Alien and Alien II - in my opinion, both of these films created and defined the Si-Fi horror genre as we know it today. I noticed that Lifeforce was often compared to the alien saga â€” after watching this movie, I would strongly disagree. There are some good special effects with alien vampires, and the storyline might be acceptable. I just can't get past the naked woman's space vampire throughout the entire movie, this is absolutely absurd (although she looks good). Add in a bunch of bad British actors, and this is pretty much FINISHED. Most of the film ends in London or somewhere in England, so after the first 20 minutes you lose the tuning of outer space and lose hope for some real fighter and waiting for Si-Fi.
