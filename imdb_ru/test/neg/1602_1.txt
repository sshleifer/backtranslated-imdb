I thought that the sleeping cell was interesting and exciting, right down to the last episode, when nothing happens, its F ****** BS, you Americans depict Muslims as terrorists, and Americans as heroes, on the contrary. I hate when every American TV show ends predictably, I was hoping that the bombs would explode at this stadium, but I knew it wasn’t, it’s just fun to watch, when you know the good guys go to save this day, again Americans are the biggest terrorists, Mr. Bush, the leader of all these groups, he is to blame on September 11, and I am very glad that you keep throwing these shows at us, which are all damn the same! I have a good show about terrorism, they call it Whitehorse, and he himself is the leader of the cell, the same with 24, as always was 24, the sleeping cell is a mockery, and you should never do season 2, it's F * * *** joke! and you, too, are American producers.
