Possible warning spoiler, although not so much to spoil this movie. I saw Project A Part II without seeing the first film. I don't think I missed a lot. A Part Two is not only the worst Jackie Chan film I've ever seen (yes, worse than Fantasy Mission Force), this film is one of the most unattractive films the world has ever seen. It's right there with Plan 9 from space on a dream scale. The plot is twisted and tied, like a 50-foot ball of yarn, which the cat played with, and finally went to death. Humor, if you can call it that, seems to have been written by an annoying new high school student who, despite what many say to him that he is not funny, is determined to throw out unconvincing humor no matter how painful a movie was made, and this movie is terribly bad. Jackie Chan is involved in the conspiracy as a navy officer recruited by the police to collect "all known criminals." He rounds them up in the first half hour of the film, and I prayed for a quick end, which I did not get. Why the film hinders progress from now on, I have no idea. The film stretches and unfolds without any purpose, without a plot, and humor attempts that fail so miserably make the Carrot Top look like a comedy genius. Kung Fu in this film is lame and forgotten. In this film, the best kung fu about 3 children ninja. Project Part II is neither a fighter nor a kung-fu movie, but nevertheless it is a complete waste of the talents of Jackie Chan and Maggie Cheung, who made the world of films superior to him. When Jackie Chan constantly avoids certain death, I enter the Blair Witch mode, asking (and wishing): â€œHe will die NOW so that the film can end? `. An example of how ridiculous this film is: Jackie Chan is handcuffed to another man. A gang of pirates (who are not at all like pirates) throw axes at Jackie. Does Jackie grab one of the wayward axes and break the chain in handcuffs? Not! You see that it would spoil the gag of his handcuffs to another person. If you have a friend who laughs at everything, I urge you to watch this movie with him or her, and watch how even they will not laugh from this movie. If you suffer from insomnia, this film will surely put you to sleep. Do not work with heavy equipment while viewing plan A, Part II. Possible side effects include headache, retinal strain and death from boredom. 0/9 Stars
