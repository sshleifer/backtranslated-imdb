I received this film in a package called “50 films of all stars” for $ 18 (45 cents each). Many are good. This one was terrible. It was a beaten restoration, done 1000 times earlier and better each time. A crippled ex-athlete dares to train a team of juvenile offenders. They learn from him that they can do it if they play by the rules. I am sure that the children and local people were delighted with the fact that they were included in a “real television film”, but I can not imagine that the guys who launched and produced this project decided that they could bring this That difficult question. I kept waiting to see this “new turn” or “new corner”, but, frankly, it does not come. Avoid this movie. Forget about 45 cents, I want to return 96 minutes of my life.
