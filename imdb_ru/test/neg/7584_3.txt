Experienced professionals live in an exotic and dangerous place. They get drunk every night. They are smuggling opium. They drop pigs on parachutes. They fly in incredibly dangerous conditions. They dress strangely and behave strangely. They are iconoclastic, outrageous. They violate all the rules of command and despise their employers in the CIA. They are irreplaceable. <br /> <br /> No. This is not "Only angels have wings", and this is not "M * A * S * H". This is not an easy mix of the two, which, unfortunately, looks rather silly than ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It focuses on shock, entertainment and education, but doesn’t really achieve its goals. <br /> <br /> As for his shock value, well, we are already trained, right? Is it really shocking that a group of hard-working pilots performed secret missions in Laos in the 1970s? No, it is not shocking. Even in our present conditions, when it would be interesting to learn that some kind of militarized excursion is NOT buried in the folder with the inscription “National interest, defense de Toucher”, it is not even educational. This is normal. Thus, we are a little embellished and not so shocking and not so stupid. <br /> <br /> The problem in this case is that the film depends on these very qualities, as its ability to amuse. Without this, the film explodes. A group of shaggy drunk pilots of the CIA are sitting idle in the cat's house, strolling girls, firing pistol lights with a silencer, killing them with lizards. Asks new pilot Robert Downey Jr: "When you guys act like that, then you have something to celebrate?" Another replies, shouting: "No, that means it's night time." It can be fun if we expect the renegade pilots to be as honest as all of us. If we do not do this, then the gag, as in the film, will not work. <br /> <br /> Naturally, there are action scenes. Everything that can happen on an airplane or on an airplane takes place on an airplane or on an airplane. People fall out of them, luggage is accidentally thrown out of their hatches, engines fail, they get damaged by AAA, are torn apart during emergency landings, but we have seen much of it elsewhere, often better. <br /> <br /> Some may find it funnier than me, and the acting is pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. is especially effective as a natural. Check out other comments, and if they describe a movie that you may find attractive, be sure to watch it. There might be some laughter in it that eluded me.
