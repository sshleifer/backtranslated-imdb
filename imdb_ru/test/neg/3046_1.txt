This movie is bad. Really bad. So bad that I wanted to shoot myself in the forehead. I hated this movie. First, the story went absolutely nowhere, and something shocking in this film was seen in a 30-teaser trailer. Secondly, anyone who saw the original in 1979 knows that it was also a bad film and a completely unworthy remake. Of course, the best part of the film is the house in which it takes place. That says little about the movie itself. There were episodes in the film when the music becomes very tense and you are sure that someone is around the corner, and it turns out that this is a maid or a cat, but when someone is really around the corner, itâ€™s impossible to even get scared you expected all this the movie. So save money, save time, save yourself from headaches and just watch the trailer. There is absolutely no point in watching this film, either in the theater, or on DVD, or on television, never.
