I can't help but be completely annoyed by this comedy show. As if they didn't even bother trying to write a good comedy, just rephrase third-level jokes and hope that they will remain. Worst of all, it's all so damn uninteresting and lacking in all respects. <br /> <br /> Worse, the lead man Kevin James constantly has a smug smile “I'm so funny” that it would be tolerable if only once he was brought to the comedy department that he doesn't, he just lies there, doing nothing, like a big unfunny child. Which brings me to the relationship between Heffernan — easily the most insincere and poor-quality presentation of a married couple on any television show — is really a headache, provocatively unpleasant, Remini conducts the whole show as if in it there is violent work, even if it is next to her husband. Jerry Stiller, twitching a little laughing in the series, 100% repeats his role as Frank Kostanza in Seinfeld, but this time his hints mostly attack the water due to the inability of the central duo to recognize the joke, even if she flew past them, the episodes just float in the stream of non-existence, their work adds nothing, and their interaction is even worse. <br /> <br /> This is not even a waste of talent, there is no talent here, it is a creative desert laugh.
