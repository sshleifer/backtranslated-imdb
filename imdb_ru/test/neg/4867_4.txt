It all looked pretty promising. The novice adviser to the president was framed for a series of murders, since he was told that there was a plot in the White House. It stars superb Donald Sutherland among several capable actors. However, very few people have something to say about it. <br /> <br /> All this really needs some depth. You can catch the idea that the president is too left in his ideas, and some in the government want him dead to stop the implementation of these ideas. Konrad, it seems, just wants the country to govern its own way, and not by the elected leader. <br /> <br /> However, there were several logical holes in the battle scenes — the sewer pipes and elevators already mentioned, as well as the rather random method of killing — and Linda Hamilton’s character was completely uninspired. Its “president my father” “sabotage” was ridiculous - that would make the president around 10 when it happened. Worst of all was her predictable final scene with Bishop. <br /> <br /> They could have created a complex, resourceful political thriller, but they either failed or failed. They could go to town with special effects, but the good ones were wasted. They could achieve much more overall. It barely cost £ 1, it cost me.
