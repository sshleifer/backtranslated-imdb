My God, what an ugly mess! Revenge, incestuous love, mechanical battles like mechanical games, incessant and completely unnecessary violence, some primitive "music" knocking on amazed victims, big "surprises" (which actually tend to be the same "frank" as “National Enquirer” headlines), Add a few low-quality camera movements, pretending to be stylish and creative, and you've already impressed the crowd. The absolutely undeserved popularity of this film convincingly shows that the pop subculture of a very low level achieved success not only in recent decades, but also as the dominant taste of an impotent audience. (For a deeper understanding of human tolerance in mental illness, without the vulgar excesses of Oldboy, I recommend the older Dutch-French film Vanish.) <br /> <br /> Well, don’t believe there’s nothing good to say about this movie . Actually there is. (B) the famous scene in which the hero (actually a “hero”, an inveterate father who sleeps with his daughter and then tries to achieve oblivion, not ransom?) Eats a live octopus, benefits from the bright presence of the best cast: octopus itself. It is a pity that the poor beast, which they ate, could not survive his only action in order to get another useless diploma for the “best actor” at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Which festival, by the way, between Moore's propaganda nonsense and this incarnation of useless, although somewhat exotic, oddity, became a celebration of stupidity and ridiculousness. <br /> <br /> Sic Transit Gloria Mundi!
