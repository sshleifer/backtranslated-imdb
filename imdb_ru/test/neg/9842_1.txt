This movie is terrible. Not only is the story incredible, the situations in which the characters find themselves are so stupid that it does not shock. I am sad that Daisy Egan, the star of the Secret Garden on Broadway, decided that it would be a career move. The idea is interesting, two young girls very quickly come of age. But sex does not even excite. The film is stupid, the story is stupid, the performances are stupid, and the whole concept is interesting collapsing. I am sure that all 14-year-old girls deal with the guys after they had the first period, and tried to flush the panties down the toilet. Good luck next time guys. My scale * T-scale *
