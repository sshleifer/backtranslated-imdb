For the most part, is "Michael" a disaster ?? ten minutes of charm and ninety mistakes. <br /> <br /> Travolta and McDowell do their best, often rising above Nora Efron’s stunningly banal script But the movie moves like a snail. And even in the context of fantasy, characters behave incredibly on a regular basis. (Reporters who usually miss the story of a life — an apparent angel living on Earth — are hidden from view?) this is not tom hanks. The “climax” of the film redefines the invented word. Efron may be filmed here for paradise, but, unfortunately, “Michael” is a long, long journey through the cinema.
