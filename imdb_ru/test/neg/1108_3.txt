As someone already said, “Living Dead Dolls” were cute, and if they came out in the form of a new series of “Evil Things”, I would have bought one or two. Well, in principle, this film was gloomy, not in a terrible sense, but in the fact that I do not see a kind of way. And it was boring. Three women in the house, the youngest of them said that under no circumstances should one go to the forest (well, that didn’t drown), and it would be better if this advice were related to their death. And nobody does the cleaning or whitewashing or something, you might think that there will be a lot of cough. Sexy young mother, where you spend your time trying to determine her age (according to my calculations, 34 or 36). And it seems that more than 20 years have passed since someone lived there, so what happened to the young adult photographs of fathers on many of the old album? I am so tired of clichés, that I am just too lazy to write, and here they are thick and fast. Teenagers are stoned and drunk in the car, and you know what this leads to ... death and obvious deafness, since Tim seems not to notice the cries of his friends. I mean, I pushed many cars where the instructor didn't scream, and I heard them. Cliche is a strange man in the forest whom no one believes. The plumber who lived in them there has been parted for many years, and this is his first experience with the children mentioned, so, passing by, he avoids a pickaxe in which the young man looks at night ... run over him, idiot! Cliches ... wandering through the woods without a clue about where you're going, armed with the knowledge that children with a pickaxe (yes, again, they) are not in order. Senseless scene - cruelty to pigs ... why do many directors not see problems with injuries and animal killing? I would rather have the kids run up and bite people on the hips than this. Zombies do not seem to possess such energy in other films. Villain, how ineffective was he? His most part was in the store ... broke in and demanded that she be served first. What he was a man without events. Why not kill him earlier, before the family gets there, and avoid making a film or remake it differently. I give my grades to the house, the forest and the little gothic dolls that I want!
