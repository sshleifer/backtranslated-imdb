It is difficult to arouse any enthusiasm for this terrible cartoon saga, which for some reason has become a cult classic. This, of course, cannot be due to the completely artificial appearance of the scenery or the transparent action of the star composition. Nowadays it is shown too often on the Fox Movie Channel or in AMC. <br /> <br /> It hurts me to say that veteran actors such as Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine even participate in this confusing science fiction parody, none of which sound true. Itâ€™s like watching an expensive budget spent on a children's show on Saturday, full of cardboard characters and inconclusive dialogues. This is a comic version of Jules Verne's novel. <br /> <br /> Maturing Fontein was still attractive, but her face had a painful expression, perhaps regretting that she had taken on the role of a psychiatrist before reading the script. She does absolutely nothing for her cardboard role, except for the imperial and uncomfortable presence and most of the time looks completely out of place. No less good are Robert Sterling, Barbara Eden and - above all, Peter Lorre - as well as Frankie Avalon, who begins to sing the title melody, which - we can safely say - did not become a favorite title song. <br /> <br /> A terribly frustrating experience of watching such a film, which waste an attractive cast and is an insult to one's intelligence. Totally unconvincing from start to finish. The film, like the fantastic submarine, is sinking at the bottom of the sea long before the fight with the rubber octopus brings the film to a dismal end.
