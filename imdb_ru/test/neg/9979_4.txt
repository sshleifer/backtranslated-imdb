Caligula shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 Fellini Satirikon, with bizarre looks, freakishness and images of sexual excesses that are all present in the "glory" of ancient Rome. But Fellini is not ... First, it is not so interesting. Too much time on the screen is given to McDowell with rubber eyes in the lead role. His performance is too enchanting and indecent to be convincing. The portraits of Jay Robinson in "The Robe" (1953) and David Kane-Houghton in "Emperor Caligula" (1983) are much more convincing and believable, the latter being the most nuanced. Relief could reasonably be provided by more fully developing the surrounding characters. As such, they are slightly larger than ciphers. One example is the Macro role played by Guido Mannari, who plays a huge role on the screen in an important role, but mostly remains in the background. The only positive features worth mentioning are the clever use of some of Prokofiev’s and Stravinsky’s themes in a musical score and the inclusion of some unpleasant, but nevertheless, exact actions of the despot. These two factors are much smaller than what is needed to alleviate the prevailing boredom.
