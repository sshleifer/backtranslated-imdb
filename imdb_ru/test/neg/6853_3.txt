I have never been disappointed with the Kurosawa film, but this is probably the first. Doppelganger is the worst I've ever seen with this director. <br /> <br /> Tartan Films advertises this film as Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Most Scary Movie. What kind? The most frightening film of Kurosawa, of course, "Cairo". And if you think it's terrible, a surprise awaits you. It can not be classified as horror or thriller. This is drama, and pretty bad. Many of the scenes that were supposed to be shocking turned out to be funny, and most of the plot is really confusing. And since this is Kurosawa, the move is slow. But it is so slow that in forty minutes you will lose interest and want to do something else. I was most annoyed by the use of CGI. Now CGI, if used correctly, can be really cool. But if executed with a little caution ... It can be a disaster. I think one scene is described here in which very little CGI is used. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can give to Dopppelganger is that it plays really well. Koji Yakusho performs well with the rest of the cast. But itâ€™s pretty much ... <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and see Cairo or Ko-Rey if you want to be scared. This is a bad, bad attempt at a clever drama. Which is reasonable, but ... Well, a lot is missing here. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for a good game.
