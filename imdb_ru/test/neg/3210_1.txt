Now this is a real turkey from an overvalued director Franco, who gave us such classics as Las Vampiros / Vampyros Lesbos. Yes, I think bad movies can be very fun. I adore the cheerful howler Doris Wishman, Duane Esper and Ed Wood Jr., but this one turned out to be too big for me. This is the first film I rated. 1. Where should I start? The script is extremely idiotic. The dialogue is incredibly bad. Direction seems to be non-existent. The best musical replica (repeatedly used in this film) was taken directly from the film "Der Hexer" (1964). And it is boring! Poor Shirley Eaton and George Sanders! In one frame, Sanders reads the Popeye comic, while his minion torments the girl (this aspect is probably an intellectual feature of this film). The only thing that confused me was that Franco immediately showed female nudity, when I thought that the film would benefit from this - this is a real directorial skill! However, I am afraid that the film, in which the actors pretend to be shooting from machine guns, shaking them, is not really worth it.
