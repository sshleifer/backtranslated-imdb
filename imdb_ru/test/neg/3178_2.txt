In this film, NO Esperanto <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on purpose, because in IMDb, Esperanto is listed as one of the languages ​​used. But IMDb is wrong about the languages ​​used in this film. There is absolutely no Esperanto at all. This is almost all English with a couple of Navajo words. Do not watch this movie if you are looking for Esperanto movies. Other options instead are “Delight of the Idiot” (with Clark Gable), in which there is a bit of Esperanto, Incubus is all Esperanto (though completely wrong), and Charlie Chaplin has some Esperanto signs in The Great Dictator. In Gattak, there should also have been a conversation in Esperanto, but I never heard it. <br /> <br /> Besides this, another reviewer is right. This film is a complete mess. <br /> <br /> Spend time elsewhere.
