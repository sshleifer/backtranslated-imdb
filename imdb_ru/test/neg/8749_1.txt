Yes, in this film there is a girl named Jessica, who says that everything is evil, and she makes trees sit on people (well, she makes a tree fall only once, but she says that everything is evil). This film is about a farm that seems to rent rooms to people, but offers a little more in terms of entertainment. Jessica can find things with a stick, and she finds the head of an evil guy. Of course, they will not know about it until the farm owner opens the box with his head. His head continues to hypnotize anyone he can to get to Jessica and use her abilities to find things that will help him find his body. In this film, quite an interesting story, but here everything is very bad. Everyone in this film gets on your nerves at least once.
