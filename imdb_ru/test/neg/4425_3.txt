As many have described in detail here with a level of severity that I find funny, it is * not *: <br /> <br /> FILM. (a replica of dramatic music) <br /> <br /> This is just so bad - this is good, completely surreal, Jackie Chan is a trick for everyone. Female fighters are completely amazed, and Jackie is definitely put in his place. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you want to see with good friends on a Sunday afternoon - surrounded by lark, ready to roar with laughter, to cheer on the good guys, scold the bad guys and constantly shout, "WHAT?" when something totally strange happens. Great pleasure!!
