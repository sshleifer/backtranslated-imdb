Found this movie in a $ 10 DVD discount rack. It was not worth it. Part of the camera and dialog box look and sound as if they were made by a student of the film. Sandraâ€™s performance was somewhat believable, but the film was predictable and the action was unclear and protracted. <br /> <br /> However, I will give them one thing. Unlike most militants, people in this film really ran out of ammunition and killed corpses for new weapons and ammunition.
