When I went to see this film, it was already a forced choice, since my original intention was sold out. what followed was pure horror, this film is so bad that I could hardly bear it. the story does not deserve to be mentioned; the gay goalkeeper forms a gay football team to play against his old team, which, having discovered his sexual orientation, caused him a lot of trouble. Loaded with unbearably old and overly used gay stamps, the subtle plot perfectly matches senseless dialogues ... it’s amazing that actors like a nutritionist or Charlie Hübner spend their talent and time on such nonsense. 1/10
