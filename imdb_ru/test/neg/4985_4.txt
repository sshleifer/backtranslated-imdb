Jason Lee is doing well to give this dog a fleeting promise, but not enough to distinguish him from any other soft family comedy. <br /> <br /> In this adventure in the CG genre dedicated to live action, the disgraceful police dog (Jason Lee) turned into a super-dog in an accident in the laboratory of the intrigue of scientist Dr. Simon Barsinister (Peter Dinklage). Underdog begins to save the city, trying to keep his identity a secret - the task, given that he can talk and fly. <br /> <br /> A strange gag makes you smile, but human assistants Underdog (James Belushi and Alex Neuberger) like father and son are just as boring as the predictable storyline. One for kids too young to see Superman. Or Spiderman. Or even a shaggy dog?
