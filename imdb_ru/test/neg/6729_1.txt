The films of Steven Seagal have not been very good lately, but this has been much worse since the days of the Patriot. The plot does not make sense that it is always like this; it is never clear what the relationship between characters is, who works for whom or who twice crosses whom. The film is completely divided, each scene seems to confuse the story, rather than pushing it forward. Even the action sequences are not inspired, and difficult to follow. Most of the blame must lie at the feet of the director, not even understanding the basics of filmmaking, but Seagal does not neglect the ease, as one of the producers of this film, he must also share the blame. Oh, and I didn't even mention how awful the game is, even by Seagal's standards. Even without looking at the video, it is not worth watching even Seagal fans. Give it a wide place!
