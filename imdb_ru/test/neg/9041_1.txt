*** SPOILERS *** This film, called EATEN ALIVE here in the UK, is probably the worst film ever made and great just for that. Sexy rich girl teamed up with a rude man to find his sister in the jungles of New Guinea. What follows is an incredibly crappy mixture of cannibalism, insane cults and religious maniacs that you need to see to be believed. The scenes of cannibalism are pretty awful, but they are so poorly organized and act that they are pretty funny. The cast is terrible, with the exception of Janet Agren as the lead woman who is superb. Look for the scene where she is stripped naked and covered in gold paint! My rating is 1 out of 10.
