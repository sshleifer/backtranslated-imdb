I would like to make it clear that I am not at all religious. I am an atheist, but I could see that Richard Dorkins was contradicting himself again and again. I would also like to say that I am not one of those people who constantly argue with something with philosophy, but I feel that, comparing science and religion, we should be philosophical and willing to question the belief in basic science. and also to question religious beliefs. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Richard Dorkins will spend some time on philosophical reflection on faith, anyone who has long and hard thinking about science and religion, will understand that science is really a religion in itself. Yes, there is a fundamental difference between the way scientific beliefs are held in comparison with other religions, but at the core of it lies belief in a certain human instinct. <br /> <br /> In this series of articles, Richard insists that scientific methods are the only correct way of thinking, and that it makes sense to believe in something only if the evidence of this is convincing enough. If you dive deep enough into how science functions, you will realize that it is as irrational as religion, and that it boils down to faith at the end, faith in evidence, faith in our sanity, faith in our feelings, but more Above all, there is still faith in our instinct to follow patterns of repetition. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to explain, but think about how the laws of physics were solved, because they were and still are the most common patterns of repetition. what we know. I think that people have an instinct that makes them believe that the longer something stays in a certain state or place of existence, the more we simply assume from a blind FAITH that it is more likely to remain so. For example, we do not expect that tomorrow gravity will suddenly work the other way around, by that I mean repulsion of matter, as it is supposed to, for its attraction. But the only reason we do not expect this sudden change is that we knew for so long that it always attracted, as far as we know. However, this does not mean that he cannot do the same thing tomorrow or even now. No matter how long something can remain in a certain state or change, there is no reasonable reason to make assumptions about it, but we do it out of instinct. I would ask you to think about what is such a long and short period of time? This does not happen, I do not know exactly how long it took these supposed sages to decide that everything should be made of matter, sound, light, etc. But let's give them what they consider to be the ultimate way! Say, much longer than it was 12.00000000000 years old! Is it a long period of time? 999999999999999 make 12.00000000000 years an incredibly short period of time. As far as we know, over the next trillions of years there can be significant changes in the so-called laws of science. It’s all a matter of comparison, only when we compare things, can we say “this is long” or “this is short.” The same with big and small, wide and thin, heavy and light, strong and weak and others. <br /> <br /> I doubt that any scientist could tell me why they think it makes sense to trust this instinct. Of course, I do not understand why this is so, but this does not mean that we, humanity, should definitely stop using it. With this in mind, the most hypocritical commentary that Richard Dorkins made was when he said that faith is irrational, "a process of not thinking," he said. If what we have in this instinct, which I described, and this instinct, which we all possess at some level, is not faith, then I do not know what the hell is this. In other cases, when he is hypocritical, he talks about the religions of the Bronze Age, about the "myths of the Bronze Age," he says. I would like to note that no matter how many scientific methods have changed over the years thanks to experience, experimentation and evaluation, the pure rules of science are getting older and older! They can even be called the sacred bible of science. He continued to talk about how he was tired of the stubbornness of various religions: “I am right, he is wrong,” but, looking back at how rude he was to different respondents, he seems to be as stubborn as he himself is. Honestly, at least he is not trying to bomb religious communities. I appreciate his hatred of certain religious beliefs that spawns the war, but I do not respect his arrogance in my own convictions. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, Richard has the right to believe in science if this is his way. I am also from a scientific point of view, but I do not think that he has the right to approach religious leaders with unfriendly arguments, trying to impose his opinion on them and in fact characterize them as stupid. Despite all his education, experience and discoveries, he does not seem to have the wisdom to properly cast doubt on his own belief system. I read what he says in defense of this argument, which was put forward by an unbiased atheist, such as my own statement. What he says tells me that he completely misses the point. <br /> <br /> Finally, the title of the documentary, The Root of All Evil. It states that religion is the root of all evil, this is not true. There are causes of evil that have nothing to do with religion. <br /> <br /> Everything around the documentary series was frustrating, narrow-minded, hypocritical and useless rubbish.
