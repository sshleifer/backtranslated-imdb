This film comes with "Gli fumavano le Colt ... lo chiamavano Camposanto", and both films leave much to be desired in the form of their DVD prints. Firstly, both films are very dark - sometimes it is difficult to understand what exactly is happening. Secondly, none of the films have subtitles, and you are forced to watch a dubbed film - although Il Prezzo del Potere seems to have the best duplicate. Personally, I always prefer subtitles, but for non-purists this is not a problem. These problems with the DVD, however, are not the fault of the original filmmakers - just an indifferent package, sold four decades later. <br /> <br /> As for the film, this is about the assassination of President Garfield. This is a MAJOR problem, as Van Johnson looks like Garfield just like Judy Garland. In no case is he similar to Garfield. He misses his beard, he has the wrong hair color and style, and he doesn't even come close (believe me, I am an American history teacher, and we get paid to know such things!). In real life, Garfield was a general of the Civil War and looked like guys out of cough boxes Smith Brothers. In addition, the use of some other actor to voice Johnson in dubbing is simply surreal. Never before or since has Van Johnson sounded so simple macho! He was a good actor ... but, of course, not a convincing general or macho president. <br /> <br /> In addition to the stupid casting, President Garfieldâ€™s death is not at all like this movie. Obviously, the filmmakers are actually cashing in on crazy assumptions about conspiracies about the death of John F. Kennedy, not Garfield. Garfield was shot dead in Washington, DC (not in Dallas), a lonely armed man with serious mental problems, and not a group of men with rifles. However, according to most experts, in fact, Garfield was killed (more than two months later) by incompetent doctors who examined and examined to get a bullet (to no avail), and never worried about cleaning hands or tools in the process. In other words, like George Washington (who was mostly killed by repeated bleeding in pneumonia), he died due to malpractice. In the film, they got nothing right ... except that President Garfield was actually shot dead. <br /> <br /> Since the film is almost not like a real story, it resembles a history lesson taught by someone from another planet. or someone with a serious brain injury. Why don't you turn on ninjas, fighting robots and Greek gods while you're there?!?! Besides some decent acting and production values, because the script is complete nonsense, I do not recommend anyone to watch this. This is just a complete and total mess.
