Harmony Korine. I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film. If this turned my good feeling of the day into a night of disturbing memories, then I think he would succeed. <br /> <br /> I know that in this film big questions were raised: who are we really, who are we? here, is God really. All great questions, but I really don’t think it is funny when you have questions along with such a tragedy. I depict all real life, but come on. It is never funny when a wife is raped, someone kills herself (and family and friends find the body), and people die for inexplicable and unnecessary reasons. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is good in this film is that the location was filmed. There are many beautiful places. <br /> <br /> I am not a student of the film and I don’t even know much about this subject, I admit it, but I know that when I leave the theater with a feeling of disgust, then it was not a film that I would recommend to everyone.
