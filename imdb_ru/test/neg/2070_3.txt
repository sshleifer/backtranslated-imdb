The plot for such a film is a distribution. How can you make a mistake with the gay storyline and with all the colors and music of India - such a story is written by itself. I will watch anything, but it was impossible to observe. The sad thing is that white people are the brightest in the film. Vanessa was a riot with a muzzle, like a sailor, and Jack was just amazing, but everyone else was so boring. Said Jeffrey, who was exceptional in My Beautiful Landrette, did what he could, but the story was so boring. The grace of salvation was really the background music that allowed you to laugh at the film, not at the film or not at all. There are many other best gay films, ethnic films, just plain movies. I give a lot of low-budget films, but this should not have been done or should have been done by someone else.
