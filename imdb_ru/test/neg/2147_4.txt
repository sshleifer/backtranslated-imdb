I do not know which of them was first released earlier in 1970. The cannon for Cordoba is the "European Western" made in Spain. This means that it is significantly inferior to the so-called "Western Spaghetti" Sergio Leone and the real American masterpieces of John Ford, Sam Peckinpap, Howard Hyuga, John Sturges and Anthony Mann. This order should not be interpreted, since all the westerns of John Ford are better than all performed by Sam Pekipan. I think 100 IMDb disassemble them all very well. <br /> <br /> Casting is the worst in this firm. George Peppard is suitable for the role of sergeant, Raff Valone for the Mafia Kapo, and Giovanna Rally for Puttana on the Piazza Vennesia in the sixties in Rome.
