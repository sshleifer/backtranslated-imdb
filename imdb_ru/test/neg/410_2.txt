This criticism tells the story of four little friends who went to see the movie “Angels and Demons” on the first night when it came out, although it was a school night because “Angels and Demons are worth it”. Two out of four read the book. Of those who did not, the guy wore pink skinny jeans. It was the least intense part of the evening after watching the disgusting Angels and Demons. <br /> <br /> The film begins in the laboratory where antimatter is created while another process is underway. And, apparently, someone knows about this or something. Notice how embarrassed I am ... I don’t understand what happened: they just did antimatter. Vittoria finds his father dead ... WHAT? The Illuminati symbol sent to Langdon is the SEAL, not the burn of someone's chest. They take out the X-33 scene. They remove Maxmilian Kohler. They, to a large extent, remove CERN and its associated symbols. They take out Hasasin and replace him with a religious British dude. They take out the Diamond Illuminati. They clean the scene of Vittoria's rape. They take the battle of Langond with Hasasin (now the British dude on the crack). They take out the press dude, following them around. They endure the death of the fourth cardinal. They take away the fact that the Camerlengo becomes Pope. They take out the grand design of the Camerlengo. They remove Langdon from a helicopter and land on this island near the end. They take away the fact that Vittoria's father was a scientific priest. They remove the fun of Langdon and, unfortunately, they remove the sexual attractiveness of Vittoria. <br /> <br /> In addition to the film, which completely loses the focus of detail, the film is terribly filmed. Admittedly, however, there were some good things. For example, rest in the Sistine Chapel had to be extremely difficult, and it was very well done. The explosion scene was SMART. Besides, SCREW OF THIS FILM FOR DESTRUCTION OF A BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T READ IT.
