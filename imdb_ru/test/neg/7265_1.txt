In short, this film is a declaration of artistic bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> Almodovar is the most important European cinematographer of the 1980s and 1990s. No other living director has shaped the style and content of contemporary European cinema more than he. Therefore, it is not easy to say that his recent efforts are not just another disappointment after two dull films, but rather a complete and complete disaster, confirming that he ran out of ideas, lacked humor and, worst of all, sympathy for the characters he creates. <br /> <br /> This is not due to the complexity of the story. All films of Almodovar are almost impossible to summarize. This time, in fact, is quite easy if you are familiar with his earlier work. “Broken hugs” is a remake of “The Law of Desire”, only this time the director is direct, and the jealous lover is a millionaire. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are not familiar with this film, I am doing a resume. If you don’t want to know too much, skip this paragraph. A blind man who used to be a famous director seduces a sexy, sexy woman who reads his newspaper after a chance meeting on the street (yes, that’s how it all begins). That's when his agent and best friend visit him. He mentions to her that he learned from a newspaper that a certain millionaire died, that he takes a story 14 years ago. He can still see and is going to make his next film. He plays the main role of the inexperienced mistress of the aforementioned millionaire, as he immediately impressed her. The millionaire learns about his romance with the help of silent videos made by his gay son, which he synchronized with the translator (several wonderful scenes: Cecilia Roth). After fierce quarrels, the mistress escapes with the director at the seaside resort, where he learns that the millionaire who produced the film, released it in the worst form, destroying the director's reputation. The couple decides to return, but gets into an accident in which the director is blinded, and the future actress dies. Returning now, he learns that his agent has retained the negatives of the film and begins to restore it. <br /> <br /> As in “Poor education”, there are various auxiliary subjects to reinforce this rather thin story, and as in “Poor education”, the result is rather confusing than satisfactory. For example, the son of an agent who works as a DJ has an accidental drug overdose - which is completely unnecessary for the plot, and is also rather poorly interpreted. <br /> <br /> Basically, however, the actors should not be to blame, but their characters are written like this. Blanca Portilla as an agent in the closet has so many skeletons that even a brilliant performance cannot save a character from being ridiculed. Luis Homar - the dream of the old man about the main character living in an artificial world, where the English alias and a few sweet words can seduce any super model. And Penelope Cruz is the embodiment of this old man's sexual fantasy. Her character is absolutely lifeless. It remains completely incomprehensible why she passed from an old man who, at least, helped her family, to a slightly less elderly person who is not charming enough to convince him of the role of a romantic hero or addiction. <br /> <But all these flaws would not have made this film so terrible. However, Almodovar makes the worst of what the director (or any other narrator) runs out of ideas: he quotes himself, what he did more and more often, and to a very small benefit. The film "inside the film", which "Broken Hugs" uses as a device for conspiracy, is in fact "Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown" (1988), only this time it is called "Chicks and Suitcases." This rather extraordinary title can give you a hint how this favorite classic is perceived here: while the dialogue that constitutes the last ten minutes of “Broken Hugs” is a crazy, excessive exchange of one-liners with a black ball in the original film. This is a tough, colorless, annoying business meeting. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is a DOA. the brainchild of the emaciated creator of past miracles, pretty much as terrible and disappointing as the last feature of Indiana Jones. Maybe not many people would agree with this, because Almodovar was such a genius. I would prefer to express my respect for his achievements, humbly asking the reader to look at “Everything about my mother”, or “Tie me”, or “High heels”, or “Matador”, all of which testify to the unique Almodovar. and unsurpassed talent. A few more such films, and his legacy can be destroyed forever.
