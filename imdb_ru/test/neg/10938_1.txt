Oh my Oh, this is a very bad movie. Acting is absolutely terrible, the script is terrible, and the photo is just terrible. <br /> <br /> What makes this film stand out is that you never care for any soul — good or bad guy, living, dying, or dead — in all 87 minutes. “Oh, he / she died? The characters are so black and white that with the volume turned off you can still understand who is who. While the voices of the actors sounded strangely monotonous, their faces give the impression that you are watching an old silent film with a large amount of brow twitching, exaggerated gloomy and "thoughtful looks." Each character is an insane, passionless, one-dimensional pony with one trick; as soon as they fulfill the fact that their special role in this fiasco demanded their creation, they are dismissed. <br /> <br /> It vaguely made me think about what would happen if Thomas Borch Nielsen (director / writer of "Skyggen", American title: "Webmaster") decided to make a low-budget version of "American Psycho" and was a little distracted by of the way. <br /> <br /> This is not a particularly awful movie; cold, passionless cast ensures that. This is not an offensive film; The director plays so safely that no one can find it that way. This is, after all, a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid it. We were not so lucky, and we really paid to watch this bomb for a fee. As part of my repentance, I am writing this review. <br /> <br /> Enough said.
