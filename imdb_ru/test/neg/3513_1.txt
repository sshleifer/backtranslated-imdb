A dull, meaningless film should appeal to southern goons, teens with IQ bordering on backward ones, and an average Bush supporter. Noble Willingham plays a major role in this simple scenario and uses a generous dose of MFers, eff this, eff that and SOBs. The end, which I expected to “Save” this empty story, was the biggest disappointment, making me hang and think: “Why?” <br /> <br /> This is a cat-and-mouse story or, rather, a boule against the victims. <br /> <br /> Don’t waste your time if you don’t like to hear the phone ring every 2 minutes and constantly scream and scream during this 123-minute trash bin settling.
