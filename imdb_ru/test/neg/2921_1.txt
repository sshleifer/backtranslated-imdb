I think of some things for this film: firstly, this is really a very bad movie. This is really "Superbad". The film looked very promising in trailers, but failed ... Perhaps the original idea was good, but between a bad script and a bad game, the film became boring and empty. My advice: do not waste 2 hours of your precious time. You have been warned. This is the first film that I rated 1 star on IMDb.com ... Secondly, none of the characters are cute. You really do not care what happened to them ... Thirdly, it is very easy to identify the villain. The grandson kills his father, sodomizes his friend's son, gets a maid pregnant, strangles his grandfather ... As JT says: "If you love evil without retribution, this is your movie." There is nothing more to say ...
