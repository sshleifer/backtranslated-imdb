Sorry for any spoilers it contains. But if you still want to read: I really wonder why so many people appreciate Kevin Williamson so highly. Let's just take a look at his work as a screenwriter, alright? There are Scream 1 and 2 (plus a story for the next), which, I think, is pretty funny, but very overpriced. In addition, turning Scream into a franchise, he stopped turning into a parody of horror films and just became different. Then I know what you did last summer, and this is essentially the same movie again. He co-wrote Halloween: H20, but even he had a reason not to take into account what he did with this monster. Then comes the faculty, which I can only say was terrible. (Very fun to make fun of, though). Don't even get me on the ridiculous, soap-opera stream of Dawson, I can talk about how bad it is for hours. So, we are starting to learn Mrs. Tingle. First of all, there are tons of little improbables in it. For example: in most of the high schools I know, the passerby is not the only one who enters college! The idea that Katie Holmes's character would never have disappeared anywhere if she were not a farewell would be absurd. Haven't you heard about financial aid, damn it? In addition, I do not think that you are expelled from high school or did not go to college because of fraud on one test. There are a lot of others, but now I will go to the big one. The ending really bothered me: they committed a crime, but it was normal because the teacher was a bitch. Fine. Do you know how many of my teachers I could kidnap based on this logic? I am sure that the police never took any statements to find out the whole story. It definitely will not be necessary. Helen Mirren was good, she added a bit of good character to the character who (as noted by the previous commentator) had NO reason for anything she did. And has anyone else noticed that Katie Holmes absolutely cannot act? Her complacency has become incredibly annoying. “You wanted me to fail. Blah blah blah". Her last two scenes with Mrs Tingle were the worst. The only reason I don’t regret the loss of $ 8.25 due to this disaster is because she was beaten a little. No, wait, I regret the loss of money: it was not real, and she survived. Mr. Williamson, if you are reading this, you have made the same film (some cruel and / or scary things, compensated by wise children who make sarcastic jokes and links to other films), just a few times too much I find 6 considering Scream 3 and what follows it), and I would really appreciate it if you stopped. Otherwise, I could just kidnap you and threaten YOU with a crossbow. OK? :-)
