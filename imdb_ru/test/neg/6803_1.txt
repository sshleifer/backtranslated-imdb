What were they thinking about when they shot this really awful movie? <br /> <br /> Arbus, one of the most important photographers and women of the twentieth century, had an exciting and dramatic life. What prompted anyone to make this film, which explains its unique artistic vision as the result of a (imaginary) romance with a grotesque but charismatic hairy freak (played by Downey)? <br /> <br /> In real life, Arbus burst from the traditional marriage and the role of a woman to express himself. In this film, Arbus is extremely boring Nicole Kidman, whose inspiration is explained by the devotion of “Beauty and the Beast” to an interesting person. <br /> <br /> For this rethinking, the film is really shameful. Regardless, it’s also just sluggish and boring.
