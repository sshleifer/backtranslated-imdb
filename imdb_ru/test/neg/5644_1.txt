Riddle as a concept is an interesting idea, but I am afraid that she is mistaken, Vinnie, if she is given the role of the Heavy Man, is his element, as in Lock Stock and Snatch. In this film, Winnie plays a sports columnist for the newspaper (more precisely, greyhounds), who during the film are easily beaten with ease and are tied up on a balcony by a man who is 10-15 years older than him. I'm sorry that Vinnie is tough, looks tough, and it seems to him that this is stupid. Attempt to investigate the double killings of a friend and drug addict found near the Thames. He takes on the role of the policeman, while the real police are a little minor players, hinting at the memories of Charles Dickens. <br /> <br /> When Vinnie appears on the screen, his reputation precedes him, he looks tough, but in this no part should act tough, snarling at the camera in parts. If you watch "The Mean Car", it is well played, believable and demonstrates very decent performance. <br /> <br /> Returning to the film, what is somewhat embarrassing is the memory of Charles Dickens, who tells a different story with characters who also appear in our day, these two stories seem unrelated, except the same actors are used . <br /> <br /> The sound in the film, especially from Julie Cox, is sometimes inaudible, and in fact did not quite find out what her role in the film is behind Winnie Loveâ€™s interest, she starts the film as a detective, but quickly becomes her friend . <br /> <br /> Death of a prostitute seems to be received, but not yet received. Remove the material of Charles Dickens, and you can make a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Winnie, is gradually turning into Briton Stephen Segal, stick to the supporting role, you are good at it.
