That's how I was when I came out (staggered) from this "movie." I could not leave because it was at the film festival, and there were a lot of people in the cinema. I'm stuck in the middle. Trapped. <br /> <br /> A tiny bit of the original video that attempted to tie this film together demonstrates some of the worst actions that have ever graced the big screen. The daughter was an outstanding performance - it stood out in a bad way. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was disgusting, consisted of a scattered frame and some strange sources of lighting that I saw. <br /> <br /> As for the video ... well, first ... <br /> <br /> Wait. <br /> <br /> Why am I reviewing this film? Why do I recognize its existence? Please do not watch this. Do something useful in two hours of your life and see how the paint dries.
