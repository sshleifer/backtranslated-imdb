Sorry, guys, but I have to say that I really can't understand the overwhelming feelings that everyone has when they see this movie ... <br /> <br /> When I saw it, I looked at my watch to see how much more time I had to spend a kindergarten with this nonsense. <br /> <br /> So why this verdict? <br /> <br /> First of all: the film tells a story that does not cause any excitement! This is not even the funny distorted reality of Quentin Tarantino, which we used to know. This story could come from the head of every little child. There is nothing clever, nothing inventive, and it goes on for hours ... The story has relevant content for 30 minutes. The rest are just terribly improved scenes that should leave a somewhat cool image. Doesn't work Even the previously seen abbreviations that Tarantino often uses are just confusing and by no means cool. <br /> <br /> Second: some guys go to Germany and kill the Nazis. Oh, right? They? The only Nazis they killed were a handful of guys, one of whom was human enough to die rather than betray their companions. This ugly face that Tarantino wanted to give the Nazis? A brave soldier, more valiant than any of the bastards? Of course not -> fail. And what happens to the horrible bastards killing the Nazis? Well, they are all killed by the Nazis, except for the two taken hostage -> Wow, what horrible, vengeful monsters they are ... <br /> <br /> Third: Are there any characters? Yes one! The only role and the only glimmer of hope for the entire film is Kritof Waltz, who creates a truly deep and very detailed character. Good game! Brad Pitt really sucks, and Waltz beat him. Never seen such a weak performance of Pitt ... And the rest? Well, some Germans whom you have never seen before and will never see. When the movie started, and I saw a group of seven bastards, I was hoping to see something like “The Magnificent Seven”: a group of extraordinary guys, each with a great character, fearlessly and knowing their way to fate. I was very disappointed then when I saw “Inglorious bastards. " No details, no characters, real men, just random guys you don’t remember, who were not given any chance to distinguish themselves ... But in fact, you don’t even need to distinguish, because "Inglorious Bastards" "except that Pitt is unlikely to play any role in this film ... <br /> <br /> So I was very disappointed, and to see this film in the place No. 40 of the greatest films of all time is the only thing that leaves me open mouth ...
