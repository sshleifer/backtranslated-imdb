Oh, no, one of these attacks on Japanese ghost girl movies ... I don't even remember how much I saw. maybe it sells ... but not me. not at all scary. Japanese horror films were very similar from the moment the first one appeared ... and also from childhood. I have seen it many times in horror movies. In the scene with a mobile phone, too, there is nothing new ... the drama of the fact that the guy fell under the train, sort of sucks ... I mean, he lacked drama ... Well, this is for children 14-16 years old, who listen to Japanese rock and think it is so unique ... we will let you say. there are a million of you = D, this is one of them. 3/10 I have seen worse, but you donâ€™t miss anything without seeing it!
