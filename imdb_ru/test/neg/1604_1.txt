Very boring show. Worse, he is very racist. White guys are stupid idiots, and the only novel is between a black and a white woman. There is nothing interesting in this novel, it’s not exciting, it’s not funny, it seems that they don’t even care about each other, rather the scriptwriters and directors wanted interracial things to happen. Why is it so popular in the media today? This is social programming, and it will not bring anything good, tension always arises when too many people want the same thing. This show is not worth 20 bucks per season, it is a waste of time and is harmful to society. At the very least, when they use TV shows to sell goods, they are more careful selling any agenda here, obviously, and without clear thinking, some may feel wrong if they resist this, but some of us know better.
