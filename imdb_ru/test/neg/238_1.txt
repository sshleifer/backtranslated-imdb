A terrible, tangled piece of shit from the south of the border. Now I watched it twice, and I still do not know what is happening. It was somehow related to the stupid-looking Aztec mummy, the “human robot,” the most stupid-looking robot I’ve ever seen, and the woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick. An incredibly boring scholar tells most of the story painfully slowly and buzzingly. This guy is a wonderful assistant in a dream. His sworn enemy is a fat slug called “The Bat,” which is the rather unimaginable name of an evil scientist. <br /> <br /> I think a boring scientist and his assistant worm dug up a mummy, and what a shock a learned wife just happens to be the reincarnation of her mother's friend. For some reason, they constantly keep the mummy in the mausoleum, so the bad guy can steal it. It takes him five years to do it, because he invents a “human robot” to steal a mummy, or attack it, or something else. He is looking for some treasure from his mother so that he can be rich. But excuse me, if this guy had a great intellect and a strong desire for success, why did he not just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /> <br /> Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense. Instead, there is a ridiculous fight between mother and robot, and it is very difficult to say which of them looks like a fraud or more tender. Honestly, I watched it because I thought that a movie with a title like Robot Vs. Aztec mummy just had to be fabulously tender. Instead, it was just terrible, terrible, and the mind was random.
