It is so depressing when directors try to be cool, and itâ€™s so obvious here. This is acting below average, funny dialogue, divided screens that are difficult to watch, and a lot of nonsense in his attempts to become a historical film and autobiographical. This film should be avoided at all costs. I was told not to go and watch this movie. I would like to listen.
