Killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1. Bad behavior, bad characters, annoying clown, bad lines, you call it Frankly, I'm not so surprised that more people have not seen this movie. The only reason I watched Killjoy 2 was because I wanted to think that the filmmakers had learned from their mistakes. They are not This film is just as bad, if not worse, than the first. This clown .... this damn clown ... I hate him! I hate him so much! And I do not hate him, because he is a good villain ... I hate him, because he is annoying to the limit! I hope that the filmmakers understood after trying and failing again that this film is irreparable. The last thing we need is Killjoy 3.
