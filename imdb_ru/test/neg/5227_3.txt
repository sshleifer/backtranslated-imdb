I'm a fan of Ed Harris, and I really had high hopes for this film. Having such good actors like Harris and Von Sidow is always a big advantage for the director, but if the script is bad, what can you do? I really think that Needful Things is the worst movie in Harris filmography, and that it was a huge mistake to get involved in it. In any case, I have seen much worse films in my life, but “Essential Things” were a disappointment because of the waste of acting talent. The story as a whole seems too unbelievable and false. I do not know if this is because of the book, because I did not read it. But if the script was so bad, I see no reason to shoot it. Perhaps it was the commercial success of King’s books or the need for low-quality films for the VHS era of the 90s. Whatever the reason, this film was a very bad choice for all participants.
