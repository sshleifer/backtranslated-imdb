A rather lousy sequel for the television of the classic Roman Polanski. Rosemary's son, Adrian, grew up and is personified by the eerie Stephen McHetty. After the destruction of Rosemary (Patty Duke plays here) the coven of witches, again headed by Minnie and Roman Castevets, prepares the son of Satan for world domination. This is not very scary and the light years are less creepy than its predecessor. Instead, writer Anthony Wilson and director Sam O'Stine choose the Satan-worshiping thriller, full of singing, lots of candles, and Ruth Gordon trying to act at the same time and meticulously. Gordon is the only vestige from the original. George Maharis replaces John Cassavetes as Guy, and very rude Ray Milland plays Roman Kastets, replacing the late Sydney Blackmer. Rookie Makhatti is the only real saving grace of the film. He is very reckless and looks really sinister, even without doing anything. The music of Charles Bernstein, respectively, is terrible, but too often used, as a result, it is intrusive, not effective. O'Shtin, who edited the earlier masterpiece of Polanski, shows no flair or subtlety.
