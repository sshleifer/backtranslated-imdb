The only reason someone remembers this floating mass of feces is because Pink Floyd has scored it. (Or, as they were then called "The Pink Floyd".) Stefan, a really annoying Euroshire hitchhiker, links up with Estel, the American model, and they keep getting tall and naked throughout the film ... what exactly? What drugs are bad? Or only heroin (horse) is there? The problem is that you don't give a shit about the characters, and in this respect, even Pink Floyd was not up to their best work. When Steffan overdoses at the end, you are almost happy to get rid of him, because he was so annoying.
