Oddly enough, I can say little about the “Box”, so it will be rather brief. I never read Richard Mateson's novel Button, Button, on which the film is based, but, considering what I saw in this “adaptation,” there was no particular similarity to the work of such a legendary author. A “box” about a family that discovers a strange thing on the threshold of their house, on which there is a button. Frank Langella appears and explains how they will be given a million dollars if they press the button - the only “catch” is that he will automatically kill someone, somewhere ... Are they pushing this? The end of the spoilers? This concept itself was interesting in itself, but somehow they managed to expand the film to some confusing Stargate fake, which complements it to a fairly decent ending with a rather deep message. Although I try to be as honest as possible, I still have to say that it was not my cup of tea, and I was bored. I think this is from the same director as Donny Darko, which I really liked when I saw him many years ago. The Box would have worked like a short film, but since it was so lifelessly adapted, I can't even recommend it closely ...
