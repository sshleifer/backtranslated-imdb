By Murly, Mohan Rao did much better with BANDHAN in 1998. This film is a terrible remake of the WEDDING FOOTMAN <br /> <br /> In short, the film consists of: Salman Khan, who at that time played the role of a dejected lover who lost his girlfriend and also had his own comic scenes where hit hard, even today he succeeds, he does it all here too, and also removes his shirt in scenes <br /> <br /> Jackie Shroff - wasted, bored and tired, his role is so stupid that he is shown as a lover Pooja Bhatra, and then in 1 scene he is shown as a womanizer? <br /> <br /> Inder Kumar is again a tangled feature <br /> <br /> Rani Mukherjee is boring, overweight and does not do anything special. Pooja Bhatra Tall is a fair and worthy actress, but she lacks talent. <br /> <br /> Kashmir Shah - says that the dial is like poetry <br /> <br /> Mohinis Behl - Poor man, two children were terrible too. <br /> <br /> The story is the same, it has horrible comic scenes, a sudden love story and boring drunken scenes, as well as the forced comic track Shakti Kapu <br /> <br /> The direction is bad The decent music <br /> <br /> Salman Khan just makes moves, Jackie's bad, Rani, as usual, Pooja bad, Mohinis and Kashmir, nothing special Inder is terrible
