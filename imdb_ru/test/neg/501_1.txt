I just saw the Heavenly Gate recently. After I watched this epic western 3 hours 40 minutes, which is not western, I read Stephen Bach's book. After reviewing all the events and the film itself, I still think that this film is a waste of time. I believe that when someone tells you to watch this, in fact they are trying to tire you to death. If for some reason you can enjoy this indulgent really bad film for yourself, I have to ask why. Although this is not a reason to hate it, it is historically far. He claims to describe a situation that occurred in Wyoming, called the Johnson County War. Just the cattle of that time wanted to kill all the thieves of cattle and claimed that they were all immigrants. You will find that you simply do not care about these people and hope that they will all be killed, because at least something will happen. Everyone in the film talks about what is happening, and it never shows. After you sit, despite this huge waste of time, you wonder how someone can make an epic 4-hour epic, in which nothing happens. Oh, and by the way, the Johnson War was not a war, it never happened. The war in Johnson district, in fact, was called that because it almost happened, in fact 2 people died. I can't warn you enough from this movie. However, if you are like me, the idea to watch a film that ruined your career and put United Artists on the “for sale” lot sounds like an interesting case to study, then by all means watch this horrible, narcist, film with no subtext or lots of pictures. (which is sometimes fine)
