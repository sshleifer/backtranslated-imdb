I usually love these movies. Give me the good old B movie, but this one was just awful. Acting (?) Was terrible almost to the point where I completely turned off the film. I thought I saw the worst of all time, but this one is right there with the Killer Tomatoes Attack! Honestly, it was the actor who made this film for me. <br /> <br /> I found that the actor was awkward and the lead man / woman were extremely boring. There was absolutely nothing in this movie. Perhaps I ask a ridiculous question here, but why the scene of nudity and sex? Do the producers think that no one will watch if they do not take them into account? I think they were probably right! Oh, where are Price and Tingler when you need them?
