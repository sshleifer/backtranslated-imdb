Why would anyone make such a film? Why would anyone invest in such a film? Why would anyone in the movie business work on such a film? Why in a theater to show such a film? Why can any TV channel broadcast such a film? Why would anyone of the critics review such a film? Why would anyone watch such a movie? Why not conduct a psychological examination of the authors / producers / directors of such films? Sometimes there are films that are so bad that they are good. This is such a terrible film that it is terrible. IMDb really has to set the scale to “0” or even minus to cover the works of this terribly pretentious horror.
