Polar Express. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, I love "Back to the Future", "Forrest Gump", "Contact" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" (NO QUESTION OF THE BRAND AFTER THIS FILM NAME !!) And Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors. Reviews of this film were almost unanimous, saying that this is an instant celebration of the classics. Ebert and Roper give him two ENTUSY fingers up! Even a written review of Ebert gave him as many as four stars! Wow ... well ... this I must see! But wait ... the motion picture used looks very strange. Hmm ... maybe I'm not interested in seeing this anymore. <br /> <br /> "Well, are you coming?" says the train conductor to the boy on the Polar Express. The boy reluctantly at first, and the train starts without him. The boy will soon change his mind and jumps on board at the very last moment. <br /> <br /> Now most of you probably decided not to jump aboard this train and not to wait for a train or an express train (hee-hee, I'm so witty and smart). I, on the other hand, looked like a boy who was skeptical at first, but jumped to see what the fuss was about. <br /> <br /> I just spent 10 dollars and two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> I can't even begin to explain the pain in my stomach. “Polar Express” was so painful to sit that it was not even funny. There is no history. There is no charge. You sit there during this series of events and wonder, "Is there any point in all this?" It would be one if the scenes were entertaining ... but it is not. <br /> <br /> This film is devoid of any emotion, soul, ounce of credibility, and, most importantly, any. fun. This movie is not fun. <br /> <br /> And let's talk about how these characters look for a second. To say that this is the same technology (movement, sorry, the “PERFORMANCE” grip) used to make Gollum a real shame, because Gollum was plausible !!! Photorealism is simply poorly translated in this environment. You use animation, why not make the characters more expressive? Or why not take it all off with real actors? They of course CAN have. We, as people, know too well how we walk, talk, interact with things. Seeing it on the screen is not convincingly impressive. Cartoons made convincingly, the more believable, as proved by The Incredibles. The result of the Polar Express is now such that they took the bodies of dead children and turned them into puppets. They move and talk, but where is the heart? Where is the soul? This is what we see on the screen. UGH UGH UGH UGH UGH! This movie is so terrible! <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film there is a scene in which the boy takes the train ticket for the girl from his seat, because she got up and left him. He wants to give her this, but you sit there and say: "Why ??!" Just leave it .. she comes back! He, of course, loses the ticket and the "adventure" comes. And then there is a boy who gets stuck in the back of the train all the time, and they bring him hot chocolate, but he can't come up and join the rest of the children? And there is this annoying guy "everyone knows" with the voice of a 35-year-old. This is all very disturbing. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there are songs! One girl goes to the back of the train, where a lonely child. He sings a song for himself. And then she interrupts and joins! They finish the song, holding hands, looking into each other's eyes, as if they were lovers. Very embarrassing. I won't even go into details about the song about serving hot chocolate while the waiters are dancing around the train. "keep it hot keep it hot!" One scene where Tom Hanks slips on his knees, arms stretched out in the air, should be one of the most memorable bad scenes in the history of bad scenes. <br /> <br /> I have to stop now, or I just kill myself. I need to watch something shitty to clear the palette. Yes ... shit is better than the Polar Express. <br /> <br /> “The only thing that is connected with trains, it doesn’t matter where you go, it’s important that you decide to get up.” <br /> <br />, For the love of God, I decided for you ! It's just another movie taken from a children's book, incredibly thin in the form of a movie. It happened to Grinch and the Cat in the Hat, and that was terrible too. But who can blame them? I bet if I took the book “Too much junk food for berenstein bears” and turned it into a feature film, it would probably also be pretty boring. But at least ... there would be a story and a point that the Polar Express lacks.
