I really tried, but this film just didn't work for me. The acting scenes were boring, the game was surprisingly meager, and some of these characters were TOO stereotypical, even funny. Pam Greer tries, but when you have nothing to work with, even her considerable talent cannot prevent a catastrophe. Even by the standards of this weak genre, this film is pretty bad.
