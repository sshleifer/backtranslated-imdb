I am very open. I watch all kinds of programs to the end ... good or bad ... just to give them a chance and learn from the positive and negative sides. This show had the potential to be good. But, my God, what were the writers, directors and directors thinking about? The cast is terrible ... with the slightest exception, Meryl (Mimi Rogers) and Darcy (Joy Osmansky) sometimes get good lines with the best performance. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors kill the show. This is the same storyline in each episode. Sam plans to do something. His boss violates these plans by assigning ridiculous work projects to him. Then the stupid ways that Sam tries to adapt to both the way, which is primarily stupid and lacks any real intellectual humor. This is EVERY episode. It becomes very tedious. <br /> <br /> Season 2, they throw an eye candy. 2 "hot" girls in the series are recorded (but brother remains? Explain to me, please, what kind of casting). I can understand why they wrote them out ... they didn’t have a significant role ... but they didn’t add anyone better to replace them. <br /> <br /> Stupid hero Derek Tricolly is given a permanent look for season 2. His acting (like everyone else) is reminiscent of many poor 80s comedies ... then it could be funny ... but now it hurts. <br /> <br /> With this performance, some good writers and some people who had some talent to perform them would be much better. This show lacks everything. Product quality is the only good aspect of the show. This is great in this respect ... unfortunately, the content is very sad. <br /> <br /> Oh my god. FOX, is there really nothing better to choose from? I stick to such shows as “It's always sunny in Philadelphia” or “30 Rock”. A plan must be established by such programs, which in fact assume that the audience is smart and does not drool over itself, using all its brain power while continuing to breathe.
