Hair, a film based on the Broadway hit, cannot achieve any redeemed cinematic qualities. You can't take a play and make a movie out of it. Rock music is so tempting to see this film that it really detracts from the quality of the Broadway show. worse than re-watching a comedy movie. musical fiasco, and I can not believe that others rated it so highly.
