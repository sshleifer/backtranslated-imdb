I did not like Underdog! I mean, it was really unnecessary and needed a big facelift, and then it would be tolerable, but for the main part I didnâ€™t like it. It was not like any other children's film, it was one of those films that wanted parents (who watched the cartoon) to go there with the children to see it, I am not one of them, so the film did not attract me in the slightest way. I had some problems with it, just like me. Don't think that Jason Lee was the right voice for Underdog, it made him sound sloppy and really unwise. Then it was really predictable that makes you feel tired and insane. Humor was really what drove me crazy, it was just ridiculous and a bit pathetic. One thing that bothered me the most was that almost everything from Underdog's mouth was sarcastic or rude. The game was bearable, but needed a little improvement. If you have children, they may like it, but if you are not a child at any cost, you may like it, unlike me. 3.4 stars out of 10
