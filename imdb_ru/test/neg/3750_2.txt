Martha Plympton starred in several prestigious films, working with River Phoenix and Harrison Ford, but she was never able to expand her limited, mean attraction in the same class as, say, Molly Ringwald. This film, which has just been released, is only a continuation of its late 80s / early 90s attempts to find a screen character that could be identified for moviegoers, and it represents another setback. Plimpton plays a troubled young woman who finds out on her 21st birthday that she was adopted and — even worse — was actually left as a baby on the doorstep of her parents! She goes in search of her biological mother and father, but the viewer has no idea why she wants it at all (does mere curiosity give her so much determination?). Unattractive material given comedic processing; it starts on the wrong foot and never recovers. Plympton gives sour, indecent work, but Hector Elizondo and Mary Kay Place are good as her adoptive parents. * 1/2 of ****
