This movie is terrible. He has absolutely zero laughter. Hebrew Hammer (Adam Goldberg) is sent to rescue Hannuka from the Evil Santa (Andy Dick). Perhaps a rather promising basis for the plot, in fact, the film does not go beyond this premise. While there are some (far from all) pleasant touches, and the plot is relatively consistent, it is difficult, beaten and, ultimately, mindlessly boring. This is despite the fact that Goldberg, Dick, and Greer (Hammerâ€™s client / love interest) all have a fairly significant presence on the screen. Despite the fact that he played for what could be described as stupid crazy jokes, this film invariably represents the middle class muck. DO NOT spend 85 minutes of your life on this. (note - the music was good ..!)
