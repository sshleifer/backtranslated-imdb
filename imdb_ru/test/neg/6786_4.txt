* SPOILERS! * When I first saw a preview of this film, it looked like a good old film with distinctive features. I love bluegrass music, so I couldn't wait to see it. When we shot the film, we read it back, and it sounded even better. The film was pretty boring for the first half, from time to time a song was played. Then (it is awkward for me to type this) lesbian love appeared. I was something more than a friendship between teachers, but I certainly did not expect nudity and long fights. I watched it with my mother and I was very ashamed because I chose this film. But besides that, it was a good movie. The acting was great, the actress who played Deladis was great. To be honest, the soundtrack was the best part of the film. I don't want to watch the movie again, but I bought the soundtrack the day after I watched the movie. And there is a continuation of the disks that follow. If I were you, I would have missed the film and just got the music.
