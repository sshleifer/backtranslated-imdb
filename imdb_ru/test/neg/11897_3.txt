One would think that anyone who proceeds to continue working on the innovative “Naked Civil Servant” more than 30 years ago will at least try to honor the original with some kind of inspirational vision, but no. Here we have a kind of biopic about one of the most stylish people of the late 20th century, who himself has no style at all. True, the filmmakers gathered several prominent actors - and handed them a cracked mug of gray porridge. Everything in the infrastructure of this film is wrong, starting with the script, which is another one of those condensations of great lives in television films, where every other line is the subject’s “famous quotation”, and every other scene is your familiarity with the next key character in life the subject. We get Swoozie Kurtz as a PR manager who promotes Crisp as a state artist; Denis O'Hare, as a gay periodical editor who hires Crisp as a film reviewer, becomes somewhat alienated from him when he seems indifferent to the passions of 80s AIDS activists and then returns to the crowd as a compassionate friend of a dying eightieth birthday ; Jonathan Tucker (in excellent performance) as a shy, insecure gay artist who became friends with Crisp; and, finally, Cynthia Nixon as a performer and the Woman-O-Bohemia Penny Arcade, who, intrigued by Crisp's person, offers him a place in her cabaret journey. Nixon is a convincing and gifted performer, but the script does not give any chance to embody a mundane and street arcade game. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one-room apartment in an old apartment building in the eastern village of Manhattan. He famously said that he never cleaned, because “after a few years the dust does not get worse” or something like that. But looking at the image of this apartment in this film, you will never feel the smell of this dustiness. He often visited a local coffee shop on a busy avenue, and he was seen almost every day, sipping tea and watching the world go by. In this film, we get a diner that looks like something on 12th Avenue on the Hudson River. Most of the scenes on the “streets of New York” have a sterile, unreal appearance without any sensation of that time. <br /> <br /> The soul of this film is the great John Hurt. After almost 35 years, he can still understand the essence of this peculiar post-Edwardian Englishman and pass it on to the third millennia. His every line, every gesture is elegant. In later scenes, he even modulates his vocal projection so that it is suitable for a person whose life is reduced to death. Shortly before leaving this kingdom, Crisp wrote that when a person grows very strongly, his skin becomes very smelly, which cannot be removed and which is eager for death. Feels this feeling in the performance of Hert. So for him and for him alone this film is worth seeing.
