The 1998 version of "Psycho" should have been moved to the 1960s, and not today. Headliners would do a good job with the setting. There were two scenes that just stuck out like a sore thumb. The first was at the beginning of the film when Marian Crane (Anne Heche) was sitting at her desk. Her boss took his client to his office because "it was an air conditioner." I believe most Arizona businesses have air conditioning. The other was a meeting between Layla Crain (Julianne Moore) and Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen). Leela, playing with Walkman, seemed an exaggeration to update the film. The film scared the audience in the theater.
