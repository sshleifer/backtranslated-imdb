Jeff Powers (Lou Diamond Phillips, "Young Guns 1 & 2"), a policeman with a history of deceiving criminals, is recruited into the elite underground unit LAPD. This does not suit the reporter's friend Jeff's friend, Kelly (Chelsea Field), who is looking for a story on the team. Soon Jeff's conscience gets better than him, which puts him at odds with Dan Vaughn (Scott Glenn, “The Hunt for Red October” and “Reverse”), the unit leader. <br /> <br /> This is a rather routine, I dare say, mundane, police action / drama that brings no surprises thanks to the biscuit cutter plot, which should go strictly from point A to point B. The cast is all right, because that the actors were given to work with, that this is not the real reason to watch the movie. In some ways, sad to see how the six previous Mark Lester films shot just before that (from the 1984 Class to Showdown in Little Tokyo) were very interesting vehicles. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Chelsea Field is briefly topless. <br /> <br /> My rating is: D +
