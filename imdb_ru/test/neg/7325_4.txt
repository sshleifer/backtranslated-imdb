I tried to love this movie. I really did. Kevin Bacon plays the victim of cerebral palsy, with whom 10-year-old girlfriend befriended, whose fantasies of digging in China, flying in a balloon, etc., are her way of coping with dreary existence. I admit that I made a fast forward through one of the scenes in which they share friendship and simple pleasures, while soulful piano music plays in the background. Well, three or four of these scenes are type. Maybe nine or ten. Okay, okay, it was fourteen. But I sat and watched most of them.
