I tried to watch this show several times and each time I found it completely pale in humor. <br /> <br /> The reason to mention one thing is that it is based solely on the mockery of everything that Republicans have. made. In short, these are mainly the political views of the Democratic Party, regarded as humor. <br /> <br /> All that Mr. Stewart does is wisdom with regard to all that the Republicans have done, and the public is bustling in a shower of forced laughter. <br /> I believe that the left is so devoid of any real substance that they have to define themselves in terms of how much they all hate Republicans. <br /> <br /> -LD <br /> <br /> _____________________________ <br /> <br /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
