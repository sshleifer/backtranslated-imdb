I do not understand! The horror star youth heroes are supposedly all devoted horror fans, but when their beloved idol (Konrad Radzoff) dies, they dig up his corpse and do disrespectful things to it, for example, dance around the house. and throw leftover food at him. This is not like what horror fans would have done, is it? I am a big fan of horror, and I immensely idolize departed icons such as Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Boris Karloff, but it would never occur to me to make fun of their memory. No wonder Conrad is returning from the dead ?? admittedly after the session ?? wipe them all off the face of the earth! Mr. Radzoff was no longer known for his friendliness in life, as he sometimes killed directors who did not agree with his visions, and even after his death he suffers from a huge ego. Even inside his grave, there are video messages to petrify possible visitors, and a group of teenagers will clearly feel that he is also enjoying the killer business outside his film sets. "Horror Star" (a.k.a. "Frightmare" and "Snatchers for the Body") is a pretty bad horror movie from the 80s, but there are a handful of cheese and bloody highlights to enjoy. The film mainly suffers from its own stupid plot, since no one ?? not even a film school student ?? stupid enough to steal a newly buried corpse and really think that it will get away with it, and too many tedious moments to fight with it. Conrad’s video talk from the grave is too talkative and definitely undermines tensions, but, on the other hand, his killing methods are pleasantly creative. One teen enjoys the cremation experience alive, and the other (Jeffrey Combs in one of his first roles!) Loses his head in a delightful sequence of decapitation. In the most confusing sequence, the head of a poor girl is crushed by a coffin. Writer / director Norman Thaddeus Wayne wanted to pay homage to the vintage horror movie, and he obviously knows how to make a movie look sinister. Places and scenery are great, but Wayne lacked the means necessary to provide his film with proper continuity and editing work. Acting performance is generally decent, with Ferdy Mein (imitating Christopher Lee) and Jeffrey Combs playing the most memorable roles. “The Star of Horror” can hardly be called a compulsory or even a good movie, but it is worth tracking it down in case you are a fan of enthusiastic B-horror.
