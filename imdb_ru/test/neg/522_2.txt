Well, I just had to think about it ... As a huge mental disgrace, I just watched this movie entirely. <br /> <br /> You will notice that the trivia section of IMDB indicates that parts of lift 747 were “borrowed” from the 1977 airport. It really does not scratch the surface ... Virtually all external shots of an airplane gliding across the ocean, landing, sinking, and even along the rest of the shots are taken from the airport for 77 years. All the “lifting” shots were taken from the age of 77, including most of the internal flooding, with the exception of the drowning of Dennis Weaver. I couldn't help but wonder if Olivia Dehavilland could sail at any moment, or maybe the “dead” Tom Sullivan. Another video: the name of Dennis Weaver in this film is Stevens, who should compensate for the fact that the plane of Airport 77 is owned by Stevens Corporation (of course, led by Jimmy Stewart). <br /> <br /> This is a real cast of actors who have worked little or at least have not worked for a long time, which may have been the first sign that this will be a real bitch. <br /> <br /> I We rated this film as 2 - It is quite worthy of “1”, but if this film cannot offer a different quality of redemption, at least someone helped Kulio, Max Caulfield, Nicole Eggert and Dennis Weaver pay their car, month!
