This film makes as much sense as the episode "Ozzy and Harriet" or "Father knows best." An old copy of the Reader's Digest (circa 1962) would have given more insight into modern life or the relationship between father and daughter than this strange mixture. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by Diane Keaton. She seems to be mooning through the film. (Considering the title of the film, I understand that its role was secondary, but even Martin Short managed an excellent, supporting character.) <br /> <br /> I can understand the appeal of the imaginary world created in a good romantic comedy. But this film is a prozac version of the imaginary world. I'm afraid to think that anyone can enjoy it, even if it is pure fantasy.
