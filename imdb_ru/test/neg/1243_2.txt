Firstly all..I've seen better action and more realistic make-up in porn movies. How bad was "Chris Moltisante" in the role of Stewie Ungar? On The Sopranos, Chris is not taken too seriously and can be considered a comic relief. And then add “Bobby Bakkala” as one of your friends in Vegas. This is too much for a dramatic film. None of the actors can cope with a serious role and is better suited as a second banana for Tony, Paulie or Uncle Junior. And I want to know who did the makeup for this disaster? I want this man to be my make-up artist for the next 25 years, so I will never grow old for a day. That's all that I will write in this film, because you should not spend too much of my time. <br /> <br /> Yes, I really know that Michael Imperoli and Steve Shirippa are their REAL names.
