Based on the novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, "ON EARTH" provides little more than the means to escape and give the brain a rest. Victorian scientist Dr. Abner Perry (Peter Cushing) invents a giant digging machine, which he and his American partner (Doug McClure) use to force their way deep into the earth to explore what secrets it can hold. Soon they discover the lost world of inhuman beings in conflict with prehistoric monsters. <br /> <br /> Cushing looks like a scattered professor to the point of annoying. Instead of being a courageous adventurer, he is faced with effeminate. On the other hand, McClure outplayed enough to make himself laugh. Caroline Munro plays the beautiful princess Dia, who refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth. Also in the cast: Godfrey James, Cy Grant and Michael Crane.
