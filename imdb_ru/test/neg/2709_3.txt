I actually planned to watch this movie when I noticed it in my television guide, but after about 5 minutes I decided that time was definitely more expensive than Who's That Girl. Itâ€™s impossible to describe how bad Madonna plays, and the end result is one of the most annoying characters ever captured in the film. This crap insults film and intelligence. I almost never! Rate the film, which I do not see from start to finish, but in this case, the first is impossible. 2/10
