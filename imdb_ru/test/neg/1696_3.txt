Pat O'Brien portrays Knut Rock, All-American football coach Notre Dame. Without a doubt, this film will be much more attractive for those interested in any aspect of the "All-American football of Notre Dame Knut Rockne" - perhaps it is most interesting to serious followers of football and / or Notre Dame football. You will see some good documentaries. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it is difficult to recommend as a FILM. This is not much more than a historical document. You will “know” that the end is near when Gail Page is cool — and don't blink, otherwise you will miss Ronald Reagan doing all Camilla! <br /> <br /> *** Knut Rockn - All-American (1940) Lloyd Bacon ~ Pat O'Brien, Gail Page, Ronald Reagan
