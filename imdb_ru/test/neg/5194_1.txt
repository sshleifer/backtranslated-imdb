I can’t pretend that I don’t know anything about cinema or Mr. Angelopoulos. But I know Greece and I love its people. In July, my 14-year-old son and I went to Cappadocia, Turkey, in search of some of the remains of the area where his great-grandfather Jordanis lived until the great exodus of the Anatolian Greeks in 1923. Reading the summary of the film (refugees from Odessa), I thought that maybe I could learn more about the forced migration of modern Greeks. If I hadn’t been at home in Rhodes, if I hadn’t been in Greece 28 times in so many years, if I hadn’t been familiar with dozens of islands and cities in Greece, and if I had never enjoyed the friendship of these vigorous, intoxicated people people, I could believe that this cry has to do with modern Greece. As a professor at New Jersey State College, let me assure you that I am familiar with the history of the period described in the film. Indeed, my wife's uncle was killed by the communists during the communist seizure of power. My mother-in-law survived the Italian invasion and the German occupation ... barely. These characters on the screen speak Greek, they listen to Greek music, but who are they? No, they are not even vaguely Greek. Of course, they are not people at all, but simply allegories. This is what the artist invents when life does not quite fit or does not correspond to his perception of what it was or should have been. All of them represent some aspect of Greece after the First World War, when large external forces appeared before a fate that they did not deserve. As we joked in the late 70s in America: "There was no revolution." For an ideologue / artist, this is not a joke. In fact, this is the basis to subject us to two and a half hours of torment. And all because different powers (Eleni’s monologue about “guards” in colorful uniforms) did not allow the generation after the “aristocrats” of 1919 (Spiros) to follow the call of peace and freedom (music of Nikos and his fellow musicians, i.e. cause). This dark surreal revisionism spreads the true and heroic efforts of the Greek people to sustain their thirst for life through the tragedies of the 20th century to achieve more than any of their Balkan neighbors to become so politically developed and globally integrated.
