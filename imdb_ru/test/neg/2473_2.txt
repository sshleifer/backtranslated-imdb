I can not believe that I actually sat this whole movie! It was absolutely terrible, and completely inappropriate, and yet I sat thinking that it should get better. This is not the case, and I wasted 2 hours of my life. Will Smith is much better in action movies - I loved him in “I”, “Robot, Enemy of the State and Independence Day”, and I do not think that you can expect from him that he will really carry the entire film as a romantic leader in Cary Grant could On the other hand, the script was unbearably terrible, and the dialogue was so funny. <br /> <br /> I didn’t like everything except the character Albert, and even what I found was done with a heavy hand. If you want to watch a modern romantic comedy with a good feeling, look at something like “How to lose a guy in ten days” or “When Harry met Sally”. The 40-year-old Virgin left me with a smile on her face. I even preferred the music and lyrics above this - and yes, I know that this is stupid, but at least it was not perceived by itself, and it was cute. I also did not like the main female role - and I was not convinced of the chemistry between her and the character of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> In general, I think I liked the two scenes (and definitely not the final, which was nauseous and unconvincing!) and - no, sorry, this is the only thing I liked about the whole movie. Do not waste your time.
