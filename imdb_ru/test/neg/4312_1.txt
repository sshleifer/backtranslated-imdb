This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and certainly the worst film Nagesh Kuknur has shot. I can't believe that the person who made the film, like Teen Deewarein, can create complete crap like this. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film itself is indeed erroneous, since Zinat is forced to seek Peace and receive her pardon to help her husband avoid the death penalty in Saudi Arabia. The common logic is: if Zinat cannot easily search the World, then the government of Soudy will not, therefore Zinat can safely forge the signature of the World or a thumbprint and give it to Judges. Another stupid thing is that Shankar gave the wrong address in his passport, so Indian government officials cannot get this address, but after a while Mira gets Shankar's suitcase through the government of Judge. Blimey! Doesn't this make Soudis a well-developed network in India more than Indians? <br /> <br /> Nadia does a little more than a cameo in the movie with the role of Chopra, who looks at the World and is looking for the father-in-law of the World, Girish Karnad (this guy has just been wasted) helps her get like a fortress. <br /> <br /> Nadia cannot speak Hindi, and other guys help him translate the English dialogues he writes into Hindi. This time it seems that his assistant was seriously intoxicated when he wrote dialogues, such as "Imaan Ki Chalaang" (honesty leap). A few minutes later, to our worst nightmares, Mira not only makes this honest leap, she knocks her legs to perform "Imaan ka Naah" (dance of honesty). <br /> <br /> One of the most brilliant films, which has his cinematography and really good shades. But since Bollywood has learned what is called post-production, almost all films have bright colors and beautifully mixed backgrounds, so there is nothing difficult. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that the creation of a crappy film is not limited to Chopras or Johara or Barjati, Nadia and they are all ready to suffer.
