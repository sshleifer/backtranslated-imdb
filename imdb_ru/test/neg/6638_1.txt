"Chairman of the Board" is a ridiculously stupid film from the popular comic "Carrot Top" (also shown in the 1-800-COLLECT advertisement). He plays the inventor of surfing, who runs into a man who has a flat tire. Top rescues him and a few days later he discovers that the guy is dead, and gave his company to the comedian. Even if someone were in the role of Carrot Top, it would still be bad. The jokes (which are always rigged everywhere) are terrible, and the idea of ​​a romantic “plot twist” should be discarded. DO NOT LOOK !!!
