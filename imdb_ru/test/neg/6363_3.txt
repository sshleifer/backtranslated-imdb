I didn't really like Sliding Doors or Twice the Yesterday, so I certainly didn't come up with such a bad secondary excuse for these films. An idea that was made to death (what happens if ...?), And the script is bad and unsuccessful, not to mention an obvious attempt to add sex / nudity just to get R rating and some scenes that are simply not necessary, but necessary it was to push the boundaries (I really do not need to see the child urinate or struggle with the diaphragm. Especially when they have absolutely no connection or are not used in the film). <br /> <br /> The acting was also very bad, the only actor I found least satisfying was her daughter; the others were two-dimensional and completely unbelievable. The people with whom I watched it left the room about halfway through; I managed to finish it, but not without fast rewinding. <br /> <br /> Overall: nothing new here, this is a common and boring movie. A few pretty funny moments far outweigh the stupid or stupid. It would be boring, even if it had not been done before. If it was not such a rephrasing, I would rate it by five, but even for an indie film this was extremely lacking, but in rephrasing it also loses originality: 3/10.
