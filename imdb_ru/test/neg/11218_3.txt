In fact, there are several good reasons why a person should risk losing his mind while watching this show. The chest is good, although some of them are not so real, but they are usually in pairs, which is good. Watching the beach on the screen is also very relaxing, as this is the perfect place to just relax and not worry too much about what the rubber shark will eat. It is always pleasant to remember that David Hasselhoff is a god. Not a god, but a god. This is not so much about his acting skills, as they are not, but his chest says a lot. In addition, KITT is not hanging on this series, which is good, as Mr. Hasselhoff said in an interview that he always thought KITT was gay. Naturally, this may make him look like an idiot, but, given other statements he has made lately, this should not surprise anyone. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this is a kind of show that is completely harmless to people. This gives us a lot to look at and laugh at, and this is what many intentionally humorous shows really do not give us. I must say that it is not surprising that Borat fell in love with Pamela Anderson. I like to watch the show. No, this is not a very good show, in fact it is rather awful, but I like to watch it. Itâ€™s basically like a B-movie that stretches over a decade.
