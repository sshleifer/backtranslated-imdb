Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The "beginning" was not the best, but better than this. This is not a good way to lead to the original film. That's just terrible! Gigi CGI were so fake in both films! Why not use real animals? I enjoyed old films of Sinbad better than this one. I was kingly disappointed! The only good thing I can say about this film waste is the cinematography and clothes that really captured that era. I understand why this film was remade as "The Beginning." This is just bad in my opinion. where does the money come from? Give me a multi-million dollar budget, and I'll show you how to do it!
