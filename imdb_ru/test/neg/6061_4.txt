I suppose that initially it will be at least two parts, and, therefore, at least a quarter longer, because otherwise how can we explain its confusing, abbreviated storyline. I have never been completely lost, but I have often been partially lost and usually unclear in character motivation. In the film, it seems that the connecting points of the plot were discarded in order to squeeze it into its time interval. <br /> <br /> If he were longer, he could have made more sense, but still he would not be too good. The most interesting idea of ​​the film about the war between Zeus and Hero is about a war between a man and a woman, but the film challenges it, making the followers of Hera rather awful, not understanding what the followers of Zeus do or believe. The film is also interesting because you do not see the gods, and there is no real certainty that they exist. So he has a couple of intriguing ideas, but they do not bring them any benefit. <br /> <br /> Bad dialogue, cardboard characters and one interesting scene with the participation of Hercules and his three antagonistic sons. Not to watch, but not worth watching.
