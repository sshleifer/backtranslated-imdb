In Thailand, the Americans Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and his girlfriend Amanda (Meredith Monroe) are quarreling in a Muay Thai fight, and Amanda leaves Connor alone. She asks the management of the hotel from a stranger, indeed, the average vampire Niran (Don Hetrakul), and she was bitten and kidnapped by his gang of evil motorcycle vampires. Connor joins the clan of "good" vampires led by Sang (Stephanie Chao), trying to save Amanda from Niran's claws. <br /> <br /> I expected Vampires: Turn to be a good movie. Places and cinematography are beautiful; very heavy music is great; Stephanie Chao is gorgeous and attractive; but, unfortunately, the script and director are terrible, and Meredith Monro's very loose costume does not help her fallen breasts. The story is very short, and the unknown Marty Weiss uses long scenes with motorcycle races, fights and boring memories to complete the minimum movie time. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Vampires: Conversation” (“Vampires: Appeal”)
