Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Obviously, this is not intentional though. The main characters take about half of the film to realize that the big hilly terrain in the city center spews hot red things, and the other half spent on diverting the lava flow through the city using fire engines (right). That, of course, made me laugh. The game makes Arnie look like an RSC fan. It's amazing that such films are ordered. A more interesting version is someone who goes to an active volcano and removes it, and it will probably cost about 20 pounds. ($ 40) I see a guy taking a film to a film company, "well, this big VOLCANO, and he breaks out at CITY ... quite radically, hey." watching this most other movies will look good.
