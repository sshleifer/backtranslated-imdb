Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness novel had a vivid sense of description, which made this book amazing. When I read this book, every scene was completely stretched in my head, and I knew what each character looked like. There were many pieces in this book, and when I finished reading this book, it seemed that the puzzle was complete. After I finished reading The Heat of Darkness, I watched a movie, which was a mistake. The film has cut so many essential parts. For example, in Marloweâ€™s novel, he waited a very long time for the rivets to come so that he could repair his boat. It was a great source of worthlessness. In the film, this part was simply excluded. More parts were added to the film that were useless and had no meaning. For example, when Kurtz spoke to Marlow at the end of the book, and Kurtz snapped a monkey neck and killed him. What was the purpose of this scene, except how to make the audience feel sorry for the monkey? As if the author of the script did not even read the whole book, but simply put the parts that he had read into the film. If I had not read the novel before I watched the movie, I would be completely confused. The book was amazing, and it is indeed a classic in American literature, but the film may have been pointedly nominated for the worst picture at the Razzie Awards.
