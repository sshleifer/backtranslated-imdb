Now I loved Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, but I can't believe that Shane Black wrote this bunch ... or that David Morse and John S. McGinley are in it. I showed it at a film festival. Awful. Everyone was laughing. This is a sermon and a heavyweight ... not to mention stupidity. It is also amazing how little LA looks like cambodia. The very idea of ​​time travel through post-traumatic stress disorder is pretty dumb. Imagine "Born on the Fourth of July," mixed with "Butterfly Effect 2" (I used the sequel as an example to really show how bad this film is), but directed by the 2nd director Michael Bay. This is bad. 2 stars based solely on product value.
