This is similar to a school video project and propaganda film that lulls the entire class, as well as the teacher. <br /> <br /> Absolutely boring long, silent (yes, silent) lines of unrelated video clips. > <br /> Instead of this film, see how the paint dries up or the grass grows - it will be more interesting if you donâ€™t like to see Arabs evil for everyone around. <br /> <br /> Suliman (director) must be embarrassed by this lame waste of the film. <br /> <br /> He deserves a unit for the quality of the film, zero for a ridiculous propaganda message and a negative number for the script (or lack thereof).
