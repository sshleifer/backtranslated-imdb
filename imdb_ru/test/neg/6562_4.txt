This is the only word I can think of to describe this film. Not a waste like a waste of time (any time spent with these characters is never lost), but a waste like a waste of opportunities. <br /> <br /> When I watch this movie, I think about everything Star Trek. written novels that would have made the film much better than the story chosen by Shatner. The scene was similar to a regular television episode, and the ending looked like the culmination (if you can call it that) of the first film. <br /> <br /> Nimoy Staged II-IV focused on the nature of the film. Spock - how he met Kobayashi Maru outside the classroom, and how he dealt with his emotional life now that he had a chance to start all over again. Shatner could have done the same with Kirk here, but he did not. We know little about Kirk, whom we did not know before. Again, one of the novels would be better - try “My enemy, my ally” for a very interesting study of the character of our friend James T. Minor characters are used mainly for cute pieces, and the plot of Scotty-Uhura seems rather out of left field, especially That overtones in the original series was Sulu-Uhura. <br /> <br /> Even hardcore fans can't find much pleasure here. Sorry, but this is true.
