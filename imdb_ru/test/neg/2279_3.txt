Director / screenwriter Allan Burns seems to have combined two different scenarios before embarking on this minor talk: a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage. This leads to an amazingly funny film. Christina Lahti plays a rude, cynical television news reporter who makes friends with aerobics instructor Mary Tyler Moore and soon eats lunch with Moore and her family - only finding out that Mary's husband (Ted Danson) is a secret Lahti affair! For Burns, the strange rhythm of stopping and beginning his dialogue, which is neither realistic nor effective (just more and more annoying, because it never seems to say anything important). Thin Moore, looking anxiously fragile in his swimsuit, shines a smile, but does not convince, as Danson's wife, and Danson is stuck with an insignificant, ungrateful role (he just has to be a guy). The film tries to cover all the basics in the classic case of overreaching (the role of a woman in the workplace, TV news business, a cheating family man, a working wife and mother who wants more, a womanâ€™s need for female friendships, etc.), but nothing significant ideas fail, because Burns only hesitantly investigates problems. As a writer, he is surprisingly free from the highlights, but also devoid of purpose, and the heavy intrigue is just confused. * 1/2 of ****
