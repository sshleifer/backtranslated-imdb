I heard good words about the "State of Grace" and came with an open heart. I thought that the “Army of God” was all right, and I thought that, perhaps, Dutcher became better and became a mature director. The film began with some shaky acting, and I thought, "Well, maybe it will get better." Unfortunately, this has never happened. The picture begins with the presentation of two elders - Mormon missionaries - and it seems that the audience will recognize them and take care of them. Instead, the story degenerates into a very unlikely series of sad events that highlight the glaring disobedience of the missionaries (something that undoubtedly exists, but rarely at the level that Dutcher portrays), and it becomes almost funny. <br /> <br /> Dutcher is the only success in this film - his successful alienation from the target audience. Unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of Mormon missionaries, Dutcher commits nothing more than the wrath of his predominantly Mormon audience. The film does not reflect reality. Missions are completely different from what Dutcher shows (by serving on a Mormon mission, I can testify to this fact), and gangster life in California certainly contains a much more pronounced language than the occasional light vulgarity. I guess I had to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to everyone, and it was incredible (oh well, the whole mission is going to see how this elder is sent home - and the mother and the girl stand right next to !) and cheesy. Next time, Dutcher, try to make a film with which someone can identify himself.
