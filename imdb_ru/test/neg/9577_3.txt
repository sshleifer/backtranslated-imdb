This Spanish-Italian co-production tells an interesting and strange story about Dr. Bannister, a woman who has not only the best years behind, but also a scarred face that makes her look like a freak. But in Madrid, a professor she knows has conducted several animal experiments with a substance that regenerates cells. The experiments were successful, but the animals became aggressive. Since the professor will not allow Dr. Bannister to be the first human guinea pig, she kills him and consumes the substance. She becomes a beautiful young woman, but also an evil killer when it comes to keeping her secret a secret. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is very funny, but Piero Vivarelli didnâ€™t have enough skills and money to make a cool movie out of it. In addition, after a good start, the film becomes boring, and it fails to recover quickly, although the duration of the film does not exceed 83 minutes. And since in the last third of the film the situation changes to the Swiss city of Geneva, sometimes it even looks like a vacation movie, because we see how beautiful Geneva is (what it really is - but it does not help move the plot forward). ..). Thus, with a more talented director, better actors and a bigger budget, Satanik could become a little-known Italian classic. But in reality this is just a boring and boring crime film that should not be looked for. Rating: 3 out of 10.
