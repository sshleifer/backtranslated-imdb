It seems that all companies that like taxes levied by Romania for photographs provide an image that has disappeared since 1994. They are hardly trying to get the oldest car they started, but they never take pictures of Lamorghini, Ferrari, Aston. Martin and all the new Mercedes cars that you can find in some important countries. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they took pictures in some quarters of Bucharest, where they had the opportunity to clean the streets and put on clothes. dressing people, I donâ€™t know, maybe the clothes of the 90s makes them so stupid that you realize that the script was maybe a second hand, bought on ebay or worth it. <br /> <br /> I hope for the future to continue to make films in the USA and to make good money there, than help us a little and dishonor our country. I have no reason to believe that someone will understand the message (besides my English ---: sorry)
