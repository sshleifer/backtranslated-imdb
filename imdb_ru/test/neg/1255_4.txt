Wow, I just witnessed one of the greatest poker tragedies, and I'm not talking about the premature death of a great student. Unfortunately, this film was terrible. Absolutely awful. The real tragedy in the history of filmmaking. Well, maybe I'm a little harsh, but if you have no interest in the life of the student, then do not even think about this. And those who are really interested in his life will find that most of the roles have been trivialized and decorated as distinct scenes of novelty. I watched him because of Stu Ungar, but I almost wanted to commit suicide, as he did when I watched this movie 4 stars for the effort, but it hurt unpleasantly
