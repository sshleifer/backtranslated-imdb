First I have to say that I read everything about this subject, and I know it inside out, and I was glad to finally see it too. But you only need to read the book on which this mini-series is based, in order to understand that this is not a true story about what really happened almost 90 years ago. It is loosely based on facts, the rest is taken from the screenwriter's imagination. And, unfortunately, these changes are not successful and are mostly completely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> How to start? Vita and Violet did not use the names Mitya and Lushka until their romance began, and during this Violet also called Vita Dmitry and Julian. It was Violet who pursued Vita with a dagger when they were teenagers. The “seduction” scene, when their affair began, Violet was much more passive than the one presented here, and, of course, did not kiss Vita first. I could go on and on, all these examples were included when the series had just begun. Besides all these changes of facts, the characteristics are also all wrong. At times, Vita behaves like a crazy woman. Especially the scene where she saw from the announcement of the engagement of the newspaper Violet, is ridiculous. Vita restrained a surge of emotion. It was Violet, who was temperamental and allowed her to show her feelings (good or bad). All that Vita did when she read this is that she almost fainted, that's all. Being a gentle character, Harold avoided collisions in real life, but here he is sometimes quite stern and blames. Harold and Vita always discussed their intimate things in letters, not verbally. And Violet ... I know that this series is specifically focused on Vita and Harold, but this does not mean that all the other characters should be just puppets on the sidelines. Here she is completely one-dimensional character, and the lines that she gives are mostly embarrassing, small. In fact, she was a clever, gifted, rather unusual woman who rarely appreciates what she deserves. I always considered her a much more interesting person than Vita. In this series, her misfortune, loneliness and problems with her mother are completely ignored. The viewer also knows little about her background and family, what kind of relationship (and marriage) she had with Deni Trefusis, or how hard she fought for Vit. Vita was the only love in her life, her meaning in life, and if Harold suffered during the novel, then Violet. After that, her life was ruined, and it took time for her to get ready again. The statue could play the role of Denis, so much the depth of his hero. Lady Sackville-West is just a poorly drawn caricature; annoying talker with an exaggerated French accent. <br /> <br /> The series ends with a completely poorly written scene in Amiens, and the script ended on this, according to the scriptwriter. No, it lasted a whole year after that, and its ending was much longer and sadder than what was presented here. But that cares about the stupid ending, if the whole series was stupid from the very beginning. I have to pay tribute to the actors, they tried to make the most of the roles they were given, although Janet McTire, as Vita is the only one who really shines through. No one can complain about the settings either. All complaints are sent to the director and, above all, to the screenwriter. Instead of deep research of characters, there are too many sex scenes and conversations. Many scenes are too long, some are meaningless and do not add anything to the storyline. On the other hand, many details are reduced or omitted altogether. Especially there should have been more information about the youth of Vita and Violet and how their friendship developed. This is one exciting story that deserves much better adaptation. Maybe someday someone will do it. Currently, much more can be done from this story by reading this book or Violet's letters to Vita, which are brilliant things.
