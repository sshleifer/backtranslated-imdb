Created for the television version of The Heart of Darkness seemed like a good way to add more insight to the book, well, this is an erroneous assumption. The film made it worse. I was very disappointed with almost everything in the film. I was hoping that the film might help bring together parts of the book that I did not understand, but nothing of the kind happened. It still left me confused and hanging. This is one of those films because of which you can feel that it would be more fun to watch the grass grow and not watch the movie. Not quite whose cup of tea. It was a terrible, boring and slow movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, Nicholas the Horn must have been in despair when he decided he wanted to make a boring book out of a movie. This is a guaranteed loss. It looks like a knife fight, but forget the knife on the kitchen table. A man without a knife is about to lose; and in this case, the man without a knife was Roeg. All I heard about the film is bad stuff, and the film deserves the bad thing to say about it. After watching the movie, I got the impression that the people who shot the movie just flipped through the book to get the key points. <br /> <br /> Moreover, although the film did indeed follow the main storyline of the book, it missed quite a few details, and it also changed the ending. I am not a fan of this. The horn was gone when Marlowe and his crew stumbled upon a camp of Russian sailors, and in this camp they found a book. It was also not visible when in the camp they met a sign with the inscription: “Firewood for you. Hurry up. Go carefully ”(Konrad 110). In addition, at the end of the book, Kurtz dies in a boat, not in the inner station. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, Nicholas Horn did one good thing when shooting a film; he managed to hire quite decent actors to play in the film. For example, he acquired Tim Roth and John Malkovich, who both subsequently continued their successful career. At the same time, he added something to the horrible movie. In addition, although I tear his book to shreds, I have some respect for him, because it takes a lot of courage to try to take the Heart of Darkness. This is not the easiest novel to portray in the film. However, valiant work! In conclusion, if for some reason someone really wants to watch this film, I suggest reading the Heart of Darkness first. This way, you get all the scenes that were excluded from the film, and you will not be completely lost while watching it. But I really advise you not to read a book or watch a movie; both will be a complete waste of your time. Trust me. My English teacher made me do it, and now I would like a book and a movie not to be. If you are interested in a book or movie, good luck!
