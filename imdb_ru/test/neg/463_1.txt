How someone might even start to love this movie, really outside of me. <br /> <br /> Idea? He has none. "The guy fell apart." This is an idea. Wow. The environment was slowly killing him ... now ITâ€™s original and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> This is the first Fasbinder film that I saw ... I heard that he is the genius of a stage scene. Scene, but I have seen student films with more attention, inspiration, idea and skill than this ... this ... this is nothing. There is nothing in it! <br /> <br /> Each shot is too long. There are so many voids in them ... The game is terrible. You can see that the actors had no preparation at all, no understanding of their roles, even attempts to show emotions ... this is so ... superficial ... The lines are so expressive that you could remove 90% of them and still the same crappy movie. Pace? Who cares about this. Atmosphere, dynamics, it's for pussies! One frame per scene, 80% of the time people look unrealistic, having no idea how to portray emotions and the importance of the moment, except for a blank look at the camera or at each other ... EDITING? All editing rules were ignored without any payment in any way ... Photography? Half of the pictures have a reflection, and shoddy lighting without any styling. Shadows, shadow play ... who needs it? We need a guy who writes, drinks, beats his wife, as if he ... as if he were acting. We need a bunch of close-ups of a not very beautiful woman ... we need an amateur climax of his capture by an unconvincing Arab tormentor ... There were so many mistakes in this film that it was not worth it without a budget. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I haven't seen such a bad movie since the American pie 5. Yes. This is bad. <br /> <br /> I just started watching his film "Veronica Foss", which seems much better, based on the first 15 minutes (as it has a hint of direction and artistic idea, unlike shit), therefore I will not argue that Fasbinder is clueless .... but this ... this movie sucks!
