I am sure that most children will enjoy this family movement of the mill, but not so much to please the adults who are watching the film. The premise of the film is that the policeman Belushi resigns, but is drawn into the case, as a result of which he becomes a private investigator. The plot of the film is so obvious that most children will most likely choose an end before this happens. But in addition to this, there seems to be story arches and plots that are forgotten as the movie progresses. This is combined with a subplot where the title K-9 is supplanted by Belushi. I'm afraid this should be avoided.
