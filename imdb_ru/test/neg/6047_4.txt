In Chicago, four electricians led by Dean (Richard Grieco) come to the old building to turn off the electricity. They accidentally activate the portal and fall into another dimension, where Chicago was destroyed by the Queen of Spiders and inhabited by mutants. The group meets the survivors led by Crane (David Nerman) and Elena (Kate Greenhouse) and finds the inventor of the portal, Dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who has lived in this dimension for thirty years. They join forces, trying to restore the portal to bring them home. "Web" is a watchable plagiarism of "Sliders", only worse. It seems that most of the dialogues are written by someone who has not finished primary school, so they are weak. In addition, the story is illogical, and it seems that Chicago is the only city in the world. A scientist is trying to start his complex machine with broken wires, as if he is stealing a car, this is very funny. Richard Greco’s face looks like the white version of Michael Jackson and is terrible. If the viewer switches off his brain, he may like this unforgettable television film. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “On Teia do Terror” (“The Network of Horrors”)
