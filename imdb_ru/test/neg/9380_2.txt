The only good thing in Persepolis is the shadows created in German expressionism in the style of animation, and a hint of history. I am tired of this movie. It was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture, who tries everything else and then returns to her roots. Here she finds great discontent again and finally goes to the finals to allow everyone else in her country to figure out the situation and what they will do now when there is none to support them. This does not lead to any conclusion and leaves us with the feeling that this woman has no loyalty. Keep in mind, it is torn between cultures and does not have sufficient background, it seems to understand what is important and real. She listens to so many voices and is more likely to end up becoming a citizen in the world than anyone who has any connection with her native Iranian culture. The only thing I got from this movie was fear.
