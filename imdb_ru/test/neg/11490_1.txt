I have not seen or heard the original version. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m not Russian, but I am learning now. <br /> <br /> I have no preferences regarding Russia, Bulgaria, the United States, etc. <br /> <br /> But I must mention the following: <br /> <br /> In German synchronization, everything film all Russian speak with a Russian accent. Americans say "Hochdeutsch" (without accent)! I have never heard such nonsense! Besides, it's boring. <br /> <br /> Hopefully the original is better. <br /> <br /> The rest is a simple thriller, not a very good idea. Like a cheap version of a James Bond movie.
