This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Boring, illogical, terrible. Do not waste a minute in your life to watch this shit! I hope that the directors will not make any other film, because this film will ruin them. The film seems to have been created in one or two days with some directors friends (if we can use this word for these two guys). They use only the camera in their hands. Many scenes in the dark and can not see anything. Many scenes (80% of the film) are just talking. ! There are films like Vampire vs. Zombies, on which you can laugh, but this is just bad, there is no point in making such films. Please stop Jason Horton and Shannon Hubbela. Do not make more movies!
