Angels and Demons: 3 of 10: Obviously something bad has happened to Ron Howard. I don't know what exactly, but something went wrong. <br /> <br /> Howard has always been a worthy leader. Although he would never be accepted as an artistic scholar, Cinderella and Apollo 13 were excellent films, Parenthood was quite good, and even the sequel / sequel Angels and Demons The Da Vinci Code was a fun game. In addition, none of his films were absolutely terrible. (Note that I didn’t see Neither Grinch Stole Christmas, nor his newest film Heidi Monteg Says No to Plastic.) What more Howard managed to retain this quality was in genres such as the Oscar star. ("Beautiful mind"), costume drama, star-controlled? (Far and Far), the starry fantasy of revenge (Ransom) and the comedy about prostitution and mermaids (Night Shift, Splash). <br /> <br /> “Angels and Demons” at its center is a poorly filmed and filmed movie. The scenes are too dark, all the corners of the camera are wrong, the actors block each other's shots, and the whole plot is often out of focus. This makes the story of the already tangled story even more confusing. <br /> <br /> Dan Brown is very fond of, but I think the Da Vinci Code is a fascinating joke (so sue me). The cinematic version of the Da Vinci code retained the same thing as in the next edition of the book, and added an attractive cast and attractive film set. <br /> <br /> However, angels and demons occur in the claustrophobic framework of the Vatican and since Howard was not allowed to shoot in many real places, we end up running around CGI. The whole movie looks like Rick Steves made a special Vatican, and instead of actually visiting the Sacred City and directing his camera, Rick had to use Lego bricks and a used art book with all his boobs erased. <br /> <br /> While the Da Vinci code had what I still consider to be an intriguing central mystery (sue me again), the story of the Demons and Angels consists of the conspiracy of the Illuminati (now rolls his eyes) to destroy the Vatican. Their idea was to take positions in schools for the deaf around the world and repeatedly raping every student in the ass. Oh my bad; Obviously, the Vatican does not need any help with this. <br /> <br /> In any case, their plan is to penetrate the Large Hadron Collider in Europe, kill the high priest and steal three bubbles of antimatter. This raises more than a few questions. Can the hadron collider create antimatter? Can you capture the created antimatter? Why does the EU collect it? (Perhaps they fear the attack of Godzilla?). Why does the head of Antimatter collect a priest from the Vatican? Now, when they get antimatter, are they going to use his incredible destructive power to take over the world ?? no, just kidding; unfortunately, the Illuminati have not yet fully understood the level of difficulty of Pinky and Brain. Instead, the current pope has just died and the time has come for the conclave. The best cardinals for the final tournament with four dads were kidnapped, and the Illuminati kill them one by one in the Seven style. Being a good sport, they, however, leave evidence in every murder, like some kind of Latin American Riddler. Yes, and the last stolen cardinal has antimatter, and if he is not found on time, Rick Steves will have to go straight to Venice next year to see worthy frescoes. If there was any Latin-style Batman to save the day. Well, the story is really horrible and badly told, but maybe this is one of those films that have survived thanks to the excellent performances. True character study ?? (Ok, you know where this is going). Tom Hanks gives an incredibly wooden representation and looks just awful (he's also an adult to play a character for about twenty years). His love interest Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer has no chemistry with either Hanks or the screen. Ewan McGregor plays Papana's personal assistant as an Irish boy who looks like he is going to hack a musical number at any moment if no one steals his Lucky Charms. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, as the head of the security service of the Vatican, Stellan Skarsgård was in an excellent position, and as far as we know, none of the deaf children were raped during the making of this film, which puts him in front of critics of the Vatican in at least one area.
