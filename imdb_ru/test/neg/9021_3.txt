What distinguishes some of the films of the “Lone Star” (and many others in western and adventure films of the early thirties) is the lack of what we call the formal story-telling in them. To be sure that they had a good against evil (the main element of any Western), the boy meets a girl and some typical characters, such as the old rancher and his beautiful daughter or granddaughter, and sometimes an evil banker or other businessman, but action was played, often different from the movie for the film. <br /> <br /> In The Lawless Frontier, Earl Dwire, in his big star turn (does not) plays the role (for some inexplicable reason) of Pandro Zanti, “half” Apache, half American, posing as a Mexican, who speaks that language fluently. " His most prominent image of a Mexican seemed to be his outrageous mariachi clothes. It seems that the only plot is that he wants to steal Ruby, the granddaughter of "Old Dusty" (Gabby Hayes). When she first met her, Dwire looked at her for a long time, which puts him in the big leagues with sexual predators. You might think that since the opening scene shows how Zanti kills John (Wayne) Tobin's father behind the scenes, this will play a big role in the film. This is not true. Too much back and forth between heroes and villains. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, we get a lot of good tricks from Yakima Kanutta, including pulling up Ruby on a horse as he drives past, jumping on the "renegades" and knocking at his feet. they jump off their horses, the horse jumps off a cliff into the lake, and even descends the same gateway as in Lucky Texan (1934), although this time the Mighty Yak uses a log to surf instead of a vagabond. a branch of a tree, and its inclusion this time is just as illogical as they are in the desert. <br /> <br /> A bright point is the measured and methodically well-photographed walk of John Wayne in the desert after fleeing and stumbling over Zanti with these fantastic basalt rocks of Red Rock Canyon (which can be seen in countless TV shows, westerns and science fiction "moon" films) framed behind it. There is no final gunfight at fifty paces with the heroine running from the wooden steps of the bar to hug and kiss the winning hero in this film! When John Wayne finally catches up with him, Zanti drinks poisoned water from the waterhole and dies. <br /> <br /> After several too many chase episodes, the Zantaya gang was finally captured in Dusty's cabin, appearing one after another behind the turntable, which apparently leads to the canyon, is now blocked by dynamite. No sunset or compulsory kissing girl: last shot - Ruby, now Mrs. John Tobin, by phone with now Sheriff John Tobin: “What would Sheriff Tobin like for dinner?” The film also has poor lighting and editing at the beginning, a step goes slowly, some of the parts with the sheriff make him pull, and chasing the horses fill the film. Thus, despite the different and unusual elements, it is considered one of the weaker Lonely Stars.
