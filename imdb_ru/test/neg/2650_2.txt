According to one critic of the film’s review, “it began slowly and stopped.” The plot was fairly believable (although some of the characters' actions seemed very, very RANDOMED), the script was pretty well written (the dialogue did not seem forced in this), but everything went too slowly so great. This film had the potential, but blew it up like a teenager addressing drugs. My advice? Wait until it appears on television before you see it.
