Ineffective, worn out, pathetic to himself, lousy supplier Jimmy Stewart has a bad marriage with Carol Lombard. After heavy difficulties, he is experiencing humiliating work, looking for flaws, a passive-aggressive, hardy, lively mother who is in dire need of an epic brush, and an endlessly weeping child. The film shovels failure and squalor to an invisible end. Do you want to watch couples with mom for ninety minutes? Many scenes show a screaming child. The film does not explain why we want to bring the mother out of hell, or why Jimmy Stewart can't grow a couple. Who wanted to see it? Who wanted to see Stuart and Lombard without laughter or charm? <br /> <br /> This is absolutely frustrating and unbearable.
