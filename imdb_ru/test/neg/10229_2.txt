Also called -> Magic Castle -> This is a stretch. Why bother? Why create another rock bar, and then add another storyline that has almost nothing to do with the play or Swan Lake. Only some rokbart girlfriend, a stolen book of forbidden arts and original characters (no voices remain). Undressed to his naked, this is a continuation in the balance. The next thing you know, some bird will remember the "forbidden arts" and the Swan Princess 4: the magic bird will be born. Fortunately, although the chapters are supposedly closed, and it will start, the poorly completed trilogy is coming to an end.
