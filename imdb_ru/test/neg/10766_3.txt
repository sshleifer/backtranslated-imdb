As a person who read all the books of Baroness Orchi and saw most of the films based on them, I must say that the 1980s version with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour was better than this. It was better written and more in tune with the spirit of the story than this one, which seemed to be trying its best to draw people into the shooting. This new adaptation is less carefree, but not so deep. Although there is a good acting game, the actors had nothing to work with. Nice costumes, though.
