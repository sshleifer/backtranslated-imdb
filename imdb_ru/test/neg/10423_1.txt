I saw this movie in the cinema. I took lessons in the Second City of Chicago, and, of course, the noise of this film was intense. This is a Woodward film about one of the local sons of the Second City. <br /> <br /> Everyone knew about the story of John. Everyone knew how he died. Some even knew that knowledge did not make him especially friendly to women in improvisation or comedy. <br /> <br /> But hey. the man led his life, and he was very loved by the people who were in his world, and it also says that he treated all his close friends with love and respect. <br /> <br /> This movie. Well. Forget the idea that poor Michael Chilklis (who is really a great actor) makes a strikingly bad movie, and in fact only gives himself in the role of imitation of this man. <br /> <br /> Forget that they could not get the rights to any of the works of Belushi ... and there was never a single SNL scene that they portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> Hide the thought that half of the historical information in the film did not even follow Bob Woodwards working. Something like: “Well ... we are going to mess with Belushi ... now let's go for Woodward ...” They also decided to take the premise “This is a wonderful life” and turn it into “This is a terrible life on a crack”. <br /> <br /> Is he a guardian angel or a devil? Is the pinball machine an electronic devil mate ... how many different endings can you attach to a movie? This is one of those films after it's all over ... you look at the person you are with, and in a dazed bewilderment say: "What the hell was that ?!" In some circles, this film has become a kind of cult classic. But for good reason. <br /> <br /> A good iconic classic that you sit around the screen and make fun of (or throw out disposable liners) on the screen. The cult film is never good. And most people would never see them in any serious context. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some classic bad artwork of the late 80s? Rent wired. If you want to know about John Belushi ... you can get more information about the walls of the second city of Chicago than this movie.
