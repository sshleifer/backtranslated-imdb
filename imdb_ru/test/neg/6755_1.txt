I was completely misled by the comments on this film, mainly because someone said that he had seen him at a film festival and loved him every minute. Expecting that this would be a good showing of the American Pie movie, I was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the camera work is terrible, I don’t think that the director knows that the cameras can move around the scenes. than staying in place and forcing the actors to move close and far away of their own accord. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the scenery! My God, I saw more furniture in the bird's nest. The club was completely unconvincing when about 3 extras danced in the background. The apartments were bare and devoid of individuality. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the actors. Wow. Obviously, the director chose the typical character of “The Reaper”, a blunt main character with a rude character “I don’t give a damn” who hits the main character. Everything that the main character said and did was a chore, so much so that it made me flinch. <br /> <br /> In general, the plot, supposedly a big topic of revenge, lasted about 30 seconds and had no real motivation. The characters acted irrationally and seemed to have no real relationship with anyone else. None of the characters had depth, they could be cardboard cutouts passing by a static camera. <br /> <br /> Truly a terrible piece, worse than freshmen, a short 2-minute walk for YouTube. Board Director? Change your name and deny any connection to the film, which will probably sell one copy on a sale in Ohio.
