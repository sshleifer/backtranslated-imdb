With David Arquette in the lead role, you immediately think that this is a stupid movie. Well, it's a stupid movie with a horrible script. But the F / X, namely the octopus freaks, make this click a shout to look. A tribute, albeit from a foolish side, to the great features of the mutant creatures of the 50s. Arquette and Sheriff Sam (Kari Ukhrer) are calling for help in combating toxic waste caused by giant spiders that damage their tiny town in Arizona. Also in the cast are Doug E. Doug, Rick Overton, Leon Rippi and charming Scarlett Johansson.
