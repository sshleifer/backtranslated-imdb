The 80s were the best and worst time for James Karin, he starred in one of the best cult horror comedies with The Return of the Living Dead, and a year later he makes this ... bad movie. The sequel to the Solids (but not quite), has a group of rather incredible characters trying to make a film in Greece. Because of the design or pure laziness, the line between the film and the “film in the film” is not only blurred, but also completely absent on the stage (which would be incomprehensible if I was just wondering what happens in the film in the film). first place. A stranger would be too generous a term. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nana, Fabiana Udenio and many other topless extras; Brenda Bakke shows some T & A <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> More info on the DVD: “Solids”, “American High School”, “Strike” trailers only , "Virgin Territory" (comes as a dual-function DVD with the first film for masochism)
