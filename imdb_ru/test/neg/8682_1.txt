<br /> <br /> A very boring and painstaking adaptation of Amis' funny satire. The hero is not portrayed as a handsome loser, but simply a nerd cretin. Most of the rest are pure caricatures, only Helen McCrory demonstrates real quality and a bit of wit of the novel. Periodic settings are set as if they were the 1920s, and not the post-war period of horror and rock and roll comics. A real fool even by the standards of bad British television. <br /> <br />
