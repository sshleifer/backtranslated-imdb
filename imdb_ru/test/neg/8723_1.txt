Drivel. Excessive junk. The authors were not supposed to read a book or watch a David Lynch film. Do not waste time. <br /> <br /> The longer the better. Although it is more detailed than the Lynch film, it has gross inaccuracies and key details of the story. <br /> <br /> “Night at Roxbury” is more worth your time.
