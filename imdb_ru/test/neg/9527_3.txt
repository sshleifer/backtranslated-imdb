History, as I understand it, is “based on real events.” This can be either good or bad, depending on which license you get with these real events and how they are displayed. <br /> <br /> In this case, the results are enough to plug the larva. I did not expect much from me - I was anticipating the story of how rich students go on an ocean cruise under a strict skipper. That is, I thought it was a film about coming of age, like something about a training camp or basic training in which a sergeant instructor says: "My duty is to get you out of your beautiful civilian ways." Well, it is, in a sense. Children begin as children and end up as an organic group. But it’s a lot more hockey than any boot camp movie I've ever seen, except for a deliberate comedy. Who wrote this thing? The air is filled with slogans that belong not in high school, but in the third grade. Dialogue offends hearing. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges usually does a better job than average, but in this case his performance is mediocre. He does not bring anything superfluous to this role, although, given his lines, it is difficult to understand how he could have done a lot with them. The rest of the cast is unremarkable, and some children are painfully inadequate. Many tears and many tears. In the best scene involved a dolphin. <br /> <br /> Immature cliches continue to the very end. The Coast Guard is assigned to the role of a cruel court at a hearing that follows disaster. The investigator does not do anything except to hit Bridges on the head with his misinterpretations and misinterpretation of events. "You allowed the team to drink alcohol, right?" (A pair of harmless drinks.) "And you did not punish them, although you punished them for killing fish." (Dolphinarium.) Technical details related to drowning are unclear. What is a "white squall"? And if this is so dangerous, according to Bridges, why was the entire crew not warned and did not wear life jackets? But why continue? If Albatross were a dreadnought, it would still be torpedoed and sunk by a ridiculous comic book script.
