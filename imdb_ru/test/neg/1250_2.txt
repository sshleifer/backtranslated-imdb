How does this movie suck? Being a fan of Michael Imperoli’s work on The Sopranos, I took it to Blockbuster, based on his name and story, which sounded like I had promised. It still happens, but this film does not fulfill it. <br /> <br /> Every turn of the story is completely predictable; I kept looking for a Lifetime bug in the bottom right of the screen. All this is: a noble woman, coming out of difficult times, a guy who is not able to realize her potential, despite all her efforts, a child who is stuck in the middle, etc., D., Etc., And so on. D. ., And so on. The identity of the mysterious stranger — that’s what I really wanted to throw things on the TV — I would be more satisfied that little Suey woke up and realized that it was all a dream. <br /> <br /> Cinematographers might as well have a "Moral of History ..." a little before loans, since, as another reviewer noted, this thing really rolls like a special school. Do not play, do not drink, do not take drugs, stay with your wife, spend time with your children ... come on, what about a little nuance? How about interesting bad guys? Writer / Director A.V. Widmer should be highlighted for special notice: not only the dialogues are lead, but the pace (in the dialogue and at the different ends of many scenes) make this film at least 45 minutes longer than necessary (and believe me, it looks like more). The talents of Imperioli, René Faye and some of the support team (Steve Shirrip, natch) are the only things that keep him from the “1” rating. All their good work is almost offset by the terrible work of the image of the boy Stui. Not sure if it was a casting mistake (hey, this is a mob film, so let's play someone from Blue Tips, who can't do anything but overdo it with a big fake smirk ... next let's play a sullen, thoughtful child in a Disney movie) or just a horrible direction, but it’s very painful to watch these scenes. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in the opinion of another director about this character and his story; It is a pity that Imperoli has already been used with this click Awful, terrible, terrible.
