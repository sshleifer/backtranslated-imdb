Mostly the municipalities of Liberty and Ramseur and the surrounding countryside. This is not a particularly good movie.

Cinematography is fuzzy things that appeared in the late sixties and early seventies. Locals were happy to be part of the enterprise. <br /> <br /> If viewers have difficulty finding a copy of this film, a copy of the recording is available in Ashborough, North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Unreliable actors include Ben Jones, Mimi Pravda, Tommy Hull, Bill Nanneri.
