I have just written a commentary on ACES HIGH (1976), and it reminds me of this film, which I watched as a child when it was released; since then I have only watched it once, and that was more than enough. As Kevin says well, "it's a waste of time." In addition to dog fights that are well done, the rest is a sequence of poorly patched scenes with actors fighting the lousy scenario and the same lousy direction. I don’t remember the silly German accents mentioned by Kevin in his comments, but this is another pitiful mistake; If Korman tried to make a more convincing description of German pilots, why didn't he use German actors or did they duplicate these roles? On the other hand, this is a good example of horrible Hollywood filmmaking with their "villains", so clearly recognizable not only by their cruel actions, but also by their grotesque accents. <br /> <br /> Speaking of "brutal actions" - the funny scene was the murder of Lieutenant Hermann Goering by English nurses during the attack on the airbase - absolutely disgusting part of the propaganda carried out with "historical hindsight." If you want to see an actual, touching, very well played and directing film about the air war during the First World War “ACES HIGH” (1976) or this wonderful classic “THE DAWN PATROL” (1938), you will not be disappointed.
