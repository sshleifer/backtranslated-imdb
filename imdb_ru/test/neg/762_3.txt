C.H.O.M.P.S. this is very similar to any crappy comedy show of the Disney family of the late 70s, for example, "Cat from space" or "Unidentified flying eccentric." Completely devoid of anything creative, beating the same stamps to death, but vaguely entertaining in a thoughtless way. Actors won neither the award, nor the director, the screenwriter, or the FX film crew, but there is some vague entertainment in its harmless and gentle predictability. The idea of ​​a robot dog as a security system is so leaky that you can use it as a colander. An incredibly repetitive disco soundtrack is stuck in your head, so be careful.
