I'm a big fan of the ABC Movies of the Week genre. I am only 27, that is, I was not even born until the end of the series, but I try to collect as many of them as possible on DVD. I have about a dozen or so. I read such wonderful things about this film, both here and in other places, and I was very happy to see him. I just received my DVD in the mail today and watched it anxiously. I admit that the first one or two phone calls made goosebumps - this guy's voice would make all the goosebumps! But this was beginning to fade away quickly, and the whole story about the divorce was stupid. I also found out that Michael Douglas was an antagonist about half an hour before the end of the film. As soon as this story was told about how the character Elizabeth Ashley locked up her mother, I realized that something was strange. In addition, no one thought to ask him why he suddenly appeared that night when a fire broke out in the barn? I admit that I thought he was training a boy at school to make phone calls. I didnâ€™t guess about the dumb boy or the prerecorded recordings (did they ever say whose voice it really is? I doubt Douglas could ever hear such a high voice?). <br /> <br /> I only give this film four out of ten, because I really liked most of the acting. Ashley is especially good. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because this film has such a wonderful premise, but, well, well, that's what sometimes happens when someone hopes too much for a film.
