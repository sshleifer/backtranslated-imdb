I went to Curve Earth to see a piece of New Zealand. What I found was a poorly written and badly acting echo of people I know. <br /> <br /> Wonderful moments between characters ?? including many of the scenes of Temuera Morrison and Lawrence Makoares together ?? were often destroyed by long and verbose monologues through which the actors were forced to stumble. Beautiful and ill-suited phrases were thundering from Lawrence, in particular, as if he were the new Maori Messiah in his beer box chair. <br /> <br /> When I watched any movie with Maori actors, I discovered that I can always choose half a dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life. With Crooked Earth, I struggled to find one key character that sounded believable during all two hours. Most ?? including Wiremu and Peka ?? I spoke or did things that I did not understand and could not contact. By the end of the film, the writer managed to push the audience away where the Maori could not contact her, and therefore Pakekha received a license to dismiss him. I feel like a movie message ?? or, at least, the chief of several, who lobbied in the audience ?? It is important enough to avoid using the character's limbs. Unfortunately, none of those who read the script before it was filmed thought to convey this advice. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was invasive and as annoying as that terrible “bing bong” sound they added. through "wide-open eyes." The audience was not so subtly inclined to laugh, cry or get angry when the music changed. It reminded me of Darth Vader’s input music in Star Wars: obvious and slightly amusing. <br /> <br /> I think there are people who might like this film. It's funny in parts, has a lot of action and has some really powerful scenes. Calvin Tuteao and Quentin Heath also did a lot of work. In general, however, I did not enjoy the experience as I know I should have. Barbed wire, Speed ​​2, Dr. Moreau Island and Earth Curve look like they are a quartet of Tam's crap.
