... and I bought a vampire bike, staggering all along this line, like a drunk with tied shoelaces. Some "bad" films are pretty enjoyable (for example, Norman J. Warren's "Normann"), some "bad" films are just bad (for example, Kent Bateman's "Headless Eyes"), but "bad" films that are deliberately trying to make the postmodern thing. the bad should always be approached with extreme caution. For example, many people think that Terma Firmer from Troma is a masterpiece of bad taste, but I assume that anyone who is more than nineteen years old will dismiss him as if it were useless rubbish. Then there is the Dark Star of John Carpenter. Yes, it is strange and, of course, is a product of its time, but, like the film, it is only two steps higher than the useless. This budgetless British black comedic horror is trying to achieve a satirical tone, with its endless references to his fellow splashes (among them Psychomania, Horrible Hospital and pretty much anything from Pete Walker), but because of the dismal performances of the second television actors (leading The lady looks like Amy Winehouse), the script that seems to have been written on the back of a cleaned beer mat by two “guys”, not understanding how the comedy works, terribly (intentionally?) Dean Friedman's soundtrack to the elevator and production prices they never go beyond the bounds of a mediocre, the result is a film that you can only laugh at and not C. If your idea of ​​nonsense is anthropomorphic poop, Chinese takeaway dishes called “Fu King” and links to long-forgotten television commercials ads, you'll like it, but don't expect too much.
