Altman is very proud of the fact that people in his films talk to each other, because, according to him, people do it in life. Well, people also cough, otrygivat, go crazy, etc. The bottom line is that only the fact that people actually do something, does not make them attractive to the cinema. This is one of the problems. <br /> <br /> A more serious problem is that in 1988 or 2004, this is simply not a very smart, direct or tricky or relevant satire. Harry Trudeau still lives in the 1960s and thinks that everything except the small core of republican elected officials is a hippie liberal in the style of the 60s. I mean, the guy is still driving out Zonker in his strip - a character who is a complete anachronism, but Trudeau still uses him, as if he represents a large strip of American youth. <br /> <br /> I do not understand, I am wrong. I am a conservative, but I am not saying that this is bad, because he has a liberal inclination. This may take a liberal position and be funny and relevant, but it is not. Basically, this is vanity with a group of famous liberal celebrities (including the odious repellent of Ron Reagan Jr.). From time to time he feels unrecorded, and the rest of the time he has a strange kind of self-confidence and “aren't we so smart?” - Ness. <br /> <br /> Someone said that this show insists that he has a cult after. I think his cult status is more desirable than actual. I’m sure there are two or three people who recorded all the original episodes in 1988 and still have them, but if this is the standard, then every show that has ever been broadcast is somewhat of a cult classic. If Tanner didn’t have the names Altman and Trudeau, it would be another forgotten production of the 1980s HBO. Instead, he is presented as a harsh, harsh political comment from guys who are on top of their game. However, the reality is as far from it as possible. Pat Paul's presidential satire is more relevant than Tanner ever was, and he has been dead for ten years.
