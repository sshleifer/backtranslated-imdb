Another example of the fact that we have to steer clear of attempts to make exciting militants in Sweden does not work, with the exception of Widerbergs, the still unmatched MANNEN PÃ… TAKET. I believe that Stormare is doing everything possible, and some scenes are mildly effective, but the plot is full of holes. Why does Hamilton continue to attack the base, knowing that his wife is being held hostage? It was fun to see Mark Hamill, but his role as Bad Guy was very much signed. I am constantly surprised that relatively large Swedish films like this are made without a reasonable, working script. 1 of 5
