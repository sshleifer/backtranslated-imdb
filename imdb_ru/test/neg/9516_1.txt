This film was so sad to watch. Split screens do not allow you to greatly influence the emotions of actors. I constantly walked back and forth, watching all these tiny images that I found to the end with wiplash. This is basically an excerpt from “The Talented Mr. Ripley” and “Timecode”, I was very disappointed by this attempt by the filmmakers to be cool. I would like to leave, like many other people.
