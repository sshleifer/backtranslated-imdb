My brother plays "The Elk" in this movie. Although most of his scenes remained on the floor of the cutting room. The funny thing about the film is “Nothing compares to the statistics.” Anyway, this is filmed in Portland, Oregon, where we grew up. The dance club is called Up Front FX. What I really liked about this movie is that the main character (which is not on the box, because Bolo brings more influence) should be a police detective ... a great opportunity to drive on a red Porsche cabriolet. I need to get a copy of this, preferably a director's version, so that I can see all the scenes in which my brother is in. The only scene he is in is the beginning when they are in a dance club. He got a place because he met with this fan from the semi-professional football team The Oregon Thunderbolts. This is interesting because its name is referred to as the first entry in IMDb. His glory, good luck, not so much.
