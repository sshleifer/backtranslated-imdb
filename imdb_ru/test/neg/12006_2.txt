this film was incredibly stupid with the meaning that ever. I felt bad for all the actors and actresses who ruined their careers there to be in this stupid film. the whole movie was based on how unreal they could do it to make it look a bit like that, which made it even more stupid. even some names were unreal. The film is fun to watch, so it had 2 out of 10 stars. this is probably the third most stupid movie ever made. I really did it after I realized that it was mostly adult actors, but it was a children's film. the most distressing was Danny Trejo, a horror actor who is always dirty. the rest of the actors were clean enough, as I understand it.
