This is a pale imitation of the die hard franchise, which just sucks. The filmâ€™s low ambitions are clearly demonstrated when terrorists hold the vice president hostage, and he has to call the White House to ask them to transfer some money. In most films of this genre, the president is kidnapped or held hostage, because in the end he (or she) is the most powerful person in the country who has a finger on the nuclear button, etc. D. And so on. would be worried if Dick Cheney had been kidnapped? An honest answer is probably not. Why do terrorists choose the Stanley Cup finals for their operation and why, despite the many explosions around them, the audience at the hockey stadium does not pay attention to the situation, these are questions that are not answered. Let's just say this movie is really hockey, not hockey. Those who loved the film and found it exciting should get a life.
