Seriously, Sci-Fi needs to stop making films. They are all terrible. And this was John Rees-Davies, and he could not help the film. Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito) seizes the legendary goat Mexican Chupacabra and takes him aboard a cruise ship, whose captain is Captain Rudolph (John Rhys-Davies). Then the creature runs off and starts killing the crew and passengers. Then Captain Rudolph and the crew follow the creature burning the weapon. But they can't stop it. So they call in the fleet. They can't stop it either. Then the thing kills all 5 (or how many there are). Then the captain and his daughter, along with some other guy find out how to kill him. Stay away from this movie. The chupacabra looks incredibly cheesy, the naval people shoot at the slightest movement, throw grenades into the ship, and the actions are terrible. 3/10.
