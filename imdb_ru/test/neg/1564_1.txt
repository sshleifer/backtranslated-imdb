Cultural vandalism Is the new product the “hallmark” of Gulliver's journey an act of cultural vandalism? Not literally. In the end, not a single copy of the book was burned. But if this is the only Gulliver people are exposed to, and for many it will be so, then these people will get nothing like what Jonathan Swift has in mind. If Jonathan Swift were alive, Hallmark could be sued for violating moral rights, and they would lose. This is a good way to think before starting a project using other people's ideas. <br /> <br /> Swift's masterpiece is an outstanding vision of humanity. Through his hero, Gulliver, he travels to places that make him feel big, small, shitty and human. Little people in Lilleput are small in all respects. Small and stupid, they fight, great and small, endless wars of annihilation, at the end of which their soft-boiled eggs open at the breakfast table. Looks like us. <br /> <br /> I forgot the rest: it has been many years since I read it. The TV show reminded me of some things, and, on the other hand, it made me want to read it again. <br /> <br /> This gift to humanity collapsed, as Guligan under the branches under the vulgar yahoos, and Danson, Steenbergen and especially two great actors, Peter O'Toole and Edward Fox, should be ashamed. Some “Creative Man” had a brilliant idea to focus on the “star”: Gulliver, played by Ted Danson, whose game is simply bad. He portrays Gulliver as a madman. All his travels were compiled. Weeeeel. Yeeeaaah! Of course, Swift invented Gulliver! Naturally, the lands he visited were imaginary: this is called fiction. His goal was to tell about humanity and our, often terrible, relationships with each other. Traveling his imaginary character to imaginary lands is his method. But these people perceive imagination as a disease, and anyone who has a moment when Hallmark cannot turn into one of his anode cards is a suspect. <br /> <br /> I can understand exactly why Hallmark created this nonsense. It's so bad that O'Toole, always deep, seems as small as his Lilliputian character. Of course, he is a character, while commenting on a character, as many, if not all, great actors do. Informing the character sheds light on this. Our light completes the character. It becomes three-dimensional through this act of psychic triangulation. Most actors do it very subtly, like Hopkins in Remains of the Day. Others, such as Nicholson, in most things over the past twenty years, play two parts quite widely from each other. Nicholson actually plays on the relationship of his two points and with us also: with him, this is all the cradle of a cat, and he, giggling, holds all the sequences. Very fun, like O'Toole. But something is missing here. He screams into a megaphone (as great as ever), and all he feels is an empty shell standing under it. <br /> <br /> This is so. Look for "anodyne" and there should be the word "Hallmark" as a synonym. Harmless, soft, harmless. A distinctive feature is the doll, which can not urinate, because it does not have genital organs: this is the norm, the average indicator, a man without distinction. The hallmark is the absence of a sign. I never suspected that such people so despise those who have imagination. Suddenly, Disney vs. Metaphysics Pound stands out in bold. Or Einstein: "Genius people will always be cruelly opposed by mediocre minds." Indeed, anyone of this mediocre type who has the answer to any question other than "a)" or "b)" is a suspect. Who is more distinctive than a person who travels through the dark places of the human soul and lights up his little flashlight to light up what can be found there? Hence the act of vandalism. The Taliban destroyed the Buddhas in Afghanistan, the Palestinians the oldest synagogue in the world in Jericho, the barbarians the great sculptures of the classical era, and all this is clearly vandalism. The attribute seeks to protect us from foreign adversaries, undermining our own culture; one that feeds and supports them. And for us. <br /> <br /> Please buy a copy of Gulliver's Travel, wherever you live, and read it. Or order online. I like to use ABE Books.
