I feel very bad for watching this film, because I want me to watch it only as a concept film. The covenant looked as if it could be a truly original piece, but unfortunately they lose a great idea when translated to the screen. <br /> <br /> The story tells of four (five) teenagers who are descendants of families. This marked the beginning of the town of Ipswitch, which survived the test at the Salem witch. They are also part of the secret sect called "Testament." Their strength must be used sparingly, as it drains the life force in small quantities and causes heavy dependence. In theory, this could be a pretty good sci-fi action movie, or at least an interesting little movie. <br /> <br /> But there were too many bright failures that do not allow this film to reach its plot. full potential. This game was not good, the sound track was mediocre, and we found many unnecessary problems with synchronization. Surely the biggest problem is poor editing work. There is almost no consistent flow in the film, and it forces one to fight for mental chronology or sense of rhythm. <br /> <br /> The film has its moments, but overall it is a bit disappointing. <br /> <br /> Sorceress 4/10
