This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Thank God, I saw it for free. I would not want to spend my money on it. <br /> <br /> Firstly, there is no character in the film who would be cute in any case. Michael Caine comes close, but even he is quite imperfect. The rest of the "commandos" consist of disgusting former cons. There are two Arab gay men and three guys who are trying to rape a Red Cross nurse, and a “leader” who easily sends his people to kill so that he can escape. <br /> <br /> The "mission" is something of a wait. They have to blow up the fuel dump. Sounds exciting, right? Well, the footage follows them through endless sandstorms and flat tire repair. Yes, you read that right. “Waiting” - will they exhaust spare tires? We actually observe how they change something like 12 apartments along the way. That's how incredibly exciting this movie is. <br /> <br /> They get to the gas station and find that it is a decoy. So there is nothing to blow up. And at this time, for some very confusing reason, the British army decides that they no longer need these guys, and tells their whereabouts to the Germans to kill them. <br /> <br /> So now, at least, we Will you have an exciting race for freedom? No, instead they decide to blow up another fuel depot to create sabotage. But, when they get to this place, they launch a ground wire, and the Germans come after him - shouting their names through the loudspeaker. <br /> <br /> Really strange. If the Germans knew where they were and where they were going, why did they let them go all the way to the dump before jumping into the "trap"? Instead, they wait until they enter the fuel depot and fix all their expenses. Yeah. Right. It will happen. <br /> <br /> So, they blow up a landfill, the leader sells all his people - except Michael Kane, because he was offered $ 2,000 to return him alive. <br /> <OK ... so all the men were betrayed and killed, and Michael Caine and Nigel Davenport survived. British troops come in with tanks, and they decide to go fleeing. Because they wear a German uniform (they wore them to blow up a landfill), they tie a white flag around a stick and go out onto the road. <br /> <br /> Some British guy comes up behind them and machine guns to death. Loans are rolling. <br /> <br /> Yes. Two "Heroes" of the film die due to a random act of violence. <br /> <br /> It looks like the film has suddenly run out of budget and decided: “That's all. go home. "I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this tired, unimaginable and completely unrealistic film that ended with the grace of the bomb.
