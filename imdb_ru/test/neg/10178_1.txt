First of all, I have nothing against Christianity. I believe that everyone has the right to believe in what he or she chooses. But I can't imagine how stupid a person must be to believe it! What a waste of money believers. They better use it to feed hungry families in third world countries. I don’t want to talk about talk actor or the plot of this “movie” because I couldn’t find any of them in it. The story is simple - two reporters, one (A) an atheist, the other (B) for the sake of religion refused. B restores faith in religion and teaches A lesson - believe in Christ or go to hell. This message appears after about ten minutes and repeats until the end of the film. People who do not believe the rating of this "film", first read the reviews. I have not wasted an hour of my life :( PS: Why is it classified as fiction? Because of these few strange sounds and the bright light from the sky? New :)
