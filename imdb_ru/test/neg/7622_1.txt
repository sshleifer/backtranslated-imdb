Interesting topic. Miserable delivery - script and direction. <br /> <br /> Our hero, Miles, thaws and he is facing the world's first life restoration operation. This is where the fun begins. The main problem is that Miles does not have a SOUL !!! This is used to explain his quasi-unsustainable behavior of indirect responsibility for two deaths (I think this is the total number of deaths in 104 minutes). <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Miles prefers an odd glass of brandy, glowing fireplaces and his young, mature female cousin. The final really does justice to this film. <br /> <br /> Some thoughts: 1. Producer $$$ broke up to create this joke. J. D. Feigelson was a screenwriter and (or only) producer. It seems that he did not learn the lesson about “how not to bring an interesting idea to life” when one looks at his other writers' works. This will support the credibility of this scenario. <br /> <br /> 2. Now available on DVD! This is really scary. Must be forever "Bottom of the shelf" in VHS format. <br /> <br /> 3. A reincarnated person without a soul will by default become an evil creature. <br /> <br /> 4. Evaluation offers minimal support. Even Jerry Goldsmith can't save him. <br /> <br /> 5. Deserved the time interval 0230 on television and a bit more interesting than commercials + test samples, with which he competed during my viewing. <br /> <br /> 6. Fortunately, there was no continuation of the “Nightmare” franchise of Wes Craven. Chiller too: Returning miles or something like that. <br /> <br /> Despite my rating of 1, I still recommend this film as an excellent example of how to kill an acting or screenwriting career. This should apply to directing, but Wes Craven will be forever released because of his only good work, A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984.
