This film simply does not have redemptive traits. The story is incomprehensible, and the script is rude, sadistic and stupid. Sex scenes are a joke, as is the inevitable car chase. The music is terrible. Acting is limited mainly by a growl and a smirk. Half star dad. Shame DirecTV for putting it on a pay-per-view. In the theater, people could throw soda on the screen.
