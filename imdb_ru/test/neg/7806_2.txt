This film is about the worst I've seen in a very long time. Terence Stamp's talent is completely in vain, and almost the only thing I liked was hearing my favorite song “If I had a million dollars” from BNL, in the first credits. <br /> <br /> Ashton Kutcher plays the main character, a nice guy who gets involved in the house, sitting at his boss. Disasters will follow. Blah blah blah. If you have time to kill and you have nothing to do, then this film is for you. Otherwise, see something else. <br /> <br /> You don’t have any saving moments, but it's nice to see Molly Shannon and Jeffrey Tambor on the screen. They are always a pleasure to watch, although this film has managed to drown out even these bright spots.
