I love to watch good gory giallo. Unfortunately, SOLANGE is definitely not one of them. This is a long time. Very long. The story is tasteless and has little meaning, even if it is very obvious. The script spends so much time killing girls, but almost does not spend time on the killer. That leaves a big hole in the story: we could see a bunch of young women taking a shower together, but we get a zero response to why the killer decided to kill these girls. Yes, what happened to Solange is terrible, but we are still largely ignorant when, why the [boring] murderer decided that it was worth spending the effort to separate these such naughty girls. All this is so invented that I could not figure it out. <br /> <br /> Regarding the appearance of the film, again, boring. Nothing memorable in this. Actors? Boring. Scenario? Funny boring. The whole “hot” romance between the teacher, the blonde and the student was really embarrassing. What planet do they live on? Music? Boring. Skip this.
