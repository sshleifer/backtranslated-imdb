This film is without a doubt one of the worst I've ever seen. It was so boring that I just could not wait for it to end. I persuaded my girlfriend to look at him after this site had good reviews, and even after 30 minutes she looked at me, as if saying “your crazy”. The landscape was as boring as in the film, just to drive in the car, looking at the wind blowing pieces of the bush around. The acting did not inspire, and the film was just a waste of what was a good idea to waste a DVD. <br /> <br /> The guy Pierce was supposed to stick to the neighbors, at least he washed his head. All he did was talk on the phone, but did not sell anything as a seller. He would have been fired a few weeks before. His girlfriend (once in “Ugly Coyote”) had to continue dancing in the bar, at least in that she looked hot. <br /> <br /> The guy who played Vincent (those who looked knows) was so annoyed by his phone calls that any normal person would go to his house and hit him 4 by 2. <br /> <br /> I do not know that someone liked this. I really want people to watch this in order to endure the torture I went through.
