Dr. Chopper begins shortly after the death of teenage mother Nicholas (Robert Adamson), he is still cut up about this, but each cloud has a silver lining, and in this case it seems that his mother owns a log cabin on Tatonka lake, which the self-proclaimed “friendly place” for happy people ", about which she did not tell him. So Nicholas, along with his girlfriend Jessica (Chelsea Crisp) and three friends, Jimmy (Butch Hansen), Reese (Chase Hoyt) and Tamara (Ashley McCarthy) go there for a fun weekend. Unfortunately, things are not going according to plan, the cabin turns out to be a little more than a scattering barn, and their neighbors are Dr. Chopper (Ed Brigadier) and his two nurses, who kill everyone they meet to use in terrible experiments ... < br /> <br /> Moving straight to the video / DVD Dr. Chopper was edited and directed by Lewis Schönbern, and this film seems to have difficulty in IMDb with some pretty pretty sharp reviews, although I think Dr. Chopper as a horror movie is pretty useless i don't think some cr teak, which I have read, fully justified. The script, which takes itself very seriously, is credited to Jan Holt (whether he likes it or not ...), who plays a role in the film as detective Crocker according to the list of IMDb actors, although I can't remember a single character with that name. Maybe was one of the cops at the start? Be that as it may, the main story is fine, I suppose, although it is a bit boring and lasts too long, this is a typical slutty fare with some evil character running around hitting our annoying American teenage cast, you already know what to do. In addition to some brief and undeveloped nonsense that Dr. Chopper uses parts of the body to replenish his own crumbling body, there are not so many stories here, and the script seems to exist only to come up with situations in which girls can lift the upper hand, there are inevitable sex scenes, there is a sequence in which some girls have to complete the dedication to the house of the women's society topless, and there is even a pair of lesbians, one of whom is visible without her full compliment of clothes. Oh, and when I say topless, I mean that they don’t wear any tops, but they all hold their bras, so you can keep in mind that Dr. Chopper has no complete frontal nudity at all. So you really have it, it's a common story that has a slightly surprising turn in the end that is wasted, populated by poor, shaded, blunt characters that exist only to show off some cheap scenes with bloody scenes and girls in bras. Honestly, I expect a little more from my films, but again, maybe I'm just picky. <br /> <br /> Directed by Schoenburn is really good, this is by no means the worst movie I've ever seen, although it still looks cheap. There is no style, I did not think it was scary, and there is no atmosphere. The blood is limited and limited to some corpses and severed limbs, there is nothing new or any particularly convincing special effects. Dr. Chopper is also one of those films where the decisions and motives of the characters are funny. <br /> <br /> Technically, this is a bit rough around the edges, but it’s done quite well on what was probably a really low budget, the forest is adequately isolated, although the police office looks like someone’s front room, and two nursing rooms commands at the beginning look like a stripper. With the acting, everything is in order, it could be better, but I, of course, saw worse. <br /> <br /> Doctor In the chopper there really is a doctor who rides a chopper, but unfortunately this is not enough to satisfy me, despite the fact that it is competent enough, the absence of any real bleeding, nudity or a decent conspiracy is buried without a trace.
