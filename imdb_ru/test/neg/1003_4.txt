This story of how the upper classes get their rebirth and wallow in their high-class suffering is like a modern mid-commercial version of the old Joan Crawford film, in which she suffered from mink. Here people behave terribly civilized in the face of disasters. The good-natured London lawyer (Tom Wilkinson) discovers that his wife has not only an affair with a local nobleman, but also that she killed the husband of their housewife in an accident. He throws up, but otherwise his tight upper lip hardly trembles. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Julian Fellows, who received an Oscar for writing Gosford Park (this is his directorial debut), from Nigel Balchin’s novel, he’s pretty comedic, although I'm not sure which part of the comedy . It's like a return to British films of the forties, when all the characters behaved like characters in books or plays, and not like people in real life. However, not everything is so bad. Wilkinson is awesome, even if you never believe in him as a person, while Emily Watson (adultery) and Rupert Everett (a very immoral high-ranking tott) both hide the cracks in the material very well. Cinematography by Tony Pierce-Roberts ensures that no matter how hard your ear is, it is always good for the eyes.
