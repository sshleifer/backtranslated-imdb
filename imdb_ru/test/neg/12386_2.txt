Well, this horror movie was supposed to be a joke, right? Please tell me that it was supposed to be a joke, then I will understand. <br /> <br /> A large croaking bird with giant claws â€” or, in any case, with one claw) pounces on unsuspecting people on the ground and devours them up. Mara Corday and Jeff Morrow are replaying enough to keep things interesting, but at least you will like a hearty laugh when you see the "monster." It looks like a cross between an insane chicken and Mortimer Snerd. <br /> <br /> Director Fred Sears just hurriedly made this picture and knew that the bird looked completely ridiculous, or he really thought that his film and creature were genuinely frightening. I prefer to think - and I hope - it was the first. <br /> <br /> P.S. Bird need a haircut.
