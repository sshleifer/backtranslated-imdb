Critics fall on themselves within Weinstein's sphere of influence to compliment this ugly, erroneous and repulsive adaptation of the lyric novel on which it is based. The fist directed by Minghella, directed at the blatantly bloody and shrill-episodic odyssey, is one of the many missteps of this “love story of the civil war”. Are they joking? After Ms. Kidman and Mr. Low met up with a pretty, no screen chemistry in a small North Carolina town and stole the kiss before going to war for Jude and his photo souvenir with the girl he left behind , this is a two-hour kidney test as to whether he can survive a myriad of death experiences in order to reunite with his other half. What's the difference? Philip S. Hoffman's amateur scene, chewing on the hideous and unfriendly role, pales before Renée Zellweger appears as a corn food dynamo that miraculously bursts into the scene of a lonely Kidman farm to save the day. Rarely did a performance shout out complacency "look at me, I play." Her pure deafening nerve woke the longevity for a couple of minutes, until the blaster became painfully thin. Released Miramax strategically for Oscar and Golden Globe (what a farce), Weinstein, obviously, along with Dick Clarke own the critical community and won 8 Globus nominations for their bloated failure. As a result, the crime is that the rewards have become meaningless, and small, less powerful PR films become obscure. Cold Mountain is a concept film and a waste of time. Really cold!
