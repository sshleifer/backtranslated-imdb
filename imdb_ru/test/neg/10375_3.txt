I just saw it at the Castro Theater in San Francisco, and I had trouble waking during this incredibly repetitive, non-enlightening little movie. This is a 75-minute film that feels like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly attractive material. This is not bad in any offensive sense; it simply repeats what has been said many, many times and is more interesting and challenging. With only a few exceptions, the interviews are droned and continued, leaving few emotional contacts or contexts throughout the topic. This is more like a “how” guide for something that is already impossible to do. I was alive in an era, but I felt a weak connection or nostalgia for what was presented.
