Here in Australia, Nights in Rodanthe is advertised in the same class as the Notebook. Frankly, a lot of rot. <br /> <br /> This film is like a recipe. On paper, we have all the right ingredients ... Richard Gere is usually perfect in this genre, Diane Lane is an old favorite from Under the Tuscan Sun and Wrong, oceanfront location, solitude, and yet the movie sucks. At the session, we went to yesterday, when the women next to my wife fell asleep, and halfway through the film they got up and left! The main problem is that, first of all, relationships are not created and do not inspire confidence. And perhaps too many long and sad faces if you like the stories that the heroes of Geer and Lane bring to the film. There are watches of these balanced with maybe 5 minutes of what we can see ... romance! There is no heat from Gere's character, Lane looks terrible at the beginning of the movie and everything is blurred. So, as a viewer, we cannot connect with the characters. <br /> <br /> Others here say the book is gorgeous. Well, be it the script, the directing or the production, someone here made a real mess in this film. It’s like a scene and build-up — it’s a deck of cards, except that instead of being in the right order, they were simply thrown around. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ... save your money at the time when he gets into video stores and even then he waits for a bargain when he switches to a weekly rate.
