Kokoda was inspired by events on the Kokoda road during World War II, when the Australian militia slowed down and eventually stopped the push of 10,000 Japanese soldiers to move overland and capture Port Moresby. What they really mean is that the film takes place during this time period, but this is fiction, and everything that happens is just a confusion of standard scenes from other war films. The first hour is just one cliche after another. Some of these scenes are simply created to give us the feeling that this conflict was terrible, beyond all comparison, when it seems that there is little evidence of this. Both sides fought hard to control the track and no mercy was shown to either side. Both sides suffered from a lack of logistics, and the terrain was great in this conflict. When the Japanese approached Port Moresby, their supply line grew, which eventually led to their fall. On the other hand, when the Australians retreated closer to Port Moresby, their supply line shrank. Some scenes seem to be included straight from the standard scene guide in any war movie. The film was erroneous and underlined the youth of the film crew. At a time when Australia could make a great movie about one of the best moments in Australia, Kokoda is a slight disappointment.
