Cinematic interpretation of John Madden's "Ethan Phrome" Edith Wharton does not cope with the work of the great literary work. While the story is maintained, the elements that give the story to her soul are imbued and generally lost in the film. Madden is unable to convey innocence, and the general tragedy of Ethan and Mattie's relationship instead turns this into a story about morality. The score is missed, and the point is lost in added detail and poor dialogue. Zina (Zenobia) in the book is almost completely antagonist, the least sympathetic figure in the books, where in the film she can almost be pitied, although it is strained to feel that you feel bad because of this sick woman who is being changed. The book more accurately describes Zinaâ€™s tyrannical control of the house and Ethan. The film just knocked me out of the rut. Adding a fox was pointless, as was the scene with Mattie trying to commit suicide. It was just poorly interpreted and made. Mistakes in the film: the elusiveness of Ethan on the church dance scene, interaction with Denis Go, the addition of a love scene, a fox scene, a store scene, saying that his plans allowed, the absence of manifestations of internal emotions and thoughts of Ethan, a priest presentation instead of an unnamed engineer what Zina knows about growing relationships, when the reader of the novel never knows what Zina thinks or knows. Just too many flaws and bad directorial decisions.
