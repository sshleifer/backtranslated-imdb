This film had a wonderful premise, and it could be a fascinating look at racism, attitudes towards women at work and relationships with men in England at the beginning of the last century. However, it just turned into a juicy love story. But what was worse was that the love story was absolutely unbelievable. Acting was mostly bad, the direction was confusing, but most of all the script and plot did not exist. The only thing I liked about the film was how dark it was to be in front of the electric light. I really felt how little one candle lights.
