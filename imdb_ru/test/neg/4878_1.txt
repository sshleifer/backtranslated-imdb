After watching this film, I did not want to get my money back. I wanted my time back. I wanted those half an hour ago back in my life - it was the most amazing, disgusting torture, when I learned that I had spent the precious moments of my life on this thing. I have scars for life, and since this “film” came into my life, I have had trouble sleeping. I'm trying to crush the memories, really. but they make me want to burn things. <br /> <br />
