This film may be great, but it is a complete undermining of Bill Forsythe's “Comfort and Joy”. C & J is one of the sweetest movies I've ever seen without becoming diabetes. <br /> <br /> It's okay if you like it, but you understand that EVERYTHING in this film is a direct robbery <br /> Original http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0087072 I can recommend almost everything , whatever forsythe - Local hero, Gregory Girl, This feeling of immersion. I'd better go tonight. The local man has young Peter Capaldi and old Bert Lancaster. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he stopped filming after some really stupid Hollywood appeal. Sad.
