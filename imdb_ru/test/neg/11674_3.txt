I'm terribly sorry! Where Lubitsch-pic was charming, amazing, full of spirit and elegance, here only this one is colorful! Lana looks like 51 (actually she was 31 then, but she is clearly depressed) and tries to play a shy and boring girl. Think of Janette MacDonald, who gave the role of the widow double the depth of "playing" with Count Danilo. The fact that Lana was supposed to play the operetta, although she could not sing, was crazy! She sings only one song - the main role of Lehar-operetta, it is really funny! The only really good thing is the gorgeous waltz scene at the end: glamorous! And - after watching this scene - take a look at the opening waltz scene in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"! Are there any similarities?
