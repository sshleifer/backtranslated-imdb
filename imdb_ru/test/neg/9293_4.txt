An ex-informer from East Germany ends up in Mexico as a student group spy in 1971, where she falls in love with one of the activists. This is Mexico’s first co-production with Germany, and although it’s a good picture of the ideals that mark and continue to celebrate (at least for CGH), the youth, as well as many, end up being something tasteless, as by internal dilemmas it looks dark -Brown (Noethem), as the passion of his ideals, which Adela (Campoman) feels, as soon as they see, in the case of his, I want to suggest, the language barrier; and in the case of her due to lack of experience. The reason that, in the end, there is no specific identification with any of them, leads to the fact that what could be films that even served as a document like “Red Dawn” was another film; although I want to clarify that in the room, many of the assistants were excited about the conversation with the director, who tells me that they are no longer so young or my ideals have not changed.
