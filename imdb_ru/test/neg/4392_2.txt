I have little interest in seeing another horrible film, in which there is nothing new, creative or funny, abusing the tag National Lampoon. Somehow, something caught my eye in the cast of this film. I see my name is Daniel Fishel, I'm a big fan of "The Boy Meets the World"! But the films are terrible. Especially since, as a fan, I am not rewarded by seeing her horrible films with the treasures of a naked chest. This is where my question arises. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen this movie? And if so, does Daniel Fishel strip in this? Save me 2 hours of my life, I will never come back to watch this horrible movie. thank you very much
