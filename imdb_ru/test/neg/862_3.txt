"Tweety's S.O.S" does not open in accordance with this classic cartoon. Instead, we get an example of the TV series Frieze Freleng Tweety and Sylvester in its most general form. Unlike the Road Runner series of Chuck Jones, who was keen to present new jokes in the same setting, the Franlenga series seemed happy enough to process the jokes while the characters were elsewhere. Thus, Tweety's S.O.S is basically tantamount to "this time let's put them on the boat." This is not quite a weak cartoon. There are a few good jokes, mostly involving grandmother's glasses, but they are outweighed by gags, which can be seen after passing a mile (sea-sickness routine), and all this leads to another of those endings when someone other than Tweety says: a putty tat ", a joke that once worked well, but has diminishing returns." Tweety's SOS will probably please kids who like almost any cartoon, but for big kids like me who are looking for more than just tired jokes, this should definitely be avoided.
