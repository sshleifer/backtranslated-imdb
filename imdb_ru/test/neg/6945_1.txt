It was one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. They said that it was the manâ€™s response to "Waiting for Exhalation." All I'm going to say is that we really didn't answer at all. I could not believe that it was really done. The director must choose another profession because he cannot make a film. The script was not good. It did not make sense and was very dirty. Movie bets are much better than they were, and I was terribly disappointed to see the talented actor Terrence in this poor excuse for the film. If I could turn back the clock, I would not go back to Media Play, to never buy a film, I would just keep it wrapped up on a shelf instead of spending time watching it.
