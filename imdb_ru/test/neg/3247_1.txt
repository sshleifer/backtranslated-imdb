Crazy attack on the feelings of the audience. This is a mix of different Hindi and English films - poorly done. The name was transferred from the multi-star roster of the 70s, which also boasts the 2002 version. The story is taken from the film "Surin Dutt / Rina Roy", filmed in the 70s, - "Nagin" and visual effects (terrible attempt) from "The Matrix", "Terminator 2" and "Mission Impossible II". <br /> <br /> Recruitment in a college environment (Sunil Shetty, Akshay Kumar, Manisha - children of the college !!! ??? !!), Manisha Koyral is a victim who mistakenly takes on a deadly attack on her two students as a collective effort on the part of our heroes. It turns out that Manisha, the cobra (Nag) snake, born in this life in a girl, and her partner from a past life, now super-powerful, taking everything and any form (Ichadhari Nag) - Munish Kohli, is looking for her in this life. Maneesh appeals to him for revenge for her violation and murder. <br /> <br /> This is how the insane, murderous fun begins when the lover-avenger begins to beat every man in the group with increasing strength and tricks with successive attempts. The effects are extremely cheap: computer skeletons, transforming bodies and motorcycle stunts complete the farce. <br /> <br /> Carrying from Nagin includes Raj Babbar playing a Catholic priest who gives temporary relief to our boys with a lot of “Religiously correct“ multi-religious medallion ”(the original Nagin had only“ Om ”). Sunny Deol Manisha's love interest in her present life and absolute savior is against the powerful Muni Kohli. <br /> <br /> Music and songs are below average. <br /> <br /> Avoid if you don’t do fashionable cheap thrills.
