Well, I have to admit, when I saw the trailer for this film, I was looking forward to it. As a rule, I am a fan of frivolous romantic comedies and a trailer, that's what I got from this movie. However, I spent most of the movie waiting for the start of the comedy. Although there were some funny scenes, in general, the filmâ€™s prospects were rather dismal. <br /> <br /> I also found it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters, since they all seemed a bit underdeveloped, a time that the director could use to study characters involved in unnecessary excessive use of Opera to make the film feel stretched and slow. <br /> <br /> In general, although there are some touching scenes, the trailer is very deceptive, and I would advise you to go see it, if in fact there is nothing that could tickle your imagination. <br /> <br /> Not fiction, as I said earlier; Blend
