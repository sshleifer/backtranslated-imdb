I understand that this is a small statistical sample (8 votes at the time of publication), but 5.9 out of 10? I give this movie 3, and even that is generous. I tried to watch this film three times (premiere on Saturday night at 9 pm on the channel SciFi, and on Saturday evening at 1 am and on Thursday evening on the air), and all three times I fell asleep before the film ended. Which leaves me with a laundry list of unanswered questions. For example, did Lance Henriksen really seek to get money so that he would continue to play minor roles in these horrible sequels of The Pumpkinhead? Under the contract, is Henriksen forbidden to make films not related to "Pumpkinhead"? Unless the creators of this franchise can achieve greater success than the monster, similar to the geriatric, exhausted "Alien", who walks, as if he had a stick stuck, his a **? When will the film characters in these films understand that pistols and rifles do not harm "Pumpkinhead"? Why don't they try to wedge another stick in place of this thing? And finally, are the writers of this film so creatively difficult that they cannot invent names for two warring families, more original than Hatfield and McCoyes? While you are doing this, why not write a script about a fictional president and call him George Bush? Someday I may have mental stamina to watch this movie to the end, without falling asleep. Until then, if someone has the answers, please let me know.
