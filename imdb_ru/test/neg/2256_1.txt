I'll just start with quotes from other reviewers who describe it best. <br /> <br /> “It’s easily one of the most overpriced films of the year, and perhaps the worst Tarantino film ever produced.” “The only good thing about this film was the performance of Mr. Waltz.” <br /> <br /> “So I was very disappointed, and seeing this film on the spot No. 40 of the greatest films of all time is the only thing about it that leaves me with my mouth open.” Now for more details, go and read the reviews I Hate It. <br /> <br /> One thing I hate in the film is when he sees the audience as a group of stupid people (Spoiler Ahead). Now I know that Tarantino’s style is based on fantasy and fictional plots, but come on, Adolf Hitler and the 200 best Nazi officers will be present at the premiere of the film in occupied France, and you only have two guards in the whole theater and surroundings? There, where American-African steel pipes freely lock the doors and set on fire, then these 2 guards were executed in a matter of seconds, opening the door for our 2 "heroes" to kill Hitler at close range with about 100 rounds ... very stupid. At the very least, challenge our intellect and create a more sensible conspiracy to kill one of the worst tyrants of all time (go see Valkyrie). In addition, the British general’s imitation of Mike Myers is more realistic and reliable than that of the guy playing Hitler, just imagine it. <br /> <br /> What spoiled him even more is that the only clever and strong character who nailed everyone into the film, with his psychological and mind-blowing interrogations, ultimately turns out to be carelessly deceived by the most senseless character in the film. <br /> <br /> After watching the film, I sympathized with the Nazis, who were portrayed for the role of more courage and humanity than our bastards !!! Imagine that. <br /> <br /> My recommendations: if you have insomnia, spend 2 hours 33 minutes or you want to relax, watch this movie.
