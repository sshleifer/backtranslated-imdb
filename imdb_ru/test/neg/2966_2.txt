No matter what you heard, "Glory" is not a very good movie. You shouldn’t spend more than two hours looking at teenagers with stereotypical problems dancing, singing, learning and looking at girls in the changing rooms. <br /> <br /> Each cliche finds a cozy little house in this movie. There a gay teenager is looking for adoption. It would be great if he was treated as something more than a minor plot. There is a child from the ghetto who has too much relationship - what, I was surprised? And guess what? They all want to become big stars, gain fame and fortune, and they will all be ready to crawl over the smoking bodies of their mothers to get it. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, this film is remembered for its music. But in fact, the only moderately good song is "Hot Lunch Jam", which is still too stupid to be really good. The two most popular songs are nothing. “Glory” is a meaningless fluff, drowned out by the sheer spectacle of the mass dance scene on the streets. And “I sing an electric body” (what does Bubba mean in this name?!?!?!?!?) Is just an incomprehensible joke. <br /> <br /> Bad behavior, tasteless dialogue and the hack-direction (this, in the end, from the director of Evita) only slightly helped, respectively, the usual camera work of Mikhail Seresin. But cinema alone cannot carry a film, especially one as boring and meaningless as this one.
