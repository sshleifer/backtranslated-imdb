The year of release speaks for itself. The film is a marauding mess of politically correct left-wing feminist self-esteem, such a cruel, symbolic diversity that seems absurd today. Each scene aims to shed light on one of the pressing problems of society, mainly the role of women in the working community, the role of women compared to men, women as objects of sex, consumption, politics, war, etc. Each scene commented on the internal dialogue of one of the main actresses or the transformation of the scene into a surrealistic joke. I have no memories of the plot, or of who the main characters were. This is a kind of film where consumerism is ridiculed when a couple makes love in a furniture storefront, while a sales agent makes a speech, or when a stage actress’s exemplary interview turns into a full-blown striptease act, for Of course, “offensive press gentlemen” equal noisy club audience. Then we quickly move on, as we need to see how war breaks out in a peaceful forest, we need to see numerous inflammatory feminist public speeches drowning in a (male) car horn explosion or riots, and, of course, we need to watch a movie Newsreel of Stalin and all the other ordinary suspects. You get the idea. But all this does not matter at all. The film is an unsurpassed example for any (male) fan of Ingmar Bergman. The film boasts that Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom, in the midst of their beauty, make this reviewer give up completely and just fuss ?? and also with pleasure I see how they so generously use their acting skills in a film that I had never heard of before. It's hard to believe that especially Bibi Andersson’s face owns the screen every time she appears. The cinematography is superbly organized, often reveling in the overexposed (?) Dimensionless whiteness, and you just never get tired of watching the performers. How absurd that a film shot with such attention to the feminist agenda, tirelessly upholding that women should not be seen as merely the object of desire, can offer nothing better than a 21st century viewer than a parade of stunningly beautiful kids. As mentioned, I am not complaining. I could check it out tomorrow.
