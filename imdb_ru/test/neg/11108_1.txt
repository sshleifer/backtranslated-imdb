This is another original sci-fi film with Rhys Davis, which is hard to decide which is worse, acting or script / direction / producer (John Shepferd directs all three.) the cargo container aboard the cruise ship escapes and the bloodbath begins. Science fiction cliche from a strong captain with a beautiful daughter, a beautiful hero and a mad scientist. The captain is alarming for the ship (since, of course, he will not believe in a monstrous story). There are no dramatic falls of the Navy with sea lions here. The budget allowed only all the forces of the eight seals to arrive on a fiberglass fishing boat and ride the ship-girl aboard. Puleeze. Also discreet computer animation of the ship, you can do better on your computer. I also really liked it when the Commander of the Seal, looking through standard binoculars from a distance of ten miles, was able to see how three people jumped off the ship. If the Sci-Fi channel is going to continue the original films, I hope that they understand that the audience is not at the kindergarten level and they are buying the best scriptwriters and directors. If it were right on the video, you would have found it in a basket of 99 cents.
