Although it starts off promisingly, a woman in a car weaves dark roads in the middle of the night in the middle of the forest until she almost hits a man with a lizard! This gave me the impression that we were going to see something special, something, almost David Lynchian (if there is such a term), but, unfortunately, the film starts to appear everywhere, not having a main center, just a kind of winding woman story trying to solve the riddle of a small town. Learning characters is happening everywhere, and I cannot take care of any characters, especially when part of the story suddenly goes into memory mode. I had some hopes for this film, but overall it was a bit of a disappointment.
