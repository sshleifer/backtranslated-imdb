This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I think you could get this from the title. There is also a special love scene, which may be the strangest in cinema history. I can't even remember why I saw this movie or when. Only this is absolutely terrible experience watching movies. On the other hand, if you are looking for the strangest film to waste two hours of your time, then by all means rent it. Good luck finding it in your local store, though. I doubt this film is widespread. And please do not show this to children in any way, as this can permanently ruin their impressionable minds.
