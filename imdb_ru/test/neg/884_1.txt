Let me tell you straight: <br /> <br /> "Plastic surgeon Hotshot loses a patient on the operating table, removing a cyst from her face, and ends up falling in love with the newly separated bed and breakfast mistress for about 24 hours after meeting her because of her solid advice about bedside manners. "<br /> <br /> Wow. Go to the "Notebook", the city has a new child. <br /> <br /> How to start. Well, what about the depth of this "relationship"? I think that we can safely sum up the basis of this immortal love in the following steps: <br /> <br /> 1. Exchange polite courtesies for a piece of salad. 2. Drink a lot of Jack Daniels; play basketball with old food 3. Provide each other with unplanned tips about your crappy life. 4. Make love in a hurricane. 5. Devote your lives to each other by airmail. <br /> <br /> I noticed that George Culph has in his file "The Hairball" and "United Kanye West Project". Will “stick to your genre” be too harsh? Enough said. I think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry, laugh, or even hope. But the reason they can do this is because somewhere along the storyline we are really starting to take care of the characters we are watching on the screen. To take care of us, you need to spend time on the development of these characters ... their lives, their stories, why we are watching them now. Wolfe didn’t want to “waste our time” on such trifles, but instead gave us all about 8 minutes of background information about each character before pushing us to an intensive one-on-one interaction between the two ACTORS we are. ” we all adore, but the two CHARACTERS we did not care. <br /> <br /> For one short tender moment, Richard Gere exclaims that he does not expect her to listen to his problems, and she invites his supper, the viewer sees a glimpse - the beginning is something special between these two characters. But instead of allowing us to enjoy the anticipation and playfulness of “what happens next” in the amazing, unpredictable joy that lies in courtship, we instead are madly stuck in a love affair between two people whom we hardly know. <br /> <br /> Let's face it. We all heard stupid liners in romantic movies. But the reason we weakened Bogart a bit in “Casablanca” or Nicholson in “Something Should Give,” is because our hearts and minds were lifted to the heavens and dragged through the mud and back with these characters, and time, when they put the line, we are so deeply involved in their plight that we do not even notice the cheese factor. Since Wolfe does not allow us to love or even love our main characters, all we have left is a sandwich with magicians and a few ridiculous people in the audience. <br /> <br /> Wolfe takes the phrase of an old Hollywood director: “The chase” is too literally here. As each performed by one liner is delivered by our actor, the viewer is left wondering if the director Wolfe will tell the audience: Just buy it. ”It was as a result of this tremendous lack of character development or relationship that the climax of the film falls miserably into our hearts. When Gira’s character dies, I felt I was watching the news about someone I didn't know died I. Or watch the women's rowing competitions in the women's eights during the Beijing Olympics. They just didn’t have. Care. Epic. Defeat.
