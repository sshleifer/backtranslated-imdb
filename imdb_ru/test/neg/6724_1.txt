I usually really like Steven Seagal's films. They are usually very interesting and to some extent are experts on aikido, I usually like the way Stephen uses these martial arts techniques in episodes of fighting. <br /> <br /> However, this film is a really bad movie, and it seems to me that the blame lies with the director and producers, who obviously have no idea how to make an action movie, let alone to send someone like Steven Seagal, and take advantage of his knowledge and competence. <br /> <br /> I have never seen the end of this film. I came to the end simply because I could no longer watch this bad movie. I am sure that many people also share my feelings.
