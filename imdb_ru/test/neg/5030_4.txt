As you may not know, Eça de Queiroz is one of Portugal’s most famous writers. He was witty, he did not spare anyone in his critics and now he must ride in his grave. And this is not because this film is bad for what it is, but as a result of the appeal to one of his masterpieces “Crime before Padre Amaro”. He is treated like cheap trash. <br /> <br /> When it became known that this would be a “modern and urban” version of the book, which I feared for the worst, it usually means freedom in these conditions. take p ****, making an adaptation, so that half the ass is the most meager way. Thus, the moral and social dilemma of a priest who has a secret, forbidden affair is replaced by very long passages of people who use drugs and sing hip-hop without any specific or relevant reason for conspiracy. It is just as if it was not. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there's a lot of sex there, so you can at least count on it when you put it on. Remember how every movie of the 80s, regardless of genre or tone, always found a way to get into some naked figure? If it was a thriller and they didn’t need him, they simply found a way that when they captured a criminal, he “accidentally” found himself in bed with a woman who would scream (shout naked) when the police broke in , I think. Not that something is wrong with the nude scenes, but here they make the creators of this film look desperate simply because there is nothing else in the film, it is completely devoid of what you call dramatic content.
