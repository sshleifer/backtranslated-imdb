Take a few dark and stormy nights, fog comes from the shore, obsession and doubts, two brothers who have a mysterious connection based on hatred, suspicious disappearance, a shoe in the night, silently knocking out a glowing cigarette butt, and finally a quivering heroine who finds herself under the threat of both one’s own doubts and one thing — but which one? - men around her. Looks like we can have a good 80 minute noir. Instead, under the direction of Vincent Minnelli and with two A-list leaders, Katherine Hepburn and Robert Taylor, Undercurrent becomes a nearly two-hour morning melodrama, a long piece of threatening longing among ideally groomed, combed and dressed actors. When you look at your watch halfway through the movie and with a sinking heart you see that you have another hour, you and the movie probably have problems. <br /> <br /> Minnelli in one of its earliest non-music films does not rely so strongly on the rococo style greenhouse as was later known. However, what is basically a simple story of greed, murder and obsession, turns into an endless Katherine Hepburn machine. Hepburn shows us in carefully lit close-ups how to demonstrate fear, love, anxiety, dizziness, happiness, doubt, suspicion and horror. Robert Taylor is more or less ready for the trip. <br /> <br /> Hepburn begins to act in the film as the tomboy Anne Hamilton, an energetic young woman in trousers who helps her father with his inventions. Their housekeeper intends to marry her. When Dr. Hamilton decides to sell an important formula to Alan Garroway (Robert Taylor), this is love at first sight. Garroway is a smooth, beautiful, dynamic inventor of the Garroway Distance Controller, who was vital in the war, and who turned him into a powerful manufacturer of millionaires. He is an industry captain, as one of his many friends in Washington says. Ann Hamilton, now Ann Garroway, may be a bit of a tomboy, but her husband shows her how to dress and how to be a successful social hostess for all those congressmen and judges who her husband knows. She learns quickly and eagerly. They are both clearly and blissfully in love. <br /> <br /> But wait. An ulcer is about to gnaw. Ann realizes that she knows nothing about her husband's family. None of his co-workers or friends are inclined to talk about them with her. When she gradually learns that Alan's mother died in the old family house in Middleburg, sitting at the piano, or that he has a brother, Michael, who disappeared, Alan becomes very quiet ... and sometimes becomes enraged. He always apologizes. But wait again. Did his mother really play the piano? Didn't she die in bed? Didn't Michael get caught when he took money from a family business, and Alan sent him away? All this takes place against the backdrop of exquisite hotel rooms, a well-kept country house in Middleburg with a stable and a tasty ranch by the sea. All in the film, except for the staff, dressed in tatters. There are exclusive cocktail parties and intimate dinners for twenty. Even in the black-and-white film, Minnelli cannot fail to give us dining tables filled with crystal and porcelain, tastefully furnished with elegant furniture and many dresses. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, when everything is finally known, when Ann is riding a horse, chasing the bad guy on another horse on a high, extremely well-designed mountain path, when she is threatened with death from a boulder, and her pursuer meets death on a horse, it is a relief. Even Robert Mitchum, who plays Michael, cannot bring much tension to the movies. What could have been in the smaller hands was a tight little B-movie, instead with a list A - just an overloaded melodrama too big for her bones.
