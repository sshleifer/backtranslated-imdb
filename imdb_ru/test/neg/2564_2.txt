Well, some other people have said that this is not a fighter, so I do not need to rephrase it (although I just did). This is not really a disappointment, in fact, nice when an actor tries something else. But, unfortunately, this is not one of those cases. <br /> <br /> Now the story: does not exist. This film lacks a storyline almost the same as Showgirls. Of course, they add a couple of environmentalists, no, even environmentalists, something else, tidbits here and there to please Seagal (that is what he does). It does not make history, even close. Now the end ... Even those of us who really liked this movie ... the end, you have to admit that it was a little, or very stupid. <br /> <br /> Now, from what I understand, it was a movie for a video (at least in the states), but itâ€™s too good for that. This piece of garbage was supposed to be only cable, on TBS or Starz (late at night).
