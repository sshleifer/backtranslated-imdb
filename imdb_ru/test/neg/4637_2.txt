This film has been advertised in Greece for more than three months as the largest production in history in Greece. Well, it can be, but ... When you hear about big production, you expect to see something new, something else. Here you can watch a movie without a reason to exist. George Corrafeis looks like he didn’t really like to appear in this film. His game is so simple that it looks almost like an amateur. The sound, especially when some of the Turkish actors speak English (dubbed?), Is full of hiss. Fortunately, the few special effects that show Istanbul and Athens in the late 50s and early 70s are more like digital pictures than computer graphics. Finally, we see the same boy from 1959 (5 years) until 1968 (14 years), but miraculously he becomes a teenager five years later. <br /> <br /> So much for "the largest Greek production." At the very least, one might think that there would be some interesting scenario to claim such an expensive production. And all you can get is a love story between 7-year-olds who meet again 40 years later. Oh, there is a political side. A couple of ironic remarks about the Greek “junta” of the 67–74s, such as children’s, which seem almost forced. <br /> <br /> In the film, of course, there are a couple of good things: most of the actors are great, mostly Hieroklis Michaelides, very good sets and great music Evantia Rembucik; but they are so few for such an expensive production. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: is it such a bad movie? Honestly, I do not know. I just know that in no case does this justify his huge (by Greek standards) budget.
