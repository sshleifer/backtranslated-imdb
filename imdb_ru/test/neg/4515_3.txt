The only good part of this movie was the final. You know that part of the film where the lights come on and you go home. No, no, it may be a little harsh - the dances in the film were sensational, but unfortunately, the plot ended there. While the actors danced and did not speak, the film went well. As for the debut of Chayann - not so bad, but I hope his next film will have a little more depth. As for watching a movie, wait for a rental or TV. Do not make the same mistake that I made and pay 8.50
