So much bad can be said about this movie and so little that is good! <br /> <br /> There are enough holes on the plot to drown Titanic, the characters are absolutely incredible, the monsters are so unreal, and I'm tired of watching films in which the ex-husband and ex-wife are thrown together in some strange situation happens too often in movies, and it becomes another bad cliche. <br /> <br /> I find it hard to believe that someone would invest $ 1 in the creation of this garbage, not to mention $ 100 or so, it should have been worth it. <br /> <br /> You could make a better movie with more compelling special effects on your home computer! I did not think that movies can get it bad! Avoid this at all costs - do something more exciting and enjoyable, for example, pulling out a tooth or an enema!
