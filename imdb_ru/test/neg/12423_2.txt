Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh dear! <br /> <br /> To think that such films were made and they probably liked the thousands of people at the entrances is really amazing. How innocent we were in those days. <br /> <br /> Speaking directly, this film is nonsense. The hero is so wet that you can hear his soft wet steps in each scene. God, but he is just one of the many horrible, horrible actors that appear in this turkey. No wonder MST3K chose it. The story, such as it is, tells about the driver of production cars (which is so incompetent that you really believe that this is an actor driving a car), that he gives up and “falls into the wrong crowd.” Terrible things. However, the wrong crowd turns out to be the biker equivalent of The Three Stooges and their hand-me round sluts from a biker chick. As an example of how inconvenient this is, the authors obviously puzzled themselves to come up with a frightening name for the biker gang - if the gang can be called four people, that is. Result? Gang called the angels of Satan! I am not kidding. <br /> <br /> Such terrible actions and dialogues, along with ridiculous scenes, are made from a film about beer with chips. But otherwise it’s just the worst kind of garbage. <br /> <br /> As I said. Once it could be considered good. But today it just makes you laugh (and cringe) every minute. Avoid this, except to laugh. And make sure you are more than half drunk too!
