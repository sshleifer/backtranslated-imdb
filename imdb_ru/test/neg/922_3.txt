A great cast, but unfortunately, a bunch of undeveloped ideas make the film drag on. In the end, you feel that you are not satisfied, waiting for some kind of conclusion, closure, or at least an ironic turn. <br /> <br /> He had a familiar sense of "curb", I dare not say that, Larry is annoyed by the polar opposite. The music was there, the scenes of “show about nothing” appeared, but without any common theme or expectation, it was intermittent as a solo project that ran out of budget. <br /> <br /> Spoilers: the name of the film speaks of cheese, but she prefers rice pudding. Is cheese a better-selling name than rice pudding? He prefers any junk food, regardless of the date of sale. Maybe I want someone to eat cheese dogs or ice cream in a pirate costume, at the very least, would link some scenes. <br /> <br /> Marty: it's just not funny and overdone. People just do not care about the "show" inside the show. The coffee table about the coffee books was funnier. <br /> <br /> If you're not a big fan of the cast, save your time and eat some cheese. It should not even be with anyone.
