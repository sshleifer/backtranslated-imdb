As the main "character" Lillit Silver likes to point out - "You know, damn it, everything about vampires." Obviously, this statement was aimed at the cast and film crew, which create an extremely bad image of the beloved bloodsucking undead. According to the misguided director, all vampires are baked in a white base and packed with latex, which looks like a piece of meat in a shrink film. With fangs resembling bannanas and severe asthma, our main character Lilith creates a caricature of farce on the “modern day” of the vampire. <br /> <br /> The plot consists of a collection of 9-year-old boys' game console, recorded on a sheet of paper, then mixed together to come up with this horrible story. Lilith, our pale hero, a vampire bounty hunter, makes a living by luring members of the beloved cult, the Illuminati! Instead of turning on the classic assassin’s methodology of stealth and precision, however, Lillit waltzes through the open window and then kills his necks before shooting at them from the pistol at close range (which obviously doesn’t leave bullet holes due to shoddy continuity). PC Plod is then assigned to solve the killings, he comes to the grizzly, but the startlingly obvious conclusion that Lilith is actually a vampire and continues to track her, armed with the usual tools to send vampires, including the cross, garlic and a pointed piece of wood, Meanwhile Lilith, who got the habit of beating up her boss, gets confused when an old sworn enemy kidnaps him and demands that the ransom be delivered personally. As you can imagine, this is not going according to plan. However, I am not going to experience the pain of the following scenes, so I’ll move on to the end. Lillit and her "sworn enemy" showdown, and after Lilith triumphs, with all the extravagance that someone says he has cancer, it turns out that these two are age-old lovers, and the whole plot was that perverted game. Yes, that blow to the balls was the actual ending of the film. In my opinion, this joke with a conclusion is the icing on a latex-coated cake, and this film is sealed in the vault “Never Watch This.” <br /> <br /> With regard to cinematic techniques, the film simply does not care about creating any style. The director is trying to save his catastrophe from the edge, throwing a few close-ups and several polygonal shots, but this is not the saving grace needed by the film. <br /> <br /> You may be screaming, but this is film B, it must be shit! ". I do not regret, however. I have seen some amazing B-films, such as Evil Dead 2 and Vampire Hunter Jesus Christ, and therefore this disgrace cannot hide behind excuses. The budget was low, it can be seen from the lack of location and good actors. Perhaps, however, if the director were more creative and spent less money to pay for cosmetics and fake blood, he could have done something decent with this disgusting attempt. Brutal sex scenes are in no way beneficial and simply serve to make me laugh at obscene acting skills in everything. Half of the budget was to be paid to the female composition only for the fact that he removed his tops for lesbian pranks. If I wanted to watch vampire porn, I would buy a Muffy Vampire Layer. <br /> <br /> Cast is bad, the story is worse and the effects are cripplingly fake. This film had some potential, but its poor shade and embarrassing depiction of the classic horrible character just served as its fall. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh with a few friends, I recommend that you watch this mockery. If you're looking for a more serious vampire fighter, try Blade or Underworld to calm your rage.
