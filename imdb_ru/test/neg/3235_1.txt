It is still hard for me to believe that the beautiful, though too long, Dean Kunz novel was turned into this extreme excrement. <br /> <br /> This film is so bad that it is disgusting. Boos to all who participated. Shame on you! <br /> <br /> P.S. The fact that the sequels appeared just shows how little taste and restraint is left in Silver Screen Land.
