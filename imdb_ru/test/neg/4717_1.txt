Do you know those movies that are so terribly bad that you have to laugh? Half-breed was not one of them. That sounds good, right? But no, it is not. This is not a bad attempt to watch a horror movie, which is interesting to watch, because it is bad, or has acted badly, or has bad special effects or something else like that. No, half-breed is just boring. They don’t even try to be scary until the last 20 minutes have become so. It's just kids running around the African bushland and getting a lot of elephant dung during the first 75% of the movie, and it's not even funny. The last 20 minutes, however, are hilarious. I have no idea what happened, but it was really funny to watch the CGI leopard tear the throat of all those white guys I couldn’t discern anyway. If you're in the mood for a bad horror movie, don't shoot it, because you will fall asleep before they do funny things. If you accidentally rent this movie, I would recommend fast-forwarding to the end and skipping any scene that occurs in daylight. You do not miss anything. You will not have any idea what character, which one or what happens, even if you look at the whole story.
