Seymour Cassel gives an excellent performance, tour de force. His actions as the allegedly washed up beach stallion of the Duke of Slusarsk will always take place in my heart. The film is about a botanist who just came to the beach in the hope of fulfilling his late brother's dreams. What he gets is lame surfing. The guys are cheating, the guys are fighting, and the guys get drunk, going to watch surfing documentaries with the whole city of Los Angeles on Friday evening. The duke takes the nerd and tries to teach him how to play volleyball - this is how to touch a woman. The next time my woman answers me, I'll pretend to light the ball. <br /> <br /> Return to Seymour Cassel. The end of the film turns into a good drama, because in the first half of the film there was really no point. The Duke is playing a great volleyball game, the best one he has played in ten years. The way to shoot a scene is beautiful. You can feel the heart of this person to the game and the love of being on the beach. These five minutes will be one of my favorites for all time. 3/10 Bad for the fair, the rest of the film was lame.
