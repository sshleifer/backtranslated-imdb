Science fiction of the early 1950s, directed by Leslie Selander. The special effects are, of course, very primitive, but rather good compared to what it was then. Travel film in a double drive; still interesting enough to watch. Two leading men, Arthur Franz, a brilliant young scientist, Dr. Jim Barker, and a simple and solid journalist for the newspaper Steve Abbott (Cameron Mitchell) joined the manned flight to Mars Carol Stafford (Virginia Houston), another scientist and two other space experts (Richard Gaines and John litel). Landing on the Red Planet, space travelers meet residents who look friendly and mentally advanced. In fact, the Martians led by Ikron (Morris Ankrum), who has the idea to conquer the Earth, to revive their civilization. There is a beautiful Martian (Maruerite Chapman), whom Dr. Barker intends to pick up on the return journey. She is the redeemable element of the film.
