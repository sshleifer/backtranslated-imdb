First, this film leaves you in limbo. You do not know what to feel. So much so that you don’t feel bad for Keynes’s character when his son is killed (which was actually due to bad editing). The script was too soft. None of the situations matter when you watch them. The soundtrack or its flaw (if it was not good enough to even remember) will not help. The only pleasant surprise for this film was the performance of Andy Serkis. It was on the same level, if not better than that of Kane. The story might have gone better if Serkis had killed him. Because, frankly, you do not feel any redemption at the climax. Just a feeling of no feeling if you feel me. Basically, this film is massively missing a draw. Leaving the audience alienated throughout the whole thing.
