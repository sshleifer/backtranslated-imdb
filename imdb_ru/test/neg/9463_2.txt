I know that this film is a low-budget horror film intended for those who love shocks and “inexpensive” blood, but even with this, this film is too boring, filled with disjointed plot, terrible music and obvious signs that this film has never been completed . <br /> <br /> Without giving any spoilers, I’ll just say that to the final video, everything will turn out without explanation, neither with the film nor the narration. Anitra's girlfriend is very attractive, but there is still not enough reason to enjoy this film. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of these bloody films of the 60s and 70s, then you should watch them, but keep in mind that he does not even reach the usual plateau of such films.
