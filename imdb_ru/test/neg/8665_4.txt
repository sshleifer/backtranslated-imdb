Is it just me or most of the actors in this adaptation that is wrong with age? <br /> <br /> Gemma Redgrave, although an excellent actress, seems to be joining her children instead of nodding on the couch. (I would really like to see Brenda Blethin in this role, despite her connection with the latest Pride and Prejudice.) All the others looked confused or inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I am not very familiar with Dr. Who (I only saw a few episodes), otherwise it would definitely spoil it. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Mansfield Park has not yet seen it on the screen (neither large nor small). This novel requires the talent of Robert Altman to successfully balance all the complexities of the characters.
