I find it hard to understand what makes the viewer feel that this is a powerful film. I assume that the main purpose of this film will be to study the nature and consequences of racism in the British community. Therefore, it is all the more disappointing that all the characters are two-dimensional and the acting is at the level of the college performing arts course. I am always skeptical about “improvisation”, that is, that I am too lazy to write a decent script. I was embarrassed by the actions and sat in an audience that laughed when they, of course, had to be moved by the story. Racism is a serious problem, but I think that a subtle approach to cinema works much better than putting it on with a trowel.
