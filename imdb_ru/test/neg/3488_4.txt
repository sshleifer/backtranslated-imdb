One thing that I noticed in the British horror films of the 1970s is that they do not stand up for re-viewing. THEATER OF BLOOD is an example, as are all these anthological films Amicus. Add the Beast in the cage to the list <br /> <br /> Most of the drama of this film revolves around the creation of a revelation plot at the end. If you know what a revelation is, it becomes a rather flat film. It opens with a pretty good hook, but after that we get a long boring sequence of two old women who are talking. Correct me if I'm wrong, but how many people are watching a horror movie, expecting a pair of older women to have a little conversation? The only interest that can be found in the Beast in a cage is the anti-smoking position. Some people mentioned that this is an anti-war or anti-war film, but look carefully and you will see that every time a squad lights up from a fly, they kill it. Oddly enough, considering that the attitude to smoking was not so hysterical, as it is now.
