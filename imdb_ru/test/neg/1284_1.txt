I had to watch this movie with my 5 year old. He never laughed once during the whole film ... and he loves dogs and will laugh at almost everything! This film was terrible on all sides: a bad script (even considering a children's film with a G rating), a bad production (nerve shots from the camera made me feel nauseous for the first ten minutes), a bad game (maybe they were “directed” to to behave cartoonly), and even poor sound quality (there are parts where the sound level seems good, then you can't hear what the next actor says). I want to put up with the view of watching a children's film, but it was worse than having a stick in my eyes. I also didn’t like it when they hit me on the head with things about god-heaven. Overall, it was the biggest waste of 90 minutes in my life ... and I wasted a lot of time!
