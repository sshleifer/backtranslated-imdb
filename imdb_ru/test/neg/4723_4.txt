Dr. Krelman wants to save his son Julio, who is dying of heart disease. He decides that a heart transplant with a monkey will heal his son (no - I'm not joking). He makes a transplant, and (somehow) his son turns from a weak guy into a muscular man with a mask in the store, who (sort of) looks like a monkey! Naturally, he goes out, kills men, tears womenâ€™s clothes and wreaks havoc. All this is connected with a boring police novel. Arturo Martinez and the lady-wrestler Lucy Ossorio. We also get meaningless sequences of female wrestling that add nothing to the plot. It all ends up copying the end of "King Kong"! This is (obviously) a pretty stupid movie. The plot does not make much sense, there is gratuitous female nudity (the main product of any exploitation film) and VERY graphic blood that looks ridiculously fake (except for an open heart transplant). However, it has its merits. The entire cast takes everything very seriously and in fact is not as bad as the actors. Also dubbed in the dialogue was (for a film like this) well done and interesting with surprisingly good duplication. I also saw a great DVD listing with a bright bright color (which helps). We are not talking about the classics here, but about a good movie about exploitation.
