I watched this show out of curiosity, wanting to see if they could make the classic epic of Cecil B. DeMille in 1956 with Charlton Heston, Yul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwick with ALL of it with modern technology. Of course they let me down. Yes, they had the right biblical characters, but they didn't give us any of the exciting theatrical scenes that interested you throughout the first movie. If you are going to shoot a mini-series, you should have some "rebellious" scenes: "Burning Bush", Sharing "Red Sea", sinking "Army Faro", "Building the Pyramids of Set", could be done with today's technology in scale blockbusters such as "The Lord of the Rings" or "The Matrix". Obviously, they did not want to leave the LAST impression of “faith and sacrifice,” which is very necessary in these difficult times.
