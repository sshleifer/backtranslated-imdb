I saw this movie because it was a giant man and was tagged as a monster movie. I don't understand why this is called a monster movie. The film is a drama. I expected a lot of destruction, but what did I get? Most of the film was a relationship problem, and people thought the woman was crazy because she saw the wreck of a spaceship with a giant inside for an unknown reason. The action began a few minutes towards the end. Once a woman has been killed, isn't this a murder? Could they not do anything else but to kill her? If you watch it because you expect it to have an effect, because it is marked as a monster movie, do not watch it. This is not a monster movie. This is a drama.
