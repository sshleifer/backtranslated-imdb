This film was one of the worst I've ever seen (including anything from or with Paulie Shore). I could not believe that the film could actually be THIS bad! <br /> <br /> Kulio should be the only worst actor (again, not counting Paulie Shore) who has ever been a “star” in the film. The temptation to press the STOP button during this movie was enormous (in fact, if my VCR had a button “TODOWN TO YOUNG THEIR”, I would be inclined to press it). <br /> <br /> lend and do something more interesting than watch this movie, for example, watch the grass grow, or watch golf on TV.
