The story of farewell to the king is intriguing. The American "deserter" (I got the impression that he and his 3 comrades were only trying to avoid capture in the Philippines, since their desperate escape on a raft in Borneo is not your classic desertion). But as soon as they come ashore when they are discovered by the Japanese. The character Nolte (sergeant) just a few minutes ago was walking down the beach alone and was not noticed. And it is incredible that no one noticed his footprints in the sand, which would lead the Japanese straight to him. But in any case, Nolte is captured by a tribe of bounty hunters and becomes their king after defeating another tribesman. So he is out of war. Then the British commandos appear and want the tribe to help them in their fight against the Japanese. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Nolth's incessant attacks destroy an interesting story. Instead of behaving like a former soldier, who was returned to the war, and now with a tribe of warriors under his command, Nolte behaves as if he had been raised by a tribe. He speaks as if English is almost a foreign language, rarely using abbreviations. He makes broad gestures when he speaks, and behaves as if he is alone with nature, as if he were raised in the jungle. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of action and many interesting scenes with the British interacting with Nolte and the tribe. But the character of Nolte is never believable. It always looks like he overplays. He was supposed to be a little more of an American soldier and much smaller than a member of a tribe. In fact, he is not met as a royal king, but as a madman who has forgotten who he really is. But this is not the purpose of the film, as the script makes him admire and trust the British commando. There is no suggestion that the British think that his behavior was strange. The British consider him just the de facto leader of the tribe. Thus, it always seems that the character Nolte does not fit into what should happen in the film. <br /> <br /> The other actor may have done an excellent job with the role, truthfully fulfilled his roles and made this an outstanding film. But Nolte destroys the film, drowning out each scene and, it seems, not understanding what its character should be. <br /> <br /> What a waste.
