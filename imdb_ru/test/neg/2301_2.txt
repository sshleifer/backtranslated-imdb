This film is the last straw on the list of films I saw this week that pushed me over the edge and forced me to join IMDb and distribute some warnings to the public. It was absolutely terrible. The film was stretched and painfully boring. Sound, effects, and even image quality looked as if they came from Willow (1988) or even from Conan the Barbarian (1982). The battle of Bannockburn was absolutely absurd. This “biggest movie reenactment of a medieval battle ever organized in the British Isles” made me laugh. There was not even a coherent formation, only a few guys with spears and horses running right through them. The scenes of Douglas, especially in the last battle, were just awful, like most of the characters in the film.
