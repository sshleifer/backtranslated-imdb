Why have I ever spent my time watching this movie? it was given to me by a video from a friend, and I thought that I would watch it, it could not be so bad, of course. First, the acting is terrible, and we have to believe that this is real? secondly, this film is clearly trying to copy the project of the Witch Blair (yawn) and does it very badly. so if you want to scare your life, I would suggest that the special Simpson on Halloween will be much worse. but if you just wanted to laugh, then perhaps that would be enough. but in general I would like to avoid this film at any cost or drink a lot of alcohol before watching. best bit? Thank god it's only an hour and a half.
