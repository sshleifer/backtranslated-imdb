Enjoy opening credits. They are the best thing in this second-rate, but harmless time-killer, which shows tolerable performances from such as Eric Roberts and Martin Cove. The main part, however, goes to newcomer Tommy Lee Thomas, who looks a little restrained for this kind of action, but, nevertheless, sometimes he manages to project a kind of belligerence of a rooster. The first time we see him, he is bare-breasted, sweaty, and is engaged in that favorite occupation of "steak" - chopping wood. After that, he has seven more scenes without a shirt, including one in which he is hung on his wrists and filled with electric current a la Mel Gibson in Mortal Guns. However, he could use the best scenario, since the way he reveals the truth about corruption and violence in prison is never convincing. They also speak of millions of dollars, which are obviously related to this investigation, but are never explained. However, there are several advantages. Sending "John Woodrow" under cover as "John Wilson" is a fun game in the presidential name, and colleague Jody (Ross) Nolan promises to be a prisoner who is shown hanged on his wrists and attacked by a strong guard at the beginning of the trial painfully responsible for the lack of "extra features." Despite the impressive size of the prison, it seems to contain only about 12 prisoners! (Note: Actor's credits at the end are not very useful. For the record: a strong bald guard who uses Jody Nolan as a punching bag is played by Bill Fishback, and a young blond guard who controls electrical current for Tommy Lee Thomas is played by Mark Chenale.)
