When my friend and I saw this in the latest releases, we decided to get it, despite the fact that none of us had heard of it before. We both love Kostas Mandilor, and he had James Coburn, so we decided that everything was not so bad. We were wrong. It was. It was really so bad. No actor or actress could have made this film worth seeing. It was like taking Titanic, the Poseidon Adventure and some film about a nuclear bomb and trying to cut and glue it all together. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that there were some chuckles. I laughed when the boy in the cabin asks Alan (Kostas Mandylor) if he is a “marine”. Others laugh, this film received, although it had nothing to do with writing. I would really like to know how the people who made this film thought that the cruise ship could be turned upside down and it would be sustainable. This is not a tip or something like that. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something to look at Costas Mandilor, James Coburn or someone else from this lineup, continue. Find something good that they did.
