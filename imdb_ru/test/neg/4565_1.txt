I thought that I could laugh a little at this long movie, but I was sadly disappointed. This film is about losers who spend most of their time trying to get a passing score, not even trying to open a book or do something. The film also depicts the teacher and director Mary Tyler Moore (Mrs. Stark) “Labor Pains” of 2000 as complete idiots. I know it was supposed to be a comedy, but it never made me laugh, and I thought that the whole movie was a LOST TIME! Nevertheless, all the actors gave excellent performances, and they faced a difficult task - to make this film an exciting and entertaining film! Just learning and getting good college grades is the only way to enroll!
