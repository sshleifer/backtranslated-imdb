With some films it’s really hard to say for whom they were made. Huevos de oro seems to be striving for a well-educated Spanish middle class. In this film there should be a lot of jokes that you will not understand if you are an outsider. This can be quite annoying. <br /> <br /> An abundance of symbols and references to art and popular culture. The film mentions the work of Salvador Dali, Luis Buñuel and the surrealists in general. It seems that a certain interest in bidets is pointing to Duchamp's finished things. Moreover, the main character also has a knack for karaoke recordings with songs by Julio Iglesias. But why all this is mixed up pretty nicely, but also gratis, just eludes me. I can only guess that all this serves to emphasize the vital, impetuous, boorish vulgarity of the main character, whom the director seems to admire and despise at the same time. The way all really beautiful women run after him (I mean the main character) is a bit confusing. <br /> <br /> The film consists of three parts. It begins in the Spanish enclave of Melilla in Africa, where the main character Benito does military service, apparently in the engineering corps. He then goes to the resort town of Benidorm in Spanin, where Benito just wants to build the tallest skyscraper in this place and become vulgarized by Howard Roark. In the latter part, the defeated Benito moves to Miami, Florida, presumably in order to start a new life. ” But the change of places cannot really be explained satisfactorily. It is also somehow annoying that there is no character development and that the film goes down to the soap opera series, without being convincingly ironic. I must say that Javier Bardem copes very well with the role of a young stallion, who becomes weak and deflated. <br /> <br /> I bought this film because I'm interested in Cityscapes. And Benidorm is a special place, urban. In this aspect, Huevos de oro only partially satisfied me. In the film Jess Franco “She killed in ecstasy” (1970), this particular place was used in a more useful way.
