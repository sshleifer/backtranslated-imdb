It surprises me that someone Pauly Shore seems interesting: it is, in fact, one joke that becomes * real * fast *. He has his little "Californian" dictionary for idiots and a basic set of lame jokes. Mostly, he's just nasty. <br /> <br /> However, I watched this film because I was sick, and there was literally nothing but commercials, otherwise I would have turned it off after 30 minutes. In any case, the film could be fine, if Polly could just turn off her game and just play it as a comic actor, not Polly. <br /> <br /> In any case, I am sure that Pauliâ€™s fans will still like it - but if you are not a Pauli fan, stay away from this manure. <br /> <br /> I had to leave this comment after seeing that another user actually gave this movie 10/10! (Maybe it was Poly !!) I personally gave him 3/10, because they didn't have any pictures in the frame, didn't drop the camera, and the supporting cast was pretty good.
