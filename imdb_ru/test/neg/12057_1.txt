How to put together all possible clichés and stereotypes that exist in the horror genre, and then combine them into one lousy movie? Answer: "Blood Camp." This is a silly amateur nonsense, made on the microbudget and too obvious, inspired by "Friday the 13th." Four of the most unbearable teenage characters you've ever seen? are they like a combination of ugly, stupid and annoying ?? go hiking and quickly be pursued by a killer maniac in a clown costume. Do not even ask me what were the motives of the murderer or even who he / she was, because if it was shown in the film, I completely missed it. This is one of the worst films ever made, without any inspiration or skill. Production values ​​were so deplorable that there are actors playing several roles without even bothering to make them unrecognizable. The only semi-decent and dignified consistency throughout the Blood Camp is the debut, in which the impressively voluptuous Meredith O'Brien has sex in the woods with her defiant scout. Yes, I fully realize that this is an absolutely superficial remark, but again, this is a juvenile and backward film, so who cares?
