This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, don't watch it, even if your life depends on it. <br /> <br /> This film about Laurel and Hardy, when they inherit the island, was wrecked and be hanged Incredibly boring movie in which there is nothing funny. <br /> <br /> This was the last movie Laurel and Hardy, and it is a very modest note to end such a great career. The films of the 40s were not very good, this film was shot in 1950. If you want to remember Laurel and Hardy, remember them in the prime of the 1930s. Short films are better than full-length films, my favorite film is "Me and My Buddy." Another reason this film is terrible is because it is dubbed. The actor opens his mouth there and the words come out in three days. Absolute nonsense, but let's end on a high note, Laurel and Hardy were, in my opinion, the best double act ever.
