What the hell is there no part II? If this film really ends as it is, everyone who is associated with this film should be ashamed. This film is nothing like the movie "Flash", which in fact was quite decent. This film was hurried in hopes of getting a few light dollars. I started watching the movie, suggesting that it would be bad, but I never thought it would be so bad. This film was nothing more than a way to use the fears of the American people for profit! If you have not seen this movie, do not worry. The film is full of poorly developed characters and poor acting. I really hope that the production of this film was only a couple of weeks. Stay away! Do not be deceived by deception!
