this movie has no plot, no good acting, to be honest, there is nothing in it, the same songs play a terrible acting game again and again, and if you can really sit there and watch it all and enjoy it, then with you something is wrong. I would like to give it 0 out of 10, but I can't, so it should be 1, which is generous! ice-t is not even a good rapper and even worse in acting, every piece of film is rubbish, I got this film on DVD, not knowing that it was priced at 1.99 pounds, and thought that I took a deal. Then I I looked at the IMDb rating and did not take it into account, but after watching it I found out that the DVD I bought was a waste of time, money and electricity. If you have this film, there are two things you can do, sell it to someone who does not know about it or burn it!
