I bought this “movie” at a gas station in a 3.99 bunker for one reason: Billy Drago, one of my favorite actors. He is terribly creepy and good, but that’s it. The film itself is a very cheap, terribly awful Western horror attempt, and it cannot cope with anything, not to mention the successful merging of two genres. Besides Drago, the acting is so bad that I wanted to put cushions on my ears, there are no production values ​​and the script, I don’t even know where to start. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs if you are as much a Drago fan as I am. <br /> <br /> Terrible, shameful, unforgivable.
