I am a big fan of horror, especially Spanish horror. This film had so many opportunities to be good. This is a marvelous idea, a ghostly nun, as well as much of what Jaume Balangero came to mind. Both visual and sound effects were pretty good too. But everything was shamefully spoiled by bad leadership, terrible casting and terribly bad (exposure, exposure!) Scenario. Very bad. Maybe Balanguero should write and send himself a remake ... <br /> <br /> Moreover, I don’t really understand why actors who can’t really speak English should speak in English (and when they do, they do it so badly that it makes their performances even more fake). If you look at modern Spanish horror films like El Orfanato or Rec, the performances fully fit this type of stylish ghost story - and it’s realistic to be believable, like someone like us, like real people, because it’s only like horror reaches its goal. Unfortunately, all failed at La Monja.
