I, being one of them, probably meant the brain to fart during the lease. Anyone who actually buys it will be happy to use it as a stand. Perhaps a frisbee? This is a DVD that I found really where kids can get to it. Since the DVD does not seem to be placed in the back room, where they tell all the tales with all the big boxes and cassettes, I find it rather annoying that they are stuck next to a Disney movie. Yes, the transition from Dinosaur to Erotic Ghost showed that we all think of Disney, right? I haven't sunk so low yet. There are no actions here. The only thing interesting is the old trailers of 1973 for the ancient erotic films of Allde, which, I am amazed, avoided being burned in hell. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (if imdb allowed zero, it would be 0/10)
