Well, if you give up the fact that there is a terrible game in this movie; and, if you set aside the fact that the story is confused and deviates in about five different directions, never deciding which direction it really wants to go; and, if you leave aside the fact that I have not found a single scene in this film that would be remotely interesting; Well, if you put it all aside, it's still a REALLY awful movie! <br /> <br /> As I understand it, this should be a love story about a rich guy / poor girl. I never understood how this romance between Kelly (Chris Klein) and Samantha (Lily Sobieski) ever began. The inexplicable novel is exacerbated by the complete lack of chemistry between Klein and Sobieski. The script (Michael Seitzman) is boring to stupidity. The way Seitzman managed to write this without falling asleep is a miracle; that he thinks someone wants to pay to see it is incredible. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that this is REALLY, REALLY a terrible movie? <br /> <br /> I would give him a ZERO, but IMDb does not provide for the votes ZERO. So I give it one, holding my nose.
