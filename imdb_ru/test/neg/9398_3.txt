Diane Lane is beautiful and sexy, and Tuscany is gorgeous, but this film is no better than mediocre, and it is generous. The storyline is grafted to travel and remains completely uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Being in (say) a suburb of Newark, the plot will be considered ridiculous. All that saves the film is the Tuscan countryside and random scenes taking place in Florence and Positano, and the film “While the sun drowns slowly in the west” would better serve to show that it is certainly one of beautiful places in the world.
