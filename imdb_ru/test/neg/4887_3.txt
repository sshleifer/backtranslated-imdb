I bought this one for a couple of dollars at a local video store, as they cleaned their tapes in favor of the DVD. I doubt that they will somehow replace this one. <br /> <br /> I can't say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's very boring. No real cannibalistic scenes. Me Me Lai is not sufficiently exposed (only about 4 or 5 times). And she is not the Thai goddess I was expecting. Therefore, my two reasons for watching this movie were knocked out. <br /> <br /> There is cruel animal abuse for those who love such things. The great battle between the mongoose and the big snake is getting pretty bloody. The torture of animals, some of which are real and some are fake. Fortunately, the fake is somewhat amusing, but the reality is a bit disgusting. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a film of the 70s - too long, not sufficiently developed, not as deep as we would like, But this is something else, right? ONE AND HALF STARS!
