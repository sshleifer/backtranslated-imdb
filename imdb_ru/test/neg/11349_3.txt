Any of Law and Order, CSI (choose a city) and Murder: the weakest episodes of "Life on the street" surpass the strongest episode of "Bones" <br /> <br /> David Boreanaz was stuck in the Angel's trashy mode, and Emily Deschanel portrays Bones too ... unreal. The actors in general have horrible scenes, be it forced action or simply horrible scenes. <br /> <br /> Killings become predictable after some time, because foreshadows and clues are too obvious. <Br /> <br /> With music, everything is in order, although sometimes not necessary. <br /> <br /> In general, Bones should hardly be recommended to watch on weekdays, as this is an exact copy of the best shows. with unreal characters and forever boring stories. <br /> <br /> Skip this if you can.
