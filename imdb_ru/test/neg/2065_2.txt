I was extra in this film, but would like me not to be, because it is rubbish. The worst thing about this movie is music, but acting, screenwriting, editing, directing, and history are also terrible. the main reason for its bad is that the budget is so low, and the only way to make a good film with a low budget is to have a good script. the script that was supposed to be broken before the movie was made was not funny, I never laughed. what made me laugh is how the producers probably think that the most important thing was a made film, who cares if its complete nonsense film needed a budget of about a million pounds and was better written. the only reason I didn't give the film one out of ten was because I felt sorry for the guy who would lose a few hundred thousand, if you go and see him, just make sure you're drunk at the time. ha ha
