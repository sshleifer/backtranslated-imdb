It seems that almost everything Stephen King ever wrote turned into a film or a series; Actually, I'm surprised no one tried to make a mini-series from this guy's grocery list. Let's face it, if they did, it could not be as interesting as the Children of Corn. <br /> <br /> Based on one of King’s many short stories, this 1984 horror film sees Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton playing a couple in a long car journey that faces a problem when it falls into the sleepy town of Gatlin in Nebraska where all the adults were killed by children who worship ancient evil hiding in the corn fields. <br /> <br /> Although director Fritz Kiersch at the very beginning manages to create quite a bit of atmosphere (after Hamilton’s stupid song and dance, but before we meet with the quaint Isaac, the leader of the murderer children), he completely screwed endless uninteresting scenes in which Hamilton and Horton prey on the murderous half-pints of the city. Courtney Gaines, like the cruel redhead Malachi, manages to seem really threatening, but the other children are not at all threatening; As a result, many of the “scary” moments of the movie do not work. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, when we finally see the evil force that inhabits the field around Gatlin, the film plunges into an abundance of terrible visual effects of the 80s, which probably looked rather strange for almost 25 years. back, but look ridiculous these days. <br /> <br /> “Children of Corn” might be of interest to King fans looking to see how the work of the writer was transferred to the big screen, but your usual horror movie fan will be most impressed
