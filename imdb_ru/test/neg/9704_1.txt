Perhaps, if you have never read any English literature or have ever watched a Hollywood version of any book, you could find meaning in this horrible movie. He has the skills of directing and scripting Shoreditch. The 1995 BBC adaptation is very pleasant, and is close to the book, and very well reflects the atmosphere between Elizabeth and Darcy. <br /> <br /> The characters of this performance are greatly mistaken, Sutherland, because Bennet seems like a complete jester. Bingley also acts like a fool, and it may not be doubtful that he can be my friend Darcy. I can't imagine how Judi Dench could have taken a role, maybe she thought it was a surreal comedy version. <br /> <br /> Quotes from the book are thrown out of context. Huge chunks are missing, an important episode with Wickham is clouded. <br /> <br /> However, Mr. Collins is very good, and towers over the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is that we did not pay to see it. Wait for the DVD and use to keep the table loose.
