... And, damn it, it was softly <br /> <br /> I saw it on the Bravo cable channel one Saturday evening, and here in Britain, we often show these horrible "Erotic" soft-core films coming out late in the evening on Bravo. It follows the plot of a strange college couple geek story creating a virtual reality headset that makes you have sexual fantasies. <br /> <br /> When you watched one of these films, you saw them all along with a bunch of toys, similar to the fact that they advertised silicone implants. C'mon, I really saw breasts in real life (I'm sure some of the other of us, too), and they hover around, unlike where they defy the laws, if not physics, then at least gravity. Sex scenes are these tedious things, when a well-built eccentric rubs his colleague without any dialogue or sound, apart from some kind of muzak, and when they reach a climax, it seems that they both have a strong attack of constipation. The girls themselves are very cute, especially Brandy Davis and Nikki Fritz, but they are wasted on such films with a soft core. <br /> <br /> And if itâ€™s fantastic, after I recommend the Lord of the Rings trilogy
