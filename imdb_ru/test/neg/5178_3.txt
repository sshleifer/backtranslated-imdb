This movie could be great. This is not in my opinion. The storyline is fragmented; the editor doesn’t seem to be able to choose between Guy Ritchie’s narrative style and the simpler one. Much attention is paid to excessive violence, including torture. Too much if you ask me. The characters are very small and stereotypical, I would like to see more depth. It is difficult to identify with the main character. As a result, the film remains superficial overall. <br /> <br /> The film says that it gives the viewer an inner look at the British criminal lower class, in particular the lower class of Essex. Football hooligans, steroids, cocaine, heroine and violence, lots and lots of violence. Violence as a result of paranoia and fear in general. In this film, it seems no one uses his (or her) brain, we look at a group of animals in clothes. As I said, the plot is not so much, and storytelling leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> If you are a man under the age of 30, you like bloodshed and brutal violence, and you think it’s interesting, then this film is for you. If you are looking for a film that depicts real people with a well-developed storyline, intensity and depth, well ... you can skip this.
