Greetings; <br /> <br /> I never thought that I would see the day when the film will be so disgusting to me that it will be a burden to finish ... I have always been a fan of horror films, B 'C and C are included. But in this case it is difficult to describe how the film may not correspond to any letters on such a scale ... <br /> <br /> The filmâ€™s focus is on a poorly developed history, a mixture of folklore and after. taste. And to top it off, the performances of the actors are questionable. Horror films B are usually divided into two categories ... 1) A gem that is underestimated and underfunded 2) So bad, it's funny, laugh or return your money. Well, this film is between. I was not scared, did not laugh ... So, I think, if you really need to see it, you could, but I recommend you not ...
