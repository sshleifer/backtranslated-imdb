1 hour and 40 minutes of talk - boring talk, more talk, and then a little more. I find it hard to understand how an actress like Ann Paris, who shone superbly in the film Femme Fatale, would subscribe to such crap! Incredible. If you need a cap, this film can help, although I would prefer cool music. unfortunately, I just found out that I need to write 10 lines for my comment to appear - it's almost unbelievable! therefore, short and short comments in one or two sentences expressing the main idea of ​​the film are not enough. God, people. I expressed my point of view and do not waste my time on unnecessary words - as in this film. Wolfgang
