Do you know the mouthwash commercial, where the guy has a mouth full of Listerine or something else, and he tries hard not to spit it in the sink? This is a great metaphor for this movie. I kept looking, although it was really difficult. But storing mouthwash will leave you feeling fresh. This film left me with an unpleasant taste in my mouth. I had to spit it out when I had a chance. <br /> <br /> The premise is banal enough to be fun. For the first time in a thousand years, the Gargoyles returned to Romania, and all the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are dead. It depends on Michael Pare and some other secret agents to find out everything before the gargoyles go their separate ways. Unfortunately, the premise is completely lost in a bad dialogue and less than enthusiastic action on the part of people leads. The best cast is Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film reminds Van Helsing for a poor man. If you check your brain at the door, it can help you survive Mondayâ€™s dreary night. I gave him 3 out of 10 stars.
