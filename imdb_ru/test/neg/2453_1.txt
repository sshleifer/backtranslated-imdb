I watched about an hour of this film (against my will) and could not finish it. I would rate it as 0. The letter was bad, the plot was predictable, and it was done too many times. The most annoying part of this film was the melody Thomas Scott acting game. This part did not require anyone to show snobbery, but in every scene I saw, it looked like a (sour) snob or someone who was about to publish something extremely sarcastic or cruel. <br /> <br /> The two novels, which seemed to grow into something serious almost at a meeting of couples, were too complicated. <br /> <br /> I should know better than watch movies made for TV. If there is absolutely nothing on the telly, and this is the only choice, read the book.
