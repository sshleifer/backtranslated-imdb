Sorry, maybe this is part of a wave of praise for the fireman from 911, maybe this is an old-fashioned story, maybe it’s not meant to knock your socks off, but sorry, this movie is terrible. As in the title, cliche 49, I think it has at least so many cliches. This is a dreary story (impressive ability to be dreary when there are dangerous fires and lives saved) about firefighters. And his dreary life, told in a meaningless “scene from the present,” recalls the past. We start the film with a hero in danger in a collapsing burning building. The whole movie is about how we are trying to make us love this guy, so we squeeze a few tears when he meets his end in the final scene from the very beginning of the movie. It was difficult for me to take care, and I wanted him to go to smoke earlier. Cliches in abundance, such as - death of the best friend, love in the first place, hazing in the new job, firstborn, anxious wife with her husband with dangerous work, boss / boss figure of the father, 2.4 children (well 2, but close enough) , sacrificing your life to save others, rewards for courage ... and so on. This is the life of every fireman, every policeman, nurse, doctor in some way. It was lazy, if it meant “life sparkling before his eyes,” when he died, then God help the poor guy, I’m surprised that he didn’t absorb more smoke to go faster. The memories are mostly mundane and predictable, boring and with sound, which can bring the "Laughing Cow" out of business, it was so stupid that in fact it sounded like a muzak or no copyright elevator !!! To avoid at all costs if you do not need to watch something with your grandmother on Sunday evening. Or, maybe, if you are connected to a fireman - a warning - your life will end terribly, or you will be traumatized for life, if you are a brave fireman in this film. Unless your John Travolta (weird velcro hair in it !!)
