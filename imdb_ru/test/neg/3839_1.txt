The blind could make this movie better ... seriously! The director is clearly a newcomer. He has to be a coke dealer for Dennis Hopper or something to convince him to be in this film. I was so ashamed of Dennis. <br /> <br /> John, the director ... PLEASE withdraw from the direction. Your contribution is not needed and not needed. The film Wednesday is stronger without you. You are terrible in control. Stick to packaged foods or something like that. <br /> <br /> This film was supposed to get around "right in the video" and go "in the trash." I'm dumber for watching this movie. DON'T SEE THIS FILM IF YOU RESPECT YOURSELF AND RESPECT THE FILM ART FORM!
