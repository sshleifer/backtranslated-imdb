When the film “Underdog” debuted in 1964, I was immediately hooked at the age of 7. He was Top Dog (pun intended) in my book (that is, before the premiere of Batman on ABC a year or so later). Even when it was clear that Disney was going to make a live version of Saturday morning’s popular cartoon, it was equally clear to me that it would be crap. Even reading the reviews in the newspapers seemed to confirm this. Nevertheless, I decided: a) never try to write a review if I have not seen the film from beginning to end; and b) never spend a single red cent on a movie that I’m pretty sure I will hate. <br /> <br /> Thanks to YouTube, I: a) am fully prepared to write this review; and b) it cost me only 84 minutes of my hard-earned time. <br /> <br /> This also confirms my point, namely, that this film is not just a piece of shit. This is a steaming pile of dog droppings. This is similar to the series only by name, although they understood almost everything correctly with Simon and Cad. <br /> <br /> In general, Underdog is a huge waste of time and money, which fortunately I did not. will have to spend. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * of *****
