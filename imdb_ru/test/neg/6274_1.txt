This film is so bad that they have to burn the master. You can't mess up the plot, because this movie doesn't have it. The graphics are smaller than fake, they are terrible. Then you have a vagabond of a starry village watcher working alone, who jumps up and down between his madness and the insane ranting of a mad preacher. And when he finally gets to Washington, they donâ€™t even have the decency to kill him; the monster (which you do not know at that time) is already dying, but how ... who knows, and, of course, he has the final juicy end ... everyone else on the planet is dead or dying, except for his family and a few backward ones survive. Submit it! It will be a movie in which C Thomas Howell will go to his grave, regretting that he ever starred. He may have nightmares.
