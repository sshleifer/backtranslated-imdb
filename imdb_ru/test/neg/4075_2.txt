I gave this film 2 mainly because he has a really good cast, but the film itself is just like that (insert an unusually rude word starting with the sixth letter of the alphabet) - it’s meaningless that I felt bad when I voted for him to have the lowest rating - three. <br /> <br /> A very predictable plot .... two musicians who have little to do, no money and a lot of money problems. However, when a friend leaves a bag of money (which belongs to drug dealers) under supervision, he, of course, spends it, and then the “fun” begins. <br /> <br /> Not an original idea in the whole movie.
