Cheap, nice bad cheese of the 80s, cheese of the decade. I watched this first uncut and un-MST3K video, and it was pretty funny, funny, even without comments. <br /> <br /> The plot (as it is) revolves around the post-apocalyptic world in which AI robots rebelled (sounds familiar?) and destroyed almost everything, leaving the world in ruins with air so bad that no one can breathe it. Those few people who remained, act as slaves of a mysterious creature called the Dark One, who seems to be partially computerized, and partly organic. Air slaves are working to produce energy for this in exchange for breathable air. From time to time Dark forces the strongest of the air slaves to fight to the death, so that no one will be the leader in rebellion against the Dark. <br /> <br /> Okay, so-called serious things. Wacky things like funny quasi-futuristic clothes that everyone carries with them, including “fur” clothes for car seats, lumbar fabrics, shiny things, and feather boas (mostly wearing Dark, improperly recognizable and almost incomprehensible accent). Or wooden acting and stilted lines, permeated with all the so-called "actors", whose dialogue is high on premonition and low on feeling. Or in the store a dime, including pink socks with teeth stuck on them for “deadly” sewer snakes, a bomb made from a string of a string of a piano and a tin can, and terrible “mutants” in rubber masks of Halloween. <br /> A group of air slaves follows their leader, a mysterious wanderer, who has adapted to the air outside, to go to an energy plant to destroy the Dark One. The guy's name is Neo, which explains where Wachowski's brothers got the idea of ​​the Matrix. Along the way, they meet up with a group of Amazons, with a mandatory battle scene in which the woman triumphs (of course). Has anyone else ever noticed that in every Amazon film or tv. ever created show, these so-called amazing warriors always beat their legs with men or women? I guess the Amazons are just pansies. <br /> <br /> This group of determined warriors sneaks through Central Park ... err ... devastated lands outside of the last city (a good way to save money on dull paintings of destroyed New York, anyway) and a journey down the drain leading to the power station where the Dark One hangs out and his experienced girl Valery. Here they defeat such ferocious beasts as puppet socks, a giant spider that no one sees, and a blunt robot lobster, which is one of the personal security guards of the Dark One. <br /> <br /> The final battle is pretty sad. One of the slaves, a girl whose father was taken by the Dark One because he created a way for people to breathe dirty air, sees that her father was “consumed by the true form of the Dark One”, which means he was eaten by giant avocados until only his head is sticking out. The three remaining adventurers destroy the Dark One by turning off several switches, and the robot holocaust dies not with a bang, but with a whimper. Two people exchange some surprisingly wooden last lines, and that is all. The end.
