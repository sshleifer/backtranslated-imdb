I did not like this film for many reasons, which I can not even say then. I mean, who would believe that they had captured the Chupacabra, and she escaped on a cruise ship. LAMA !!! It was normal for a slop video, but not worth the money spent on it. I can not believe that someone actually gave this film ten. But I think there are people who like this movie. I gave this film 2 instead of 1 just because it was a chupacabra, and there was no guy in it, the lord of the rings. If you want to watch this movie, I would stay at home and wait for it to be shown on a science fiction channel. Do not waste your money on watching this movie. Believe me.
