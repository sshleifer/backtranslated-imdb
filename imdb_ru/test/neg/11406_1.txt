“The Demon of the Wind” is as much fun as breaking legs. This is definitely a terrible film example. So terrible that I don't even consider it a movie. I describe it more as a thing ... a monstrous thing. Things that need to be stopped at all costs. My friends and I first discovered this ... thing buried under a large box of videotapes in my friend's house. It was a late evening, and we had nothing better, so we decided to watch some raw horror films (we, unfortunately, chose this one). Well, for 90 minutes that this game played, we laughed so hard that we almost broke free, The point is literally meaningless in every sense of the word. It's just a cheap, poorly-made Evil Dead robbery. This whole “story” seems to be nothing more than some guy who wants to confuse his friends, inviting them into an abandoned house and allowing the demons to tear them apart. I bet that the writers really wrote the story while it was being filmed. I've already seen bad horror films (Manos, Troll 2, HOBGOBLINS !!!) (shudders). I would have to say that Demon Wind can definitely fight with any of these films on the terms of sheer stupidity. Watch it only if you like to laugh at silly movies. <br /> <br /> Interesting fact: this film looks like a cockroach on steroids! Like the ouija board, every time we try to get rid of it, it seems that it mysteriously appears again. Something scary, huh?
