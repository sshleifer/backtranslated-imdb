4 Oscar winners, Carl Malden, Sally Field, Shirley Jones, Michael Caine. The great characters of the cast are Telli Savalas and Peter Boyle. 1 hour 54 minutes of sheer fatigue, melodrama and terrible acting skills, confusion of the script and immersion in the feelings of a GOOD LORD, WHAT DID WE THINK? <br /> <br /> Irving Allen was just trying to cash in on the Popularity of the original classic disaster film with the D class script minus the script, the actors were obviously in it just for the paycheck ... horror, horror! <br /> <br /> How crazy are the heroes that Cain, Savalas, Malden and Field play? Go to a potentially deadly sinking ship that is 1. burning 2. Hot from steam 3. Slippery from water and oil, 4. Boilers that explode every 5 minutes, etc., all for love? Greed? 5. They have very little equipment, they donâ€™t even see a pair of gloves or work boots, especially hooks, ropes, etc. <br /> <br /> Nonsense! <br /> <br /> What was they thinking? <br /> <br /> Peter Boyle replays so much that I just wanted to hit him! Stop this! And what a bad wig? In addition, it is impossible to believe that his character was a veteran of World War II. <br /> <br /> Kane, Field and Malden find all this gold and money, and they are happy! We are rich! (We may not live to spend it, but hey ...) <br /> <br /> And yes, this is a great actor Slim Pickens! <br /> <br /> Survivors abound! Jack Warden and Shirley Knight too! <br /> <br /> The last dramatic plot that the terrible plutonium has not gone anywhere, as if they had forgotten, sort of? There are a lot of holes in the script. <br /> <br /> This movie has a disease that the strongest pill cannot cure. I'm surprised that the name of Alan J. Smithy was not in the script, I would be embarrassed that I wrote it! <br /> <br /> Oh, madness, oh humanity! Oy Vey! <br /> <br /> Horror, horror! <br /> <br /> This is like a bad two-hour TV movie. <br /> <br /> At least the sets were made from recycled material from the first film. <br /> <br /> The script should be on the compost pile ...
