1st viewing 25.02.2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-George P. Cosmatos): a predictable action movie in which any frequent cinematographer can guess what will happen next. Charlie Sheen is a good old presidential president who is not loved by the rest of the presidential administration. Of course, he finds himself in a situation where he is being substituted again and again, and he has one friend in the White House, played by Sutherland, who, naturally, does not remain so long. His other friend is the reporter, played by Linda Hamilton (who has little to do or say in this meaningless role), and, of course, his biggest and best friend is the president himself (Sam Waterston), who remains his friend to the end, despite everyone else killed around him. Brainless, but action-ridden, meaningless trif, despite the many and many acting talents (all largely wasted.)
