I would say that this is a background movie. Play in the background when you are prone to busy work (washing, checking email, etc.). I thought it was a movie that was made before Amy Adams became successful after Enchanted. Wrong! It was made in 2009! The script / script is pretty awful. I love musicals, but singing is just mean and doesnâ€™t move the plot. Ughh. Looks like a movie for cinema based on cinema. Do I watch TV shows? <br /> <br /> Even the secretary starts singing. What the @ @ $ is happening ?! In fact, she seemed to have a better voice. Amy Adams was so good at Enchanted. The lead actor is average. Disappointed for sure. This film would be good for life, but that's all. :(
