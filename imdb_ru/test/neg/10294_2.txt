I have to say that when I saw this movie on 6.5 on this site, I thought it was worth seeing. I was very disappointed. Almost from the first scene, it is obvious that the two alleged FBI agents are, in fact, killers. Could they make it more obvious? If this is a deliberate "turn" in this film, it is pretty sad. While Pullman and Ormond are great actors, even their talent is not suitable for the reprehensible bad script. Pullman skillfully plays the role of a sociopathic killer ... and that's the problem. There is no switch with "I play the FBI!" on "I just killed 12 people and a boy, my hands are tired." You can't blame the actors ... the story fails in more ways than one. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning of the film, however, I was sure that I was wrong that no director / screenwriter would ever be so obvious about the plot of "turn". I thought that Ormond and Pullman were behaving strangely to distract the viewer's attention from the real killers, which gave the filmmakers too much credit. I had to follow my instincts and turn off the film before it reached the 15-minute mark. <br /> <br /> To honor Lynch, she managed to put in a lot of things that make a good movie: sex, violence, humor, and well-trained actors. It is a pity that they were in the wrong configuration. I hope Pell James will be able to recover from this role ... I think her performance is particularly impressive, because a terrific addict turned into a potential savior. She should rewrite the role so that the godmother would win. <br /> <br /> Those people who compared this film with “Natural Born Killers” noticed: Tarantino made the heroes Mickey and Mallory reprehensible, but sympathetic. Observation only wants it to be “Natural Born Killers” ... in fact, he has dark dreams of being at least part of what was in this film. People who have not seen Observation ... adhere to something with a little more intelligence. Like Camp Rock.
