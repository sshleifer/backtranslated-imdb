I tried my best to get this film, and I was lucky to get it on VHS. Being a big fan of Gloria Graham, it was a great addition to my collection. Other than that, I really can't say much to recommend this picture. The plot is predictable (and weak), and the only interesting aspect of the film is to watch Sterling Hayden get into deeper problems with his own department. Miss Graham is always fun to watch (if you like her, like me), but duplicating her singing will hurt this picture a lot. She works in immersion, so let her use her own voice. It can only give into the atmosphere. I have to agree with an earlier reviewer; the finale borrows heavily from BIG HEAT. On the verge of distraction from the final. I have seen the worst films with Ms. Graham (MACAO), but I will never miss the opportunity to see her on the screen. If you have a movie night and you are looking for a second feature film, this is your movie. Enjoy the picture.
