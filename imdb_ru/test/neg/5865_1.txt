We sat in this film, thinking why this or that scene in the film, what does this have to do with the plot? We hoped that by the end everything would become a little clearer. It should not have been. <br /> <br /> I think that the director, in a fit of frustration, threw the script into the air, and then some insignificant (and vindictive) subordinate again accidentally assembled it, not paying attention to the scene being filmed glue). <br /> <br /> Motives of the film: â€œCommunism is bad? Is nihilism bad? Bad parenting is bad? Three bad? Is the TV bad? Well-coordinated scripting is bad? Is deconstruction good? It really is not clear. <br /> <br /> Finally, no German water taxi would ever have a free chain that would allow passengers to fall into the water. The abundant amount of "ahtung" signs everywhere testifies to this.
