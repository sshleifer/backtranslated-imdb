Barney is that idiotic dinosaur who (unfortunately) did not die out with other dinosaurs many centuries ago. Instead, he sings stupid songs and has stupid morality about life that is 100% useless and / or extremely dangerous: “FOREIGNERS ARE YOUR FRIENDS WHICH YOU DON'T MEET!”. The reason why I say he is angry? Well, on YouTube there is a video of Barney's song about toy balls. When it is played backwards, it sounds like this: “WE WILL ALL GET YOU! LET'S CLEAN! ”. You do not trust me? See for yourself! I also read in another review that they now read PC folklore and fairy tales. Now this is just stupid with a capital S! I mean really! In any case, I do not recommend to my children to watch this dirt, because it contains stupid morality, as strangers are your friends (as mentioned earlier), there is no reason for sadness, and if you are sad to eat unhealthy food, then be a man Taboo , magic can solve all your problems and a bunch of other ridiculous crap.
