This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Truffaut should take everything seriously; This is not just some kind of B-movie launched by crackers. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that Truffaut could not decide whether he was making a noir or a sentimental film about a chick. and Deneuve also could not, whose dozens (?) of symbolic slippers are simply incredible - they did not even act badly; just did not act at all. Among other things, how beautiful a woman, like Deneuve, can be a man like Julie / Marion, simply does not give in to anyone to stop her disbelief; the role absolutely requires someone not very beautiful. Acting Belmondo also suffers, although, in his opinion, his character is not as incredible as that of Deneuve. The end of the clich√© (which I will not describe), unfortunately, is too suitable for this complete error.
