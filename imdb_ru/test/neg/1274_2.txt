I will give it this way: he tried. It really tried to do it well and even involved Luke Wilson. Luke Wilson is good, but he can only do so much. He can not make up for the fact that the story was very spoiled, and the characters were underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> The running “gag” with the bully was stupid. He was never funny, and I quickly got tired of the gag. And the barefoot baby was also weak. Did he hitchhike to florida? Come on. <br /> <br /> With this underlined mantra, sometimes the film seemed like an ordinary children's film: adult silly, intelligent children. And it is a bit tiring. <br /> <br /> But the only funny moments were the police carts that Wilson went to when he lost his police car. I loved this little dolly, especially when Wilson turned on the siren. But apart from that, nothing else was worth my time. "D-"
