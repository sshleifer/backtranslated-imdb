I would like to find something good that can be said about this brisk sequel (but not really) of Atlantis: A Lost Empire, but this would be a very short comment. The magic that the first had was nowhere to be found here. the animation is pretty bad, the characters themselves are not well drawn. backgrounds and foregrounds are also not very good. there is very little attention to detail. and instead of a convincing and engaging story, we have 3 short stories that are boring and have little meaning. I swear, even the characters sounded as if they were bored, and would rather be somewhere else. This suggests that the actors sound boring and want to be elsewhere, at least this is an impression. Some of the same actors return for this grim effort, but Michael J. Fox, as the main character, Milo Thatch, was an integral part of the success of the first. I got the clear impression that this film was simply combined to benefit from the success of the first, without which I do not think and do not worry. but at least Cree Summer returns as the voice of "Kida." This is probably the only good thing in this film, and even she does not seem to have her heart completely in it. You could not blame any of the actors for not giving them everything, considering what they had to work with. Or rather, don't work with that. This is a live video (and I use the term loosely), which was to go straight to the closest training ground, whatever, shame on Disney. Consumers deserve much more than this. This one gets 0/10, and deserved this one.
