The couple moves into their dream home, unaware that he and his neighbors were built on land previously used as a graveyard. They say that the film is based on real events, although it is not known how much of this should be true. The plot is hardly unique - see Spielberg's “Poltergeist” (1982). For a short time, they experience various supernatural phenomena: from disturbing - mysterious shadows, severe disease of their daughter - to frankly ridiculous - toilets, which are constantly washed away, and the garage doors go out of control. There is little depth in this story: as soon as it turns out that the earth was used as a graveyard, we will not know anything anymore. The plot does not seem to develop. Characters are not particularly well drawn or are remembered in any way, and the atmosphere is not particularly special. The film may disturb some viewers. There is no feeling of catharsis or any positive message from him.
