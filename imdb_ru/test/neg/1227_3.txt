I am rarely motivated to write a review unless I am inspired by the quality of the film. In the case of Comanche Moon, I was not so inspired that I felt the need to warn others how bad this series was. Here are a few thoughts. <br /> <br /> Indians: they came across, like on a Saturday night, live, making fun of what the Indians say. When McMurtry writes dialogues in his novels, it sounds so interesting; I'm not sure how they ended up getting. <br /> <br /> Gus McCray: Looks like a fest from the old Gunsmoke series. The actress is all right, and the manners from McCray by Robert Duvall are correct, but the look is pure comedy cowboy. <br /> <br /> Clara: Maybe next time you could use some dirt or sweat. Have you ever been to Austin in the summer before air conditioning? I promise you, women did not look like that. Do you think they have never seen Dearwood episodes? <br /> <br /> Gov. Elisha Pease: Again, when they are in the governor’s office, it’s like a live parody of a Saturday night, and the parody explodes. <br /> <br /> Woodrow Call: Call is the most reasonable character, of course, He speaks so little how can you screw it up? But hey, what about this hat? <br /> <br /> Blue duck: see above and note that it is not even scary. They had to force Javier Bardem to play this role. <br /> <br /> The Rangers: Right from "Oh, brother, where are you," I expected George Clooney to come up to them and they would burst into song. <br /> I may be premature because the mini-series is not yet completed, but I doubt that I will watch it anymore. <br /> <br /> I would not expect anyone to duplicate the thrilling feeling of a lonely pigeon, but I look at it and it seems that they don’t feel the old west at all.
