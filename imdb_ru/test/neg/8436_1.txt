One of the greatest lessons I’ve ever received in how to watch a movie came about like this: <br /> <br /> I worked at Roger Corman’s office, like many other tramps before and after, I interned and tried to figure out how it all works and how to make yourself irreplaceable (ha!). One afternoon, Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and producer herself, asked me to load a tape. I'm not sure why she wanted to see this. I got the impression that it was a student film or a commercial, something like that, some kind of business card. Whatever the reasons for which she had to see it, the only free video machine in the offices at that time was in the room in which I worked, and I was the closest person to the car. I launched the tape. <br /> <br /> Appearance: on the screen a figure was sitting at a table facing the camera. Behind him, on the left, was a door opening into the room. There was a coat rack by the far wall. The second character entered through the door and spoke. The first character, the guy at the table, turned around to answer, (it's all one double, a static camera, there are no cuts or panoramas. Only one camera is locked). The second character turned to hang his coat on a hanger, and said his next line. Julie Corman said: "I saw enough." and left the room. <br /> <br /> In the ten seconds of shooting that she saw, she saw that the director was an idiot. An opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs to the camera, delivering the lines? Sorry, but no. Following! That's how long you have. Ten seconds Lift him up during the first shot, and you are dead. <br /> <br /> I was reminded of this moment when I watched the opening of this piece of shit. After an endlessly long journey through the jungle, we see several monkeys rushing into their cages. The man with the gun laughs. The jetliner lands, and we see it by taxi to the terminal itself. God, it's boring! Cut from inside the airport. Two men meet. Aha Something is happening! They shake hands. Cut at a different angle two men - <br /> <br /> - and the director crosses the line. <br /> <br /> The first two frames of the film, which have any spatial connection with each other and the guy soared. “Do not cross the line” is one of those basic rules of movie grammar that does not allow characters to jump from side to side across the screen and mislead the viewer. The audience does not like being confused. Mystified? Upset? Puzzled and intrigued? Yes. The audience loves it all. Embarrassed? No, you lose them. They go out. "Do not cross the line" - this is one of those things that they drive into you at the film school or should. These are basic things. This is not an inviolable rule (there are no inviolable rules), directors constantly violate it, but not during the first film. <br /> <br /> I thought: "I have seen enough." And turned off.
