This is just the worst, most offensive part of crap on television. I would like to completely ignore this, but Fox put it in their Sunday lineup, forcing me to find something else to look between the American dad and the family guy. A star-headed guy is almost the least developed, pathetic excuse for a man I've ever seen on TV. Nothing on the show is remotely funny and almost everything on it has already been done and is much better than other shows. <br /> <br /> Obviously, their strategy to ram it deeply and hard on a Sunday schedule and hopes someone likes it ... but I have to break it for you, Fox, this is not that hole. The scam didn't work for me — I'm just looking somewhere else — but come on, you, damn it, this show, damn it, and it sucks even worse than the rest of Fox Fox Sunday. <br /> <br /> THEY CANCELED THE ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PAIRED DOLL?
