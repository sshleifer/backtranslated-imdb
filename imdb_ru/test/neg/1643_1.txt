Yes, this film is clearly trying to become Conan the barbarian, and what surprises me is that this is a sequel (did people demand another?). The first part of the film is a memory showing the original. From what I saw, it is not worth checking (and, obviously, Ator always kills a huge puppet in his films). Well, now Ator lives on the edges of the earth with his dumb buddy Tong. The girl is looking for his help, as this evil dude keeps his father in custody. Let me just say that this bad guy is extremely patient, as the old guy constantly insults the Gadyusha and just talks endlessly. The bad guy waits until the very end of the film and finally slaps the old guy around, leaving you to ask the question: “What made him miss him so long?”. Meanwhile, Ator, his girlfriend and the girl are going through one adventure after another. They fight with cave people, invisible soldiers (do not ask), rent bandits and people who worship snakes. Ator also fights with a giant snake doll and hang gliders (again, do not ask). All this time, you'll think that Conan kicked Ator in the ass.
