Some ugly eccentric who had three families who cheated and neglected all of them, built ugly useless buildings that are now underestimated and crumbling. His bastard half-Jewish son runs around, interviews random Jewish senile people we donâ€™t care about, and shows his horrible story and writing skills as long as tragic piano music plays. It lasts almost two boring hours and means nothing. <br /> <br /> All of you, little hippies who watch these stupid documentaries, eat salads and yogurt, think that all this nonsense is so important. Is not. Save the whales. Nobody cares.
