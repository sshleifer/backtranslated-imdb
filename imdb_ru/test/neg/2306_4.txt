Although there was nothing special about this film, I have to comment on at least one factor that made a decision in his favor - the role of the lead performer in the film, Dayan Cannon. Despite the ridiculous storyline of the film and what it experiences here, her best acting work in the film, which makes the unbelievable more believable. Her hoarse scene with gay photographer David Hemmings needs to be seen to be believed. Good job, Dayan.
