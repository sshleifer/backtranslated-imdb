If you thought that 10.5 NBC were stupid, you will be glad to hear that FX has penetrated the depths of hell-made television and squeezed fingers in this pseudo-stern after 9/11. Not only was the plot stupid, it was a total robbery 24 and a bad robbery in that. The filming style was now overly “documented”, complemented by fragments of black and white raw videos. I'm not quite sure what that means, but it sounds like what the DP told the director before filming. I don’t know why they were walking here, but it reminded me of a guy in the office who considers Powerpoint presentations with “raids” and “animations” to be “cool.” <br /> <br /> The story is that 6 “terrorists” seized a nuclear power plant in the southern part of Central Asia. That's right, nuclear power plants, where hundreds of people work, where there are safety measures in yin-yang. For the sake of reality, they put 2 chips CHIPpies in their spare time. Because they can stop 6 people, right? Six. I mean, even Bruce Willis had to deal with a lot of terrorists in this idiot Nakatomi building. <br /> <br /> Leslie Hope (TV host Teri Bauer) plays an officer of the RPP, who has trouble talking on the phone after she was shot dead in her bulletproof vest. Her voice sounds like a Sally Struter television ad, whining and monotonous. Her character is just a plot device, and after she performs her small duty, she quickly gets rid of. Yes, Teri Bower died! <br /> <br /> Bruce Greenwood plays the role of the FBI S.AS. Tom Shea, who constantly points out how he strikes foreign diplomats in the face. His boss is absent, so no one in the internal security department believes his prediction of the situation. He is sensible from a group of paranoid government officials who are afraid to take the blame for any disaster. He is calm, he is strong, he is boring. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing in Meltdown that could redeem or entertain - well, maybe Teri Bauer's death was rather unnecessary and funny - except for this, she didn’t buy anything.
