No, it's just a cheap 1940s series with the good name Cap. If you are a fan of comics, you will be greatly disappointed. They radically changed the character. There is no shield, there is no Baki, there is no fight against the Nazis, there are no wings on the side of the mask and most importantly: Captain America is now the district attorney, not the soldier. <br /> <br /> Dick Purcell as Captain America? Do not look too closely when he changes clothes. It is quite obvious that he was not in better physical shape when he did this show (can you say, flabby?). It is also VERY obvious that the stuntman performs most of the action here. Almost every chapter has an obligatory fist fight, which shoots and performs the same way. The villain is rather soft, and although he uses a pseudonym (Scarab), he does not wear any disguise. The story repeats and is very simple. The effects are ridiculous, but the effect is average. On the other hand, we have sexy Lorna Gray as an assistant to DA, and a good captain in one early chapter rides a cool motorcycle. Overall good, but nothing special.
