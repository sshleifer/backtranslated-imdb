It must be the worst thriller I've seen in a long time. The direction, action and adaptation of the story leave what might have been a good plot, in a waste of time. Within a few minutes of watching the film, it was easy to understand the plot, and very early on, more obvious clues appeared that would not leave any mystery. I guessed it for the first few minutes, and I continued to hope that I was wrong, and to my horror I was not. <br /> <br /> The film begins with two FBI agents traveling to a distant city to investigate the murderous fun that left three witnesses, a young girl, a drug addict and a police officer. They are interviewed under surveillance cameras separately, and each tells their own account of the day. Everyone has something to hide about themselves, and the day unfolds when they tell their bills. This part is probably saving grace, and if it were developed, it could have made this film better. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The whole story ends with the fact that the FBI agents are real killers, and the young girl is the only one who understood this and left them intact. <br /> <br /> Why do they go through the whole way of interviewing three witnesses and get close to a young girl if their idea was to kill them first? How did they manage to pretend to be FBI agents (when you find out that real FBI agents were killed and badges were found on them)? How did they learn how to install and use surveillance cameras? <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond are so inconclusive from beginning to end. Perhaps the idea is to develop your characters for a revelation at the end. Come on, they both look ridiculous, stupid and not ominous at all. The character of the young girl also lost potential. There is no point in her actions and there is no point in who she prefers to contact in her ordeal. She does not look upset, but rather detached, which, again, is not explained. <br /> <br /> A horrible movie in general.
