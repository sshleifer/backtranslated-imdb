I had to watch Changi last year in the 10th year of Australian history. Looking around the classroom, both classes, all 40 students were almost asleep, all 40 heads on the table were whispering to the person next to them. I refuse to believe that since I am only 16 years old, that my opinion does not count, having studied the Second World War, I not only felt embarrassed and shame when I watched this Australian piece of garbage TV. I was crazy about the terrible efforts that this mini-series applied to the use of the elements of the film. The game was bad, the script was very inaccurate, and the score was terrible. Please do not watch this film, it is bias and very racism (for the Japanese).
