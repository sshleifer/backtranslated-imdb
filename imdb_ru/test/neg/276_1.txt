The man I loved in Ocean 11. <br /> <br /> A smart movie. All eleven characters were crucial for the robbery, as each had their own special skill, which was necessary to get out of the grand finale. <br /> <br /> What on Earth was 12 Oceans? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I guess it was supposed to be Zeta-Jones, but she was not part 11 because she was trying to confuse them and work against them the whole movie ?? It was more like a story about the boring relationship of the characters Brad and Zeta-Jones with some parts of the original film, added just to get a few asses on the seats to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> With O-11, the gang was always one step ahead of Benedict (Garcia). They could always outwit him. What happened here? He is catching up with them after the warning, and suddenly they are all clever? The whole movie is such that they can raise the money they stole, plus interest, to return Benedict for the robbery they put on him 3 years ago. So in the next movie, they’ll have the courage and brains back and return him for making him pay for the first heist? Pooh-Lease ... <br /> <br /> This film could only be made with Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and Matt Damon 5 minutes for the switching scene. <br /> <br /> A slow film, not the energy of the first. I tried my best, and it’s usually very easy to please me, but I’m really disappointed. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! Twist - the whole movie didn’t have to be done, since the real theft was made earlier than everything you just saw in the last 2 hours. <br /> <br /> END SPOILER. <br /> <br /> Wait until it appears on TV or if you are a fan of the original 2001, please do not watch it.
