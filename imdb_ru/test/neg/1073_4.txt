I could not relate to this film. I am surprised that people praise him for being so “realistic”. How many people in your school are victims of incest? How many closet homosexual athletes? How many quiet people you never noticed committed suicide? Hmmm Well, you would not know, even if they were. But in reality these are explosive problems that many of us never face. And yet there are many adolescents with subtle problems that could be investigated. But where is the "entertainment"? <br /> <br /> With regard to the girl who committed suicide - I discovered that it was exploitation. I really think that MANY people in high school at some point feel invisible, ignored and undesirable. But what makes someone commit a violent suicide on another day, when he is ignored and not noticed? The director decided that this girl would commit suicide to make the film more provocative. And the graphic nature of suicide makes it even more provocative. I did not buy it as a real life script. <br /> <br /> And the problems of other students with whom I was not fully connected. Bullying has been studied, but it was done to death, we all know that it continues, and this is really a matter of determination in this person. Wardrobe homosexuality? Pff, another cliche. That's it, too much cliché. I guessed the ending at the beginning. There was a predictable unpredictability, if that makes sense. You have all these characters with explosive problems, and one obviously doesn’t. And I thought, what is the meaning of this character, if she is an unsuspecting suicide victim? And, of course, enough .. <br /> <br /> One thing I will say, and this is the saving grace of the film, is that it does NOT embellish suicide. Suicide is very visual and heartbreaking. It is a powerful scene (no matter how contrived it is) and a scenario that rejects suicide as an easy option. But the film is not really very creative and uses stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Not bad, but certainly not innovative OR not worthy of a 17-minute applause in Cannes ???
