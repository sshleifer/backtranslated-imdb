"Soul Plane" is a terrible attempt at a comedy that should appeal to people with thick skulls, bloodshot eyes and fluffy pawns. <br /> <br /> The plot is not only inconsistent, but unimportant, the acting is basically not the same level as the gang of crazy and horrible characters added for bad measure, jokes are often seen miles ahead and almost never a little funny. There is no structure in this film, and it is full of racial stereotypes that must have seemed old even in the fifties, the only thing he does for this is some lovely ladies, but in fact, if you want you to rent something from the “Adult” section. Good? <br /> <br /> I don’t see anything to recommend here because you’ll probably have a lot better and more productive time chasing rats with a sledgehammer or inventing waterproof sachets or something This. <br /> <br /> 2/10
