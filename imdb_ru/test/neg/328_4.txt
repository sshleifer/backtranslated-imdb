I bought Jack-O a few months ago at a Blockbuster video sale, and at the time I didn’t expect anything outstanding from him. Looking at it, I realized that I had received not only less than I could count on, but also much more. It seems strange, I know. And this. But this is completely appropriate, given that this is a mysterious film "Jack-O". <br /> <br /> The film tells about a boy named Sean Kelly. Somehow, thanks to hereditary connections, he is marked by death at the hands of a madman who owns a scythe, Pumpkin man. This pumpkin man was killed by Sean's great-grandfather, uncle, cousin, and so on. And now that the villain has been resurrected, Sean's death is obviously crucial to his infernal revenge mission. In any case, there is a big “horror” when Jack-O is sneaking through various neighbors before fighting with Sean to the finish. <br /> <br /> I’m not so much here to discuss the conspiracy as to determine who can find some value in this film. I can honestly tell you that Jack O is one of the worst films ever made. The action is imperturbable (except when it should be), the scenario seems to be a project of a class 1 group, and the production budget should not exceed $ 150. Some of the funniest scenes of death occur in this anti-thriller, and they are all the more humorous when you realize that director Steve Latshaw does seem serious in his film. <br /> <br /> And yet I enjoyed the film with all my heart. I can call it a horrible horror movie, yes. But I can also say that I had a great time watching this with my friends, and watched it several times from that fatal first viewing. Many people (including some of my friends) will find this film intolerable and overly laborious, and this is understandable. If you are like me and enjoy ridiculously bad horror films that take you seriously, you will find the Jack-O instant classic, which is also understandable. <br /> <br /> That is why it is so difficult to evaluate this film. If I evaluated the quality of Jack-O as a film, I would not give anything. In fact, the studio owes me a star. However, if I evaluated it on the basis of pure pleasure, I would give it 8 or 9. I would give it 4, so as to be somewhere in the middle. I recommend everyone to go out, rent it and form their own conclusion.
