First of all, I'm a big fan of Bronson, from the late 70s. I watched every movie he made on the big screen, starting with Love and Bullets, which, ironically, was the beginning of his death in the role of a celebrity, a Hollywood blockbuster star. <br /> <br /> I kept hoping that everything would change for him, that he would make a really good film in the 80s, but this did not happen. And I don’t know what he was thinking about when he signed with cheapjack Cannon and director Hack Lee Thompson for most of his latest films. <br /> <br /> “Murder” instilled hope in me when I saw this Peter Hunt was the director instead of Thompson, but these hopes were quickly realized. First, the film looks incredibly cheap, as if it was made in about 3 million, minus Bronson's inflated salary (I heard that he insisted on 5 miles per picture, which is probably more than the rest of the budget for all his Cannon movies). The scenes of the White House were filmed on VA territory in West Los Angeles — I got on the bus when they were shooting. Good job at recreating the white house, but no one thought about pulling the palms out of the shots? Do not guess. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the cast is really bad. Ireland was dying of cancer, and despite that, she’s not bad, but the terrible Asian playing Bronson's sidekick was typical of Cannon’s talent at the time, which was not there. I would be very curious to know how she got this role. I can not imagine the worst actress, plus she is 40 years younger than Bronson! The story is not so bad, and this is what later made the studio with a large budget and a large budget (Eastwood's film "In the Line of Fire" and Costner's film "The Bodyguard"), but how this happens is really sad. I wonder if they could afford to do more than one or two takes per shot. None of this is believed in the least. If the Secret Service officers really behaved like the cornerstones in this film, we would have presidents leaving the office (and out of life) every few months ...
