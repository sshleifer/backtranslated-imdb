First, when does this plot happen? This should happen after the first movie, because Cuzco knows that Pasha and Cheecha have her third child, but this cannot happen after the second movie, because Kronk has no girlfriend, wife or anything else? You will never see her on the show. <br /> <br /> Also, why does Cusco go to school? The whole plot of the show is such that Cusco goes to school to become emperor. But wasn't he the emperor before that? And who is the emperor when he learns to be an emperor? Isn't that Ism? Or has Ism already been fired at this time? And if this is true, then why is he waiting for him not to become empress? In addition, you know that in the first film he said that from the very birth he was taught to be emperor. So he must know what he is doing. <br /> <br /> Kronk. Why is Kronk a student? He is about 25, they said that in the first film. He is an adult going to high school. Everyone thinks he is an idiot? I really like Kronk, but I think that because of his age and because everyone knows that he works for Izm, he had to be a teacher. Being a teacher of Home Ec would be in his lane. <br /> <br /> Malina, this is very unpleasant. It must be the love interest of the Kuzko / moral compass. But a lot of time she breaks away from the owner and knows it all. She usually says that I like "I should be proud because I am beautiful and smart." <br /> <br /> She has an ESP when it comes to Cuzco, and she knows when he has trouble, when he cheats, or even when he sings the Hot Hot Hottie song in his head, although she welcomes the lead , a school newspaper and keeps A + in all its classes. <br /> <br /> It seems more interesting for her to use her attractiveness to make Cusco do the right thing and study well at school and then meet with him. In fact, she seems more maternal for Kuzko than love interest. <br /> <br /> Ism. When I was stingy before Isma tried to make Cusco fail, she became an empress. Not sure how this should work with dismissal and all that. Ishma seems to be experiencing the first film in each episode. In almost every show in which she appears, she turns Cusco into an animal in the hope that he will fail a lesson. (I can remember that this did not happen, only 3 times). Jokes that Isma is old, not as clever in the series as in the movie. And the classic Izm jokes get used to death on the show (for example, “Pull up the level, Krunk!”, The roller coaster and the lab). <br /> <br /> Also some other points that do not make sense in this series. The fact that whenever Cuzco is assigned something, everyone acts like this task, he forces him to pass or fail a lesson, but he seems to pass every task given to him. So why is one appointment so important? <br /> <br /> Seriously, who rules the kingdom while it happens? Do they have a consul or a steward? You will never see anyone rule the kingdom unless Cuzco weakened his authority or Ismme became the empress. <br /> <br /> Why does Cusco go to an ordinary peasant school? Shouldn't he know how to run the country, what to do in the event of war or something that will be useful to him in the future? I could see that I am taking the usual farming classes (for example, he knows how to prepare the country for famine or something like that), but tie the bonds? How is this useful? <br /> <br /> Now I know that someone will say: "But it does not make sense, it must be funny." Then they should have more fun things there. All the funny things about the show have already been made in the film. Also, if they notice some of these huge holes in the plot, why don't they make fun of them like in the movie? (For example, when Ishma and Kronk get to the secret lab before Cusco and Pacha, and Ism and Kronk can't explain how they got their first.) <br /> <br /> There are some good moments, it's nice to see some characters from the first movie in the series, like Bucky and the monkey with a mistake. Pacha and his family are still very good characters with a good sense of land. I feel that this series will be fun for young children. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the series is not as good as the film on which it is based, but it can be useful for young children.
