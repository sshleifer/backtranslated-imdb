The best thing about the film is the title, as it describes the plot and the action. At the very least, they cannot say that they did not warn you ... It seems like a button that says "Do not press it." <br /> <br /> Seagal must have run out of things that move like planes, trains and ships, but the plot remains the same. Under the guise of a guy who fights slowly, but still beats like 40 mercenaries, and does not even blink. What surprises me is that Sigal is now as big as a barn, and the bad guys still can't hit him in the hallway with a machine gun and 50 rounds of ammunition. Where do all these bullets actually go? The only feature of this film is to watch Nia Peeples knocking on Jaul Rüla’s face (Jeffrey Atkins’s real name isn’t quite that punk) on the floor. I could spend days watching a woman kicking herself like that ... especially in such a dress! It was just a bonus when Jeffy got hit in the legs, and cheerfully, hoping that one of these blows really landed. Sorry, it's just a time when we get stupid and cool, a cool guy can't play rappers from movies. PLEEEEEASE! Who ever came up with the idea? I would say that it was this man who decided that Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore would consider themselves witty sports angels. <br /> <br /> The only unexpected twist in this film is that they don’t do a politically correct thing and let Jeffy come in and save the day. No doubt, if Snoop (known by his nickname as his mother Calvin Broadus, who doesn't sound so cool again when you call him Cal) was in the film, he would have thrown some signs at her and probably saved the life of Seagal or something.
