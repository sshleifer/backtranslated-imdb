"Crazy Chick." The beauty contestant is dead, and the usual suspects are surrounded. Another entry in the spirit of a Texas cheerleader is a common example of this type. <br /> <br /> Yasmine Blyth turns into her usual useful game for girls, and Jill Clayberg does a good job, as she is a little tired obsessed mother. <br /> <br /> A few mildly funny moments, listening to the excessively selfish PR erupting from the mouth of the contestants. ("I would like to have a restaurant so that I can give the rest of the food to the homeless.") to kill her! <br /> <br />
