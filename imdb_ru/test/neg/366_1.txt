Well, now this film is part of the job. He is full of stupid Jesus arguments and dialogues that would cause most of the biens to wonder if they should watch movies at all. Celebrities like Roddy Piper and David Carradine attract you, but take it from me, this movie sucks. History is incomprehensible, and it lacks the fullness of intelligence. Sets, costumes and costumes are a cross between the bubble of five and the click of slavery. I am sure that Teresa is porn with the best dialougue.
