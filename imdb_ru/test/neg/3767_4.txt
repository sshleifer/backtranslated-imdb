Any serious movie lover should watch Rocketship X-M for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) This is one of the first - and few - films that does not have a happy ending. Undoubtedly, the effect was deeper in America after World War II than it would be today, but, nevertheless, a sad ending adds to the message of the film. <br /> <br /> 2) It is also one of the first films that deals with space travel in a serious manner, using space as a valid setting for drama. Despite the lack of a scientific background, the film stands on its own as a dramatic fare. This is not so much a cosmic drama, as a drama unfolding in space. <br /> <br /> 3) The message of an anti-nuclear war is transmitted in a serious way, which is not lost in areas associated with large grasshoppers, men, or animals. The influence of Martian society from nuclear devastation is openly and frankly represented. The fact that the expedition survivors of the disaster cannot preach the lesson learned on Mars adds another element of sadness to the tragic finale. <br /> <br /> Sterno says take a ride on the Rocketship X-M.
