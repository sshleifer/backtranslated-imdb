“Eh, heh, heh, hey, dude, - look at these aliens. They like - bite people and stuff! E-he, he-he-he ”<br /> <br /> This must be among the worst films of all time. This is complete nonsense for those who have a little brain. Of course, you have reviewers in the list, who give brilliant reviews and appreciate this abomination, but it is easy to determine who these sales are. Their feedback is too good. To give a film like this, even a mediocre review, claiming that he had some corrective appeal of the B-film, would be a brilliant review! By calling it a good movie, you get the advice of a corporate shill. <br /> <br /> But enough about that. <br /> <br /> This film tells about all the bad characteristics that a movie can have, but it’s not that bad. which is nice to just laugh. Old Japanese films of the 60s had quality that this film lacked. At least in those 60s films, you could laugh at how bad the monster's rubber costume looked. Or laugh, seeing the strings holding the spaceships, as the models dangled on the strings and how the flame bent upwards along the back. These films made fun of how they were BAD. Alien Express (aka Dead Rail) seems to really think of itself as a GOOD movie, which makes it incredibly absurd. <br /> <br /> The effect was terrible by today's standards. Beyond the horror. However, not as bad as in the monster movies of the 60s, so they lacked comedic appeal. The plot and the dialogue were about the same sofomorian, as I have ever seen, even more aggravated, being as predictable as one would expect. I will not even point out the plot and the logical holes in it; it would simply be unfair to this deplorable story (plus it would take a long time to even begin). Most of the game was terrible; Lou Diamond Phillips must have been desperately trying to agree to touch it. <br /> <br /> The SciFi Channel is quickly becoming the “cheap thrill channel”, producing film by film without any kind of iota of concept or intelligence. I can only wonder - why bother? <br /> <br /> Don't worry about this prank. It does not get any worse.
