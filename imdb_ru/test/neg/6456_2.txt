In the film "Revenge" there is something wonderful. Everyone wakes up in the morning, believing that he / she is the star of the “movie”, and that anyone who interferes with his personal agenda is in some way an enemy. Subject films of revenge work especially well if a person has low self-esteem. Instead of resisting at the moment, the “hero” relies on accumulated internal anxiety in order to participate in a single act of force in an attempt to restore balance. It is quite natural that in the “real world” this type of revenge rarely relieves stress, because life is not a movie; after revenge is taken, the actions taken have their own consequences. A good click of vengeance helps people ignore this bitter pill. The films end credits, and all responsibility is decided. <br /> <br /> “Swimming with sharks” is advertised as a comedy, no doubt this is a producer act to figure out how to sell this weirdness, Dark, but this is not a dark comedy (“Company of Men” and Todd Solondz’s work is much closer ). Parts of the film are so fierce, they are preceded by the current "torture of porn" genre is all so obsessed ("Saw", "Hostel"). Have a little laugh. There is laughter in Rescue Private Ryan too, but he is not called a comedy. <br /> <br /> The internal problem of this film is that he did not earn his chance of revenge. Allegedly, this is a young man who is abused by his boss and eventually takes his boss as a hostage in order to “pay him” for all the bad treatment. The hero (aptly named “Boy”) is an “ordinary person”, so vague that we literally do not know anything about him ... what does he do in his spare time? Does he have friends / family? How did he get to where he is? What are his interests (it becomes the acting motive of the film, no doubt, inspired by the film’s own struggle: “What do you want?”, The answer to which denies us a vague, deceptive end)? It is very difficult to take care of such a character, even if he did well (even Tom Hanks becomes a villain in the wrong throw, for example, in “Punchline”). Kevin Spacey as the boss "Buddy" should be a monster, but he is too charismatic as an actor. The best laugh came when he outraged his assistant - he seemed almost as surprised as the public, probably because Guy would stand it. When Kevin's character is tortured, this look suddenly becomes sympathetic to him. The guy is suddenly filmed as an evil monster without rationality. At the moment, any message from the author has been lost; There is no “hero” in this film, so there is no cause for concern. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to assume that this story is based on the author’s own hectic career in the movie business. I worked for a similar boss and I can assure you that this is not so contrived. At that time I had similar fantasies about the fulfillment of desires, and I thought that I was justified. I thought that you could beat the most beautiful woman in history (in fact, the ONLY woman - it seems that there are only about four people in the universe of this film), just being your impatient, naive me, this aspiration won honors and that the boss insulted you because he was a mean man. Time and tide revealed the truth that most "monsters" are in fact just demons of a person’s personal psyche, and resentment is usually based on itself. As the film points out, if Guy was so unhappy, he only needed to leave. The film offers no denouement at all, despite the "surprise" ending. We still do not know anything about the main characters, we cannot even be sure that everything they said was actually founded, and everyone magically gets his cake and eats it too. In short, there was no point in this story, except to indicate that (shock!) The film business can be quite cruel. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of good movies that talk about hard and satisfying revenge. There are not so many fantasies in the style of well-being (“9-5”, “Working Girl”, “The Devil Wears Prada”) (“War of the Roses”, remake “The hills have eyes”)). This is not one of them - despite Benicio Del Toro’s funny turn in the role of Emily Blunt from “Prada” and some interesting works by Spacey and Michel Forbes, this is a disappointing, vile, slightly tangled and slightly boring creation of self - indulgence from a director who we hope by now "settled everything" ...
