For me, this is not at all like Joe Joe. When I watched it in childhood, I didnâ€™t care. In fact, the part that I liked the most is the opening credits. They change so many facts and turn the story around. The cobra commander is supposedly part of this stupid reptile race in Antarctica or somewhere in a frozen place. Although I always thought he was a normal guy, given that every time you saw his eyes on the show, they were surrounded by normal colored flesh, not blue, his face is here In this movie, too much shit to try to make exciting movie, but for me it just destroys what I watched the show for.
