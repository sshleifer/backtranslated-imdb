Remember those horrible war movies your grandmother made you watch 25 years ago on your old VHS recorder? "Fallen" - just a poorly executed remake of these films! The story is terrible, the direction is terrible, the editing is terrible, the music is terrible, and all together create an unbearable nightmare. <br /> <br /> It's also terribly slow! So slow! I tried to fall asleep while watching, but could not, because I had nightmares. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie! This is very bad! Ten lines is a lot, so I donâ€™t know what else to say. <br /> <br /> NOW press the eject button and you will not regret it!
