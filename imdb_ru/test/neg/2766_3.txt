The film begins with a little girl (Rita), who sees the murdered father. He was obviously a criminal who screamed at his fellow fraudsters. Later, and this part does not make much sense, the girl grew into adulthood and STILL haunts her father's past! A little later, Rita meets the useless and meets him. During one of their dates, he is a little drunk and acts like a complete fool. The police are stalking and he is running away, killing a pedestrian in the meantime. Here comes the really stupid part. He convinces her to confess to the crime, as he assures her that his lawyers can withdraw her with impunity. Why, oh, why would she agree to this ?! Yet she does and spends the next couple of years in prison !! And soon after her conviction, this guy disappears, showing that he is a total heel. What a damn thing !!! Later, after her release, her friend (Jack La Rue) tells her the truth about the guy. Then, he explains, the guy's family is loaded, and she has to shake them for a lot of money for all the trouble he put to her by adopting rap. Honestly, it makes sense - since they were certainly indebted to her - especially since they knew that she would go to prison, and intended to use her, and then throw her aside. <br /> <br /> Now the idea of ​​bleeding money from rich chumps is a good plot idea. However, in the first place, this would not have happened, because it is hard to believe that someone can be stupid enough to take a rap and run! In an interesting turn, a stupid lady chooses a criminal life - puts on a wig and picks up a rich guy - takes him to the desert and robs him at gunpoint! Wow ... how she has changed! Apparently, she likes the idea of ​​stealing from “deceivers,” that is, rich hypocrites. However, even this did not make sense, she soon stopped doing this and began to loosen the father of the old guy - why she was trying to commit several minor robberies at that time, did not make any sense. And the fact that it was also a bit hard to believe was that, instead of wanting money from the old jerk, she was interested in forcing him to influence the crowd-controlled person for mayor. Strange ... very, very strange. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, another storyline is developing with the participation of young Alan Ladd. He is an undercover agent who penetrated the crowd. He was chosen because he is just a dead man for a real crook - what a cliche! But what does not make sense is that this real cheater is not in prison and does not commit crimes, while the fake cheater penetrates the crowd in another city. <br /> <br /> In the end, proof that Ladd is capable of uncovering is enough to issue warrants to the king of the mobs — including Rita. This is a case of very bad timing, as in the meantime she decided to become a decent and legitimate woman, because she met a really nice guy she wants to marry! Wow ... what are the odds ?! In general, this is a dull and rather dull film that suffers from “kitchen sink syndrome” - in other words, too many plot elements and strange twists to make the film less believable. Plus, since the film lasts just over an hour, it seems very forced and contrived. This is a relatively bad B-movie from PRC's shitty studio, known only for the performance of Alan Ladd just before he got more fame next year on Paramount. <br /> <br /> By the way, this DVD was released by Alpha Video --- a company that sometimes releases some surprisingly little-known names (mostly public domain), but NEVER cleans prints or adds closed signatures. In other words, the cost of producing a DVD is strictly 3rd level ... at best.
