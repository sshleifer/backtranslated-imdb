I tried to like this movie. I love Kevin Spacey and I know another guy in the role of Brad in the movie "Pulp Fiction." But I just did not care about the characters at all. Kevin Spacey is a shot through the entire film, and even discovering some terrible things that happened to him, I didnâ€™t like him. Especially the end - which made me hate him even more. It was like watching a bad car accident. Spacey played well (he does everything well), but other than that, I do not recommend it.
