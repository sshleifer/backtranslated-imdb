Please ... if anyone gets the opportunity to read this BEFORE watching a movie, if you can call it that, refrain from it ... do not waste your time !!!! I also watched this movie right after the book was finished, and I was seriously disappointed ... the main character is basically a new fictional Fanny, because she NEVER shows any resemblance to the book ... she is so animated and laughs all the time .. If the author wanted to say something, this is that she was a very shy, reticent person .... please !!!!! All the most important parts of the story, which should bring to the hippie finals, are simply not taken into account ... and the rest is invented !!! I think it's better to use the time to either read a bit of a real novel, or just do nothing.
