A few years ago I saw the “Scent of Green Papayas” by the same director. My feelings for both films are actually the same: beautifully shot, but terribly slow and boring. I saw this movie in the preview, and left after half an hour. Couldn't bear it anymore. How can you make an interesting film about people who constantly tell each other how happy they are and how beautiful their life is .........? I had a fantasy about the forgotten American GI, still wandering through the Vietnamese jungle, who did not know that the war was over. As he suddenly emerged in the film and began to devastate his M16 from the heroes of the film. The red of their blood would create a beautiful contrast with all the green plants in the film ........... So I was not greatly captured by this film! Time to go!
