This film is too far from the Straub novel to enjoy. I barely got to the middle of the movie. In addition to transforming Don Wanderley from Edwards' nephew into his son, most of the main scenes and a number of characters who gave the novel so much life were removed. What was left was rubbish. Straub's version was far superior to this poorly executed film. I do not think that the casting also did a great job of recruiting members of the Chowder Society. I hope someone will come and really remake this film correctly in my life. I just hate it when Hollywood advertises the work of talented authors, because they find their version much better. I'm sick.
