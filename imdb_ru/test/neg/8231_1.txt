This film was so terrible that I can't even describe it. I was amazed that I even sat in this pile of garbage. I could not believe that such a film was even thought of. It was a serial killer, like a chicken. He doesn't just click a couple of times, he continually clicks the entire movie. He even claps his hands like a chicken, which is even more stupid than I have ever seen. I could not believe it happened in the 1990s. I thought it came out in the early 80s or so. Then the daughter is also not very smart, because she defended a man or a chicken. The end is only getting worse, and this is the worst end I have ever seen. This movie is just a chicken with ** t. I laughed more than I was scared, and I strongly recommend going out and taking a bucket of fried chicken instead of watching this movie.
