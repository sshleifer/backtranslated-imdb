This film could be impressive, but the creators seem to have done everything they can to make it seem silly. Even God Himself did not spare in this film because His words are imbued with childish jokes. The result is blasphemous and annoying. Only people who do not want to see a cheap parody of the biblical story can watch this movie without embarrassment. The creators of this tasteless performance should see the film “The Singer Paolo Pasolini”, “Il Vangelo secondo Matteo” (The Gospel of Matthew), which shows that there is no need to distort the words from the Bible to create a good story; The most impressive result is due to the sincere display of the simplest text.
