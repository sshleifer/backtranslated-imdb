For me, watching movies is a continuation of my love for cinema - and for a horror movie in particular. The reviews that I have written so far have been for films that I love, respect and admire, and I gladly awarded them bright awards and dozens of excellent ratings. A fan of horror films for life, it’s a great pleasure for me to be able to share my thoughts and ideas about great horror films with others, and I hope to have a hand in showing people films that they couldn’t find otherwise, I just I recently started reviewing films for IMDB, and I initially wanted to focus only on my personal favorites, studying those that, in my opinion, are essential and have lasting value for the horror genre. However, the existence of films such as Graduation Day, without a pun, is on my side. Completely devoid of any virtues, this jumble of unformed ideas of 1981 is aimed at the amateur, does not work well and in every sense represents a unhindered embarrassment for a horror movie. For a short couple of years before and after the release of this film, we saw the emergence of domestic (and Canadian) films, such as "Halloween II", "Prom Night", "Horror Train", "Crazy", "My Bloody Valentine," Robber " , "Before Dawn", "Last Exam" and "Hell Night" and others. These films, although with varying degrees of quality, clearly sought to achieve something in terms of plot, plot, action, direction, and general tone. Not every film released during this rich Era Slasher season would have the artistic value or commercial success of the original Halloween or Friday the 13th, but all of these films were well made and contributed to the constant development of horror films. “Graduation Day”, a terrible farce about a masked killer stalking members of a high school track team, was directed by Herb Freed, who can only be hoped that he will never again try to taint the horror genre with such a parody. The task of creating a decent horror film is best left to those who sincerely love and respect the genre. This film fails miserably at all possible levels, not least these are terribly wooden performances, special effects in a dime store, an annoying musical score and, most importantly, a story that lacks the slightest hint of tension or tension. A pointless exercise in how to waste a movie, “Graduation Day” is a complete shame for a horror movie.
