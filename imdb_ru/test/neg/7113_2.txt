Live version of the Dragonball through Taiwan. <br /> <br /> An evil lord comes to earth to pick up seven magical dragon balls ... pearls that, bringing them together, will cause a dragon to appear and fulfill your desire. This is followed by a lot of action and bad comedy. <br /> <br /> What can I say that "the best way to watch this movie is drunken but witty friends"? I dont know. This is really bad, but funny in the sense that there can be really bad movies. Come on, this is one of the few martial arts films I've ever seen, where you actually see wires. This is a lively animated film, and it is not so far from what I saw in the series, and this makes me afraid of the big budget American version that is being filmed now. <br /> <br /> If you have a few drunk friends and you want to choose a movie to watch this movie. If you are going to see it sober (like me), avoid it.
