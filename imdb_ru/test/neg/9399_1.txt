Funny, nauseous dog with a terrible game; clumsily, superficially and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clich√©s about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and middle age. The main actor frowns nervously through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-glorification, self-pity for a worthless character and script. I'm sure the book was bad, but it could not be so bad! The camera is constantly equipped with a vomit-yellow "Tuscan" lens filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun was not enough Tuscan?), Which they forgot to remove when the scene moves to Rome and (as figuratively!) The Amalfi Coast. You have never seen the white marble of the Roman monument Vittorio Emanuel look so yellow ... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst films ever, and therefore worth seeing.
