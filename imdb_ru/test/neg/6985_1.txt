First, the great discovery is the initial concept of a lost state in gold bullion found in Lake New Zealand inside a downed aircraft of the Second World War. What follows is nothing but a caricature. Men chase men, cars chase men, helicopters chase men, helicopters chase boats, boats chase boats, for most of the hour, the most boring nonsense, absolutely no progress in history. Of particular note is the editing of the store, since many scenes seem to have been grouped in random order. The actions of all stakeholders are embarrassing. One last thing: the quality of the picture and sound on this DVD is so bad that you will be shocked. - MERK
