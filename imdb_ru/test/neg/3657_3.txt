Overly ambitious and shoddy; and sometimes too dark lit. The DARK REALITY script is not even close to original. Dark and damp basement. Abducted prisoners. Fearful survival. Cary (Alisha Seton) tells her family and friends that she will travel in Europe. She does not make it out of the city. She was captured from a rainy sidewalk, drugged and woke up in prison. In the end, she realizes that she is not alone, and after meeting some of her fellow men, they think differently about survival. Her cellmates are starting to die off one by one. Can she gather enough strength and courage to see the light of day again? Other cast members are Lila Dagger, Rachel Oliva, Eva Derrek, Arthur Bullock and Jan Parker.
