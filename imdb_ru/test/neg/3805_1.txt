Stuck in bed with the flu and feeling too rude to get up to find the remote, I actually watched this abomination from beginning to end (how many people can say that? And for anyone who can, what is your excuse?). Oh my god, has there ever been such a complete mess ever released by the main studio? In the alleged “thriller” there is not a single second of genuine tension; the script is inept and funny; the scenery looks as if they were left from a low-budget television film; and the cast ... What did they think? !!! Sally Field, undoubtedly, gives the worst and most awkward results among all the Oscar winners in history. Her annoying nasal nagging and stupidly cheerful behavior in a situation that should be life threatening is truly stupid. Surprisingly, she did not use all her future earnings to buy and destroy every imprint of this turkey. Michael Kane, who is now endlessly pontifying the art of on-screen play — even conducting workshops for future fans — should be killed and shot (preferably by one of Telli Sawalas’s minions). Angela Cartwright, the actress I usually love (and whose name is not even in the opening credits, poor soul), is ten years older than her role, and her terrible dull-yellow prom dress should haunt her nightmares to this day. Throwing it in the eyes of Karl Malden and Shirley Knight - I hope they collected a large salary to calm their participation. The whole film is a series of bad scenes, but I especially remember the explosion, as a result of which the “ceiling” (if the inverted deck of the ship can be called such) collapses and the load of empty cardboard boxes fails! Oh, how scary! Really, really, terrible.
