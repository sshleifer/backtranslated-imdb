This show is like watching someone prepare to ever make a show. There are some good comedic ideas and a lot of mediocre ones. It does not seem that the authors know the difference between what is funny and what is just strange or rude. <br /> <br /> He has his moments. When Spike jumped off a neighbor who allowed her dog to stain his lawn several times, he reached his peak. But there are too few fun moments, and there are too many experimental comedic bits that do not hit the mark. <br /> <br /> The show is better than, say, viewing a test pattern or a QVC network, but this requires the best authors. <br /> <br /> While reading IMDb’s bright positive comments about this show, I’m convinced that most of them were written by the show’s staff, as well as Spike’s relatives and personal friends. <br /> <br /> This is simply not very good in most cases.
