When you make a movie based on the assumption of killer children, there are two effective ways to approach it; you can make it as realistic as possible by creating believable characters and situations, or you can make it as funny as possible by playing it for fun (what the creators of "Silent Night, Deadly Night", for example, did on No less controversial : Santa's killer). People who made “Bloody Birthday”, however, do not do any of this; they simply rely on the shocking value of the image of a child with a pistol (or knife, or noose, or arrow) in his hand. The result is both offensive and stupid. The whole film looks like a bad idea that was thrown into production (and then not released for several years). This is a bit bought by good performances of children, but VERY casually done. (* 1/2)
