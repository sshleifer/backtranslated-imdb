I'm trying to write a summary of the plot for several minutes and can not do it. But with such a bad film as “The Night of the Bloody Beast,” the plot hardly matters. The cosmonaut’s crash lands and is considered dead. Later, his body is reanimated, but it is discovered that it carries embryos of some strange alien form of life. But how did they get there? And where is the alien who implanted strange creatures into the body of Major John Corcoran? <br /> <br /> IMDb lists the Night of the Blood Beast lead time at 62 minutes. It is right? 62 minutes? It should be longer than that. It was endless for me. Even with the MST3K commentary (which, by the way, was very funny), the film itself seemed much, much longer. And it pretty much slumbers from beginning to end. I like many of these alien films from the 50s, but not this one. It could not capture my interest at any level. The little aliens looked too stupid to take them seriously, the title bloody beast was pitiful, and none of the characters did anything for me. Add to this the usual low-budget attributes of Roger Corman, and you get a real loser of the film.
