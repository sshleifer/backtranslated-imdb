“Secret Life” begins with the worst introductory story: “The crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer are too terrible to make a film about ...”. OK, so what are you suggesting? What we should not continue to watch the film, since the film will not be accurate or bloody? And they, too, were right! The film is not at all shocking and contains almost no blood or blood. Although I think this is mainly due to the low cost of producing the budget, and not because of the too horrendous crimes of Dahmer. In essence, “The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer” is just one sequence, repeated over and over. Young, miserable and mentally embarrassed, Jeffrey picks up the victims (always men, because he was homosexual), kills them and then says that he was not going to hurt them and how alone he was. It gets very boring, and even the wonderful performance of an unknown actor Carl Crew cannot save this film from a complete fool. However, this version is much better than the elaborate and hopelessly tangled "Dahmer", released in 2002.
