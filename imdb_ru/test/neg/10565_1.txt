After the initial titles on a black sheet of paper are stained with white paint, oh well, I'll be generous and call it a star field, we witness how the alien spacecraft crashed into a meteorite and was forced to land on the ground. A scary-looking model spacecraft lands on a terrible-looking model field. Three neighboring tourists are investigating. A reptile resembling an alien, “Night Monster” appears from the burning spacecraft, well, so I lied that it was a guy in a dodgy rubber monster mask and a silver space suit. Vacationers are quickly killed by the Nighbeast laser cannon, which shoots terrible special effects at people. City Sheriff Jack Sinder (Tom Griffith) reported. He warns his deputy Lisa Kent (Karin Kardian) and gathers a detachment of men to conduct an investigation. Meanwhile, Nightbeast killed the unfortunate motorist who stopped at the side of the road for a diversion. His two annoying kids run for help. They come to the house, two young people kiss inside, the girl says: “someone runs to the house”. The guy gets up to take a look and is attacked and gutted by the Night Beast, it also kills the girl. Then he manages to kill two children with a laser, maybe the Night Beast is not so bad. As soon as the Sheriff and his men arrive at the scene, they enter into a firefight with a laser weapon with the Night Beast. After the most uninteresting skirmish in the history of cinema, only the sheriff, his deputy and local resident Jamie Zemarel survive. But the Night Beast is still alive, the bullets do not seem to affect it. The next day, the sheriff visits the mayor of the city, Bert Vicker (Richard Dizel) and his girlfriend, Mary Jane (Eleanor Hermann), in order to obtain permission to evacuate all residents of the city. He refuses to say that the party he holds for the governor (Richard Raxton) cannot be canceled, and that he does not want to create a panic situation. The sheriff evacuates the city anyway. The Night Beast attacks two doctors, Stephen Price (George Stover) and Ruth Sherman (Ann Firth), before they can leave. However, they manage to scare the Night Beast and survive. Together with the sheriff, his deputy and Jamie, they decide to stay and fight the aliens. Written and directed by Don Dohler, this should be an amateur film made with family and friends, look at the captions and see how much Doller participates in them. For this reason, I probably should weaken him a little, but it still will not stop, or excuse him for the fact that he was a terrible horrible film in every department. He doesn't have a story or a goal, things just happen to waste time, and what about Drago (Don Leyfert) strangling his ex-girlfriend Susie (Monica Neff)? This and many other scenes add nothing to the film. There is no logic in the script either. Why is the Night Beast sticking around the city as soon as it is allegedly evacuated? The special effects are terribly bad, just look at the effect, when Nightbeast shoots someone from its laser, the computer effect of the 80s will be a shame. There is not much blood or blood in it, a torn belly, a severed arm and a decapitation, but they all look predictably poor. Give it up, Nightbeast itself looks mostly good. There in the sex scenes between the sheriff and his deputy, who must be seen to believe that even porn music will be embarrassed and two really ugly naked people make it difficult to watch the sequence. Less than a star game, photography, music, lighting and editing make it a real chore. And what's worse in this movie? He commits a mortal sin: boring and not at all fun. Sorry, mate, but don't give up! Definitely to avoid.
