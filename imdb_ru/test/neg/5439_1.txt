I would give this movie zero if I could. How someone could rate this higher, I can not do. Until I saw Rollerball, it was my choice of the worst film ever in a large studio with a real budget (arguing that Mangler 2 or Leprechaun in the Hood) is the worst says a lot, it must be bad) /> <br /> Mom Tim Curry must have needed an operation or something else to get him to accept this senseless trash. I'm really not sure what happened here. The novel was great, director Frank Marshall had a solid track record with “Live” and “Arachnophobia” (perhaps they should have changed their name to “Africa”), the actors were good, and the budget was there. You might think that someone would bother to read the script. <br /> <br /> It would be better to see “Battlefield: Earth” again, than to waste time on it. Congo makes you crave the return of MST3K
