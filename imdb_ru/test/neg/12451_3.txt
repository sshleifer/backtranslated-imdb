This is an adaptation of the work of Edith Wharton, whose writing is amazing. Unfortunately, this film never upsets the feeling that these 20th century people do not understand the repression and despair that Wharton’s work in the 19th century portrays. Ward and Dalton are not so bad, but Alicia Witt's wooden execution made me flinch. She had to play a restless element of this story, but she stood like a stick, the whole movie, and I never believed a word from her mouth. When she asks Selu Ward "Why can't I move you?" towards the end of the film, I could not help but answer: “This is what I was surprised at for the last hour and a half !!!”
