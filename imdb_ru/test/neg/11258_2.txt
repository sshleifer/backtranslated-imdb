I have to be honest and admit that this film did nothing for me, except to completely confuse me. He is burdened with a conspiracy that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women, who are then associated with finding the body over 40 years old. It seems that the story does not make much sense, especially when Robishaw (played by Tommy Lee Jones) begins a conversation with Confederate General John Bell Hood (I did not understand). Jones was fine in his role, although I thought he really began to show his age here. John Goodman is badly mistaken in the role of Julie "Baby Feet" by Balboni, who, I think, must be some kind of local mafia figure. I just did not think that Goodman worked in this role, although I admit that this is possible because I am not a big John Goodman fan. Somewhere in the mix, Justin Machado appeared as an FBI agent, although I did not understand what the FBI was doing, which could simply mean that my attention was constantly distracted from the screen. If it was explained, though, I missed it completely. Fortunately, this is a rather short film, so you wonâ€™t spend too much of your life on it. 2/10
