yes ... this is what a disclaimer states after advertising this show, "some scenes may interfere with some viewers." <br /> <br /> This does not interfere. Confirmation of all this demonstration of ego-framing and chauvinism lies in the fact that it is on the channel COMEDY. Yes .. comedy is true and true. JOKE. Seeing how these “games” go through their tough charade really explains what’s wrong with society. Especially the bar scene of the meat market. Both sides, male and female, are equally weak and are desperately trying to mix in this superficial atmosphere. The club is obviously one of those scenes sponsored by the Cigarette Corporation. These people have a choice, and that makes it even more fun. <br /> <br /> These tricky tricks try their best. They shine from their own grease grooves. This is normal. This is a video lesson for a new generation on how to NOT focus on potential heart interest. I hope that this façade will collapse along with the Bush and Harper administrations. The problem is who will line up after the disappearance of these characters? Bastards of children for one night worth?
