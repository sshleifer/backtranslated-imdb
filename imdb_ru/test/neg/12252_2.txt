Dictated by scant experience (both in life and industry) and the lack of funds, Sofia Coppola’s early shorts are almost necessarily an observational part set on the high school campus. The actors are quite weak and do not benefit from the fact that they are removed in black and white (it is difficult to distinguish the characters). Sound editing does little to help a simple story of adolescents ’fickle devotion. <br /> <br /> But there are one or two things worth paying attention to. In the controversial edition, the campus was shot with a balance of wide and intimate pictures of the applicant. Editing to music also creates interest and momentum (without immersion into the underworld of a music video). Coppola clearly attempted to change the tempo of the film. The dramatic twist is shortened quickly and precisely, and the second act is almost non-existent; we understand that he was actually played out in tandem with the first, which is the point of the narrator's path on crutches (which in this first act is curiously added to the character). <br /> <br /> Despite these notes it is awkwardly short. 2/10
