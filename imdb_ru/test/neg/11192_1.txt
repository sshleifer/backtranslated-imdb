If you need a great April Fool's joke, please, without fail, show this movie to someone. However, it is important that you do not in any way criticize the film, but instead say what kind of artistic triumph it is and how “they simply no longer make such wonderful films”. As your victim watches many incoherent and meaningless scenes (for example, when a cute dog is punished for no apparent reason, the cow is on the bed, the woman is licking the statue's foot, or Jesus clearly rapes the woman), make a lot of comments using such words "Glitter" The combination of "or" Transcendence "- all this time is conducted as if the movie really makes sense and is not a waste of an hour of your life. Also make sure that you keep a deadpan character and pretend to be shocked when (and if) they say they either do not understand this, or think that it contains all the skill of a cow pie. Then, to get even more involved with them, show them all the comments on IMDb, since almost everyone (with the exception of a few troublemakers such as almagz and rooprect) happily talk about the genius and artistry of this film! By the time you are done with this little charade, they will most likely think they are idiots and make an appointment with a psychologist. <br /> <br /> For me, this is the ONLY possible reason to watch this horrible movie mess !!! That, or you could show it to the Guantanamo prisoners to make them talk! <br /> <br /> If you ask me, the famous picture of dogs playing poker or the velvet picture of Elvis is artistically excellent.
