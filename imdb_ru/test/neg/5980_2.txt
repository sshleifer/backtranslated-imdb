There is nothing funny, interesting or relevant in this movie. except for the two characters gathered at the end, nothing is decided, and there is no plot. and by the way, what about the DVD cover? He has a female ass in Daisy Duke shorts ... where was this scene in the movie? no one ever wore the dukes of daisies in this film! Surprisingly, almost all the actions in this film are good, and Jack Black performs the full song (it can be a tenacious track ... although I donâ€™t know) ... but these are the only expiatory values. In general, this is just a waste of time.
