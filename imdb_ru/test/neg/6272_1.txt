Itâ€™s hard to imagine someone making a film about Tom Cruise well; really hard, but this one makes it look good. Fine. In fact, it makes him look like Sir John Gilgud, who is celebrating "Very Good Actor's Day" with a bravura performance. <br /> <br /> The whole ensemble play struggled to rise above the risk and failed. The error was, in part, fair, in that the plot bore the same resemblance to the original by H.G. Wells as the killed carcasses of human victims in the film were with their living predecessors: both were bloodied and disturbed by the remains of a more attractive predecessor. But to describe such a conspiracy, to be a little holy, means to say about a colander: "I, have this kitchen utensils have a wonderful variety of holes", unless the holes are your bag; In this case, this film will be grateful to you. <br /> <br /> The mistake in the other part was that these were demotivated jobs, DVD-actors who knew well, we can assume that this was their exhibition, which is on a DVD shelf for $ 5. And overpriced. <br /> <br /> So is it worth watching? Why yes, of course, you should. You are a miserable sinner and deserve punishment.
