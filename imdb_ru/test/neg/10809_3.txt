Well, I read the director’s commentary on this film (shown as “the most important comment”), and I must admit that I can identify with his position. <br /> <br /> Michael, I hope that your career has recovered from this particular setback, and you have moved on to other, better things. I saw this film in the form of MST3K. Even though the robots rejected all intermittent continuity and snotty remarks, I saw a potentially worthy film with an ambitious set of ideas trying to break free from the limited budget and limited actors available to it. And this is one of those films (Mitchell is another), where the MST3K team took a lot of cheap shots in the lead role, even when it really deserved better. You know that they were unjustly entertained at the expense of the actress, because it helped to revive the episode. <br /> <br /> IMO, the fact that the film really tried to be About something, and had some decent, effective moments should be kept away from Bottom 100 (Tangents / Time Chasers) - another movie with a plot and heart, which also does not deserve to be there). <br /> <br /> But this is still not a very good movie. I do not blame the writer / main actress for what she is. It just took her acting and writing skills a few more years to grow up before she was able to carry out such a conceited project like this one, or make a feature film. The letter and description are amateur and delusional, and the dialogue often barely meets the standards of the ABC Afterschool Special. Actors sincerely do their best, and overall acting is definitely head and shoulders above abortions, such as Future War or Space Mutiny, but there are no really professional performances here, except for Big Joe Esteves, hammai, but tense . I have never seen the full original version, but the MST “Soultaker” sample was representative enough to make these facts clear. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is Robert Z'Dar in the film. That is, IMO, the real “Kiss Of Death” for any film that hopes to be taken seriously. Yes, he is big and scary in his role, but I just hate this guy as an actor. (In real life, I wish him all the best and hope that he feels comfortable from a financial point of view.) <br /> <br /> There were little things in the film that I liked. For example, the camaraderie between a man and his dead mate brought a little warmth and humor to the film and made him much more watchable. The idea of ​​creating an elevator in a hospital that opened its doors to the afterlife was an inspiring way to cause some terrible vibrations without requiring special effects, and I respected anyone who included this in the script, trying to keep the budget manageable. In fact, it did not work, but perhaps with a little more fine tuning. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mr. Rissi, good luck with your other projects - your participation in this misfire will not stop me from seeing something else that you did if the “buzz” was good. And Mrs. Miller has nothing to be ashamed of - she was young and ambitious, and the film was NOT SO bad.
