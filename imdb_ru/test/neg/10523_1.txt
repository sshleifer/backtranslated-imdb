Well, we kept up with the stereotypical bad experience in the orphanage and explained to our son, adopted from Russia, that it was excessive acting and dramatization so that we could get to the dog playing football (since he plays football). But the last scene, in which the dog returns to its original owner, put my son on the edge, and he cried for 15-20 minutes: “He was replaced !!!!” This is from an elementary child. I do NOT recommend this movie to a single family that has an adopted child; he badly reflects adoption, orphanages and adults - and, in the end, even though they win the game - the dog the boy is associated with must go - and this is too much. PLEASE be careful if you have foster children and beware of families with biological children, because the impression about adopted children is not positive and creates a stereotype that is unhealthy and unpleasant. (The dog is cute, but not enough to save our family’s reaction to this film ....)
