Looking for something shocking? Okay okay ... such a figurative. That's all. This film tries to establish deep connections with the audience with the help of various symbols and is simply annoying. I’m not quite sure if the director’s goal was to really portray some deep message for his audience, or he was just trying to hit them with devil, blood, sex and violence. I think it was probably the first ... but in an unsuccessful attempt ... it just turned out to be part of clever trash with lots of blood, some disgusting characters and excessive reliance on religious symbolism. If you are looking for some kind of independent film to criticize for trying to use the metaphor ... try it. If you are looking for a click of blood that will make you nauseous and uncomfortable ... here you are ... If you are looking for a film that annoys you endlessly because you understand that the message was stupid ... the film was stupid .. ... and you will never return these moments of your life ... this is definitely a movie for you!
