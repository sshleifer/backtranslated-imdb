I gave this film only 4, because I saw it in the 3rd. If you do not see him in the 3rd, I give him 2. This film is so bad that it is not funny. Anyone can make such a film in a week. Bad game, effects and story !!! But it was cool to watch in 3d. Why can't they make good movies in the 3rd format ???
