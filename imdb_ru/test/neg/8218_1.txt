The film begins with a big voice over, bad sign. Then it just slides down with silly and mind offensive scenes involving catchers and Indians. But it reaches new and impressive lows when all the cheerful mountain people dance with each other on a high alpine meadow. In the meantime, happy Indians are sitting and looking at them. This is a better scene than dancing cowboys in Blazing Saddles. There is a slight flaw in this comparison; "Around Missouri" is not a comedy. <br /> <br />
