I spent the last 5 years in the entertainment industry, and most recently I worked for a company that made this film, which is very unfortunate because I like these people, I just can't believe that someone can do something as bad as this? !!!! It was crap from all sides. From cinematography to dialogue, from acting to costumes and staging - one of the worst films I've ever seen! The actors in this film looked like they were taken immediately to porn, which is filmed in the San Fernando Valley and put on the set with an even less talented team. <br /> <br /> I just cannot overcome the fact that I am sitting on one of the best materials I have ever read, and on contacts in the industry that can help me to make my dream come true and overcome everything possible obstacles? However, the people behind this film’s spectacle have no problems with assembling it, and in fact, it’s good to get enough sleep after it’s released. <br /> <br /> Life, what a trip!
