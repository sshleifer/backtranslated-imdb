Oh. Good. Sadness <br /> <br /> I saw the name of this film on television and thought: “I have to watch this film, shooting“ Snakes on an airplane ”, it will be terrible, but I hope it’s funny too. Sounds fantastic bad. ” Well, I was half right. <br /> <br /> This film is incredibly bad, and, unfortunately, even unintentionally hilarious. This is just bad. Worse, what looks like an action takes almost an hour. In the first half of the film, we have to endure some vague foreign language (Mexican or Spanish, apologies for my ignorance) and terrible behavior when a woman spews alive snakes for reasons that we will learn later. Then we have to endure even more terrible actions, and we find that those who mumble in a foreign language can still speak English, because snakes are finally lost in the train, and things move from pacified to funny. br /> Low budget does not always mean "bad", but in this case it is. What we have here is a film, a non-conceived, horrible script, a poor cast and even meaningless to use its very few strengths. I give two marks for some decent special effects and a stupid ending, but it still seems too generous. Avoid if you can. <br /> <br /> Look if you want: Stagknight, remake of The Wicker Man, terrible CGI.
