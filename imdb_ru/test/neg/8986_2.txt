The story of the psychic woman Tori, who returns to her hometown and begins to relive her traumatic childhood past (the death of her childhood friend and abusive father). Tori discovers that her friend was only the first in a series of murders that are still happening. Can her psychic abilities help solve crimes and stop ongoing murders? <br /> <br /> You really don't need to know this, because, my God! It was so bad! I know that all fans of Nora Roberts will gather in this film and give him dozens of dozens. Then the rest will see 6 points in IMDb and really think that this film is worth seeing. But do not be fooled. The ending was predictable, the acting was HORRIBLE (don't even turn me on with southern accents * y'all *), and the story was commonplace. Just remember .... you have been warned!
