This film was a complete waste of time. It is nothing like a gangster movie. It contains a very predictable plot. My feelings do not sympathize with the characters, and the dialogue is mediocre at best. Half the time you are looking for something else, because the film is boring, because you already know what will happen. The rest of the time you are desperately hoping that the main character will grow a couple of balls or just end his life by jumping from a bridge or something. In addition, minor characters are mostly one-dimensional. There is no depth for any of the characters in this movie! No depth!
