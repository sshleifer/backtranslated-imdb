So, it all started with “Shreik” - a set of horror films, then we had a “Scary Film”, a really good attempt at a new genre, a famous film. however ... now we have: Scary Movie * Scary Movie 2 Scary Movie 3 Scary Movie 4 * Date Movie Meet the Spartans movie, not another team * plus many more (really funny movies marked with *) <br /> <br /> and ..... A film about superheroes .... it seems that the people who make these films cannot yet understand what makes the parodies ridiculous. it's ridiculous to use robberies from other films - everything is fine, if everything is done correctly, but it seems that not many producers know how to do it. The scary movie (1) did it well, the next sequels were terrible then, because they were trying to replay the franchise, but it was bought by Scary Movie 4. No other teen film was good because he used parody well ... and his credit I'm tired of teen movies. however, this film plays like a bad version of all this. he relies on a slap that will make even 3 puppets cringe, disrupting the image of Stephen Hawking, and then when people start to get bored (and the producers knew when this will happen), we turn to Pamela Anderson in a tight-fitting suit. Finally, the parody should The idea is to make a tribute-like layout of the original film with the original storyline, and not to mix random fragments of a legitimate movie with the storyline of a real film. <br /> <br /> ... I shudder at the thought of a "sci-fi film" and prepare my knife seppuku
