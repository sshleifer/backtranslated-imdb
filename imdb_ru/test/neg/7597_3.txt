Given that Roger Corman put his name to this production, I had high hopes for this film. Korman made many unforgettable horror films with a low budget in the 1960s. I especially liked his adaptations of the Po stories, such as “Asher’s House”, “The Pit and the Pendulum” and “The Crow”, in which the great Vincent Price appeared. These films had a good game, atmosphere, tension, strong characterization, intriguing plot development and delivered some frightening moments. Unfortunately, `House Of The Damned ', for the most part, sacrifices these qualities instead of stupid low-budget special effects, excessive nudity and meaningless blood, topped with a cliché of quick edits and views. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Of The Damned begins with some beautiful shots in Ireland, but from here it’s straight down. Unfortunately, instead of wasting time creating an atmosphere, creating characters that we could take care of, or creating uncertainty — the director decides to start counting the number of people. After a brief acquaintance with the leading characters, a young couple and their daughter, the audience spends the balance of the film, moving from one "frightening" event to another, which in this film replaces the consistent development of the plot. The main characters are so poorly thought out and do so badly - the audience doesn’t care what happens to them. Worse yet, “creepy” events are either completely cliche or inconclusive due to low technology and low budget special effects. The soundtrack was filmed from Omen. The plot, which is not enough there, is borrowed from “Poltergeist” and “House of the Legend of Hell,” but does not possess any qualities that would make these films convincing. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in looking good at Haunted Houses, I recommend you to look at classics such as Ghosts (1963), Innocents (1961), or see the early American international movies of Corman and see "House of the Damned", if you are not a masochist or not thoughtless. <br /> <br /> 3 ½ out of 10. <br /> <br /> Rob Rivott <br /> <br /> Wpg, MB.
