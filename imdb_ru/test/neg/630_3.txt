I was really looking forward to seeing this film after spending a few (fantastic) weeks at a college in Barcelona. The original premise is correct - a young and confused young man enters the world of young and confused young people. But the director’s weak views on symbolism, philosophy, and social commentary were completely wrong, and this leaves us, the audience, confused and upset. Bravo. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if this film were presented as the European film American Pie, I would be able to turn off my brain and go for a walk. But right away, the director penetrates our deeper feelings by introducing the symbolism of warped highways and the dichotomy of the “inner self” against the “public self” (“mother tongue” against the “secondary language”). In addition, he boldly dives into the theme of racial / national stereotypes. Start interesting, eh? <br /> <br /> WRONG. This is as far as it goes. These interesting topics are hardly mentioned again, with the exception of the contrived final of the epilogical type, which seemed to be the director in order to return to the topic. It reminded me of a stray speech that does not go anywhere, but in conclusion, the speaker says: “So in conclusion, I hope you understand how this relates to my original thought!” <br /> <br /> Moreover, like other reviewers, pointed out, a cynical blow to stereotypes poses itself. If the goal is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes, then why did the director present a caricature, drunken English maiden as a caricature of prejudice? Why did the director portray an American as a Neanderthal (literally pounding on his chest and making monkey sounds), while Europeans haughtily tolerate him? Why is the British girl the one who plunges into tatters (calling the French "frogs" and killing French), and everyone else is above all this? The answer is that this is not a deep and thoughtful film. This is just a replica of Anglophobe Anglophiles. But in reality this is no different from the prejudices that he tries to ridicule! Now there is a funny irony worth considering. <br /> <br /> Well, philosophy, artistry, and sociopolitical commentaries, besides this film, I was still very bored. There is one very funny joke, which includes the deception of one of the girls' guys, but besides this I was hardly entertained. The only reason I’ve watched it to the end is because I’d like to brush up on my knowledge of French and Spanish. (You see, we Americans who speak the same language may be stupid, but we try.)
