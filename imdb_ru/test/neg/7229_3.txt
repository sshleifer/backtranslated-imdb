As if the world had not yet received enough cheap imitations of Jaws, the writer Boaz Davidson decided to continue his octopus with amusing, but pleasant enough creatures with octopus to completely rob Spielberg's classics, to a concerned policeman who nobody believes, and the mayor is more worried about his celebrations 4 July than about people. <br /> <br /> Even in the hands of an extremely experienced director, it is unlikely that this derivative garbage could be anything other than hockey trash in the B-film, but with Yossi Wayne (yes, Yossi Wayne!) causing shots behind the camera, a man with a small amount of Mr. Shpilberg's talent (I estimate about 1 / 10,000th), Octopus 2 is guaranteed to be as bad as you can imagine! <br /> <br /> Predictable and extremely clichéd plot should not be described in more detail (replace the “Island of friendliness” of Jaws with New York, and Bruce Shark with giant rubber). octopus, and you get the point), although a few moments about the film are definitely worth mentioning, simply because they are so funny: all the attacks of the octopus involve actors struggling to make incredible looking giant tentacles look real, which is fun to contemplate; The capital of Bulgaria, Sofia, unconvincingly replaces New York, and excessive use of video materials makes the illusion even less convincing; best of all, the sequence of stupid dreams, in which the rubber octopus attacks our hero on the Statue of Liberty, is not only incredibly stupid, but also has truly awful special effects. <br /> <br /> Davidson’s script also doesn’t know when to leave: there are several moments in this film in which he could (and probably should) end, but the action continues and continues when the octopus has experienced several explosions, and the tunnel collapsed (trapped in a love interest in the film and a group of children) before the hero finally blows to smithereens. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it’s very stupid, always horribly technically, but never really scary, this bitch STV can find fans among those who are actively looking for cinematic trash. However, most normal people are advised to stay away.
