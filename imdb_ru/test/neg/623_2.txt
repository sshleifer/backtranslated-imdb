I'm an atheist. For me, history really means a lot. <br /> <br /> This film is made after a novel published in 1921, which is still being updated, as if it were a history book. Well, it is not. The film is about the version of the novels of the 1950s. Some actors were EXCELLENT, but this does not apply to the plot. <br /> <br /> In short, man invents a super-bomb, so God and his friends are holding a tribunal to find out if they should intervene. The analogy of the devil persecutes man, and we have the spirit of man to protect. What is the spirit of man anyway? And why was Adam's first responder? In the end, you find yourself in American Christian propaganda in the 5th grade history textbook of the time. Although other religions are mentioned, only European Christianity is explored. <br /> <br /> First we will learn the history of the caveman. Women are skinny stereotypes of girls in distress. Real cave women were as strong as men and as resistant. Difficult times, hard life, adapt and survive. All this is mitigated by the stereotypes of the mid-century. <br /> <br /> Then we get the first construction of the Egyptian pyramid. Today we see another story and we know that there were far fewer deaths and permanent citizens at work. Losing the mentioned number of many lives in the process would be a national catastrophe, and no one afterwards would try to defeat it. As if there was only ONE pyramid. <br /> <br /> The part about Moses and the one true god was as if asked by the Spanish Inquisition. The Inquisition itself was not even mentioned in the film. <br /> <br /> Helen of Troy’s wicked gloom was so nasty that I didn’t even understand why so much even interested her. In fact, they were just soldiers, following orders from commanders who "discussed" the political problem of power. She was just an excuse. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra said that this film was inaccurate and filled with propaganda. Here the brother was much younger. She was not obsessed with poison, was educated enough to restore the contents of the library, and was politically competitive to get the beaten Egypt out of the mud. <br /> <br /> It was disgusting to part with Nero and pray to Christians in a cave. Yes, Rome burned down. Yes, Christianity was persecuted there. But the way they portray it, it looked like the Colosseum was building itself, and there was no Vespasian to restore Rome. <br /> <br /> Attila Gunn appears in the near future, and we jump to King Arthur. Crusades are mentioned with minimal bloodshed. And there is no mention of the crusades east to Russia, which ended in an ironic battle. The knights just went home and began to compete. A lot of things are postponed, like no internal cleaning, hygiene and epidemic. <br /> <br /> Then they cover Joan of Ark, where she always has a lot of makeup and looks like princes. Territorial policy was replaced by an unfair court. One glass on a stool makes me want to ask how someone might follow. When burning, I wanted to shout: “Huru! And now die! Cheap special effects, where's the fire? ”. <br /> <br /> By the time they mentioned Leonardo, I'm already fed up with the movie. Columbus, the Spanish massacre of America, shouts to Queen Elizabeth, "kick the Spanish armada," and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> The only reason I wanted to watch this film was that it was the last one with all 3 characters brothers. And all they got is a scene with Manhattan and the Indians. Funny, but nothing more than a smile. <br /> <br /> Witches hunts are briefly mentioned, as well as epidemics (after a resurgence). When they begin to depict revolutions, it all comes down to a thirst for power and anarchism. The revolution in the United States pursued the French Revolution. Oppression and incompetence are bad, but you can’t just blow the old path out of anger; you have to replace it with something. Thus, they replaced the French monarchy with a new French monarchy. Thus, we force Napoleon and his ambitions to travel to India by land. But they replace his motives with unity and unite him only for the title “Emperor”. The conquests in Europe, the defeats in Russia are fired Waterloo. <br /> <br /> US Civil War, English rich inventors (Tesla is not included). “Mr. Watson, come here, I want you to” almost made me laugh for teenage reasons. Hard technical work boiled down to the latest discovery and abuse of comedies. <br /> <br /> In the end, after 85 minutes we enter the world wars and organized crime, but this is not terrible. Adolf's words “I invade Russia. This is my last territorial requirement ”were fun. This was his LAST territorial requirement. <br /> <br /> To create uncertainty, God sets the reference clock to the end of the world on the “wall” for the last words. All the mighty can not suspend the universe for a second? The pursuit speech was not necessary, but the defense made the last throw. <br /> <br /> Last time we see the man of tomorrow as the last defense. Apparently paradoxical person, because the bomb had to go today. His toys are a pistol-shaped music box and a pencil box. Now is it so wrong? Pens and pencils drew so many drawings of weapons that the number of killings exceeds the atomic bomb. And make music from weapons? Seduced selfish generals make music from weapons. So the man of tomorrow is already a monster. <br /> <br /> As I understand it, all that the defense had to do was to accuse the devil as a true conspirator of the death of a person, and the case was closed. And, frankly, compared to all the barbaric behavior that our ancestors did many centuries ago, we are quite humane in a painless backstab these days. <br /> <br /> To sum up, I’ll simply quote the episode of “Firefly” “Jaynestown”: “This is my assessment that every person who ever received a statue from him was one or another son of a bitch. Jane. That's what they need. "
