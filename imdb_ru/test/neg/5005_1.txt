Ugh. Yes, it looks like a McMartin mess or horrible arrests in Wenatchee, Washington. In the film, the mother continues to persistently interrogate her little boy, again and again, until he finally tells her what she clearly wants to hear. Judicial investigators and "therapists" repeat this model. Interrogation is in itself a sexually creepy, ambiguous repeated attack in its own way. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers abandon the doctor, talking about the physical evidence of violence, perhaps to justify the point of view of the film: Four-year-olds never invent such things. Well, they will, if every adult they know asks them about it. The way this part supports such discredited interrogation techniques makes viewing this exercise frustrated for anyone who knows what is needed for a successful prosecution in real life. <br /> <br /> (They also add to the end a special incident with an arrest in order to “prove” their case - there was no parallel with this fictional incident in real life. I can’t say more without turning it into a spoiler, but You will know about it when you see. <br /> <br /> Yes, children are bullied, sometimes paid service providers, but to watch a film that confirms ridiculous, hysterical accusations against so many absolutely innocent people, to watch the re-creation of lawsuits that destroyed life of countless children, as well as life I don’t think that I’m going to last until the end. It’s just too sad, and it’s even more obvious because the writing team approved the offensive, paranoid, intrusive interrogation methods that started - how can we call it? Bonfire of Sanity? <br / > <br /> No one I know was ever accused of abusing children, thank God, but my 12-fold great-grandmother was accused of witchcraft and killed for it. Mobs filled with what they consider holy anger now as dangerous as three hundred years ago. Sensational chatter like this: “These accusations of satanic violence appear all over the country, there must be something there!” “So say it to the jury!” - just eggs on them. <br /> <br /> And who would have thought that this is a good idea for children under ten, some of whom under five, to play these roles? It is traumatic to watch them deliver their lines; How traumatic were these parts? The commitment of cinematographers to combat child abuse is obviously not their own. And what did the parents of the child-actor THINK? Melinda (uncredited, at least in the A & E Network version in 2005, but I think it was Cassie Friel) and Teddy (Brian Bonsall) were terrific. Professionals or not, however, they were too young to be exposed to this material, much less to pay for it. Despite the ruthless exploitation of these real children, "You Know the Muffin" received an Emmy nomination for directing, which simply shows how crazy things were, back in 1989.
