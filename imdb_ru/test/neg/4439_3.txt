Quintet is definitely not a film that most people find funny or even interesting in this regard. There is no scene, dialogue, action or plot that would spark a spark. The ice world is one thing, and the tangled plot is something that you really can't bear. Characters are not only three-dimensional, they are not even one-dimensional, they have no emotions and there is no point in everything that happens. There is a world enclosed in ice, where no one does any meaningful work except playing the Quintet, and the rules of the game never even hint at anything. The houses are not heated, even there is electricity, but who and what produces it? There is a tree, but there are no animals, except dogs, where clothing or shoes come from, because there seems to be no industry, and everyone is dressed like in 16th century Europe, which contrasts strangely with the not so futuristic background of the pavilion. The whole movie seems stuck in Altman's imagination, and he never bothered to share his ideas or his vision with the audience. Desolation or hopelessness have nothing to do with the lack of appeal to this film, George Lucas’s “THX1138” world is not a brighter place, and the characters are no more funny, but the story has its own way. In Quintet, there is no obvious or even hinted way, and, in my opinion, it does not even cause thoughts about the idea behind all this, as, for example, in John Bourman’s similar film “Zardoz”. It is not even made in the unique style of Altman, so it does not appeal to his fans, and I am one of them. In general, Robert Altman had a dream, and he woke up without telling anyone what it meant, even to him.
