Today it is the most disgusting and cruel version of the Scarlet Catcher ever created. As a Pimpernel fan, I was genuinely offended by what they did to the characters - but this crime is not worth watching, even if you are not familiar with the story. <br /> <br /> Percy Blakney, for example, would never slaughter people in the back, just to go down the hallway. Shovelin would never have a row of women in his bed. Margarita never had an affair with Chaulain and Armand with Minett, whoever she was. Chauvin will not accidentally shoot Tony in the head. Chovelin's name is not, and never was, Paul. They completely destroyed any reference to the Pimpernel disguise, replacing them with gadgets and James Bond tricks instead. As for the movie itself ... Makeup is terrible. Women look like clowns. A sign of beauty Elizabeth McGovern wanders over her face at random. Poor, wretched actors do not have a script for the work, so in fact they are not to blame for the fact that their characters are as thin as a wet tissue paper. Dialogue ... oh, dialogue. The dialogue is unbearable. And the one who is responsible for all these little inscriptions at the bottom of the screen should be forced to watch this movie as repentance. (For the first half hour before I gave up, I counted 13 signatures about the location. As if we cannot understand that the reservoir between England and France is the English Channel.) <br /> <br /> Film - If I Can to call it that, because in reality it’s just a video cassette with a filter, it’s absolutely useless. Do not waste your time and brain cells on this rancid chatter - instead watch the 1982 Anthony Andrews / Jane Seymour film or the Leslie Howard film of 1934, or ANYTHING besides.
