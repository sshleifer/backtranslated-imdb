I am one of those guys who like movies with a hood, from New Jack City to Baby Boy and Killa Season, from class b to Hollywood. but this film was something else. I'm not a hater, and this movie was pretty enjoyable. but some bits were just weird. well, the game was not good compared to Silkk The Shockers' performance in Hot Boyz (pretty good) and Ice-T in the new Jack and SVU (great). The scene where Korrupt (Ice-T) kills a volunteer to become a Jamaican dude, he says something and lights himself on fire, burning both Ice-T and another guy, it kills Jamaican, but Ice-T is intact, very similar on other ice. The movie “Urban Danger” (in which both of these actors were shot) was Snoops’s supernatural character, but after that there is no suggestion that Corrupt as a demon. When MJ (Silkk) first gets hit with a knife, he fights, but after that he fights normally and gets stabbed in the thigh with no blood. and when MJ admits that he killed a policeman because a policeman beat his friend Benny, he was strange, Benny is not represented in this film, and the scene is not in the film. it really weighs the fact that Corrupt wants to kill MJ, but still makes you scratch your head. Wen Jody writes a letter to Miss Jones’s character explaining what happened to them, after the words there is no mention of what happens to the other two main characters, MJ and Lisa. the film really showed the horror and poverty of the ghetto, which has plagued the lives of latinos and blacks all over the world, was a good part of the film, although the projects clip was used thousands of times. and the scene where Miles kills a Hispanic brother, smashing his motorcycle at full speed (without a helmet) and crashing into the car of my Latin American brother who killed him. the film was similar to the film Urban Threat, and half of the actors were in both of these films, as well as in the film crew. it was good though. but out of poverty, I love movies with a hood, but if you don’t like them like me, then DON'T LOOK. the only thing that saves me from leaving is that it reminded me of the first movie I made, which was shot for $ 100, and my love for the genre. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel Pures
