Undoubtedly, the concept has already been made with Alf and Charmings: to impose modern society on one or more inappropriate characters. But I loved both shows and watched them religiously until they ended in 1990. When I found out about Scorch, I really hoped for something new, since the new television in the 90s still did not impress me (but at least Star Trek: PNP and Simpsons were still going). <br /> <br /> What I received was a big disappointment. The game was terrible, but, given the ridiculous dialogue and absolutely incredible composition, I can not blame them too much for what they had to work with. There were a few humorous moments, but most deliberate jokes seemed forced upon delivery. All the production work on the show seemed too low-budget for what was on television at the time. In the 80s he could fit in. <br /> <br /> However, this was the first episode in which it was necessary to introduce the characters and create the entire premise of the series, so I doubted it. The second episode was not so bad, and I began to return my hopes that as soon as he reached his climax, the show would improve. Unfortunately, my VCR ended up not recording the third episode on the air, I never saw it, and the series disappeared from the television lists after that. All I have right now is the first two episodes recorded on the air on a VHS tape.
