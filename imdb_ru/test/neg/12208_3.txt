It is only necessary to read the list of actors and captions to salivate in anticipation of this DAVID COPPERFIELD, but, alas, alas! The extent to which a powerful acting and directorial talent could turn one of the richest literary tales into such a monumental FIGHT, is completely beyond me. It looks beautiful with a beautiful photo, especially with Yarmouth TV shows, but just boring !!! No need to continue! Skip it and watch Selznick or the wonderful BBC miniseries of the 1980s.
