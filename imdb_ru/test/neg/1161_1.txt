I did some Ed Ed research and found some interesting things. Like the fact that Ed Gene was quiet and lonely, and not some amateur because of the jerk, as in this film. I will say that I have not finished this film, but I will. I will interrupt the fact that all of us, Wisconsinians, speak as if we were from Kentucky. You know the funny, but oh, such a sad factor in this film, that Wisconsin is not as hot as they look. <br /> <br /> This film is not just an insult to people from Wisconsin, I am Wisconsite. but this is a complete insult to a man who turned out to be a mad, lonely man. He killed two people, and the film could not even understand it correctly. Ed was not so close and personal and scared people, he shot two and only people he killed. So why do these films lie and say "ON THE BASIS OF TRUE HISTORY"? It is not based on anything other than the lies that the director invented in his dirty head. <br /> <br /> Joke and nothing more! <br /> <br /> Okay, I would add to this. I finished this horrible movie, and I would like to laugh at the director. Do your homework when making a movie. I would like to inform you that there are no mountains (for those who have never been to Wisconsin), and oh, there is no desert! What the hell, in Predatory there was more pines and snow, and this should have been shot in California. <br /> <br /> Well, for those who don’t know anything about Ed Heine, I would like to give you a history lesson. Ed Gein was thought to have killed his family, but it was never proven. He killed the bartender, she was shot dead in a bar nearby when no one was around. He took the dead bartender back to his house. 10 years later, he shot and killed the seller, he stole a cash register and a truck store. He was caught because of this murder, he came the day before, when her son was there, and asked about antifreeze. On the day he killed her, he was there, buying antifreeze, and the recipe, in which there was only an antifa ..., was the only evidence that they should have started a worldwide hunt for people. He robbed graves, in fact in 56 graves robbed. He hates the people he dug, and he made funicours; lampshades, couches, chairs and more. <br /> <br /> He had a family with whom he dined once and for a while, and they threw all the meat he ever gave them when he was caught, given that he was caught in their house. He was arrested and hid in the back of a police car, fearing what might happen to him. How do I know all this? I read the book that the judge who tried to write it wrote. <br /> <br /> After this film was finished, after seeing all the terrible things, I’m not only offended by the horrible directors' eyes on how women from Wisconsin look. I mean, it was hard to tell who this guy had half the time on the plate, you know, because the women from Wisconsin are all BLONDES. You are welcome! I’m too offended by the lack of homework this guy did and the bad work he did when making this film. I have no idea who this guy is Kane, and I think he might be alright at something else, but he did a terrible job playing Ed Gein. <br /> <br /> After all this, I feel so sad that I spent 3.99 on a movie. <br /> <br /> The film after its completion was completely untrue, this film, like me, says that the world is flat, and George Washington was not our first president. Come on people, this is your story, and this is the story of Wisconsin. To stop this rant, how would you feel if I made a film, and George Washington looked like Brad Pitt (some of you might think it was good, but it wouldn’t be like that), and he lived rather than was president and no difference. You cannot rewrite history.
