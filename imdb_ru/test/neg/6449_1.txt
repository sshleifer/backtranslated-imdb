This terrible piece of thrips is everywhere. The script is bad, the plot is bad, the acting is bad. There are some decent actors in it (for example, Charles Durning), but the director did not get anything from them. The plot has Santa, feeling depressed and thinking that he no longer needs anyone, taking a little girl across the country to try to get her father back with her mother. This is a fraudster in Santa costume with a parrot on his shoulder (performed by “Isaac” from “Boat of Love”), the world's largest elf (played by Bruce Vilnach is a very funny man, but without an actor), a seasoned factory owner who works on Christmas Eve overtime and sleigh when someone cuts through one of Santa's skis, trying to win. If the plot sounds bad, on a small screen it's worse. If you see that this movie goes on, run, do not go to the TV and turn it off. You may want to brew TV to remove the remaining infection. If you accidentally watch more than 10 minutes, you may have to burn the TV, and the cable company will install completely new lines.
