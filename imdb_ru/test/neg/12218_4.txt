The real problem with this story is that there is not much history in it. One can hardly talk about conspiracy. A widower buys an electric grandmother for her children. One child resists electrical grandmother. Then finally takes it. Then the children grow up and the grandmother leaves. In fact, very little is happening. This is much more prerequisite than a story. <br /> <br /> In addition, deprive her of this Schmalz, and you have a story that has already been made and is better: Lonely. The same basic idea: a person cannot initially accept the love of a robot, because it is just a machine, then eventually gives in and loves a robot. The biggest difference is that The Lonely is much more powerful, as both the main character and we, the audience, were shocked that they returned to reality and had to remember that in the end the robot is really just a mechanism. <br /> <br /> I also find the story very erroneous in that the electrical grandmother is just * too * perfect. She is not only a "man", she is * a superman *. She is wiser than a real person, she has no signs of mechanicalness at all, and she makes marble appear from the air. Frankly, it’s really trusting to think that she’s a car.
