Although this is better than most television films, Buried Alive is nothing more than a common story of revenge. There are so many holes in the plot that makes you wonder why the writers did not go through a series of rewrites. In the end there is a good twist, but this is hardly plausible. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Jason Lee's game is, as always, amazing, but Tim Matheson mixes it with obscene remarks that resemble Jack Nicholson in Shining. Do not worry about that.
