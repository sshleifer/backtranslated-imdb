In the year when Singing in the Rain and High Noon were released, this stuffed turkey somehow won an Oscar for the best picture. Half of the film is nothing more than circus performances. The other half is a soap opera and melodrama. Heston and Wilde both replay, although they are models of restraint compared to the annoying Hatton. Playing as a self-centered trapezoid artist, Hutton acts as an over-zealous high school student in a poorly prepared school play. Graham - the only cast that can play a worthy role. DeMille is not interested in telling a good story, only in creating a long spectacle, no matter how boring it is.
