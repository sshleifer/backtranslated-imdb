The American family moves to the Spanish countryside to live in an isolated house. Regina (Anna Paquin), daughter of a teenager Mark (Ian Glen), who is sick and has some mental problems, and nurse Maria (Lena Olin) note that strange things are happening in the house and with her younger brother Paul (Stefan Enquist), but her mother does not believe in her. Reggie decides to find out with his boyfriend Carlos (Fele Martinez) the origin of the house, and they discover that forty years ago the place was the stage of the death of six children. Reggie decides to ask for support from his grandfather Albert (Giancarlo Giannini) to protect her brother from home and her father. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD, expecting to see a good horror film about a haunted house, mainly because of the names of Anna Paquin, Lena Olin, Fele Martinez (from "Theses" and "Abre los Ojos") and Giancarlo Giannini. In addition, I really like the Spanish cinema. Despite this, I discovered a terrible screenplay, a terrible director and a regrettable game of great actors and actresses. The intention of this story is good, it is a bit like “Shining” at some moments, but unfortunately it is poorly developed, since it is never clear, for example, the reasons and motives for which the American family moved to Spain, or the terrible relations between family members , basically the situation between Maria and Reggie. The direction is confused, ill trying to use darkness and shadows to give a terrible effect to the story. I love Anna Paquin, but her expressionless face never works in this film. Lena Olin - a caricature of the great actress, which she is; and Stefan Enquist is too weak for such an important role. Only Fele Martinez has good performance in her character support. I liked the open end of the story. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “A Sétima Vítima” (“The Seventh Victim”).
