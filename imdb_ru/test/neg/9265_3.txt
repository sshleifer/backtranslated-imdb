I purchased this film a couple of years ago, and, trying to find some information about it, I discovered that even the powerful IMDb does not have it in the list. That was supposed to be all I needed to know. <br /> <br /> With Like Like This is an anthology that plays as a collection of Twilight episodes / External limits of the second level, connected to each other by bus journey, which never seemed to link with the rest of the film. Of the three stories, the only thing from which I extracted any value for entertainment is the second episode in which a person (of a kind) grows out of bacteria in a refrigerator for guys. This episode wins points for several spots of humor, and this is a fancy premise. In addition, there is an episode with a talking machine (soft and aimless) and an episode when a girl visits a very unique dating agency (my dog ​​guessed that this was the end). <br /> <br /> As was mentioned in other comments, 18 rating is completely unreasonable. There is nothing to offend. If you need a good anthology of horror, watch movies Asylum or Creepshow.
