Some directors take 2 and a half hours to tell a story, David Lynch needs 2 and a half hours to put together scenes with “clues” and his trademark oddity, but the story never happens. No plot. No progression of characters (if you do not find the detected error "progression"). It amazes me how someone might call Lynch's rubbish "art", but if beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, so be it. Lynch's work in film and television in the 1980s looked like “avant-garde” and “alternative.” After 20 years of work, such as Mulholland Drive, begins with a 2.5-hour piece of masturbation by David Lynch. This confuses. I finally saw the movie, which ranks my first place as the worst ever existed. At least, the people releasing “Godzilla” and “Rodan” did not pass them off as “art”.
