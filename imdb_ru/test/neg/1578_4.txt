Starting to watch reruns of old Colombo films, I thought that they would all get about the same voice from me (6). But apparently, I'm starting to see the differences in the films. This happened in some previous episodes, in which quite a brilliant direction was shown, and in this episode, but negatively. <br /> <br /> The film was so boring that I sometimes found myself busy at the peak of the newspaper instead of watching it (never happened during the Colombo movie before!), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away. The direction seems too pretentious. Scenes with a “so mature” girlfriend are not the place. In general, the line and the plot is weaker than in the middle episode. Then the scene where they discussed whether the trumpeter (who was falsely accused of murder) should be fired is pure horror, really stupid. <br /> <br /> However, some “applause” should be given to “foreplay”. In this episode, much attention is paid to how the killer is trying to protect his alibi and hide evidence, etc. I really liked it. But, alas, I do not focus on how Colombo reveals all this. And the “proof” that Colombo won in the end is the most stupid in history. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 to 5
