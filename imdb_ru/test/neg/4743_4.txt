When I saw “Alien vs. Predator” a few years ago, I have to say that it was stupid, like a sequel, but it was still pretty nice. Unfortunately, lately there are not enough good films in the theater, so my boyfriend and I decided to just see what AVPR is: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem. So, we saw it a couple of nights ago, and I must say that there was absolutely nothing exciting about this horror sequel. It took a completely different turn from the first AVP movie, it’s not a bad idea that they took Alien and Predator and placed them in the upper class suburbs, but from the idea of ​​the first one explaining the reasons for their existence, it was just a mean and predictable continuation of the horror. Not to mention the story, which continues to introduce new characters in each scene, where I was not sure who to remember, who was the main character and why, so I could not keep up with the story. <br /> <br /> From what I have gathered, of course, the Predator and the Alien are in space, dealing with the things of the typical neighbors in the neighborhood, they just turn off the light from each other and decide why not? Come on, take it on some earthlings. Thus, they collapse, and Alien captures the utopia of the suburb. But adolescents, including a restless couple, similar to Ken and Barbie, the marines and her daughter, among others, will surely do some cosmic ass, that is, if the predator does not get there first. Because he is angry at Alien, I believe that he started a party without him, lol, just kidding, actually for killing some of his friends. <br /> <br /> AVPR: Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem is not the worst movie by any measure, it's still pretty cool, with lots of visual effects, and the fighting episodes between Alien and Predator are so cool to watch. As in the first sequel of the film Alien vs. Predator, the cast is what destroys the film, and it seems that they are not very well developed, I know that it's terrible, but in the original films Alien and Predator were characters that you cared for and wanted to win. But it was a decent sequel, which, I would say, is worth a look to have fun, especially for Ken and Barbie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
