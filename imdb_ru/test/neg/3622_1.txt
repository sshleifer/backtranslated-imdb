Zoe 101 is such a stupid show. I donâ€™t know if this is because bully Jamie Lynn Spears is a ghostly star or something like that, but I just know that the show is crap. About the girl and her brother who go to boarding school. The jokes on this show are extremely boring and unfamiliar, and I hate every character except Chase and Lola. Damn, the jokes on this show are so unfamiliar that they make Jack Black look like Monty Python. This show is without a doubt one of the worst shows on Nickelodeon, it is right there with Avatar and Danny Phantom in a pit of shame, if this show were a man with some honor, it would hang in disgrace. <br /> <br /> 1/10
