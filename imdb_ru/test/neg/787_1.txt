This is my first review on IMDb.com and, perhaps, the first ever written review about a film I made at my own request — not for some class assignment. I think this fact alone says something about this film ... not a good thing! I am not an experienced journalist or critic (although I have seen my large share of films), but I found that this particular film was so terribly painful to watch that my own peace of mind needed to be expressed about this experience. Where better to do this than IMDb? When I forced myself to watch the movie, physically writhing from the inability to connect the dots, I was sure that at the end of the tunnel there would be some kind of “light” - a revelation explaining what was in it. was happening. The film ended, and I was as enlightened as a dog ****. After several rewinds to view certain scenes, I still could not do anything sensible. I caught myself wanting to shout "Does it make sense to anyone?" I would recommend not to waste your time, but on the other hand, if I were you, I would probably like to try it myself. If so, bring a crossword puzzle or something else so as not to get bored.
