Was it really necessary to include awkward shots of non-participants in a documentary? And why all the scenes with stupid dogs, and then the repetition of all the same scenes with stupid dogs? This film begins with a big promise - to expose the international politics and wine business. It all started well and included all the right characters. But the production is a mess. Points began and developed most of the way, then never ended or remained with hanging ends. Very bad and disorienting camera work and editing. They were supposed to use subtitles for the British mutter from Christie's. <br /> <br /> Too much fluff and not enough facts for a documentary. <br /> <br /> This is probably celebrated in Cannes because of the beating of the USA (although in my opinion this was too little). <br /> <br /> We left at around 2:00 - I have no idea how long it lasted.
