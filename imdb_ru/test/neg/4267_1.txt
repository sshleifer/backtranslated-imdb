I find criticism of many IMDb users a bit harsh and in many cases discover that they criticize the film from a very professional point of view, and not with a guy on the street who wants to sit and watch something, just to get away from it all. <br /> <br /> In this case, however, I must say that it was bad. I am a SciFi addict, and in this film ANYTHING was not enough even for one second. <br /> <br /> There was no correct storyline. I may be an idiot, but I still do not know where the GOVERNMENT was, who was so worried about these parts. <br /> <br /> The miserable attempt of the main character to assemble these three parts is terrible. Half the time, the two parts were already in place, and he just had to add a third. A 3-year-old child could bring them together. <br /> <br /> This movie was BAD. <br /> <br /> Dominic
