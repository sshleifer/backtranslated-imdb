Steven Seagal made some horrible films, but this is probably one of the best since his career dived about ten years ago. The cast is better than usual, and although the plot and plot is a complete joke, at least most of the action films look pretty good. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably one of the worst in cinema history. Is someone executed because he stole some money? What types of mercenaries kidnap a Supreme Court judge? Their goal is to exchange the judge for a prisoner so that they can find out where his money is? Meanwhile, the execution chamber is full of hatches and raised floors and looks like a set of one of the circus performances of Cirque Du Soleil. <br /> <br /> Then the problem of prison arises. Here the Warden is a homie played by Tony Plana. All prisoners have their bandit colors and signs, and the guards are there to serve food and keep the prison clean. Nothing like a group of prisoners who fight and beat up some of the guards, until the superintendent. What goes? The guardian gives them a rigorous conversation. He can punish them next time. <br /> <br /> There are many moments in this film that are good for laughing. However, Nia Peeples looks pretty good, and Ja Rule is trying to become an action hero. It is very fun to watch how all the prisoners are “doing the right thing” and are arming themselves in order to free the Supreme Court judge from her captors. No matter how bad Half Past Dead can be, keep in mind that this is easily the best movie Stephen Seagal has starred in since 1992 in Under Siege.
