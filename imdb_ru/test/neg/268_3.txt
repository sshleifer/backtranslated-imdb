When watching this movie, a few words come to mind: “sophomore”, “funny”, “incredible”, “indulging” and, finally (deadly), “boring”. Poorly directed, poorly photographed and poorly played, the film is a tangled mess with subject lines (if you can call it that), curving in all directions. Someone may have used the thumbnail of a five year old child as a template. As a punishment for this child crime in the film, this lineup of “stars” should be slapped and sent to their respective beds without dinner. In general, it seems that George needed a reason to get together with his little buddies for a paid summer vacation, and we pay for it. Bad George! Bad!
