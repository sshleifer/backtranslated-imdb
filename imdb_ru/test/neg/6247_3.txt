Hmmmm - slaughter of fans. Let me think - high school girls are getting bored, except that sweetie survives. Got it. Next movie <br /> <br /> I was surprised that this film was shot in 2003. I really thought they stopped making these films in the 80s. This was truly your film about a mill slasher with teenage candies, stupid males, even stupid adult males and a hot teacher. This continues on a list of dark and stormy nights and an abandoned hut in the forest. We have already seen it all before. <br /> <br /> However, this one has some interesting plot twists that place it over ordinary slashers, so if you have several brain cells to fry and 2 hours to kill, you can make it worse.
