“Disappointment” is the best word I can think of for this film, especially given the brilliant reviews that it receives from some other users. <br /> <br /> One thing that really spoils the film is that it is shamelessly partial (in both senses of the word). Not only does he provide a very selective description of the games (focusing on the US athletic team), but also contains several inaccuracies, most of which serve to exaggerate the difficulties the American team has encountered. <br /> <br /> What is even more disturbing is that all omissions and errors (?) seem to glorify the sportsmanship of the United States, excluding other athletes (with some notable exceptions). For example, the viewer believes that the United States won most of the medals at the Games, whereas in fact they won only one of four gold medals and one of six. Similarly, many athletes are portrayed as caricatures of their fellow countrymen (so we have an arrogant Briton and a wine Frenchman). This attitude serves very little to the Olympic ideals that the film should celebrate. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I believe that this film will appeal to the part of the American audience that is looking for a quick boost. national self-esteem. Those who are looking for a detailed and historically correct description of the games are recommended to look elsewhere.
