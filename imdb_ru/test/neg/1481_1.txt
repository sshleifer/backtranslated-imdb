Classic trash! In fact, we have a story about a couple of American teenagers (one man, one woman and, of course, beautiful people) who seem mentally connected: every time they both fall asleep, they can populate each other’s dreams and express each other’s innermost desires ... think that Mills & Boon meets secret materials and you are somewhere nearby. In fact, it’s more like a miserable hybrid between one of Ed Wood’s famous bad B-films and a particularly stupid episode with Melrose Place, which are so tasteless and special effects that are so unprofessional. The actors who inhabit (I would not say, star in this) this film say that their lines are as if they are reading from a cue card and sulk when they have to show emotions, and this is not a big shock (or loss for industry) that they have since disappeared into obscurity. All this is just a ridiculous mix of styles that do not fit together at all, and the end result is an intriguing curiosity that will no doubt be bought up by suppliers of such bad, good films in years to come. I’ll probably be the only person who has ever commented on this film, but if you read and see it, please come back, it’s kind of lonely here ...
