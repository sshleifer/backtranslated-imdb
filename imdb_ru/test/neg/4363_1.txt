<br /> <br /> This movie sucks! The first was much better. None of the first to return to this stupid sequel, and in a sense, this is good because of a bad game, but the characters in this film are not even better. Kill in the forest? Come on! Give me a break! I’m surprised that Kiljoy’s friend, Blair the Witch, didn’t show up to appear in a cameo. Bad game, bad story and just stupid and boring. Do not waste your time!
