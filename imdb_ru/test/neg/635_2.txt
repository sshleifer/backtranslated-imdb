Watching ALIEN EXPRESS inspired feelings of fear, shock, pity and, of course, horror. To think that actors who have done a good job in the past should come up with something like this. Horror, horror. <br /> <br /> Tell me if this sounds familiar. <br /> <br /> A train specially created for the political campaign is going to Las Vegas for a large rally. for the candidate - a Texas senator (Barry Corbin, the only actor with the roles of “Alien Express” and “No Country for Older Men” in the same decade). At a railroad crossing in Utah, a meteorite burns a car waiting for a train to pass. <br /> <br /> The train stops. Local law enforcement agencies are called. Oh, can it be? The senator has a beautiful young lady (Amy Lokane of CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE), who once accidentally married one of the officers who answered the 911 call. Lou Diamond Phillips (“STAND AND DELIVERY”, LA BAMBA) - ex-husband. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the aliens managed to remove the train. <br /> <br /> The train is leaving. Lou makes his friend fly a helicopter so that Lou can take a moving train (about 70 miles per hour) to save the day. As a reward of a friend, he crashes a helicopter into the mountain. <br /> <br /> This is another example of how poorly written "FOREIGN EXPRESS." The police cop assistant must die, we all know that. But he must die near the end of the third act, usually saving several lives. <br /> <br /> On the train, Lou manages to lose his shirt so that he can send Bruce Willis to DIE HARD, putting on his wife to beat his T-shirt. Yes, Lou is 46 years old, but he goes to the gym. You don’t have to worry about the role he plays, but he’s in good shape. <br /> <br /> The senator will have joy after dinner with Miss Utah, but the aliens will stand up, and he and the woman are young enough to be his granddaughter, pay the highest price. <br /> <br /> Soon we have bomb bombs, alien multipliers, and, of course, the train gets out of control and accelerates to its date with fate, while Lou and Todd Bridges (DIFF'RENT WALKS) try to save as many lives as possible. <br /> <br /> There is exactly one surprise in the whole film. At the beginning of the story, the couple raises their glasses for the thirty-fifth, hoping thirty-five more years together. The dude gets hit, but he and Mrs both live. Maybe the writers just lost sight of them. <br /> <br /> This is the movie you would like to see on the wall. Those actors who have done a better job (and, indeed, deserve much more than that) are probably just happy for the work. Did they really think they were working on something worthwhile, or were they crying (and / or drinking) to sleep at night? At the end of the story (quite a lot, considering all the circumstances), the survivors gather in the last carriage of the train, which is disengaged. Other cars pass over the cliff, but the one in which the main characters are located stops a few inches from the cliff. <br /> <br /> Lou and his ex were reunited. Happiness reigns supreme. I would have thought that first of all they would get off the train so that they would have solid ground under their feet, but I am retreating. <br /> <br /> Someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star. Look, make a wish. Then another. Then more and more. The earth is bombarded by meteors that will open, and eerie puppets with crawling hands with large teeth will be everywhere. <br /> <br /> It got to the point that after seeing the words “Science Fiction Channel” the “Original” film tells us that we will be glad that we have Ti-Vo so that we can rewind forward over the next two hours. Or, better yet, just go ahead and erase it for two minutes in the story and spend the time more wisely.
