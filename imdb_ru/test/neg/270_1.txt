I did not expect much when I went out to see it, but, my God, what a disappointment. The original was quite funny in its genre, but it was so bad that I felt offended when I left the theater. There is no plot, it is not funny, it is not pleasant to watch, it is directly embarrassing. An hour later, I hoped that my patience would be rewarded, but now I regret that I did not leave the theater. Do yourself a favor and ignore it, look at it when it comes to the small screen. Or look at the budget DVD, whatever you do, do not spend money on it. Do not say that I did not warn you.
