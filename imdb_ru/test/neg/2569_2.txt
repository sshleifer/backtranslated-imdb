Wow, I haven't seen such a bad movie since Fire Down Below. Wait, this is also a film about Seagal. Like On Deadly Land and Fire Down, Seagal focuses the film around its environmental awareness message and how the military, the FBI and the CIA are incompetent idiots. The problem is that both reality and sensible conspiracy are secondary to any social commentary that Seagal is trying to convey.
