Okay, from the point of view of an American who, I believe, is not very good at rugby, it would be an amazing film for them. First of all, he has a heart, a good moral, a typical good coach trying to change a bad guy. HOWEVER for us, where I come from rugby, this is sport number one, this is lifestyle, this is a game that only the bravest play, and the winners are welcomed as heroes, as if the Americans were playing as their baseball / basketball stars. I'm not quite sure if it was a cheap budget or maybe the director or actors knew very little about rugby and, being a rugby fan, I can see that some of the actors didn’t even know that rugby existed before he started star in this movie. To summarize, this film was terrible to me. If you watch this and think it was great, please take time to get online, and perhaps Google “All Blacks” is the national team of New Zealand and those who made the hack famous. Believe me, they will make the boys from the Highlands look like schoolgirls.
