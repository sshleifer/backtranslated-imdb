Kevin Spacey, without a doubt, one of the best actors of the 90s. After his speeches in the “Normal Suspect”, “Se7en” and “American Beauty”, you expect more and more from him. That is why the “Ordinary decent criminal” is a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> Michael Lynch is the most cunning criminal in Dublin who never has a bad mood. His next robbery becomes an obsession when his partners begin to doubt Michael’s ability to plan everything perfectly, although this is the only thing he does when he doesn’t play a good father at home. <br /> <br /> I think this is partly my fault that I did not pay enough attention to the thousands of scenes, which, unfortunately, are the “essence” of the film. I gave the film a chance, calling it a parody and ... well, the parodies are always funny, no matter what they cheat or how they do it. So it was not a complete parody on purpose. It's just another scam movie that is desperately trying to be funny and fails. <br /> <br /> Unlike some of their “colleagues”, “Ordinary decent criminal” too much depends on the development of the plot and logical sequence, forgetting about the main reason, the viewer chose this film - to entertain. This is definitely not entertainment. It includes one of the most ridiculous scenes in the entire history - the representation of Michael's two wives. I do not know, some meaningless metaphor or strange, dark humor, but the chicks are sisters. Remember that the character Spacey has children. <br /> <br /> The usual decent criminal is complicated and confused. You do not expect a funny scene. Instead, you are closely following the dialogue, because there is a high probability of losing yourself in the boring, pale universe in which the film lives. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to Spacey. I wonder what state he subscribed to this film? This is not a mistake, but something much worse. Insulting his work at American Beauty, released a year before Ordinary Decent Criminal. The character Michael is eccentric and talkative. Spacey is sometimes almost pitiful. The only cure for this is to think of Lester Burnham and Roger Quinte. <br /> <br /> The writer, Gerrard Stembridge, should certainly re-examine his writing skills and be more objective this time. Because the dialogue is very weak, and the scenes are often meaningless. And we are still talking about comedy. <br /> <br /> “An ordinary decent criminal” is a really bad criminal comedy that doesn’t deserve your attention.
