God, it sucks. You canâ€™t finish a horror movie in a family setting. Yeash. I was a little ambivalent, entering the final act. But oh my goodness He did not need to kill the girl, she did not die, the ghost father appears with medicine (which does not make sense because his spirit would be released after the Yankees killed all the bad werewolves). What a piece of junk. This is the worst horror movie I've seen in a long time, and I watched a lot of horror movies. This is a slap in the face of Landis and everyone else who participates in the American werewolf in London. Blegh. I hope this ruined everyone's career in this bar of Julie Delphi. And CGI: the look of the new and chic in 1997, but today it looks bleakly compared to the skillful work of prosthetics and makeup in London. Anyway, I did, I hope that scared a few people. Take the original instead or fail this howl. Or by failing this watch, American Idol is re-launched. Just don't watch this mess.
