I was so looking forward to it when he was in production. But he turned out to be the biggest disappointment. Far from the bizarre world of Dr. Suze. It was vulgar and unpleasant, I don't think Dr. Seuss would have approved of it. How the Grinch stole Christmas, it was much better. I understand that there were some subtle adult jokes in it, but my children still did not understand. Considering that “The Cat in the Hat” screamed vulgarity, they caught much more than I would have liked. Grow with Dr. Seuss I was very worried about how this timeless classic was broken on the big screen. Who. I hope this does Dr. Seuss a little justice.
