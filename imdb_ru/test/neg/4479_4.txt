The only thing that is romantic in this film is the pain and suffering of romance. If you expect this cinematic adaptation of another novel by Nicholas Sparks to follow the unmistakable formula of previous films, such as Message in a Bottle, Nights in Rodanthe and Walk to Remember, think again. No one dies from an accident trying to save someone else, and romance here does not transform these characters. In any case, it makes them even more unhappy than they were. <br /> <br /> Silent sergeant of special forces army John Tyree (Channing Tatum from “Joe Joe”) experiences unforgettable two-week throws, while on vacation from the military with an impressive college student, Savannah Curtis (radiant Amanda Seyfrend from "Mamma Mia") that spends spring break in South Carolina. Savannah does not drink, smokes, but she tells John that her head is filled with profanity. Inevitably, John and Savannah fall madly in love with each other and begin an endless exchange of letters of love letters that cause sleep in all respects. Tyree leaves for the world, serving as a military in some godforsaken corner of the globe while she is in college, looking through his letters in class. As soon as it gets hot and hard between them, suicide bombers crash airplanes into the World Trade Center. John is chatting with his friends on a wave of patriotism, without discussing this option with Savannah. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, another guy, a shaggy but pleasant friend of the family Tim (Henry Thomas of ET: Alien), in which an autistic child without a mother named Alan becomes an object of the savanna feelings. She is one of those girls who help build homes for the less fortunate and want to organize a summer ranch for children with autism. She puts aside what seems forever before she finally contacts Tyree with the letter of the same name. Indeed, she throws him for a man with a disease! She later confesses to John that she knew that the sound of his voice would violate her determination to marry Tim, so she does not make this fatal challenge. As expected, John is suffering because of the lack of communication in Savannah. During a normal mission, our hero takes a couple of terrorist bullets in the back and ends up in Germany. While all this is happening, Tyree is trying to negotiate with his own father, collecting coins, Mr. Tyree (Richard Jenkins of The Step-Brothers), who suffers from Asperger's Syndrome. It seems that his father is on his last legs after John leaves the hospital. The main character lacks respect, and her betrayal of Tyree comes down to a rather weak blow. Tyree, his father and Tyree's commander, Keith Robinson, are the only sympathetic characters in this long-distance epistolary novel. <br /> <br /> “Dear John” attaches new meaning to lethargic love stories. Ugh!
