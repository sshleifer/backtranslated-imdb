Both Killjoy 1 and Killjoy 2 are smelly, but the first one was better. The special effects in this film were not at all special. Despite the fact that the killings were more successful in this part, they had nothing to brag about. The second part was worse characters. They suddenly changed their emotions, and some of their lines were just dull. For example, one character quoted: “You'd better have a little R.E.S.P.E.C.T., or you will know what it means to me.” As soon as I heard this line, I realized that this is the worst thing I've ever heard. Another thing I hated about this film was that it was too short. A successful film should last more than one hour and twenty minutes, as in Killjoy 2. If Full Moon does the 3rd part of the Killjoy film, it will go down to the lowest level they can reach. Only 1 out of 10. <br /> <br />
