I seriously broke with this purchase. Other posters are pretty good at highlighting the flaws of this poor bad movie. On my DVD, which I bought, there was a poster on the cover with the words “1978 Piranha” with titles for the film “Director Joe Dante”, etc. I am actually a fan of many bad films. In most of them, there is always something funny, or at least funny. NOT this movie! In fact, I'm going to spend three dollars on petrol money to get this two-dollar DVD back on the principle. Brazen fake packaging here. Easily the worst movie of all time. No buying factors at all. Boring !!! Don't even check, just to see how bad it is. Seriously.
