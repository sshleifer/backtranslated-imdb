Really! Here, the French cinema reaches the bottom, and, compared to it, the least attractive of American horror films for teenagers, such as Friday the Thirteenth, Freddie and others, are masterpieces of the seventh art. <br /> This is all the more frustrating because there were exciting original elements: forêt de Brocéliande and his legends, the Druids and King Arthur, were all great assets for a fantasy fantasy and horror movie. Alas! Filmed as aptly pointed out by a user in a fake forest not far from Paris, the film is fake horror, fake Celtic history, fake remnants - you should see the professor (Wilms, who was a wonderful M. Le Cesna in La Vie EST UN). Run for a long time, calm down) the cry of "priceless scrap" - which was probably bought in the store for ten cents - fake characters, false excavations ... <br /> <br /> The boys disguised as druids are inadvertently very funny; girls who seem to be experts in martial arts. And what can we say about professors? monster? A ten-year-old would have written a better script than this grotesque farce. To think that people can spend money on such nonsense when artists are still waiting for a producer! <br /> <br /> Word to the wise: Maurice Leblanc wrote an amazing story about druids and old ceremonies in his Arsen Lupine saga called “l'île aux trente cercueils”. The miniseries was made 30 years ago. Avoid this "Broceliande" trash and try to see it instead.
