I just watched the descent. God, what a horrible movie. Immediately, they show a lava geyser, and the note states that it is located many miles below the surface of Washington State. People, in the depths of the Earth there are no such geysers. They thought it looked neat, and in typical Hollywood style they threw it. And then there is the well that spewed lava. He threw a stone, and I heard a splash. Steam could have escaped from this long before a lava explosion could have occurred. <br /> <br /> And the game was pretty bad. Michael Dorn sank to a new low in the workplace. <br /> <br /> What a dog from the movie. I can argue that the vote is no higher than 3.5 <br /> <br /> It does not seem that the SciFi Channel has spent too much time, except that the pretty boy Perry tried to make a draw.
