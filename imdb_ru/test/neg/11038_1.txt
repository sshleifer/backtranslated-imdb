Let me get this out of the way before I ruin this movie: I like the work of Pak Chan-Wook as a director. Although I do not agree with the opinion of the masses that he is the best director working in our time, I cannot deny that he understands how to use the camera very effectively. I really liked one of his other films, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. In addition, the Min-Sik Choi acting was the only one that allowed me to take this film seriously. for 1/5 of the execution time, that is. <br /> <br /> Now it's bad: the plot is simply the oldest cliche used in film / literature. I will never understand how critics can spoil a Hollywood blockbuster because it is cliché, and then greet films like Oldboy that are just as unoriginal and clichéd, if not more so. Despite this, Oldboy is one of the most common, non-original films ever conceived. * Spoilers * The man is in captivity, the man is looking for revenge, the man finds out that he had sex with a family member, the man’s life is over. * End Spoilers * Simply put, this storyline was used in everything: from Greek plays to modern melodramatic series and countless films / books between them. It is so melodramatic and unoriginal when the main disclosure takes place, I laughed out loud. Does this mean that I am a reckless freak with no emotions, as some reviews of this film say about people like me? Not. What this means is overdone by conspiracies that make people laugh. The Scary Movie franchise proved it, and Oldboy, too. Why can't people think of something that really bothers, instead of just spewing proven cliches disguised with fancy camera work and classical music? This raises the issue of blood / blood. Simply put, he is not there. The director is too timid to even direct the camera to the screen when something “bloody” happens, as if we were watching a children's film or something like that. Maybe we were. Anyway, I heard that Oldboy called “the most violent film of all time” and “the most exciting film in the whole history”, but when I watched it, I did not see ANYTHING, even remotely horrible or disturbing. All this "dirt" behind the scenes, and even then the level of violence is something that you have never seen in PG-13 films, such as The Dark Knight or Casino Royale. Why this rating has received even R, confuses me, and even more so "the most brutal film of all time." Seriously, I've seen movies that just make Oldboy look cute on every level when it comes to violence / bloodshed. <br /> <br /> Another huge blatant, stupid flaw - the main villain. Most of his screen time, he demonstrates his comedy ass to the public in the style of an American comedic pie, but should I think that he is so evil? When he wears clothes, his hair folds back, like a bad Asian mixture of the cutest villain James Bond mixed with something from Austin Powers. He speaks like a sober brain recovering from an acid overdose, and his dialogue is so bad that I laughed again. Seriously, Oldboy made me laugh more than any comedy this year. . <br /> <br /> In the end, Oldboy - for those of you who drink good wine, doesn’t have a sense of humor and talk about how boring your life is at dinner parties. This is for those people who are so stuck in their own ego that they forget how unoriginal they are, and therefore forget how unoriginal and boring those “films” (and not “films”) that they like. <br /> <br /> These people can only say one thing: I like “movies” as well as “movies”. I like thoughtful dramas that really say something about the human condition, and I also like senseless action films that make me coma. But in order for me to like “movies” and “films”, they must be original. They must be something that I have not seen so many times that I lost count of how many times the plot was used. When something is not original, it is consumable. If he does exactly what everyone else does, it is forgotten and boring. Before giving Oldboy one more excellent rating, because he “touched” you, maybe you should think about something: will not the film be so touching, but at the same time original, make you think more? I would just like someone other than me to understand this. <br /> <br /> In general: Oldboy is forgetful and shoddy. <br /> <br /> 1/10
