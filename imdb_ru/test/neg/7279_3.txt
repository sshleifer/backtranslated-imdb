This film was recommended to me by several people, and after reading all the positive comments from this site, I went further and bought a copy of the film on eBay. The acting in the film is average and a bit boorish, especially in the cannibal family, one of the scenes comes to mind when Jupiter rants and goes crazy with a burned corpse, speaking directly into the camera. This is one of those performances where you just cringe and feel bad because of this poor actor. This is also evidence of the worst editing I've ever seen, and this is a terrible leap right in the middle of his “speech”. Although there are some terrible moments, and from time to time the music works well ... but overall the film is not so good, and I don’t know why people think that Wes Craven is such a great director. So far, he has not shown me anything that I consider brilliant, the only thing that has improved with Cravens films, from production to production, is his budget.
