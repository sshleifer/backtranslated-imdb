Oh, damn it, where do I start ... First of all; This show is just another stupid American not funny so-called comedy that has a pitiful game and very very bad humor. The American way of laughing makes it all the worse. Why can I hear laughter, but nothing funny is happening? Pretty silly, huh? This show is intended only for those Americans who have never heard that there are much more funny, better and witty comedies - not only in Great Britain, but also in America (for example, The Simpsons). I simply cannot understand what is so good about the Rebbe that it lasted for a long time on television. There is nothing new in it, it underestimates (possible) viewers in many ways, and this is not at all ridiculous. I could live with the fact that there are such bad shows as Reba, but what the hell were they supposed to run it here in Finland. If I see a few seconds of this terrible show, the rest of the day is ruined for me. Take my word for it and believe me - this show sucks, even more than similar American comedies usually do. That's just terrible. Do yourself a favor; never watch this world of shit. <br /> <br /> Well, I leave a comment for those who are now the best language. Thank you for your (possible) interest.
