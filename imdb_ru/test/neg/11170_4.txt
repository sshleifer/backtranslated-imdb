In the brutal, quasi-black comedy of Robert Aldrich “Brig Grissom”, remade in the British film of 1948 “There are no orchids for Miss Blandish,” the heiress of Kim Darby of the 1920s was stolen by a bunch of clumsy thieves; Soon, this gang is sent, and poor Kim then falls into the clutches of another crooked group — third-grade gangster brothers with sweaty, painful faces and a mother like Buddy Ebsen into a drag. At first, Darby (not very brave and not very smart) tries to escape from this slobbering brood, but they are at her. In the end, it just stops trying, and therein lies the problem with the story. Should we in the audience sympathize with her? Should her growing concern about the family imbalance be spiritual? These are disgusting, impudent characters, and I wanted to see them as little as possible. But since the side stories (the work of the police in the case and the other, in which the tireless singer Connie Stevens participates) are quite boring, the director has no choice but to impose these sweaty faces on us. Pretty soon the nervous Darby starts to sweat too, although her scene in the hayloft is sensitively performed, and the climatic moments of Aldrich make you wonder if they are not organized. ** from ****
