It opens - and for half an hour - as an educational program under the Old Testament, although not without humor. The film finally begins to grow its wings when the biblical slope does not fall. In a scene with mixed success, Martin Donovan (Jesus) decides not to start the Apocalypse, and for the last quarter of an hour is a kind of humanist, “what is all this fuss about?” long shot twin towers of the WTC. <br /> <br /> In addition to the authority of Donovan, acting is divided. There is a plot melodrama for the rest of the cast: although it was formally invented for a biblical performance, it is suitable for the modern paranoid comedy Hartley is aiming at. But I was also pleasantly surprised by PJ Harvey's contribution (credited this way, and in danger of being in the film solely as a pop star, like her, not least in the script scene in the record store and the dangerously spotted soundtrack to what contributes). She remained calm — something like a disingenuous lack of focus — like many of the pop icons that starred in the film (I think this is a Jagger performance), but nonetheless supported persuasive integration with actors and projects. <Br /> <br /> In the end, an affirmative, but this bitter-sweet essay is too much like one and relies more on perseverance than on the imagination of the audience. 4/10
