It is important to remember the real meaning of the phrase “Inspired by Real Story” when viewing the Pride. This is something like "You can save up to 50%," which literally can be translated as "You can not save more than 50%." It all sounds great, until you realize that the bottom of the word “before” is “zero”. In the same way, “inspired by the real story” means that someone heard the story, and it made them think about it. The only certainty is that the real story and the one you are about to see are not the same thing. <br /> <br /> There is a real Jim Ellis who started coaching a swimming team in the Philadelphia rest department in the early 1970s, but I have a feeling that the real Jim Ellis must have been unable to hide some frustration in how the movie turned out. It is clear that wild liberties are needed with his life story, and I just imagine how he reacts to the strange looks of his friends, who wonder why the film is so different from the person they know. <br /> <br /> In any case, one thing that he will certainly be proud of is that he is portrayed by Terrence Howard, one of our best actors, who starred with Bernie Mac, who, despite in the absence of an original and powerful story, still gives a soulful and moving performance. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in the 1970s in Philadelphia, the time and place where racism was the norm, not the exception, and the educated and professional Jim Ellis, who is also an experienced swimmer, is having trouble finding teaching position until finally transferred to the crumbling recreation center, which he was instructed to clean up before his demolition. We can certainly understand his sense of humiliation. <br /> <br /> When we first meet Elston, a maintenance technician (Bernie Mac), he is a disappointed grumbler who sits in his office surrounded by piles of garbage that touch the ceiling and watches daytime television on an old, dusty old one television. It goes without saying that when Jim arrives to begin cleaning up and cleaning up this place, Elston is not exactly friendly with him. He knew that his recording center was closed, and all his anger about it rather smoothly shifted to Jim. <br /> <br /> Given his past as a swimmer in college, Jim takes a special interest in the pool, which he cleans, fills and puts in great shape. A group of black teens who play basketball near the recreation center are interested in the pool, when their basketball rim is removed and the heat remains suffocating, and soon the group has a developing swimming team, which they introduce to the citywide district. swim, meet. Calling them weak, of course, would be an understatement. They are unorganized, unprofessional, insufficiently trained and do not know how to behave in swimming competitions. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter, of course. This film is your standard sports story about losers, so the first sports trip is completely unimportant, like anything other than a learning experience, a catalyst that contributes to their more complex and much more focused training, which will lead to the final sports walk that matters. So far, the only thing that is in the sports film is that the main characters should not win at the climax of the film, we just need to understand the meaning and significance of their efforts. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film tells about the character development of the old Seagal film. The good guys are the good guys, because they just have to be, and the bad guys are nasty white swimmers who laugh and mock and mock the racists in our team. Oh, and there's one scene where one of the white guys kicks one of the black guys under the water when he's in the middle of a race. I did not know that it was really possible to hit someone like that underwater, but you understand how deep the character’s development is. <br /> <br /> We understand that this is a group of children that Jim Ellis has transformed from children hanging out on the streets, who don’t do anything with their lives, and from an organized and competitive swim team, but we don’t know anything about who they are. <br /> <br /> But the biggest problem is that the only real statement the film makes is that effort and organization lead to success, and racism is bad. Both are so obvious that when a film is shot only with them, it becomes empty and unnecessary. Racism was so strong in America in the 1970s that it seems like a huge loss that the film was directly related to this problem, but did not say anything about it. It's like a good movie, but when it's all over, and you realize that what he had to say is much more than what was said, the feeling of well-being turns into sad disappointment.
