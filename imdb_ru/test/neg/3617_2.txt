Do not waste your time. One of those cool looking boxes that you pick up at Blockbuster for a guess, but not even worth it. You will NOT say, "This is so bad, this is good." Just "This is bad." The greatest American hero is a writer who rents a house on an African island called Snake Island. Some other tourists are on a boat that will drop him, but they do not stop at the island. They just stop to let the writer go. Then the boat is there, and - in true Hollywood originality - the only radio on the island is broken. So they start walking and see a bunch of snakes. Like hundreds of them that really became annoying, and you knew that the conspiracy was not going anywhere. Itâ€™s not that ONE was ever the main snake. Like a giant mutated snake or a very poisonous king of all snakes. Instead, there is just a bunch of ham snakes of all breeds. So their only goal was to flee the island ... instead of defeating the enemy. Because there were so many snakes, you knew that they could not try to kill them all, and they did not try. I saw a similar film where snakes chased the city, and they bring all the snakes into a cave and then blow it up. At least then you get the feeling that the good guys killed the bad guys, and that was a normal ending. On Snake Island (by the way, every character was shocked to see a snake on the Island ... yes, for good reason, it is the NAME of Snake Island for some reason), there was no other plan than to try to get gasoline for a stupid boat. Oh, they never get gas by the way. They "just by chance" find another boat on the island, already fueled by gas.
