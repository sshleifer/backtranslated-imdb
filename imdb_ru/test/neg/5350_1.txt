This movie supports justice! This gives freedom to the black man who killed the people who raped his daughter, and in the end he goes unpunished! However disgusting there is adultery in this film. The character Connachi has characteristics for the character of Bullock, and the film has some of those stereotypes of trial films (for example, important news brought to court at the very last moment) that make every aesthetically demanding film viewer, like me, sick! I really can't believe that anyone liked this stuff. This film is so bad and contains false ideals that I cannot express criticism eloquently. When Americans wake up and find that they are being manipulated around the clock by films like these, which turn reality into a certain BS, where justice exists for everyone, if only they take it into their own hands. This cowboy attitude just makes me sick, and in my eyes it represents everything that is wrong with America!
