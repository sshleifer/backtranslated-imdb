11:11 a.k.a. Hell's Gate (2004) is another bad horror movie that tries too hard to be what it is not. The young girl has an imaginary assistant. One day, while in the fields, playing with his friends, a couple of fugitives visit her parents and kill them for no apparent reason. A young girl runs away and hides from bad people. After years the girl grows into a woman with problems. The losers in her school (similar to repressed homosexuals) flaunt their courage in front of her when she rejects one of them. Girls hate her, and life as a whole is unhappy for her. The secret of her past comes back to visit her. Who or what is it? Why does everyone hate her? What is the problem of her keeper with her? To find out, you will need to see the "Gates of Hell." <br /> <br /> New heading makes no sense. I do not know why people are given money for such bad films. This film is not even good enough to make fun. This is a headache mess that confuses anyone who tries to figure it out. Do not waste time. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
