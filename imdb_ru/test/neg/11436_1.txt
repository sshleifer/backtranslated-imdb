I can not understand what John Voight would have thought when he was involved in this inconsistent, pretentious, mind-blowing grinding at tenth speed. He helped write the intended “script” himself, and he should be damn ashamed of it. The film (I can't call it a “film” because it barely moves) is an incoherent, embarrassingly pretentious bore — sort of like a really bad Oprah Winfrey show, but worse. It meaninglessly wanders back and forth from medieval times to modern-day Los Angeles, with Voight as a television producer who thinks he is the reincarnation of a medieval prince who must save the kingdom from the frauds of his evil brother, and somehow transferred it to modern from the time when Voit must save the country from the evil machinations of the head of an oil company. If the strange casting (Wilfrid Brimley, Frankie Valley (!), Kay Ballard and Armand Assante, among others) is not enough to kill him, a stunningly inept direction, a washed photo (it looks like it was taken from a really cheap 16 mm camera), almost a complete lack of editing (the scenes either continue indefinitely or end in the middle of a sentence), and the embarrassing, apparently, “active” flow of Vojt is enough to bury him, that exactly what should have been done with this. Awesome experience. Avoid this dog at all costs.
