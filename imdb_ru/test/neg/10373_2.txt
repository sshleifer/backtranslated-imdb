Being gay, who survived the period of time covered in this tedious documentary, I could not wait to see how this subject was dealt with. Unfortunately, the filmmakers missed something that could be an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed some light on our collective gay history. This film concerns only the period in New York, ignoring the rest of the country. Although I spent quite a lot of time in New York at the time, I can assure you that there was a fun life outside of Manhattan! The men interviewed here are the same A-List queens who thought they were better than anyone else in the 70s, and here they are again, growing nostalgic and still casting attitude. The film should at least try to cover larger themes such as race, ageism, the burgeoning gay “caste system” based on wealth, body image and clone growth, discrimination of subgroups within the community and the ability to grow decent mustaches (which It was very important in the 70s!). Alas, none of this is presented, and the memories of the respondents are no different from my own memories. If you have been there this decade, you will enjoy archival photos and grainy home movies of bars and discos that we chased. If you were not there, this film will surely seem boring. It should have been a lot more, but unfortunately it is not. Two stars for running through my memory ... I still miss the Anvil trip!
