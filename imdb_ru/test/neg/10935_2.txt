It is amazing that something like this can find its way to the general public. I knew that it was Uwe Boll, and I found him in the store for $ 2 (still pretty cool considering), but the painful curiosity made me look at it, and: <br /> <br /> 1). I am quite sure that this is the robbery of the Seven, the Silence of the Lambs and the American psychopath, all in one, with a dialogue that may have been written by the guys. <br /> <br /> 2). Casper Van Dien plays the main character, and he is so strange and creepy that almost everyone can KNOW that he must be a crazy serial killer. <br /> <br /> 3). Jennifer Rubin plays the "good cop" who invites a serial killer to her apartment for a home dinner, and what does she get for her problem? I'll let you guess. <br /> <br /> 4). Michael Pare plays an "intense" cop who drives a VW Bug, a new style, i.e. with a siren. VW Bug ... which strikes fear into the hearts of a criminal when they see what is coming. <br /> <br /> 5). Wang Ding breaks up with her fiancé, but she still has a “non-engaged” party with a “non-wedding cake”. Imagine that everyone is surprised when he appears (he was, of course, invited), and all of them are shot. <br /> <br /> 6). In fact, it should have been No. 1, in fact. The killer in this is known as the "Monkey Maker". This is, without a doubt, the stupidest killer name anyone could think of in a million years. Supposedly, this is somehow connected with the statement “I see no evil, I hear no evil, I do not speak evil”, complete with monkeys. Perhaps the monkeys also had something to do with the script. <br /> <br /> 7). Oh yes, and there is a club that Van Dien attends at the beginning of the film. Is there bad disco music, I mean, really bad, and a fenced cage in the form of a chain link in which gang members beat each other with crap with baseball bats? Here is how it looked. And, of course, this is only the tip of the iceberg, in the basement there is a really cool thing (?!), Where some dubious "actor" persuades some woman to sign a confession before they shoot her. snuff film? Not quite sure how it fits with the rest of the film, and Ball probably wasn't, either, so if he didn't worry, I wouldn't worry. <br /> <br /> An incredible part of non-entertainment that makes you feel that you are watching something from a parallel universe. The parallel universe, which is kind of like ours, but where everything is far enough away, where they seem to be wrong. You have entered the Ball Area. Get out as quickly as possible and do not look back. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
