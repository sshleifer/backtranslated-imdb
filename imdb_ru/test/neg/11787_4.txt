Irwin Allen, a former master of cinematic shlok, pulled all the stops in Voyage to the bottom of the sea. Badly aged Walter Pidzhon, who may have died when he played this role, is the commander of a nuclear submarine, which should be the size of the Empire State Building. Each room is gigantic, and some even have no ceilings. In some of these rooms you can play ball and hold the ball at the same time. The submarine called "Sea View" begins its work when all hell breaks out: the Van Allen radiation belt lights up and the sea view has to launch a rocket into the belt by a certain time, otherwise the world will go out in the flames of global warming! On the trip a lot of really awful characters, many borrowed from television. This makes them television hackers. Worst of all, probably the fact that poor Stella Stevens, Barbara Eden, being a naval secretary, squeezed herself into too tight clothes, in high heels and behaved as if she appeared on the beach. Maybe it's because Frankie Avalon is also ready for the trip. A poorly aged Joan Fontaine, almost unrecognizable here, plays as a guest at the doctor with a big bad secret, but, to tell the truth, who cares? VOYAGE is a really bad movie, obviously made for small children, but which child will sit motionless for endless shots of a miniature Seaview model moving again and again from right to left across the screen in what is obviously a studio tank? There is not a single scene where we believe that these people are actually aboard a submarine. When “Sea View” trembles, the actors rush, sometimes in opposite directions to each other. Just like in the good old series STAR TREK, when the bridge shakes. If I remember correctly, not a single fish or sea creature is visible - with the exception of the octopus, which for a moment clings to the submarine, a nod at 20,000 LEAGUE OF THE SEA. The octopus, if it was real, was probably about a foot in length, and it shows. Worse, when people stand at the glass nose of the Seaview, the ocean they are supposedly watching is obviously a close-up shot of an invisible air hose, spewing bubbles, probably shot in an aquarium. You have never seen big bubbles in your life. You might think that those bubbles alone would break the damn sub into pieces. Unfortunately, the poorly aged Peter Lorre is also ready for the trip. Toward the end, when the rocket enters the blazing belt, Lorre congratulates Pijon enthusiastically, while everyone else is waiting for their signal to start shaking hands and hugging each other in victory. Scene with one take, if I've ever seen. What an abomination It's not even good for a laugh. Stick with a quiet run.
