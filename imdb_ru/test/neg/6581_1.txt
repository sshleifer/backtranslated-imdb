I am not joking: in this film there is a scene where a tramp hits his head on the keystone of the tunnel and explodes (albeit without a fireball) into a million pieces! This made some child scream in front of me in horror! ... In a movie with a G rating! <br /> <br /> This film can convince children that Santa Claus is EVIL! His assistants are ugly, misanthropic, excessive and mean! When Santa appears (here is Satan's anagram!), All 200,000 elves begin to sing "Santa Claus is coming to town" as if it were a Druid military song. Then, in the reflection of the “Rosebud” object of this film (a ringing bell that whispers a hint at why you do not hear its ringing: “doubt .... doubt ...)), an old Saint Nick appears, looking like a stoic Donald Sutherland, his face is ablaze, like Moses from “K10C”. When we hear him speak, his thundering voice does not sound like a cheerful old elf, and is more like the voice of James Earl Jones, slowed down by about 20%. Fearfully! <br /> Syrup music is misplaced, boring and repetitive. She does not follow the emotional strands (as in the very effective account of “Titanic”). It just seems to be added at certain moments in order, giving rise to a feeling of warmth and magic. He does not move, partly because he does not match the images of the film. There are some musical train derailments (without a pun), where, out of nowhere, an eerie, symphonic score suddenly claps into a happy, childish polka about the name of a locomotive. It just makes the whole movie sound like it was thrown into production! <br /> <br /> Finally, I am Ree with some other reviewers that, well ... "dead" everything looks. Sometimes it seems a bit gloomy. The motion capture technique is good for train sequences on a roller coaster on Kings Island to look convincingly at a distance, but close, “real” actors should be used. In general, a nice candy for killing time in front of the TV, but no more here.
