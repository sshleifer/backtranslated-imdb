Let's talk about marketing. The cover of the New Twenty poster / home video broadcasts a half-naked man in Wolfe's Video. For those familiar with gay-themed movies ?? this translates the "must-see". (I liked to read one reviewer (from another site) that he was "deceived" to watch the film "Sodomite." Are you serious? The slogan itself is like the word "gay." Does the Lord give you eyes, but you can't see ?? ) At the same time, despite the number of stereotypical gay characters, no less (see Lonely gays, gays who become victims of AIDS, and same-sex gays), it’s rather a matter of long-term friendship and characters that are separated. In fact, in any case, there are other (that is what Christians complain about) heterosexual couples who have sex outside, choking! Marriage. Not to mention stabbing in the back, excessive drinking and drug use. I think this is more done for TV-Logo or Showtime than for the big screen. Of course, I loved cinema, some actors could play, and I always liked to see a large group of friends who actually behave as if they had known each other for a million years. But we saw it all before. There is nothing really "new" here. Hardly an original idea ?? therefore, returning the same “Ole:“ I have AIDS, let's deal with it ”for the good part of the film, and our friend has a serious drug problem, but let's not do it until it is too late. This is because (USA) "Queer as Folk" and "Broken Hearts Club", with respect. The film is about a group of college buddies who grew up (in size, not in their minds), who ultimately have to grow, and each of them tries his best, failing. Strange, but, as in most of these independent films, the most interesting, at least for me, was a film with a heavier plot, Ben. He stole every scene, but, again, there was nothing to take.
