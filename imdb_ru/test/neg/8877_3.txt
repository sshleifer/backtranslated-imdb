I am going to recommend putting this one in a bunch of “skip this” as well. I was a bit excited about this concept when my bride rented her, and a little more excited when I saw that Milos Foreman was directing her. Ah, well ..... <br /> <br /> The costumes were good, of course, but they were typical. There was nothing in them that would indicate that they were from elsewhere, except for the costume department of the period of any large Hollywood studio. There was no difference between Spanish, British, and French — all dressed up as if they were at the court of Versailles. For some reason, the sets did not cause the qualities of the situation — the prison did not look like a prison, the mansions did not feel like mansions, and the external scenes looked like they were being shot in the background, despite the fact that they were probably practical places. <br /> <br /> The bill was significantly less than it could be. I have been a fan of films since childhood, noticing, appreciating and collecting them, by which I mean more than John Williams. My bride is a professional composer, an award winner whose works were performed at the Lincoln Center, and a rising star in the industry. We had high hopes at the beginning of the film, and it really began well. He quickly deteriorated, and in some moments - including the place of release of prisoners - he actually reached a level of irritation. I actually reached for the console to turn down the volume. The score has never been anything more than the most obvious choice for articulating a particular tone of the scene, and has not integrated into the film’s “soul” (think of the music in Babylon and you’ll understand what I mean). He never achieved the greatness that he wanted, but then the film did not work. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem, as talented as he was, was terrible. For the first part of the film, his manners are so distracting that it takes over his work. In the second half, everything that was his character in the first half disappeared, he was replaced by a completely different set of annoying manners, and he looked like the child of love of Keith Richards and Lestat Stewart Townshend. It never occurred to me that he cared about the role (that is, the character cared about his life and actions) or that this character was painted by the authors as something more than an opportunist who for some reason rethinks and decides to adhere to his principles in the end. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman was very good, although her performance lacked shades of growing madness between her release from prison and the taking of Lorenzo’s hand at the end that I should call it a really effective performance. The character of Alicia has never been sufficiently defined to truly distinguish, and if not for the excellent makeup on her eyes and cheeks, someone who saw the beginning of the film and the end would not know that this is not the same character. The prostheses were horrible, artificial and distracting, but it does not knock Miss Portman. <br /> <br /> Stellan Skarsgård was fine, like Goya. Not an Oscar-worthy, but serviceable and generally believable. I don’t know much about Goya’s life or his deafness, but it seemed to be tied to the film as a requirement of biographical information, and not everything that was used in the film. I’m sure this has influenced Goya’s life much more than the need for an interpreter, but you’ll never know. By the way, words and sounds can be correctly interpreted only in about 30% of cases, reading lips. <br /> <br /> Don't get me on Randy Quaid. At least he was a minor character. <br /> <br /> The script reads as one of the books “choose your adventure” that I read in my childhood: after a few minutes of the film several results are possible, and none of the actions that precede them result with any certainty to how the movie actually unfolds. Ironically, the film is also predictable, especially his meager attempts to cheer up with small bits of humor. Joke about hands? Maybe it's because I draw (not very well) as a hobby and I know what PITA is to draw / draw with hands, but I saw a joke passing a mile from here, as well as a reprise in the second half. Was the child ever there for any other reason than to be accepted by Inez? With the same success could exist a line of bread crumbs. <br /> <br /> Unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> (note: this review is a copy of the answer I made in the forum thread)
