Although this film has a slow, dream-like, almost fascinating pace and an interesting, although perhaps not entirely accurate, description of the practice and personnel of the criminal investigation department of the rural French police, I believe that in the end it is impossible to recommend. I think this film is just a production piece, in order to develop an aversion to the heterosexuality of one person - the director, one can assume. Of course, human sexuality in all its forms may have its own disgusting moments, and this cannot be denied! But choosing a bad one evenly at the expense of good, as this film does at every turn, implies a distorted sensitivity at work. In short, if you like to see how homo-eroticism is disguised as compassion, and depict heterosexual lovemaking and a female figure in a disgusting and degrading light - then this film is for you. I did not, and it was not.
