Bad script? Check it out. Terrible effects? Check it out. Terrible actors? Check it out. Lame direction? Check it out. <br /> <br /> After seeing the DVD box on the blockbuster video and being a fan of the horror genre, I put my 4.28 dollars on the line and rented this “movie”. My girlfriend was not in the city, and I was bored, so late on Tuesday I decided that this would be the perfect time for me to see what, apparently, (based on the cover of the box) was a horror movie. Instead, I got the worst movie ever made. Up to this point, I have always declared Slumber Party Massacre 3 the worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those who want to watch a movie because you heard how bad it is, this is for you. If you do not want to lose $ 4.00 and 80 irreplaceable minutes of your life, stay away from this garbage. <br /> <br /> Added note: I noticed that several “actors” come here and leave comments on the bulletin board. How can you boast of being in this movie? You were all terrible. I mean really bad. If American Idol existed for actors, you would all laugh at the first few episodes. <br /> <br /> Peace. <br /> <br /> Sutter Cain
