“As long as you were” is one of the worst films we have ever seen. It fails in every way. Jeanne Tripplehorn was better (as an actress ...) at Waterworld. For comparison, this film is Dungworld. When a character stumbles once or twice in the course of a movie, it can be understood. But Jeanne's character falls, stumbles, stumbles so often that there can be a little Jerry Lewis in it. In her defense, every fall (prat?) Was probably blocked, staged and rehearsed. And rehearsed. Although this is bad enough for the film, the actors (Dylan McDermott and Jeanne Tripplehorn) seem to spend most of the plot on “smoking” or searching for a place to smoke. If the film was a diatribe due to the fact that he had no place to smoke - well, BUT, it is not. <br /> <br /> No matter how long this film goes, it is too long, 10 minutes after the opening time. /> <br /> Oh, Jeanne Tripplehorn, ALMOST acts on a public forum. You ALMOST see how it breaks life up into a character. Oh, it's almost as convincing as her scene screaming at Michael Douglas in Basic Instinct - hmm, if you think about it, not really. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that should be avoided at all costs if you don’t need a cigarette and are trapped in nicotine addicts or forced to watch Hooper (Burt Reynolds). And even then throw a coin or go to bed.
