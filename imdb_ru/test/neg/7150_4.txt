Everything that this film tried to do was done better - and great in “Run Lola Run”. Red-haired cutie, critical deadline (s), "Lover is in danger" and the message "Crime pays sometimes." BUT, unlike Lola, this is simply implausible and not very well built. This is a heavy blow, which could have worked for me if I had seen him before Lola, but in comparison with this he would fade. Yes! The falling Beetle was good! But it was the only surprise in the film. Do yourself a favor and look at the Real McCoy - (AND A REAL fashionable red head!) - in the Run Lola Run!
