Once was a great American film. Which combined the horror and comedy with equal sensations. This film showed a clever guide. Innovative special effects and excellent comedy and serious action. He was called "American werewolf in London." Sixteen years later, the long-awaited sequel was finally attached to a bulletin board outside your local theater. Of course, it would have at least some thrill of the original. Think again. “American werewolf in Paris” is an incomprehensible mess from the beginning to the pitiful end. Problems begin with a leading person. The work of Tom Everett Scott is tough and tedious. From the very beginning, he seems intent on proving that all young people are prostitutes. In his defense, even an experienced Shakespearean pianist could not have achieved good results from juvenile and insane dialogue. At some point, one of Scott's dead friends, whose soul is doomed to walk the Earth after one of the werewolves has been divided, can finally go to the afterlife. Then he jokes over Scott and his friends. “Okay, guys, see you. What an unforgettable goodbye. Julie Delphi soon appears as Scott's enigmatic European love interest. In fact, she is a French girl playing a French girl. It is not so difficult. But all this nonsense is not even the most disappointing thing in the film. The special effects, such an integral part of an excellent original film, are far from perfect in this flop. Werewolves are like cartoons. It doesn’t matter how well you make a cartoon of the muscular muscles of the lycanthrope. Still difficult to fear the cartoon. So instead, a resting American gang led by super-weak Scott continues to look for excuses to return to the werewolf catacombs' lair. Here, this incompetent team of special effects is much easier to keep computer creatures or masks of an absurd beast under the cover of darkness. Some say that if you don’t see this film as a continuation, it’s not so bad compared to it. I disagree, this film cannot stand on its own, and is even more shameful in comparison with the brilliant original. If he does not want to be viewed as a sequel, he should not have borrowed much of the title from the 1981 film. I don't care how much you love werewolves. Or how much you worshiped "American werewolf in London." like me. This is just not worth wasting your time. “Okay, guys, see you. Terrible. 3 out of a possible 10 T.H.
