When I first looked at the back cover of this film, it seemed to me that my friends and I look forward to 82 memorable minutes. And it certainly was memorable. Puckoon was a movie where you constantly ask yourself how this is possible. How is it even possible that it was released on DVD. Of all the movies available in the video rental store that night ... we could choose the worst. And yes, they had a Tomb Raider. Absolutely nothing in this film surprised me even a little. Who had the idea that it would be funny if the narrator could change the story on the advice of the protagonist? Of all the nonsense that you can completely ruin the movie, now this is my favorite. Foggerty's character, the village idiot played by Nicholas Grace, is the most annoying character since they started making color films. If there is one movie that you definitely should not see this year, please let it be Puckoon, because I donâ€™t think it could be worse. I still wonder if this could be the worst because I spent my money, and believe me, I made a lot of lousy purchases over the years.
