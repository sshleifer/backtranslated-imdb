Having finished reading the book “One of a Kind” a week ago, I thought: “It will be a great movie, especially now that people know a little about poker and poker players.” I was completely shocked to find it yesterday while watching a video in the store. I had no idea that someone actually turned it into a movie. I immediately grabbed it and looked with great anticipation. What a big disappointment! <br /> <br /> All the intriguing things about Stu Ungar were quickly removed, and instead I had a biopic that could tell about someone. Ungar may have been a burnt asshole, but he was also a brilliant thinker who could instinctively read people. That's what made him so exciting. Why not focus on that? <br /> <br /> And talk about watering the real truth. This guy was excessive in almost everything: drugs, women, gambling, starvation, sleep deprivation. He played sports from dusk to dawn, he disappeared for several days, hanging out in dirty dens, his body was constantly exhausted, and yet, if he ever needed money, he could always beat anyone who wanted to play cards . Now this is a story! <br /> <br /> Too much time was spent on his childhood and personal relationships (although his connections with Vincent and his daughter were barely affected) and hardly anything related to his drug use (which was exorbitant) his crazy gambling and his incredible ability to play cards. <br /> <br /> It may be too late, but I hope that someone will redo this film properly. I had no problems with Imperoli. He's great. The script just left him nothing to say.
