This is truly one of the worst films I have seen lately. This is not funny at all. It simply depicts the northern British lower class setting. I find it a very sad movie in parts, in others, where they should not be. One thing that really annoyed me was the close-ups of meaningless objects, it really slowed the pace of the film. I starred in this film only because I quickly moved some episodes to an end. <br /> <br /> This film completely loses the attention of viewers. Its main problem is that it leads to several reasons for a single action, which, in turn, leads to a weakening of this action. However, if there is one reason for one action, this makes it more passionate. In general, this film is everywhere. I did not learn enough about the characters to take care of them because of the changing storylines and stories where, as I might have enjoyed, studying the life of one character. <br /> <br /> For example, in the beginning, when a guy meets God at a bar, God seems like a cool guy. At this point, the film could be more detailed, and I think it would be much funnier. Look if you want, but I warn you that this film is nonsense. I respect the manufacturers for trying to do this with such a low budget, but they could do a much better job. I assume that all this is in camera movement and editing, the game was decent. But again, this is just my opinion.
