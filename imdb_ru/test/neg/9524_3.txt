AKA <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 3 x 1.78: 1 in a frame of 2.39: 1 (triptych) <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> 1978: working The teenage class (Matthew Leitch) takes a false identity and provokes a secular society, where it learns the hard lessons about the difference between rich and poor. <br /> <br /> An autobiographical film directed by Duncan Roy (Jackson: My Life ... YOUR ERROR), exposing the aristocracy to Thatcherite, seen through the eyes of a low-paid “common man” whose worldview is transformed by his adventures among the upper classes. Unfortunately, Roy’s script says very little about the fact that we did not yet know about the excesses of rich idlers, and the story only briefly flared Leich’s relationship with a beautiful but self-destructive partner (Peter Youngblood Hills), who turned out to be no less hypocritical than those the very people whom he seeks to imitate. Also starring Diane Quick (in the role of an outrageous snob who thinks that people from the working class are “embarrassed to be alive”!), Bill Nyei as the black sheep of a rich family, Lindsay Colson (“EastEnders”), Blake Ritson ( DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS) and Georgina Hale in a typically bright cameo that shows her boobs and stuff, without any care in the world! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the film’s impact has been weakened by Roy’s insistence on using the Triptych effect (three separate images of 1.78: 1 are packed in a frame of 2.39: 1, each of which provides a different perspective on separate scenes.), which compresses the image and distributes the audience from the events on the screen. A long, meaningless film, too personal for wide appeal, and it is hampered by the cinematic process that cannot reconcile the story at hand. Also available is a single-image version (theatrically designed at 1.85: 1) with an AKA: LIES AREE WISHES screen title.
