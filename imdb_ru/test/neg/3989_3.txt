The film is visually stunning: from the dusty interior of the church with the illuminated stove, through the damp street and the dilapidated garage to the flame, which is the culmination of the film. It also has a wonderful sense of time, and the 1950s (film opening) and the 1960s. All performances are first-class, especially Matthew McFadyen as a psychotic preacher and Gerard McSorley as a father, who discovers that his own intolerance is terribly intensified by his son. What a pity that the story is so ridiculous. For a start, concentrating on the relationship between Gabriel (McFadyen) and his family, it’s not at all clear how he managed to maintain such a great influence on the community. In the church, we see five or six main characters in the front and two or three behind them, but the rest of the meeting can also be mannequins: they have no signs of hearing, paying attention or expressing disagreement. From him; in cockfighting, no one says “yes” or “no” when he interferes with the process, but no one applauds and condemns when Caroline throws him a pint; The situation that leads to throwing a stone through the window of a pub is mysteriously resolved when labor pains appear. Secondly, in Middletown (in fact, this is not a city, but a small village), it seems that some important services are missing, such as the police and the fire department: only a family member with a crowbar can be involved in killing; residents watch a hell that threatens to swallow the whole city as if they were in a movie theater. In this respect, everyday things, such as telephones and newspapers, are noticeably absent, the rural community is strangely deprived of farm animals or wheat fields, and the most surprising thing for the “typical” north of Ireland is only one Christian community. - not even a pair of Anglicans to spice up the mixture. Even if you are ready to suspend disbelief, the story itself is rather worn out, a pale imitation of A.J. Cronin melodrama. And the music? Well, it's beautiful for the first two minutes, but when the same four chords are repeated without interruption for 90 minutes, it becomes more than annoying. My advice: watch it with the sound turned off.
