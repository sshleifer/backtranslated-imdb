Some people thought it was funny because they liked the political issues discussed in this issue. However, I was so tired of the state of the two-party system in our country that I can not stand the propaganda on both sides. I was hoping for a horror show, but I got "cute" zombies and partisan nonsense. I watch my horror movies to be scared. This is not even an attempt to be scary. In addition, there is no laughter with Romero in his political / cultural satire permeated by his films ... it was a frank story without imagination that I could not live through (for the wrong reasons). On the other hand, if you hate Bush, you will like it (I do not approve of hate or Bush with this statement)
