I am not a fan of the original book, but I expected to see a better adaptation than the Natalie Portman film, which I found terrible. This version is even worse. <br /> <br /> First, there are very few Miss Gregory books in this scenario. The whole story about George Boleyn's sexuality is completely excluded, and in this version George simply falls through his duty to the Boleyn family and his duty to the king. I thought that in the title of the book Maria is mentioned as the least known of the Boleyn sisters, but here she is used to refer to Anna. <br /> <br /> Secondly, in the script, the characters periodically turn to the audience as if in confession. Apparently, this is intended to give a small background and explain their motives, but in amateur performance. <br /> <br /> In addition to the bad script, the direction is amazingly bad. Too many pictures taken with a circular camera, which at best is not too stable, and at worst - completely shaky. Some of the speeches are delivered roughly as if at the first rehearsal. Production values ​​for the bright court of Henry are minimal. The costumes are different: some are copies of historical portraits, while others are from some designer’s inflamed imagination. And the King, the source of all power and mercy, is often shown ONE. No court courtiers, no servants in the background - where are all the people ?? I'm used to the fact that Hollywood turns history into fantasy, but I expected more from the production of the BBC. Even based on a spoiled book, this production is BAD.
