From watching the trailer the movie looked quite interesting. The production of the film is also pretty good - it looks like they had a good budget and not a cheap film. The action ranges from good (Joe Morton as Professor Simon) to OK (Kelly Overton as Eve) to bad (James Haven as Don). <br /> <br /> The actual content and plot of the film is weak. The film begins as if it might become interesting, and ends in a poorly executed, disappointingly boring turn. Watching the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes of a movie would make this movie normal, but everything in between makes this movie absolutely boring. As if they shot a short film, and then tried to make it last more than an hour, filling the middle with an hour of filler. <br /> <br /> If you want to spend a good hour and half your life, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay away from this extremely boring movie.
