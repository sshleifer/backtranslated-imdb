After all the hype I heard about Jane Austen's novel and various versions of the book, I was very disappointed with this film. I expected a classic drama, but it was not. First of all, let me anticipate my review with the fact that I love old movies, especially riddles and dramas, but not women-oriented films. This probably makes a huge difference, so take my review with a lot of salt. I thought the game was a bit excessive, but this is very common in the films of this era. June Allison was as good as Joe, but I found that each sister was a stereotypical and moveable form. There were no surprises or overly dramatic moments. I hate to write negative reviews, but the film left me very cold. I always wanted to read a book, but after that it seems unlikely. The only warm storyline was between the old gentlemen and the younger sister, it was a very nice bright spot in a disappointing view. Again there are others who love this movie, I'm just not one of them.
