Do not confuse this parody with the lousy 1975 Michael Richie beauty contest. This “Smile” is a refuted example of the good intentions that pave the way to hell. <br /> <br /> There are two stories in the film: the impoverished Chinese. the father sacrifices his wife and son to raise an orphan deformed on his face by the name of Lin (Yi Ding), and the Malibu-born family plays the "Gidget Get Birth Control". Katie (Mika Buram, Olsen's third twin) plays a spoiled, self-absorbed high school girl, cut off from reality. Her teacher (Sean Astin) is paving the way for a school trip to China, the purpose of which is to show students how to work with deformed children. <br /> <br /> In the film, warp is used as a means of concern, regarding Ling as a Frankenstein monster. Kramer constantly masks his deformation with the help of hats, hoods and camera placement. This approach uses the quality freak show inherent in the material. She may feel uncomfortable with the way society looks at her, and Kramer’s answer is to cover her until she opens. Why bother your audience with such troubles? We see her face for a short time at the end and just a few minutes before her closed shots after the operation reveal the swan under the cleft lip. It is not enough to give the girl a reason to live; it is imperative that Ling be as hot and popular as Katie. <br /> <br /> Financing the film came from a trust founded by the late Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. They represented the legacy of quality family films. Give me the "Son of a pale face" any day.
