Is it as stupid as they come? the concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already too fixated on words, but wait until you get the weight of a stupid creature as it appears on the screen! Am I telling you that I laughed so hard at this thing that I missed some explanatory dialogues? on the other hand, the latter is often so heavily dependent on scientific jargon and the laws of physics and the like (which I have never been good in, despite my love for sci-fi films), it still didn’t matter! Bird ?? first depicted as a simple blurry form whistling to the heavens, but subsequently shown in all its stupefied glory ?? it is so sublimely stupid that in the Looney Tunes cartoon it would be wrong (witness a series of periodically taken photos that start with the creature at a distance and end with the extreme close-ups of his face broken on the sides)! <br /> <br /> Director Sears coped much better with his other UFO film, the beautiful EARTH VS. Flying saucers (1956) with special effects provided by the master, Ray Harryhausen (referring to which, I have just given my copy of the latter in anticipation of the acquisition of the recently released in Colombia SE DVD SE); In addition, it seems to me that some shots illustrating the rampage of birds in New York were removed from the destruction of Washington, which can be seen in this early science fiction classic! Again, the regulars in the genres are regulars ?? namely, Jeff Morrow (from THIS ISLAND EARTH [1955]) and Mara Corday (from TARANTULA [1955]); As with the aforementioned FLYING SAUCERS, are these names highly appreciated and loved by fans ?? consequently, they are far superior to this deplorable addition to the alien / monster cycle common in science fiction times and beyond (by the way, other flying threats were shown in Flying Serpent [1946], which I did not observe, and Larry Cohen's Indecent Update same in Q: Winged Snake [1982]). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the giant claw can not even rise to a decent climax ?? who is in such a hurry that it becomes “washing out” to quote the pilot of a jet plane from the film itself, whose attack with missiles on a bird turns out to be completely ineffective (that is, before Morrow realizes that he is protected by an invisible barrier, and then how to be able to penetrate it). In the end, apart from intractable (and frankly tedious) technical differences, there is a feeling “so bad, it's good,” watching it: in the end, does it last only 74 minutes ?? and, in any case, the bird is such an unforgettable foolish creature that it causes a smile on its face every time it appears!
