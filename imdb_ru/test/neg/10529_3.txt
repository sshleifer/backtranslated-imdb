I really liked this film about the doctor, who has the opportunity to start a new life with a young woman, if he can accept the death of his wife. I suppose it was supposed to play like an unusual light romantic comedy, but this theme is a little inconvenient for me. <br /> <br /> But leaving it aside, I found that the dialogue was too much like a stage, despite the fact that it was based on a novel, and also, the mediocre acting game was embarrassing to watch especially young lead Vincent Spano. <br /> <br /> I tried to catch up in all the eighties films I missed during that decade. It was my petitioner loot that nostalgia lovers of the eighties seem to focus on the same canon of films, usually showing actors and parody actresses, and neglect other films, such as Creator, that have fallen through the cracks. But in the case of this function, I must say that I can understand it. Not all these eighties films were magical, and the Creator is proof of that.
