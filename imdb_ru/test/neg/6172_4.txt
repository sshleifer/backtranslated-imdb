I decided to watch this movie to sleep. It kept me awake, so it was interesting; however, it was rather soft. <br /> <br /> The game was good. I don't think any of the actors did a bad job. Mickey Rourke is as believable as a hired assassin can be. The dialogue in this film does not give these actors a special opportunity to demonstrate their full potential, but they still shine. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere was great. The music was good, and the colors corresponded to the mood that the director wanted to draw for the audience. Even the weather improved the mood of the film. Everything was well done. <br /> <br /> The failures of this film are in the development of its history. The storyline with the mafia against Blackbird does not attract enough attention. The plot for the divorce of Carmen and Wayne is not explained. The FBI seems to be working very fast here. Are there any documents for all these processes? Is it really so easy to dig up your brother's body from his grave, burn the corpse and identify him as you? There are too many loops in the storyline so that I can give this film something higher than a rating of 4 out of 10. I would not recommend this film to people unless they really miss and smoke really good weed. Even if WoW is down for maintenance, find something better than watch this movie.
