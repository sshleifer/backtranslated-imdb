I got this movie on a DVD called Evil Never Sleeps, it tells about Carrie Ann Moss on the cover, but she plays such an insignificant character that I did not notice her in the film. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I think this is one of the worst purchases I have ever made. The dialogue was filmed and the delivery was wooden, I found that the action was disconnected from the plot. For me, Graham played someone who wondered if she left the gas at home. <br /> <br /> In general, it seemed to my wife and I that it was painful to watch this movie, and it is not a valuable addition to my collection, look at your own peril and risk, but spending 90 minutes on your nails is probably would be the best way to spend time.
