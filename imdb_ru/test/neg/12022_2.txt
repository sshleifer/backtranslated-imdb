I'm going to fight here because this film was shot so well and so good that I get twice as angry about his deevolution as I would be with less work. Without revealing too much of the plot, I can only say that the first part of my set of 2 VHS was a frustrating, unfolding admiration for strange, but believable plot development. The main character was accordingly naive, but also smart and very very open. The events he was quickly forced to accept were separation from his parents, cultural shock when his Pakistani roots faced the complete disintegration of an English cramped society in the sixties, the dubious transformation of his father into a revered Buddha in the Suburbs, and his cousin's transformation into a feminist action as his best friend, he suddenly becomes a symbol of the growing punk movement in the seventies. Among other things. <br /> <br /> What made me so angry was the amount of detailed work each actor put on creating and creating his characters in the first part, only for all this to turn into very bad porn episodes the second part, too much to justify the development of the plot , and too obvious to even seem erotic. My biggest pet peeve is when directors allow their personal fetishes to interfere with the veracity of their film, and for me it was an excellent example. <br /> <br /> I felt a bit like I was invited to a party by very smart, funny strangers, just to lock the doors and not allow guests to talk, and we all have to watch bad movies about sexual exploitation of the seventies instead. . What an insult to the hard work of these amazing actors! Why not just start with cheeseball? And why use the great protagonist, who can really act, and then step back from him whenever he prepares for a great performance? I almost felt as if he, too, was tired of endless sex scenes, where all he did was lay shaking the pelvis of another naked naked actress. <br /> <br /> The result - part one - an insignificant genius, part Two - a perversion of a second-level soap opera. I know the book is pretty clear, but I felt that these wonderful actors were just as exploited in real life as their characters in the film, and it made me very angry and feel very uncomfortable. Only John Waters can deal with such dubious humiliation of the actors and plot, and this may seem artistic. I propose only to watch the first part, throw the second one into the conventional pile of garbage, and you will love the Buddha forever. Score A + F = 0
