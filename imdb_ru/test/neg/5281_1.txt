This film is sucked on many levels! Have you ever seen a dentist? This film made the Dentist look like a masterpiece. I do not recommend this film to anyone, unless, of course, you are really very, very bored, then maybe. It was SO banal. The killer reminds you of the monster grandfather, except that he has points. When Jessica said, “I want you to meet someone, my inner bitch, I thought that she was going to kick his ass, but all she did was,” he dumped the trash can, crying scene about his wife, I SO felt the pain behind his tears ......... NOT !!!!! So, before watching this movie, take a blanket and a pillow, feel comfortable, because it is very relaxing,
