In the farcical vein, Gaudi Days can be perceived as a mediocre exercise. Marcia Gay Harden and Judy Davis played a successful role (the freaky New Age hero Juliette Lewis was incredibly taken from reality, I know an American young lady who screams like her!), But GA doesn’t show anything but her wrapped storyline. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that making films is just an invention, there were some noticeable inconsistencies in the script. Two examples: you pay 14 euros to enter the chapel where Kassandra and Frankie met, NEVER at 7 am, and you cannot leave the terrace without paying the bill (they will pay you on the spot if they do not know you) , or quickly get off the taxi (Americans always tip taxi drivers, even if they don’t expect it, but the episodes shown in the film were ridiculous). Do not believe me, reader: come and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> If you have never been here before, you may not care, but good films must be believable regardless of your background. Nobody knows about GA here, and I will make sure that this does not change in the future.
