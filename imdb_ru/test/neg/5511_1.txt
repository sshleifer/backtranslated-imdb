I tried to remember the name of this film over the years (not consistently, of course). I saw it at the local dollar theater when I was 11 years old, and it was so awful that I almost went out; I think I did not understand that someone was allowed to leave before the end of the film. In any case, it was remembered to me as the worst film that I saw when I was growing up. I can finally give him the grade he deserves. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (it was oddly satisfactory)
