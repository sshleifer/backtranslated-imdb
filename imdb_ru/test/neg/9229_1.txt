Yes, it's me again! Mr. "I am sitting through shit, so you do not need." <br /> <br /> What do you think this is about? Maybe it is a woman who calls on the sexual line and arranges meetings with bachelors in a lonely place? Then her dressing up boyfriend comes in and cuts their throats with a razor before they run off with his money? Wow, what a hunch! And if I tell you that the policeman, put on this case, is forced to unite with the sexual assistant DA to pin these suckers, what conclusion will you come to? Do you think that the sexual prosecutor will go under cover in a light red dress, trying to meet the transvestite, but in the end he will be kidnapped and an individualist officer will save him? (who already handed over his gun and badge) ZING! You get 10 points! <br /> <br /> Honestly, this film bored me to tears. Why do people insist on doing this kind of garbage? This is a waste of our time, their time, and, nevertheless, they still continue, making a film about which no one speaks one iota. If he has any redemptive traits, there is the fact that he has some of the most beautiful girls I've ever seen in a movie. I hope that they spent the meager salary they earned on the abundance of Botox and the colon. They would look great on the cover of Vogue or sit on the side of the car. They should simply leave the actions to the professionals (for example, Shannon Tweed). <br /> <br /> Speaking about my future career, I ran into the director the other day. He is sure that he is cooking delicious food from a chicken burger. I must also say that the form really suits him. I asked him about the Party Line, and his eyes fell to the floor before he muttered something about the extra french fries. Oh well, I guess that didn't quite work out. Never mind, they let him take control until tomorrow !! Hooray!! 1/10
