Full zero out of four. One worst sums up Ajooba: awful. In fact, more words come to mind: stupid, third and terrible. This is one of Amitabhaâ€™s worst films ever: he jumps in a cheap leather jacket and equally cheap tinsel in zorro style with wings on the sides. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in antiquity. Persia or Arabia is not historically characteristic of Indian cinema. As stated above, the K-Mart leather jacket with velcro straps was not 400 years old, unless all my history teachers were right. <br /> <br /> Rishi also removes the patented clothes in this film. It is not funny at all, it is very shameful to look at it. What could the son of the legendary Raj Kapoor have in order to capture the memories of his house on the screen? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you want to really laugh, keep watching this movie. Bright discrepancies in the plot and costumes can not be compared with the terrible dialogues and sloppy play.
