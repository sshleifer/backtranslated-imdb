On a scale from 1 to 10, I gave it 4. I thought that the film was not very good, too much violence and not one character who liked it. <br /> <br /> On an erotic scale, I give 6. Many of the sex scenes have been painted with disgrace. I always enjoy nudity, and Nancy Travis and Fay Grant come in, but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic.
