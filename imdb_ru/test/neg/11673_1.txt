This is not exactly what I would call Mad Max, after seeing Road Warrior and experiencing the superiority of this film, I felt some disappointment when I saw it. He supposedly started off as a kid in a wildlife movie and was merged with the Mad Max franchise (bad idea). Casting was not exactly the best, I mean, come on Tina Turner? One of the main problems of this film is the absence of good villains. No Wes, no Khumungus, not even a decent Toecutter! Nothing really even happens if you plan to see this click of the subparameter action (can you even call it that way?), Make sure you see Mad Max 2 or Mad Max, or better yet both. Another problem with this film is that there are too many people there, even the battle in the Thunder House is boring, Max doesn't even kill anyone! The music is bad, the characters are bad (not in a good way), and after watching this movie, I still have very bad taste in my mouth.
