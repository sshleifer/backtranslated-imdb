ATTENTION SPOILER: At the end of the film, it was announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after it was captured. It seems that the attack was completely for nothing. In fact, the capture of the bridge in Remagen was the last important victory of the Western allies. It was the crossing of the Rhine, which the Allies tried to reach for six months. Since the Remagen Bridge was captured, the war ended in just a few weeks. <br /> <br /> The bridge should only last one day after it was captured. It was enough time for the Americans to send combat engineers and large defenses to the other side, and then they could start building a series of pontoon bridges. Taking the bridge was a complete success, and this meant that the end of the war was near, and would not last until the summer. Contrary to the cynical nature of the film, the victory was marked by enthusiasm from the troops who did it. They knew how vital the battle was. <br /> <br /> This film has little to do with the real story. It was rather a reflection of the cynical nature of the time when it was produced.
