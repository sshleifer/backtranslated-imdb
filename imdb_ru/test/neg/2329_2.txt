A colleague from work told me to watch this film, since he considered this film to be one of the best films ever. So I watched it. First, I have to admit that I donâ€™t like mainstream movies and I prefer to watch movies with real meaning. <br /> <br /> And that's why I don't like this movie. It makes no sense. It's just a combination of funny, silly, boring, entertaining, absurd and exciting pieces. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that this film could become a real mysterious thriller (as the German packaging says), but the film was too mysterious for me. <br /> <br /> David Lynch may be able to make a combination of a variety of images, but the composition for me is just as terrible as the combination of milk and beer. Both are pretty good for themselves, but together?
