They used shots of some kind of real protest demonstrating that some woman spoke about a society where there are no men to create the impression that these people support the “gender gender” of men. The funny thing is that in the background you can see a person who is ill for his own death. <br /> <br /> Good plot. Some woman says that there should be a society without men, and the crowd in front of her (which contains several men) thinks this is a great idea. So, all the people are killed or something. So there are no more. <br /> <br /> Then this blond scientist creates a man, but removes some chromosomes so that he cannot be cruel. A man grows very quickly and soon becomes an adult man. Soon he takes the Volkswagen beetle and goes to the city where it was discovered. Now you think that a lonely man in a city full of lesbians will be the happiest guy ever, but he can’t. The police are chasing him. <br /> <br /> I didn’t watch the rest, but probably they should end up in a time trial race and some people, otherwise something bad could happen. Somehow, a man finds himself in a stadium along with other people who want him to lead a rebellion. These brave warriors, hiding in the stadium, could have some kind of plan that laid out the details of how they single-handedly got rid of a planet full of women, but I did not look. And you should not. <br /> <br /> If you are late and surf the channel, and it happens, do not look. See anything but that. You will find such advertisements for Bowflex or advertisements with women in swimwear in which you are asked to “pick up the phone to meet the same women” in your area will be more enjoyable entertainment. <br /> <br /> (Oh yes, there is such a funny thing when they drive up to their cars. I don’t know what they did, it looks like they were driving very slowly and carefully, but then they tried to speed up the film to compensate it is, but it just looks really weird.) <br /> <br /> The blonde was pretty sweet and I feel generous, so ... 2/10.
