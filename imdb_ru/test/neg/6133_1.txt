Well, first I must say that I assumed that this was done simply by a group of friends with a limited budget. With this in mind, it really should not be compared with the functions of a blockbuster, and my rating will be higher. But still ... <br /> <br /> After he gave him a chance, he still broke some of the basic rules of filmmaking to such an extent that both the viewer and the amateur director shrank in me. Lot. <br /> <br /> Think: Blair Witch is in the car, but REALLY boring. <br /> <br /> Think about it: you left the camcorder on the dashboard and recorded that you lost your way in the park at night for an hour, and then get your friends to watch it. <br /> <br /> The scariest part (THE POSSIBLE WARNING OF THE SPOILER ... IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET HERE) was in one place, the image was rewound, and you might think that you would have to look again and again. SCARY. <br /> <br /> Aside from stupidity, this is a very good idea for the low-budget film “Come on, make, make a movie” tonight. But the concept passes the fine line between being really good and really bad, and let's just say that it was not really good. There were too many parts where nothing happened. At first, I thought it was a director's plan — you had to immerse yourself in a sense of security, and then really scary things would begin. But no. <br /> <br /> I kept trying to find something good to say about it (and I had enough time to think), and I would say that the music was pretty cool. And I must pay tribute to the lead woman for standing alone and looking scared for a very, very long time. But that's all. The actors playing the "infected" people looked like they were laughing at zombie movies. Or they got their motivation from the beetle in the costume of Edgar from the "MIB". Most likely, if for some strange reason you are going to watch this movie, it is on DVD or Tivo, so you can rewind it forward when waiting for something becomes too difficult. <br /> <br /> I hate being so critical of something, but at the same time I watched a lot of similar movies, and nothing has ever been so painful. If they just cut off half an hour and add some scary things, it can be decent. Maybe it will be the director the director ...
