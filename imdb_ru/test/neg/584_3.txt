Although our gang comedies still have their followers, I must say that their attempt to move to feature films, courtesy of Hal Roach, was too short. Why did Roach have to choose a civil war, since all the attendant racism applies to it. <br /> <br /> Dicky South Cavalier Phillips Holmes takes the young orphan Spanky Macfarland and his young black friend Thomas Crap after Spunky by negligence exposes a card cheat on a river boat. In the Old South everything is calm and serene, and then civil war destroys it for everyone. <br /> <br /> But even children can charm the worst in the world, and there is nothing worse than these damned Yankees. They just go south and destroy it for everyone. <br /> <br /> Criticized, although for its southern point of view, Gone With the Wind served as a good argument for the southern cause, and the blacks were depicted, although they were slaves. Of necessity, three-dimensional characters remain. Hattie McDaniel would not have won her Oscar if it were not so. The nature of Butterfly McQueen in Prissy, as stupid and senseless as she was, has a certain dimension. <br /> <br /> Here, perhaps, one of the worst racial stereotypes ever encountered in Hollywood. The partnership Spanky and Buckwheat really shows that children get along, racial feelings are acquired not inborn. This is not black slavery, which is undesirable, but there is a full acceptance of this. Right from this horrible watermelon song, sung over the title titles, the message of General Spunky is bad. <br /> <br /> Still, she received an Oscar nomination for the sound recording, perhaps one of the very few Hal Roach ever left the short subject field. <br /> <br /> General Spanky away from Gone with the Wind.
