Sorry, but this work of director Peter Hall is terrible. If you can't reach us with a plot, why not kill someone's cat or dog. It certainly reaches the audience. This viewer is tired of seeing animals sacrificed for the plot of the film. And believe me, I saw it happen before she opened the package. How predictably you can get. Take a cute animal and kill it in a terrible way. I have never been a De Morne fan, and this view tells me why. Excessive and somewhat stagnant in interpretation, I found it rather stupid and definitely boring. I liked Banderas, but I felt bad when he played with De Morne. He did much better in other films, namely “Philadelphia”, where he had some honesty in his dialogue. In this chestnut, he did everything possible to keep his character real. But the authors, Green & Rush, did a good job of preventing it through their banal storyline and tasteless dialogue. Please, let's not be exposed to this kind of entertainment. Some of us are not fooled by banal conspiracies, the beating of animals and generally a long verbose dialogue. Seeing how she got away with it, I got angry.
