The appeal of this film should be fanciful in European style, because there is absolutely no point in this. There are a lot of things that seem to go somewhere ... but this does not happen. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s hard to find as many as 10 lines of comments, because this film is a completely empty experience, there are a lot of good pictures of a cemetery, some really flimsy zombie effects, some flashes of what may be surreal humor, and weak existentialist final. These elements undermine each other. Just when you may be enjoying the eerie mood, there is some nonsense with bouncing heads or zombie sex. In order not to scream from boredom, you cling to the minimum storyline - and it turns into a ridiculous incoherence. It is as if someone took a few unfinished B-films and threw them into a blender. <br /> <br /> Basically it turns out the film * about * meaninglessness - and * not * good. It is clear that this will hit the category of art-house fans who consider the emptiness indistinguishable from the depth. All others must stay away from this melancholy mess.
