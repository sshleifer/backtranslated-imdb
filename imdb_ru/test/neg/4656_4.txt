Like his close contemporaries "The Great Race" and "These magnificent people on their aircraft", I always associate this film with my childhood, especially in the New Year. On New Year's Eve, we visited my grandmother, and after dinner, while the adults were talking, the children watched TV, where one of these three crazy racing films always showed. <br /> <br /> For this reason, I really wanted to make a good “Monte-Carlo or Bust” note, but I am afraid I will not, as the child will not be the father for the man in this case. By this I mean that I see its flaws too clearly, and although I sometimes wanted to smile, in truth, I really wanted all participants to get to the end of the race long before they did. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is related to the stereotypes of nationalities and the woman as the weaker sex, and I also didn’t really care about one or two crazy, admittedly mild vulgarity, which sometimes appeared. Moreover, the cast, while outrageous, simply does not sell the film enough. Tony Curtis seems to be too old to play a young galant during the trial launch of his "Yankee Abroad" series, Eric Sykes is incredible how dirty ... Thinking Lothario, while Gert Frob , as the defeated Teuton, just strangely removed in the camp comedy, when you remember that he was the best villain of Bond Goldfinger. In any case, Engles are best - Susan Hampshire, at least, attracts herself as a “bright young thing”, appropriately playful as a chic cracker and, although chained to the leash of the script, Pete and Dad offer the most pleasure, like the tough types of the upper lip army. Even then, the “Carry On” team made it much better in the “Carry On Up The Khyber Pass”. <br /> <br /> Director Annakin is trying everything to cause Golden Silence, with a lash farce, erroneous capers, quick camera shots, potential dramatic stunts and a little light novel, but for such a famous race there is no real tension, and in any case, the race at the end seems like another race. <br /> <br /> In fact, I would give another assessment if they adhered to the alternative name “These magnificent people in their jolly yalepii”, but in fact the animated series “Foolish races” made it much better.
