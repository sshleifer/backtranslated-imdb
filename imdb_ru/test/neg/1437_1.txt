I do not recommend you watch this movie if you are easily offended. I'm not even easily offended, and this film upset me. This is so disgusting. And it does not make sense. Everything related to the Internet is such a cliche, and the producer clearly does not understand all the "rules of the Internet." When you communicate with someone, you can track their IP address. Indeed? (see sarcasm here). That was stupid. It makes no sense. And I did not even watch the end. I could always say: “It does not make sense, it also ...” This film is sheer nonsense at its best. Good comment, right?
