The story of Underwood is a stupid story about a young man (Arquette) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap Frank Sinatra Jr. (Nicholas). The film is ridiculous, the direction is strange, the dialogues are irrelevant and picky, the actors also did not condemn it, Arquette is annoying everywhere, Ian Nicholas was not, Macy was decent, but only because he was a pretty good actor and probably just tried his best getting out of this project with a completely awkward performance, he was at least tolerant. This is a stupid film in my eyes, sometimes dull, not interesting, just a film that I would not recommend to anyone. IMDb rating: 5.5, my rating: 4/10
