Judging by the kind words of my friends, I hired this film, hoping that it would be at least equal to the laughter of a similar film "Home Party", but I was very disappointed and very boring. <br /> <br /> Falling asleep while watching a movie is a bad sign. I don’t know if I liked it because I don’t live in a “hood” or if I’m not black, but this is probably one of the two. <br /> <br /> It tries to fake several films, only by inventing a couple of laughter, but in the end it fails miserably. Skip this.
