The director is cute, like his wife is director Shira Geffen, but their film sucks. It has its moments (and some pretty girls), but there are too many things: “Amelie” meets “Breaking the waves” meets “Pauline on the beach”. You leave, wanting to know more about the wedding photographer and the girl who loves it most when nothing happens, whether in the movies or in real life. Instead, you get a suicidal writer, a neurotic actress, and an illegal immigrant who comes as a social worker with a heart of gold. It seems that there are some really touching stories hidden in the script, but at first glance this is a pile of empty plot lines and sentimental garbage. It is difficult to sit as it is.
