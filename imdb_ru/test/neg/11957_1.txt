This is a very terrible movie. And if you think you've seen another horrible movie, just like this, you probably saw it. You have probably seen Scarecrow 2, made in 2003. Yes, that's what I said, Brian (the director) stole the idea of ​​the film. And he not only stole it, he could even make it worse. I bet even the actors were afraid to tell people that they were actually in the film. I should also note that the director tried to make up for the fun by showing as many boobs as possible. Also kissing scenes were put together like a porn movie. In fact, this is probably all that the director has ever seen and tried to put together a decent film that will never work.
