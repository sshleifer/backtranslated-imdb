If you like the “Time Machine” version of the early 60s, do not waste time; as in last year's Planet of the Apes, this was “rethought”, and not for the better. And, as in the case of "Planet ...", its leading actor is extremely unsuccessful and lead; Guy Pierce, a terrific large-scale actor, is completely unsuitable for this role, acting in one note, which causes zero sympathy; he is so stern and serious, and he lacks the thrill (supposedly) of amazing things that he sees, that you will not believe for a second that he is experiencing them. Worse, whose idea was it to make him look like the child of love of David Spade and Calisty Flockhart ?? A handsome actor, here he is sickeningly skinny, which, believe me or not, distracts. To be honest, a man looks seriously ill and takes a cruel photograph. He shares absolutely no chemistry with anyone on the screen, which is a direct result of work that is not synchronized with anyone else. Unfortunately, even with a good presenter in this film, there is no chance that he is mortally burdened as a completely inept director - whole scenes do not lead anywhere and are poorly implemented - and the script, which is extremely incomplete, scattered and sometimes incoherent - not for one moment you don't care about anyone in this film, the only fact that there is NOTHING in character development! In the original, you recognized Eloi SIGN, so you took care of them and felt their terror in front of the Morocca; here, as emphasized in the film several times, they are nothing but sheep and act accordingly. If you are not a member of PETA, scared sheep are VERY fun fun! <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba does his best in her debut at the cinema, but like everything else in this mess, especially Jeremy Irons (if he is Morellok leader [who looks like rejected from "The Mom Is Back"], then why does HE look like Edgar Winter's long-lost brother? FULLY LOST. Also wasted money spent on endless "special effects", which refute the 70 million dollars spent on the film; they are equally dull, obvious and inconclusive. And there is also a kind of film: poorly photographed, its artistic direction and sets are simply “there”, and its costumes are typical in design. There is no original thought or idea expressed behind or on the screen. Most of all, it's not even fun! (The filmmakers use the now ubiquitous Orlando Jones as a “comic relief”, but, as usual, Jones is annoying, and just HOW does his electrically driven character survive in a world seemingly devoid of electricity?) <br /> <br / > In general, it is an empty, lifeless, dull, fruitless and confusing business: did they ALREADY REMOVE the "Planet of the Apes" ??? (At least THAT was lucky with some strong performances!) <br /> <br /> * SPOILER! * Last insult (with the exception of a terribly scary, not to mention a convenient ending)? Not only do they show BARELY the changing shapes of a clothing store, they even make the time machine an anachronistic, tasteless opening of glass and chrome! (If the Clan Soprano had a time machine, THIS would look exactly like that.)
