I am proud to be Dutch, I am really shocked by such films. What for? why is this cheap acting game? Why does this storyline just suck? why a dozen sequels? why? they add a lot of hot Dutch chicks to save this movie from ransom, and you know what? all underage breeders girls in Holland go and watch it. I was forced to watch it at a party. all the girls went crazy when Daan Schurmans came out on the screen, all the guys took another beer and grumbled ... But what really bothers me is the fact that such films are the only kind of films that Dutch directors can produce .. (except for "Van God Los" and "Lek") This does not prove our superiority over other countries ... This does not add anything to our imagination ... This is just F ** raises the brains of small 13-year-old girls ... Johan Nijuhuis I hope you will burn forever!
