It is a schmuck, but what else did you expect? The heroine is the younger sister of Cinderella, full of angry mother, sister and son-in-law; the hero (if you can call it that) is an ineffective way; and rival love interests are full of melodramatic meanness. <br /> <br /> The cast, furnishings and wardrobe were very attractive, and I thought the actors did an excellent job considering how weak the material was. The film was beautifully shot and had a soundtrack that was carefully thought out to let the viewer know what emotions he should have in everything. Megon McDonough sang sweetly and gave the film the best moments. <br /> <br /> If you love Daniel Steele, you will love this movie. If you love an archetypal novel, you will love this movie. I do not. I was able to sit through it, but it was close.
