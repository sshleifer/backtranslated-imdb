I love movies ... and rarely see a movie that I hate ... but it was the worst movie I have ever seen, or at least close to it. Any film that ends with a rape scene is terrible. Hands down ... I can't believe that I wasted 2 hours of my life on watching this movie. I'm really angry, I want my money and time back. HORRIBLE! Do not watch it, the cinematography is terrible, the plot is terrible, the final is terrible. I didn’t know what was going on for half the movie because I couldn’t see it (and I watched a very good and big TV). I saw the rent, the hills have eyes or a wax house ... one of them is better if you want something scary.
