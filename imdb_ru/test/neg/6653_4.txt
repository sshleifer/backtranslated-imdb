I really wanted to watch this movie - I thought the plot was really unique and intriguing. The cop (Andy Garcia) has a son who is dying and needs bone marrow replacement in order to live. The only match is a convicted serial killer who escapes from prison. To save his son, he must hunt down the killer. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton plays the convict in one of the many disappointing moments of the film. Sometimes Keaton is a great actor, but here he is pretty boring. This is too much, to the extent that you just stop caring. <br /> <br /> Garcia is better, but tries too hard for a film that is not up to par. Barbet Schroeder (at one time such a promising director with films like Barley, which meant almost nothing on the American market) is managing quite well - I honestly thought the script was the culprit here ... it's just a big mess . <br /> Ultimately, the film spends a lot of good material, good actors and a good director - all because of the wrong script. What should have been tense and thought-provoking is just a Hollywood action.
