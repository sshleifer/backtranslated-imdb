I love to shoot this movie. My peers are always trying to protect him, perhaps because of his love for Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but they will never convince me that this should be appreciated. Here are a few good reasons why: A: The story goes from a film about a kidnapping on the way to a movie in which vampires live, without any settings. Suddenly something very real turns into something very false. It’s as if the audience had a holiday at Thanksgiving, and then blew it up with dynamite. B: In this mediocre Juliette Lewis. C: A lot of ridiculous ideas, such as real torso and leg guitars, brothers with the name “Gecko”, bad vampire makeup tasks, Cheech Marin plays three characters (?) "and belongs to the guy who drives the Sex Machine." If Robert Rodriguez had not tried to be so inventive with his violence, I could have had fun with this obvious popcorn flick. The whole project, as if he got ideas, playing with figures. The only thing that is even close to being considered my favorite scene is the funny funny monologue of George Clooney after he killed his bloodsucking, horny for children, terrible acting brother. I swear, I think they came up with it right now and there. This film insults and ultimately insults those who want the offensive. Horrible movie.
