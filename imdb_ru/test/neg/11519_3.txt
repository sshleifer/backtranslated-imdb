Being one of the founding fathers of my regional monkey club (it also includes monkeys / chimpanzees and orangutans), I view this film in terms of monkeys. After all, this is a whole summer of monkeys, more than 100 days for monkeys to do what they do best, cause harm, machinations, hijinks, solve human problems and teach us about ourselves. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple, in short, the poor boy needs money for what he wants. Fortunately, there are a few monkeys (chimpanzees) that have generosity on their heads, which cause the blood of Boba Fett or Great Dane (Duane Chapman). When a boy tries to catch monkeys, he learns about himself, his family, his grandfather, the local crank, flirts with a girl twice her age, and learns how the little animals have to deal with hooligans so that someone can put a gun on them. br /> <br /> This is the problem. So much attention is paid to the boy that chimpanzees simply do not get the time on the screen they deserve. Chimps are not as talented as the chimps that play Jack in the M_P trilogy, or the legendary orangutans who play Dunstin or Clyde (1 or 2). So don't watch this movie, expecting to find the next big thing in the chimpanzee genre. The chimps were hit in a few sweet flips, and this is what the film needs. There is an epic scene in which chimpanzees break into the home of poor families and destroy everything they have worked so hard for. Serious monkey movie lovers will want to rent a movie for this scene alone. <br /> <br /> Therefore, closing this film is not for serious fans of the movie with monkeys. I would not recommend this film to families, as it encourages the rebellion of children against their parents. I can only recommend this film as a rental for hardcore monkeys, loving adults and children under supervision.
