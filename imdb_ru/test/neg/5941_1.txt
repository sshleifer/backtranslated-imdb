I like this movie! Today it is the best parody of Russian cinema. Who else, except Sokurov, could play Tarkovsky so brilliantly. Did you think the stalker was slow? Well, come to the plate. Mat i Syn makes Stalker look like Raiders of the Lost Ark. Do not miss this movie! There is no excuse - even if you live a busy life, you can still enjoy this movie to the fullest extent, while holding down the fast forward button on the VCR. Sokurov gave us the first full-length film, which can be evaluated in 12 minutes. <br /> <br /> I believe that the next great masterpiece of this form will come when someone has the vision and the courage to show a film consisting of no sound or image at all - 45 minutes of a black silent screen (isn't it already explored in "In the Soup"?). <br /> <br /> Apparently, the director (and the fans) forgot about this. ”“ The Movement ”is the first word of the“ movie ”. <br /> <br /> !!! BASIC SPOILERS AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> Want to reach the heights of the genius that this film has achieved? Here is a walkthrough: <br /> <br /> 1. Find a talented photographer. <br /> <br /> 2. Find a few items and a suitable scenic landscape (think Tuscany!). If you need inspiration, look at the advertising of luxury cars or perfumes. <br /> <br /> 3. Remove about 3 rolls of film. <br /> <br /> 4. Photoshop results for reproduction with richness, blur and aspect ratio. <br /> <br /> 5. Now just take your movie camera, take 40 best shots and let your “actors” mumble their shots behind the scenes. Don't worry about writing it in advance — just let the actors say whatever they want (like “Do you want to drink?” And “Let's have something to eat” - this is really all you need to fill in 8 minutes or so Togo). ). If you can't come up with enough dialogs - no problem! Just ask them to repeat what they say several times. If this is still not enough, just let the camera work. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, another masterpiece! As a bonus, if you want to distribute it over the Internet, no problem! Static images are compressed to zero with standard mpeg encoding - a 73-minute film is likely to be about 2-3 megabytes in size, even at the highest quality levels.
