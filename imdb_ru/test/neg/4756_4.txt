I love movies B, but from the very beginning I like to realize that I am watching one of them. I can not believe that someone can spoil a film about aliens and predators so badly. <br /> <br /> Aliens and Predator AMAZING. This movie made a big joke out of them. The creators did not take this film seriously. Iâ€™m completely disappointed with how the assholes of Strauss dealt with this film. They mocked the amazing characters. As if they were trying to be serious at the beginning, then their writers went berserk and surrendered. Almost nothing was continuous, the main characters were terrible and were NOT Foreigners or Predators. I feel so sad that no one else takes the Aliens and Predators seriously. These characters are icons of American pop culture, and the creators of this film showed no respect for the original films. They should not be allowed to cash in on the titles of previous films, and they should be ashamed of themselves.
