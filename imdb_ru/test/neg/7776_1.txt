Scary terrible movie for television. Once again, Lifetime brings us a predictable triangle; plotting a bitchy woman to get a stupid, not knowing wife of another stupid husband who doesn't have a clue. <br /> <br /> I get nervous when I see these films. You may ask why I watch them then? I have no idea. Usually by mistake. And the film is so bad that I can't get away from it. I'm waiting for the bitch to make her come to her senses. And, as a rule, I am not satisfied with the way she gets her only desserts. <br /> <br /> Now, if you can believe our fox, she steals the embryos from the clinic, and how can this be done? Without blood tests, DNA, references and recommendations. She continues to kill the real estate agent, Gabrielle Rose, who is next to her, in broad daylight in the courtyard for sale, and no one sees her? She kills her mother, Susan Hogan, and you can predict this assumption when the mother unconditionally mentions that she is allergic to peanuts, and that the pills to combat this allergy are in her pocket book. Guess what? I will not continue this. <br /> <br /> Finally you were left alone in the house with your wife and bitch. Good, good wins evil, but too slowly. Victoria Pratt as an evil friend in this role is adequate, looks too disheveled and obvious. Tori Spelling just stands, seeing almost nothing. She has Bette Davis big big eyes that look like they pop out of her head. I liked it more in TRICK. And Tamoh Penykett plays out her husband, assuring his wife that he and his former girlfriend also do not know anything, although he noticed that he is very friendly with her all over the city, he stands half-naked with her in his house, when he sends his wife to the city stay the night. However, he continues to deny romance. <br /> <br /> Lifetime never disappoints viewers with its meaningless stories and stories about women and their stupid husbands. I would like to give this chestnut a rating of "0".
