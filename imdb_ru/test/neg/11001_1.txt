I had to go through this movie three times while I was an extra zombie in the new movie directed by “After Sunset”. The first time I saw this film, the director was standing next to me, and a fake and cheeky hand jumped out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters. I couldn't take it anymore, laughing right in front of the guy. The film has no direction, and the only thing that could make this film worthy (Female nudity) was not found anywhere. I'm a fan of low-budget horror films, but that was too much for me. The worst thing was that I had to watch it so many times. Also do not expect the new film to be better.
