Because they all just watch MST3K with their artificial friends who make (mostly) not so funny and obvious comments about movies. And this is the only way these people watch them, and then comment and vote against them on IMDb, based only on this, they don’t even try to watch the movie on their own. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on my own, I didn’t read reviews at first, I didn’t have people telling me what to laugh at, I just got a DVD (bought for the back side of Morons From Outer Space, an old favorite ) and looked it up. <br /> <br /> Of course, I knew what I was doing when it was the film Golan Globe, the film by Albert Pune, but usually they can be quite interesting. <br /> <br /> The film is not too straining to the brain, Alice tells the story of the Rabbit Hole, which was done so many times, and in some way resembles in its basic structure (but completely in content) Warlords of Atlantis, another entertaining B-movie. <br /> <br /> The voice was annoying, but then it was an idea that they even put forward a few lines in the film. <br /> <br /> The hero-hero had one of the worst voices / accents. in English I am history, but you grow to accept it and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> This is not a good film, but this is not a very bad film, this is just an ordinary B-Movie DTV film, Nothing too new, nothing too outstanding, and it will probably get more pleasure from younger age groups (say, 7-14 years old) than from me. This is a little carefree fantasy. <br /> <br /> I’ll see it again, maybe not 10 years ago, I would have done it. <br /> <br /> Don't be so harsh in the film, because a couple of puppets also told you that this film does not take itself seriously, and, of course, there is no troll 2 or cosmic insurrection.
