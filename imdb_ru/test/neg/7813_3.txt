“There are some things you just don’t do,” says this thesis, the 2003 comedy by David Zucker, about a young man who ended up in one terrible situation after another, called “My boss’s daughter”. should speak both for people who made this garbage, and for those who are considering viewing it. In fact, there are some things that you simply do not do, with most of the content that you can find in My Daughter's Boss, which are completely considered elements that you simply shouldn’t do in the cinema, including them in your photo. , My boss's daughter is nasty; creepy; a grotesque experience, an awkward and heavy object, which is childish beyond words and disgusting beyond expression. Seeing it means tolerating it, tolerating it means surviving and surviving this achievement in itself ?? if any of the cast; writers; Additional services; Hell, even the guys who worked as runners on the set help in creating something as stunning as the Earth again, then it will be either because they were sent here by the devil himself to destroy the film, or will be because they most likely got a job on behalf of the Friedberg / Zeltser mob. <br /> <br /> My boss’s daughter (which I’m pretty sure should be called “My boss’s daughter”). "Grammatically) revolves around his unfortunate male hero named Tom Stansfield (Kutcher) and nights in his boss's house when he pursues that seemingly elusive" goal ", which is his young, blond daughter Lisa Taylor (Reid) - who Someone who works in the same department as him, in a towering office building in Chicago, under the scrutiny of Jack Taylor (Stamp) Tom spies on Liza early, she drives to the subway to work with all the other shmuses, despite that she has a car and that her father is the boss of this h fucking company. Trying to talk to her, but his attempts were thwarted by an emetic child and a dog for the blind, who are more interested in Tom's crotch than anything else, he finally gets his chance in the office when there is talk of a party after dark in another place and that he should come to her house to visit her - and yes, she still lives with her father. Think of the 1960 Hitchcock film “Psycho,” in which the gender roles of Norman Bates and his mother changed places and then played for laughter. <br /> <br /> A clear manifestation of character becomes painfully evident in the initial scene in which Tom sits on the subway. Train and travel to work with your yuppie cohorts. They are a ruthless and intelligent group, from which it becomes apparent, to swipe the unfortunates' portfolios so that they are stuck in the doorway to the next morning rush, without even returning them. Once this happens with Tom there, and he wants to return him, thus putting pressure on us, that he is not like the other guys (!) This is when he first sees Lisa in the carriage and is somewhat embarrassed to approach her like other people to the whole situation, as if they were in his position, it would be a breeze. This rather obvious and unsuccessful attempt to make us “side with” Tom is worried about what is supposedly required to earn a place among these employees in this company. <br /> <br /> This is true, however, as close as my boss's daughter approaches any level of filmmaking. From a seemingly harmless premise, when a boy meets a girl and wants to know her, comes the comedy from hell. Arriving in the house of Tom will not see that he was invited to a party, instead he was accused of sitting at home with his beloved owl Jack and, as a rule, does not allow harm, maintaining an immaculate house. It has been established that the character of Terrance Stamp means doing business in the strictest possible manner, dismissing people for the least things, like making a bad cup of coffee. The point is not that Jack is an astute businessman, he is a freak of purity; obsessed with control and border sociopaths in their arrangements of bear traps in the garden so that the children in the neighborhood would stay away from his land. You can imagine that when we let in his big and elegant house with orders that nothing should go wrong, obviously, there will be problems. <br /> <br /> The film has fun with this premise of danger for about ten minutes. The first time someone uses a tabletop to crack a beer, thus noting the pristine top, you can grin, but by the time half the house is destroyed and Michael Madsen found himself urinating all over the carpet, you already have a head with your hands. Each joke in the film is set up in an omnipotent, clumsy way, before it is played out in a way that is closer to slow and painful than slippery and error-free, the only thing missing is the sound effect of someone switching gears on the car, as it rattles and squeaks for the next dip. In between coarse tomfoolery, it takes time for a film to wind down a disgusting, saccharine-driven romance like Lisa and Tom Bond, while it’s about staff in the workplace and outside the workplace, and perhaps they have more total than initially thought. By the time, the film chose coarse jokes and hate filled with ridicule more than anything else, when there is a whole scene that exists solely for targeting paraplegics, and a blunt story associated with a sports neighbor with a head injury on a blind date, in which some are truly unforgettable sights deployed. Everywhere, the heroine Stampa likes to let people down and ask if the simplest tasks are not too difficult for them, what a common answer should have come during Jack Taylor's channeling: first reading the script is too difficult - a concept for you, Stamp?
