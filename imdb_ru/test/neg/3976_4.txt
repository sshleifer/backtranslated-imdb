The film was not really THAT bad, especially in the plot, but the gruff (and hairy!) Actor they chose to play the main role was a bit irritable in the acting department. I would choose someone else. The idea of ​​“going to America” was very ingenious, and the main character, who asked about everything he had ever known, made him somewhat likable, but not so much when the lead actor has pastries. <br /> <br /> The storyline was interesting. This raises the question of how the issue of cloning will be addressed in the future. Of course, cloning will not be allowed for the purposes of the film, but this is still a valid argument even today. The clones are still humans ... right? <br /> <br /> The film was not special, but it is still much better than some cheeses produced in the 70s. Let's not forget the "Invasion of giant spiders." I give him 4 points, as he DOES NOT FULLY stink, but the MST3K version turns this film into 10. (I still like Dr. Super Mario!) You will like this film, but it will not be your favorite.
