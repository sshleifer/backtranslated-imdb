This movie made my face hurt. I don't understand this ... things just happened, inexplicably, and they usually led to someone breaking into the number of a song and a dance. I do not understand how people can praise this film with praise. There are B-movies, and then B-musicals, and then there is Rockula. <br /> <br /> The songs made me slam into the wall. The only saving grace is that one of the musical explosions is a music video that relieves pain, but still cannot explain why it should exist. The most frightening part of the film is the creep dance of Tony Basil, accompanying her strange song. But, on the other hand, she manages to find the notes she is looking for, in contrast to the sensations of pop music Rockula (aka Rapula) and Mona ... wow, you can say, a dull tone. So if you want to question life for about 90 minutes, watch this movie. If you hate your life, then buy it.
