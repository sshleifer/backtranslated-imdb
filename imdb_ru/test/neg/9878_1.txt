*** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS **** <br /> <br /> I was very excited to watch Blood and Chocolate with my friends. I could not wait, because the book is one of my favorites. But as soon as the film began, I could not believe how much it had changed. At first I was fine, so both her parents are dead ... maybe everything will be fine. But then the rest of the movie came. When it was over, I was furious. Nothing was right except their names and the fact that Vivian fell in love with Aiden. By the end of the book, Gabriel was my favorite person for all times ... and then the film comes out and turns it into a complete, heartless idiot ?! The film also shows werewolves or werewolves, as these vile, evil creatures were, as the book shows, just wanting to fit in and keep their flock safe. They would never kill people for pleasure. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a film like them, they should give it a different name and name the characters differently. Because then I went out and watched it again and bought, but when I think about it, I see only the bad. You can't pay me to watch it again or buy it.
