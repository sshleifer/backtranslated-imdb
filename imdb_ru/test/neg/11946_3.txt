In fact, there is only one reason to watch this barely adequate and perfectly predictable film about an excited chef Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta-Jones), whose life changes when she inherits her orphaned niece Zoya (Abigail Breslin) after her sister died in a car accident. And the reason is to watch Aaron Eckhart (Nick), who, with his flexible haircut and attractive mannered behavior, looks good enough to slap between two pieces of organic pannini and eat with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette sauce and several finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes in the sun. He reminds me of Sean Bean. The idea that he could take off his shirt was actually the only thing that kept me awake until the end. He brazenly removed his apron several times, but, to my disappointment, he never went further. <br /> <br /> I can’t be too critical because I was watching him on a paid basis for watching the house, so it didn't cost me at least the price of two movie tickets, and I was raised to be grateful for small favors But in fact, this is the Rom Com in its most formal form. Zeta Jones gives a very smooth, monotonous idea, she felt that she absolutely lacked passion (perhaps because of the amount of time she obviously spent in the fridge in a restaurant? Thirty pieces there could not have been fun) and her face almost did not change the expression throughout the film. Abigail Breslin was pretty good as a niece, she was such an attractive little girl that she could not be criticized, and in any case I loved her in Little Miss Sunshine. Patricia Clarkson is always a good price, and I cannot blame her for being a restaurant owner because she looked very undervalued, considering what a good actor she is and how little she had to do here. But all this is so banal, most of the dialogue is banal, and the result is so obvious. This is the cinematic equivalent of paint by numbers, and Zeta Jones and Eckhart generate some heat on the screen. <br /> <br /> Nick loves Italian food (undoubtedly indicating his burning inner passion) and cooks to the sounds of Puccini. His appearance in Kate’s kitchen at 22 Bleecker (the name of the restaurant) predictably trembles her feathers, but his supernatural ability to communicate with her niece while preparing a pizza and building a Bedouin tent in the living room brings Kate and, despite several stumbling along the way, she eventually gives him his valuable property. No, not her honor. But her recipe is saffron sauce. <br /> <br /> I'm very unfair here, right? I mean, Rom Com is Rom Com, and we all know what we allow ourselves to do when we subscribe. But should it always be so mind-blowingly boring?
