Like most of you, I watched a lot of great movies; Between them, we often either voluntarily or by mistake find those films that are so meaningless that we think about the reasons for which someone can shoot them. This is exactly what I can say about the reward for the dead .... <br /> <br /> The least I can do is try to “warn” some of you. If you like to be entertained by movies because of the plot, game and intensity, you can choose something else. Now, this is not so bad ..... In fact, if all you need is creative film editing and unique angles along with original ambient music, than you think is normal. As someone who appreciates the plots of films, makes films and plays with them, the truth is that I thought that this film was so terrible that it was beyond words. I could easily find a place for it on my list of the worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> With regard to the participation of Val Kilmer in this, the truth is that he was given, most likely, for the service to the director; As a fan of some Kilmer films, I can't understand what his motive was for that. The film seems partly western, partly romantic ......... In the end, I am sure that most of you can agree with me that this is just a waste of our time. If you have not seen this film, I would recommend completely avoiding it.
