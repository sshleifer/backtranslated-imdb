I saw this film when it first appeared in cinemas in 1988, and although I knew that it was not award-winning, I liked it. It tells about how 5 ex-young scouts reunited to accomplish one task that they never had to perform as a child, namely, to climb a mountain. Whitehead. Of course, now all boys scouts have grown and developed their personality in different ways, but they were no different from what they were in childhood. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklin Ajay is still a kind of Dear Abby from the group, and Tim Tomerson is still the surfer dude of the group. Of course, the main star is Louis Anderson, the "true believer" in everything related to newcomers. He still lives in the same house with his mother, daily browses the beginnerâ€™s manual, is bold, respectful and clean, and it is he who brings others together for another grand adventure in exploration. However, their task is aggravated by the brothers Grunsky, the two above-mentioned hooligans, knocked out of the newcomers. By coincidence, they encounter their old lair and decide to wear them out a little, though harmlessly. Not so harmless are the three escaped prisoners who think that Pack 7 of the FBI intend to destroy them. Overall, the film still has charm pieces. Look, for example, at Richard Lewis, who is trying to get comfortable on a cot, and you really get funny. Upon further consideration, the entire film needed such observational humor. After all these years, he can not stand, but still remains guilty pleasure.
