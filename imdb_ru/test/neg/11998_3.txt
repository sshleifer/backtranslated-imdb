Wow ... I suspected that it was bad ... But now I'm just lost in words ... Honestly, none of my words can justify this film ... <br /> <br /> In any case, I will try to say something ... <br /> <br /> This is really one unique treasure. One of the worst. <br /> <br /> Lash La Rue - given his experience in acting - during the climax of the film during the whip battle with the sorcerer-zombie toltekami ... ??? No doubt a real genius. <br /> <br /> It rarely happens that I laugh out loud when I watch one movie. It happened many times with this. <br /> <br /> Accents of actors, men, accents ... And the dialogues that I heard, they say ... And the game itself ... I just could not help but believe what I heard. <br /> <br /> This fat uncle farted so loudly (when he went to the house with his little nephew) for no apparent reason ... <br /> <br /> Tits! Yes, there are boobs! And a woman's ass! In the bathroom, even a naked chick is sipping a beer ... <br /> <br /> He who “stretched his mouth over his face” - killed the bomb! The real highlight. <br /> <br /> The comedic aspects were just insane. I just could not believe what I saw and heard. For a while I even thought that they inadvertently shook their heads in disbelief. But about halfway through the movie, I began to understand the picture. Looks like it took me half of the film to stifle half of my brain to finally get it. <br /> <br /> It was very hard for me to believe in this film ... But I think it’s really good. One black chicken came up to a very tiny closet, opened it and said: “Wow, look at all the storage space!”. And she said it the way she wanted. I mean, this is a good dialogue and a good acting game, right? <br /> <br /> Yes, and perhaps there is no need to say: Knut Lash La Rue's skills suck a big ass in DARK POWER. It is really sad and miserable to contemplate. It's all part of a comedy, of course. Or wait, I could be wrong. No, yes, I am mistaken. Lash La Rue was amazing with a whip! It was an editor error. He ruined everything by cutting his eyelashes and all that. Or wait, it could be a cameraman. He filmed from the wrong angle ... Then why didn't Phil Smoot say anything? That's all, it's the director's fault. <br /> <br /> But this is a good movie. <br /> <br /> I just stop talking about it. In any case, I have nothing to say, except for the fact that I hope that my brain will recover from this experience ... soon.
