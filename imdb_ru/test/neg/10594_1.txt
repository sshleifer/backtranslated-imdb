The film was slow, the dialogue between actors / actresses seemed “flat”, and basically there was no character development in the story. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps wanders with a mad expression on his face all the time, sulk and basically looks annoyed at all. Danes do not have screen magic, and the character Ribisi is a cheater with whom no one wants to hang out, even if they are paid for it. <br /> <br /> Add a strange scene where Epps is supposed to dance with an old man, and you have something that could well be the worst movie in cinema history. <br /> <br /> I watched it on the satellite (thank God, I did not pay for it) and regretted that I did not. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and sort the box for underwear and socks if you need to do something, but there is a temptation to watch this movie when / if it appears on your TV. A horrible movie if you ask me, and I can usually say something good about any movie.
