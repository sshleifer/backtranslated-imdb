I place the blame for "Return" on anyone who liked the movies "Date" and "Epic Cinema". You folks encouraged Fox to continue releasing desperate mock movies, and now we’re faced with what may be the laziest and most desperate of them. The return can hardly be called a parody. Hell, this can hardly be called a movie. This is a comedy in theory, but not performed. No one, not even the people associated with this mess, could fool themselves into thinking that they are making a funny movie. Directed by Tom Brady ("Hot Chick") did something really awful here. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you can call it that, is focused on a man named Lambo Fields (David Kechner). When I heard his name in the first couple of seconds of the film, I realized that a long film was waiting for me. Funny names are rarely funny, and the more you hear them, the less funny they become. Lambo is one of the worst coaches in the world, but his best friend Freddie Weisman (Carl Weathers) gave him one more chance to coach the motley high school football team called The Comebacks. Lambe must not only lead the team to victory, but also teach them inspirational sports cliches. He expects his children to have bad grades and problems with alcohol, and makes fun of them when they do not. When it seems that the team has a chance to play in the big championship in the toilet game (this script was written by 10-year-olds?), Lambo is shocked to find that Freddie is the coach of a big rival team that his team is against. It turns out that Freddie only prompted Lambo to go to coaching because he wanted to lose Returns. <br /> <br /> “Returns” is a film so forced and pitiful that I could hardly believe what I was watching. Fake movies have recently become the “Find a Movie Link” game, and this continues the tradition. He tries to squeeze in as many references to other sports films as possible, but he either does absolutely nothing with them, expecting that we will simply show on the screen and laugh from familiarity, or try to be ridiculous and failed. face. Some of the films mentioned include Dream Field, Bend It Beckham, Rocky Balboa, Friday Lights, Stick To, Radio, Miracle, Remember the Titans, Brigade of Gridons, " Invincible "and" Down story: the story of a true loser. " But wait, was Dodgeball no longer a parody of inspiring sports films? So, in other words, we watch a parody of a parody of inspirational sports films. If it has any meaning for you, you are simply the viewer the film is looking for. Some of these films are mentioned in the plot, and some (for example, “Rocky”) are simply added for no reason, because the filmmakers tried to refer to as many films as possible. There are some that the film even feels the need to explain to us in its dialogue, in case we missed the obvious link. You know that the film has problems when it comes to telling us its own jokes. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the script of veterans of television and first-time screenwriters, Ed Yeager and Joey Gutierrez, do not even know the first and most important rule of the parody - you have to play it straight. Actors must pretend they are not in jest. The reason why classic Zucker Brothers films such as Plane, Top Secret and Naked Weapon are so gently remembered is that serious actors like Leslie Nielsen were shot (yes, he was serious actor before turning to comedy) and Robert Stack, and then threw them into funny situations. What is funny is that they behaved as if they were not in a comedy, and they had a stony face in front of the oddities around them. These films would not work if they played their roles extensively. "Return" proves it, because all the actors are forced to play their roles so stupid that they shout at us to laugh. David Kohner continues to swing his arms, bulging his eyes and screaming at the top of his lungs to such an extent that he looks like someone who knows that he is stuck in a dead-end comedy and is just trying too hard to pretend to have a good time, the film also does not understand celebrity cameo art (also an important factor when it comes to parody films). What kind of cameos do we get in “Returns”? Andy Dick and Dennis Rodman. <br /> <br /> By the time when the film had a completely unexpected and extremely meaningless musical number in the film “Don't Stop Believing”, for no reason at all, I was almost ready to go out of the theater door. I was the only person in my show, and I liked the idea of ​​this film, which was following its pitiful way to a completely empty house. I sat in the "Returns" and was not rewarded for my efforts. The sad thing is that Fox hasn't finished killing the parody genre yet. They have a parody of 300 coming out next year, called Meet the Spartans. I would say that this cannot be much worse than this, but I have seen the trailer, and I would not want your hopes to be realized.
