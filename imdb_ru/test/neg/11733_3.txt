Honestly, how hard is it to make a good remake? Obviously quite difficult! I was so excited to see this because I liked the original, and my friends watched it and said that it really sucks. Well, I finally see it and sooo disappointed. Well, the scene in the shower was more realistic ... which is why I gave her a 3. Otherwise, it really sucks. Vince Vaughn plays a terrible role playing Norman, he is too tight or something like that. I don't know, it was just awful. I do not see it!
