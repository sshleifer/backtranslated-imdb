Why do such “romantic” films that actually never go anywhere, always start (and probably end) with crappy jazz? This is not clever, and it makes it look like a bloody television film. This film was full, slow, boring, unoriginal, wooden and I said boring? <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford probably tried to be mysterious and rude, but he was just a creeping, muttering cop who seemed to enter the house of a woman of Congress, as if everything was fine when he behaved like a pervert - stared at Thomas with a perverted look, hardly bothering to talk. <br /> <br /> And why the hell do they always become British? actors put lousy accents - they play them because they are famous, and everyone knows that they are British just because they are famous!
