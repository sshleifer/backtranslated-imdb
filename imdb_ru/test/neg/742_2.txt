I'm afraid I did not like this adaptation. When I started watching it, I had a strange feeling when I watched a 70s TV series because of the filter and music. I did not like the final scene. Mr. Tilney looks dressed only in a vest. Jane Austen would never let go a gentleman without a coat. It seems that the producers have made a modern misinterpretation of the dream of a romantic girl. I much more appreciate the more modern JA adaptations that follow these details, which makes the BBC series so useful. Sorry, I look forward to the adaptation of 2007. I hope it will be better and show the advantages of Jane Austenâ€™s 20-year adaptations.
