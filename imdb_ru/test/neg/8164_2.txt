I love films of all genres, from big dollar shows to small indie projects. But even if we take into account that this garbage is 25 years old and its attempt to pay homage to the 1950s, it suffers almost from the aspect by which we judge films. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, I was reminded of a few “student films” that I had seen, an effort that required a creative approach to fill in the gaps, where funds were needed. <br /> <br /> In general, there is a chance that within 90 minutes of your life it will be much better. <br /> <br /> 2/10
