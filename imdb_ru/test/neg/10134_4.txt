Imagine that you are trapped in a dark medieval museum, and you are being pursued by a resurrected vampire and his manic companion. Where is the absolute last place you want to hide? I would say inside the supernatural device of the torture of the Virgin of Nuremberg, because there is a good risk that you will be cruelly stabbed to death. And yet the elderly lady in this film stupidly crashes into her spiky coffin. The Coffin with the Vampire is a rather disappointing continuation, as the director Fernando Mendez does not recreate the gothic atmosphere of the original of 1957, but focuses on comic situations and dialogues. No more sinister castles with a spooky web and dark arches, but confused doctors and clumsy helpers who provoke laughter instead of fright. The story begins at the last resting place of Count de Loveud, where an eminent doctor and a hired assistant steal a coffin to inspect the corpse in a private clinic. Naturally, the wooden pole is removed from his heart, and the vampire count comes to life again, immediately enslaving the petty thief to do his dirty work. The vampire looks after the beautiful patient in the clinic, and Dr. Enrique Saldivar must save her soul and destroy the bloodsucker. "Vampire Coffin" uses a limited number of locations, and there are very few actions. The whole film would actually be quite boring if it were not for some unforgettable episodes and decent acting performances. Nevertheless, the photo is amazing, thanks to the excellent use of shadows and darkness. This is especially noticeable in a scene in which the Comte de Lavood chases a young woman through the deserted streets of a small town at night. This is the only truly worthy scene of the entire film, the rest is rather mediocre and deja vu.
