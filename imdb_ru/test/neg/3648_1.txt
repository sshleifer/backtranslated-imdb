The feminist tract, in which, if you, the viewer, think that: i) wild animals rarely tame by singing, but instead attack, kill and eat (the line that the grizzlies never attack, if they are not provoked, is not a cry - if “provoked” means that it sees flesh); ii) homosexuality itself is immoral - and its adoption has almost always been associated throughout the history with signs of disintegration and disintegration of society iii) few women are bisexual (in this almost every woman seems to have no preference for either men or women)) iv) divorce much worse than infidelity v) the land is designed so that people can use it, develop it and enjoy vi) the mother of an adult son must keep in touch, like son vii) the mother raising her son alone is unhappy and infused viii) parental idolatry for ideals - this is good and useful ix) adults continue to be responsible for their sexual behavior, regardless of age and duty to participate in this most intimate and giving activities only within the most intimate and frankly sacrificial relationships: marriage - believe, you will NOT like this movie! In fact, this is a guy like Howard Stern, who was hit by a woman, Jane Fonda (for example, Rider-Electric). This is ugly because the values, ideals of the script are so harmful. <br /> <br /> I share other objections about strange things in the letter: a) why this man loses each of his girlfriend - because he refuses to reveal that his mother’s death and funeral led to the fact that he could not meet with them? It’s a mystery why he just keeps saying “it was personal” when confronted with angry and frustrated women. BUT? <br /> <br /> b) there is a huge inconsistency (i.e., the screenwriter wants it in both directions), telling us that the main character's mother loved her father for everything she had - and then we are told that was the only great love in her life - her lesbian girlfriend. <br /> <br /> (c) The underlying legal assumptions are nonsense. We are never told that the performer has any right to live in the property - she simply has to determine the time of entry into the position of the sole heir and the right to hold the property. However, the film somehow creates the impression that the performer is the rightful tenant of that madness. (Try to think about any executor of any will that uses the property of the deceased before the will is done - this does not happen). <br /> <br /> d) in this film it is assumed that women are equally attracted to men and women - this is just absurd. Thus, we are told: i) that the character of Penelope Ann Miller meets with other men near the end of the film - after having been with the deceased for five years - and before that has good relations with the main character, ii) that the housekeeper is the hero, after she had devoted her entire adult life to her kind husband, now meets another woman. iii) that one girl, frustrated by the main character, now "would like to try a woman." <br /> <br /> iv) that the male Transsexual seeks to meet the main character v) that the character Mary Kay Place naturally looked at other women in the college (“and they looked back,” she says with an idiotic triumphant flare ). <br /> <br /> This is all just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I agree with others about the sound of the DVD (I had to keep it at maximum volume and rewind it many times to understand the titles, phrases). <br /> <br /> This is a film of someone who truly despises the traditional heroics of any person, hates the notion that a person needs to raise a child, hates the idea that there is some necessary connection between marriage and sex. The film is being preached - and such propaganda of false messages does not suit.
