When “Deranged” was filmed, the filmmakers found it necessary to turn Ed Hein into Ezra Cobb, even though the resulting film was actually very close to the facts of the notorious incident. I guess it was enough that they thought they should change names and the like. <br /> <br /> “Ed Gein is a butcher from the plain” invents a true story retelling the Gein case, but in fact there is very little in history. Like a biographical film, this is a parody. If ever the film needed a change of names, then this one, much more than “Deranged”. This is as close to the real story of the crime as “Dirty Harry” to the real story of the zodiac kills. <br /> <br /> Okay, so apart from this annoyance, like in a horror movie? Well, like a horror movie, well, like a movie in general, it's pretty awful. One of the worst films I've watched in a few months. Problems flow like this: 1) Kane Hodder is amazingly mistakenly perceived as Ed Gein. Completely unsuitable in this part, Hodder just frowns threateningly. Very bad. <br /> <br /> 2) Kane Hodder is the best actor in the movie! The rest of the cast is pretty “amateur dramaturgy” and completely uninteresting. It hurts to watch how some plots are delivered. <br /> <br /> 3) It seems that occasional efforts to create a stylish film come from the Big Book of Cliches in Moody Cinema. You've seen it all before, better executed. In addition to the style efforts, the rest of the film industry is largely inept: the cameras are shaking, the framing is bad, the frames are too long, meaningless, holding back the pace ... which leads me to ... <br /> <br /> 4) goes on forever. It is less than 90 minutes in length, but sit through this ordeal. You would have sworn he ran for two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> 5) Ed Gein seems secondary. Basically, the film is dedicated to the family affairs of the newly formed deputy sheriff. Said deputy plays a terrible actor, on whose shoulders should not lie the film. <br /> <br /> Anything good about this? Well, Gore FX is very good. Some convincing wounds are on display, and cosmetics are generally excellent. None of this, however, compensates for the huge failures of the film. <br /> <br /> It doesn't even make any difference to kitsch, it's just bad; not pleasantly bad, not “so bad, it's good,” just really bad. A film that should be avoided and despised.
