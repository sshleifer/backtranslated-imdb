I do not understand why so many comments here indicate that this is acceptable entertainment. The stunning horror of this cinematic deformity can not be overestimated. I and my friend just watched it together, and I'm not sure that we will ever be able to have sex again. I'm not sure what was worse, skinny, unattractive cast, their extremely non-photogenic genitals, rancid attempts at humor, screaming sounds that pretended to be songs ... <br /> <br /> No, I know what was worst . Girls in green swimsuits with a green face mask, licking Alice to dry her, then suggest, in a spoiled children's speech, that they suck milk from her breast. It was the worst. <br /> <br /> Besides what happened to the nurses, and why do they have so many problems finding each other's vaginas? Why are all male actors gay? Why does Humpty Dumpty wag the dildo in the air and pretend to be its member? Why should my eyes see this? No words.
