A group of teenagers from handbags goes to the old mining town in the hope of finding gold nuggets. The only flaw in the enchanted scheme is that the ancient supernatural miner, who owns gold, does not want to part with his treasure so easily and therefore begins to send violators accordingly. <br /> <br /> A literally cliche-like dialogue, a terrible game, some kind of insanely terrible “southern dialect” and a lame unrecognizable killer, similar to Jeepers Creepers (without the addiction of the above-mentioned boys, naturally) combine to make this bitch almost unwatchable. Even the cult legend of actress Karen Black in a small role cannot save this aberration. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elina Madison shows (poorly lit) T & A <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br / <br /> Where I saw it: TMCX
