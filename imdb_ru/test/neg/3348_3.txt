Some guy named Karl Ramarevich with the help of telekinesis learns to live on even after death. He is buried in a mausoleum. That same night, Julie (Meg Tilly) should spend the night there to get into a group called The Sisters. And Karl's "power" in full bloom. <br /> <br /> Stupid movie. I saw it in the theater when I was 21, and, as a rule, I was bored. The PG rating should have warned me - this is a horror movie for kids. One REAL stupid scene at the end has a corpse smashing concrete to hit a young guy! First, the corpses are first placed in the HEAD, which makes it impossible to use the corpse with their hands, and no one can penetrate the concrete. When you notice such silly mistakes, the film does not cope with its work. <br /> <br /> He has two good scenes - two “Sisters” are “attacked” by floating corpses crowding them. One day, one of the sisters hit a corpse in the stomach - her hand enters the body and she cannot pull it out! This scene has stayed with me until now. And in the end there is a cute little piece of a corpse and a toothbrush (which made my audience laugh). But the rest of the film is a vague, boring memory. Only for children - adults will be bored. I give it 3.
