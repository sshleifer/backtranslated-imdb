The final version - the screenwriter (James Van Der Beek) locks himself in his apartment and falls into a psychosis, trying to write a horror script. Not a terrible premise, but a terrible performance. It looks like the first year of directing and writing, and probably is. Director's jump damn with all his might. It must be disorienting. What is annoying. So much so that little pieces of film are incoherent. The letter is predictable, and most of the ideas it suggests are not implemented (package with oranges). As if they didn’t have enough time, and they smashed it together at the Toronto Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This film is not overwhelming: “My God, he is so bad, he is good,” bad. It's boring bad and long annoys you. James Van Der Beek is not a terrible actor and holds the ship just above the water. But he is too normal for the psychosis that the film is trying to offer. He is just a closed guy who once sees people and hallucinates things, and then decides to act slightly insane. The reason follows the effect. Maybe something in the water. Now Darrin Lucio, who plays his “friend,” is a terrible actor. He shares the similarity with Chris O'Donald and even more annoying - superhuman achievement. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere created by the film is good (dull gray and gloomy), but this is the only thing that the film achieves that means nothing. This film wants to be Jacob's Ladder or the Machinist. This is not even a secret window. This neat girl in the classroom decides to turn into gothic. <br /> <br /> Not very terrible, but her stupidity will affect you. I already thought more about this criticism than the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> d
