“Alien” is a story about a foreign intrigue with Seagal in the center, like an undercover operative who has a package that everyone wants and wants to kill to get. The film is not inspired by a smaller number of ordinary fighters who put Seagal on the film’s map (shooting, hand-to-hand fighting, pyrotechnics, stunts, etc.), as well as a plot that is confused, uninteresting and full of meaningless filler. What happens there seems to be iconic and gratuitous, while Seagal, more and more like pork chops, wanders around this tasteless flick without expression and is boring, showing no improvement in acting ability. Somewhere near the “Flickering Man” or “The Fire Below”, Seagal’s clicks made a nose dive, and the “Alien” is only a continuation of this trend. Nothing here is worth watching except the most stubborn Seagal fans. (WITH)
