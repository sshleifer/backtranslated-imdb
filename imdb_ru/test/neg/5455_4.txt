“The bored television director meets black art and the astral projection of his girlfriend. Studying the ability to separate his spirit from his body, a man regains an interest in his life and a sense of well-being. Unfortunately, a person discovers while he is sleeping, his spirit leaves his body, and his uncontrollable body wanders through the streets in a frantic riot, ”reads the summary on the cover of the DVD. <br /> <br /> As it turned out, this synopsis is not entirely correct. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film begins with a dizzying “off-body” example of the recently-discovered experience of the “astral body” by the handsome director Winston Rehkert (as Paul Sharp); it also heralds the upcoming air battle. The young Andrew Bednarski (like Matthew Sharp), as a child, paints pictures of the Blue Man when his murder begins. The handsome detective John Novak (as Stuart Kaufman) discovers that the victims are related to Mr. Rekert. Mr. Novak’s investigation leads to the supernatural; a striking example of this is Karen Black (as Janus), with whom Rekert fears falling in love. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors do well; but the "Blue Man" is tied in a knot. Aka "Eternal Evil", his unsatisfactory history tries to be too clever for his own good.
