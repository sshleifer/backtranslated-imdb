I saw this film in a film club in Germany in 1970. Most of the participants were from the local private school where I taught. I had seen several Godard films earlier when I lived in France, and although they were not my favorites, I could at least understand them. The ability to speak French helped. <br /> <br /> The rather innocent beginning of Le Weekend soon turned into a kaleidoscope of images, very well, perhaps, too well photographed, which soon did not make sense to me. For me, films, like books, should have some clear meaning. This is not for me. I suppose I am not "in" feature films. Images still haunt me from the film. To this day, I refuse to eat rabbit meat, beloved by the French. Those who have seen the film can understand why. Yes, the topic of materialism has passed, but cannibalism, car accidents and all other scenes of destruction and horror only made me sick. I'm not sure if I went out to the end, but I, of course, wanted to. I promised myself that I would never watch another Godard film, and never will, and never will, consciously. <br /> <br /> My rating: nothing. It was the most disgusting film I've ever seen. Others may have been more inept, stupid or stupid. I forgot about it, and the scenes from this will haunt me forever.
