Oh my gosh, I will reveal a secret: this film stinks! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some graceful effects of dinosaurs that, for their time, were probably really fun to watch. Now they do not cut it, but they are not terrible. They are good enough to endure without laughing at it. So they just sit there, and I sit looking at it, not laughing, not thrilled, just, well, boring. It stinks! <br /> <br /> If I can train my Jay Sherman for a moment, the film really does. The box promises cowboys versus dinosaurs, and in a very general sense, it delivers. Guys dressed as cowboys fight a pair of large dinosaurs. But actually these guys are a bunch of women, and the hero is a loser (more on this later), and dinosaurs hardly frighten. The plot is yawning, and with this there are not so many technical problems that you can laugh at. Everything is just gray and soft. <br /> <br /> After some terrible night cinematography (shot in one and a half colors, as I called it), we get a story in which some people are involved in something. That was what I caught. Yes, and they are at the turn of the century in Mexico, so they at least dress like cowboys, even if they don’t behave like that. <br /> <br /> So a group of people who, I think, were people they go into the desert and stumble upon these dinosaurs (after they find a miniature horse ... I don't know, let's just move on) . Then the film turns into a truly pathetic robber of King Kong in the final act. At that moment I lost the desire to even keep my eyes on the level of television, and I regained consciousness. <br /> <br /> “Hero” is played by a guy from “Under the Planet of the Apes”. who, in fact, played the role of Charlton Heston, when Heston decided that he did not want to participate in the continuation. He was chosen the cause, shock o 'shock, he looks just like Heston. This is about all that he has for him. I was very upset when he was the hero of the film, because all he does is rage, a smirk, a bag of chick in the film (whose name is TJ ... unfortunately, she is not a prostitute, or, finally, the origin the name could be known) In the meantime, his friend kills all dinosaurs, saves the day many times, and what does he get for it? Not a confession, there is nothing! And he dies, sacrificing himself for his friends! They don’t even wait until they run away! <br /> <br /> Boring, long, slowly, with little pleasure, until the film decides to copy the King Kong script to your own, it is better to avoid this film, unless you enjoy the pain of falling anvil on the eyeball.
