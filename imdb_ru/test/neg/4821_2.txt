Licensing fees to view this trash, And pay for it hard-earned money? Without humor, without a hint of laughter, God knows how he won the BAFTA! <br /> <br /> We have been subjected to "Eastenders" for twenty years. When, oh, when the great British public sees this horrible soap, what is it for? Crass Pap! This program no more reflects the reality in Londonâ€™s East End than daily life in Beirut, and has never done so. <br /> <br /> True, which I know (real), kind, brave, hardworking and loyal. And one of their greatest attributes is humor. It was Isti who survived the worst of the London blitz and still stuck two fingers to Hitler. And what do we see on our screens for five days of the week (including omnibus)? Nothing but moans, cries, "dead people from the neck", weaklings, who seem to be doing nothing but sit in the pub all day, interrupting each other. What a great advertisement for Britain! Do the authors really believe in this garbage that they pump out? Obviously, public opinion of the public thinks so, but then I heard that, obviously, anyone can be brainwashed to believe anything.
