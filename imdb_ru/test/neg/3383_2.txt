What an absolute joke from the movie. In the case of this film, you would believe that the Duel meets Jeepers Creepers and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Three good films by themselves, and you might think using their plan, MM could not go far wrong. Well, this is what I thought, and I was very, very mistaken! <br /> <br /> We follow two college students who travel miles through the desert to get to the wedding. They pick up a girl (no, she doesn't take off her clothes), then they are pursued by the robber of the Leather face in the Monster Truck, which they aptly call F ** kface (AKA Monster Man). <br /> <br /> Admit it, Monster Truck is a very cool car, but less than exciting chase scenes destroy its potential. <br /> <br /> So MM decides that he has discontent with these guys and persecutions. they lose him for a while and stop at a bar full of amputees, then they go to the motel where the main character Adam sleeps with hitch-hiker Sarah (although they both wear underwear!). Then they are caught by MM, taken to his house, where they escape death and try to kill MM, but fail, hence the installation to continue. In addition to a small "turn", that's all. <br /> <br /> If you can pass the first 2 minutes ?? where Adam's friend Harley appears from the shelter behind Adam's back, trying to scare him, without explaining how Harley even got there, how long ago or how Adam could not even understand ?? without thinking that you already hate it, then you can just enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Monster Man has very bad cinematography and directing, which immediately repels. This is the film that you can choose as one of those films in a set of 20 horror films that you have never heard of. <br /> <br /> What is annoying is Blockbuster. Stock many of these low-quality films that are digitally filmed by some amateur students, and this is exactly what MM is doing (although IMDb claims this particular director was born in 1961). <br /> <br /> Throughout this film is brutal. The scenario, which the author clearly thought was funny, is annoying and childish. It seems that only one draft was written before they started to shoot. In fact, the script is terrible, most of the film seems to be improvised, full of boring, uninteresting conversations that are just fun or important to real people. Imagine that you filmed yourself and your friends, talking, of course, funny moments ?? YOU, but mostly it's rubbish. This is what the script looks like for MM. <br /> <br /> Don't look at his blood ?? it's pretty minimal, and there are much better horror movies (Bad Taste, Evil Dead, etc. ??). <br /> <br /> Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, even despite their joie de vivre and holes in the plot, are far superior to this. film. Compare the entry of Jeepers Creepers with the entry of Monster Man, and you will understand what I mean.
