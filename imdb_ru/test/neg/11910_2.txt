Jack Lemmon was one of our great actors. His performances in "Days of Wine and Roses", "In the Apartment", "Some Like It Hot, Missing" (to name the first ones that come to mind) were worthy of the nomination "Best Actor". His only victory was for Save The Tiger, and that is a shame. He falls into melancholy in science, but never balances it with the driver in his character. In fact, he made a similar hero much better by the end of his career in one note of Glengarry Glen Ross. <br /> <br /> Regarding the film, Jack Guildford’s wonderful support work as a partner for Lemmon and Thayer David as an arsonist does not make sense because the rest of the script is a mess of clichés of vignettes, anxiety, neurotic nostalgia and meaningless moralizing . It should be seen once as a time capsule in the experimental direction of the 1970s Avildsen style.
