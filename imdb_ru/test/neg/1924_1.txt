*** This comment may contain spoilers *** Warning: this does contain spoilers, which I saw at one time some pretty lame films. And this is only because I see about 80 films a year. I have to say that of these 80 films that I watch in the theater, maybe 5 is really good, 15 or 20 are not so good, 40 or 50 is good, and then maybe 5 or 10 is terrible . Here on Earth falls into the category to itself. This is one of the most predictable, violent, disgusting films I've ever seen. It is loaded with unattractive characters, offensive situations related to special topics after school, and enough fluff to make YOUNG AND WRONGLY look like an American BEAUTY. And I'm not unfair. This is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a rich, poor girl, poor guy and a small town who prepares fresh cookies for all his urban people every day. Are you already warm? Let me continue. One day, rich snot come to town with his new graduation present, which his father bought for him, and he insults a pretty girl in a diner, almost enters into a fight with her old boyfriend, and then chases him and destroys a small snack bar in which she works. Therefore, he was sentenced to fly in a small town, where he and the guy should repair the diner together. This gives us many opportunities to see Chris Klein without a shirt so that we can understand why the girl at the diner fell in love with him. He has a press !!! Oh and he is rich! And .... he is the biggest moron without respect for anyone. This is James Dean, he is a rebel who doesn't care! He is rude to everyone in the city, he does not want to communicate with someone who is trying to be kind to him, and he behaves like a spoiled rich guy. But Lily Sobeski still falls in love with him. There is no reason why she does it, she just does. Oh, sorry, that's right, I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet as she. Well, if it doesn't get wet, then I don't know what will happen. <br /> <br /> Here, on Earth, there are also some of the most predictable moments I've ever seen in a movie. There was one moment when I left the theater to take popcorn and read graffiti on the bathroom wall, and I told my bride exactly what was going to happen in the next ten minutes. On my return, she just laughed and said that I was right, even when I said that there would be a dance scene. Moreover, she suddenly got cancer. This is the most beautiful cancer patient I've ever seen. Have you ever seen a cancer patient slowly die? They lose weight, they lose their hair, their gums begin to rot. This is not a beautiful picture. Sobieski glows after she gets cancer, as if she is pregnant. What an insult to people who watched as lovers slowly die from this disease. And how can you get cancer of the knee by falling into a field? <br /> <br /> Now I understand that I have seen too many films, and this sometimes leads to the fact that my cynicism begins to rage, but this is ridiculous. There was nothing that could please in this film or the character Chris Klein. He is a jerk, he is nasty, and he never tries to make peace with someone around him. Here on Earth, this is not only a bad film, but also an irresponsible one. It got 4.2 on the IMDb voting chart, and that is too high. This makes it difficult to write a script, and the one who gave the green light to this work should not only lose the job, but should promise never to step on the script again. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10, and this is generous. This film should be shown in film schools, how not to write or shoot a film. <br /> <br /> If you are bored and you really need to do something, and you choose to clean a farm filled with cow dung, or watch this film, choose to clean the cow dung. It smells better and you feel that you have done something good with your two hours.
