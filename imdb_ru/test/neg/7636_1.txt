Judging the film only by landscapes, scenery, costumes ... it’s just wrong, you lack the essence: HISTORY <br /> <br /> The film should tell something, tell something. it impresses you. Yes, I was pleased with the sea, rocks, clear water and all that, but ... Is there a plot? <br /> <br /> These are more interesting films with crazy people, such as: “FLIGHT TO COLLINS” S NEST ... etc ... and so on. It's about a crazy woman who is more attached dogs than to their children or husband. Just a clear psychiatric case !!!! Nothing extraordinary. Sorry, a waste of time. And is all this rage emanating from? Smell of fish? Sea?
