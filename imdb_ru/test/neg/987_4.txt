*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW *** <br /> <br /> What a long and mostly uninteresting movie! Who were these characters? Why I did not care about them? If I'm going to watch a movie for two hours, I would like to take care of someone or something. <br /> <br /> We know that Salvatore dreamed of the wealth that can be found in the new world. In addition, we learned little about most of the hopes of his family, fears, and so on. When they went on an adventure into the unknown. <br /> <br /> And why was Lucy even in this movie? She said little; we knew little about her or what she was doing (she was forced to serve men in exchange for being allowed to board the ship?) or what plans did she have when reaching New York. To those who can assume that she was needed to emphasize the fact that a single woman, no matter how cultural she was, could not get to this country alone, I say that this fact is not a sufficient reason to give her so much time. This thought could be done in five minutes if Lucy were an instant character. <br /> <br /> Another questions: why was the twin brother not in the boat to meet the family? We heard about the brother, and some kind of conclusion on this issue would help to give the film cohesion. Also, how long did the journey from Italy to New York last? Given the conditions on the ship, it will matter to the viewer if the journey took five, 10 or 50 days. (Someone said something about seeing the earth once a week, but I think it was when they were on the way.) I needed these types of parts to better appreciate, through what they went through. <br /> <br /> The only scene I really liked was when the boat, filled with passengers, left the dock. <br /> <br /> If you decide to rent this movie, do it with a remote control in your hand; You may need the “Fast Forward” button. <br /> <br /> Finally, can I suggest that, with the right voice transfer, useful information about the time and circumstances for immigrants should be provided, especially during slow endless periods, shots from the countryside, people walking, etc This film could be an interesting documentary television documentary.
