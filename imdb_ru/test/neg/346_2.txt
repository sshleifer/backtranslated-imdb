I think you canâ€™t imagine how these people really work ... !! Before I came to the studio to see how the guys work there, I thought exactly the same as you. But since I saw and did the work that the guys on this TV show must do, I must say that they really deserve respect for what they do all day. This is really hard work. As well as actors who in your opinion can be terribly bad, really wonderful people, and many of them can really act! I don't think the material given to them can really show it, as I think this material is not very good. But THEY are really good! So I do not think that you, before you saw how these guys do work there, can judge them! And I should not have tried them before I met them, but I did and now I am terribly ashamed of it. So please do not allow yourself to judge these great people if you have not seen them doing work there.
