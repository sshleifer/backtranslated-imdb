Coen Brothers imitator from screenwriter / director Paul Chart relies too much on ideas drawn from other (better) films, but at the same time has managed to create an eerie atmosphere that allows you to watch what is happening. Robert Forster begins to play like never before, playing a psycho psychiatrist (haha) who kills in the desert. The film is unusual, but, trying to keep one step ahead of the audience, it becomes alienated and repulsive (with the role of Amanda Plummer, which is completely humiliating). Admittedly, the finale of Bravura, a lot of unusual cases - and Forster looks great in the nude - make it a matter of curiosity, nothing more. Veteran filmmaker Irwin Kershner, and perhaps should be the director (can Paul Chart be a pseudonym?). * 1/2 of ****
