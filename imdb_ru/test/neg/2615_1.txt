AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHEN DO THE DANGER STOPPING? This is what I said somewhere between the beginning and that other part of the film that really sucks. This movie almost ruined my whole life, and I watched some really bad movies. Based on a real Puppet Master fan, I would expect to say this myself, but this is true. The plot is insane, the effects are awful, the soundtrack is the worst, the hellish buzz I've ever heard. Oh! I almost forgot about acting, it was so bad that I forgot what it was all about, said Nuff. The only saving factor in the film is the puppets themselves, they are really stars and can surpass everyone except Guy Rolf himself (he is the master of the puppets), and although you can see their wires and strings, they endure me throughout the painful start. . In conclusion, PM7 is recommended for true fanatics who are masochists. <br /> <br /> roach <br /> <br />
