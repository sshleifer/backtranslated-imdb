Other commentators have called this film "classic science fiction of the 1950s" with clever use of video and documentary videos and clever interaction of characters. <br /> <br /> Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a classic 1950s SciFi ... but the 1950s SciFi is the worst dumbest worst option. <br /> <br /> Note that the first prey of the praying mantis is a radar station, shown first from the air and then from the ground. ... but the station (from the air) is depicted as at the top of a mountain, with snow on one side and semi-luminous dark earth on the other, but when (on the ground) investigators visit the site, it suddenly turns out to be on a flat surface Uniformly white plain a few miles from the nearest mountain. <br /> <br /> Consider also the absurd pseudo-scientific babble of a highly recommended expert who was led to examine a huge claw. He says: “Well, we know one thing ... it could not have come from an animal, because every known animal species has a bone skeleton. Even reptiles and birds have bones. ” He then goes on to say that some creatures ... snails, mollusks, insects ... do not have bone skeletons. Excuse me? Let's define an "animal", here. Even in the 1950s, no one over the age of six could consider this person to be a biology expert, since he clearly does not know what an “animal” is and cannot name several broad categories of animals that do not have bony skeletons. (Sharks, rays, jellyfish, insects, mollusks, arthropods, gastropods, sponges, arachnids, echinoderms ... You understand.) Characters - cardboard, 2D types: scientist, girlfriend, girlfriend, big bad monster. Nothing here shows any sense of creativity. No pulse, no sign of life. <br /> <br /> There are no witty dialogs here, special effects are stupid even for their time, and the footage is used with reckless disregard for continuity. This is a B-movie, created in the worst possible way, with a production team that obviously cannot bother trying even hesitantly. <br /> <br /> Use sparingly as a sleeping pill or punishment for small children who are easily offended by bad science.
