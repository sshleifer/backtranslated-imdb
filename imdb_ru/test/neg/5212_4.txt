I saw this recently at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival, and I cannot believe that this is the official performance of Sweden for the 79th Academy Award, which will be considered the best foreign film. Producer Anna Anthony last year also received an official application from Sweden for the best foreign film from Zozo. I personally was not a fan of Zozo, but at least it had some value for production. This could be made as a film about a school project. Like a short film, he may have worked, but as a feature film, he is lost just like his characters. This is a story about fifty-twenty friends who live in a small Swedish town and have no goals, hopes or ambitions for the future and love to live in the past of their long-gone childhood. In fact, Falkenberg does not look like some remote northern Swedish village. This is a popular summer resort with a population of almost 40,000 people in the city and villages, located between the two large southern coastal Swedish cities of Gotborg and Malmo. The characters are nice enough guys, but if they were children of older school age with a grim or confused attitude to what they plan to do in their lives, I would undoubtedly care more about them. However, they had long passed the stage when they should have made plans for adult life. If they want to stay in Falkenberg forever, then surely there must be some jobs in the tourism or fishing industry instead of just riding a bike, drinking, smoking marijuana, and sometimes painting the house. Perhaps if they were hanging out with a girl or two in the circle of their friends, who are not at all in this film, which does not make sense. Jesper Ganslendt makes his debut as a director and wrote the film with the cinematographer I freely use, Fredrik Wenzel. the action is not so bad. I would give 4.5 points out of 10, but despite the fact that it was submitted for consideration to the Academy awards, I would not recommend it.
