Now I am a big fan of animation - I love Swankmeyer and usually enjoy all applications of stop motion, so I had high hopes for that. Then I went to IMDb and paused - I am always suspicious of films with a bimodal distribution of votes on IMDb. Here we have another one - a bunch of 10s (shill anyone), and then a few very low ones. I am also suspicious of dozens with the word "seer" in them. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are seers, but this character is not one of them. Despite my forebodings, I saw this film and had to take the side of those. The stop motion animation was fine, but the plots were commonplace, and overall it seemed amateurish. Treat yourself to a real bargain, get a little Swankmeyer and leave it to also run on the shelf.
