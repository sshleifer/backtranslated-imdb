What we are given in this trendy film about trying to be a “young man” is a “brotherhood of friends” from college, which is now about 30 years old (which we all know about, of course, their generation considers it the “new 20”). Consisting of four guys and girls, we imposed the following types on us: outwardly “unemployed” and frequent drug users, as well as one person who works successfully and the one who tries to be. They all drift in their own way, trying to find a future and emotional happiness. With one, perhaps two, exceptions, these are people that this browser will definitely never want to approach modeling themselves afterwards. There is frustration after disappointment after frustration in almost all their lives. Except for the case of one person (who appears on the way to his search), neither seems to be aimed at emotional satisfaction in his / her life. And now, about the only sincere moment in this film, when a knock on the door leads to the person answering him, unexpectedly and sincerely, "I love you." <br /> <br /> With the exception of the exceptions mentioned, these people are those who hardly deserve or deserve the several hundred thousand dollars spent on presenting their stories. <br /> <br /> ps. Writer / director Johnson is definitely having trouble with showing gay sex scenes. --- without such problems in the presentation of more long and revealing heterosexual. Why can this be? <br /> <br /> ****
