From the title, tag, summary of the plot on DVD, etc. I was expecting something, at least a little epic, with historical fiction and a novel that would amaze you; this is what they did in The Last of the Mohicans, for example, and I think they did an excellent job. Maybe I had too high standards for this film, and I did not give him that chance. But the landscape was barely fine (how could they not have come up with something more beautiful when they had such landscapes to work with?), Two lovers had no chemistry, and the plot was so predictable that it seemed that It was compiled after 5 minutes by twelve - and not very creative. Nouvelle-France is a love story taking place in the historical age. But the story of “New France” is hardly secondary, and the love story is banal and unable to make the viewer take care of the fate of the lovers. Surprisingly, the only good moments in the film stem from something completely unexpected and unintended: the relationship between Marie-Loup, the heroine and her children (one natural, one adopted). If they had focused on her family and forgotten a love story, it would be a much better movie. Parents of Marie Lupi should have spent more time on the screen and character development, the policy pursued in Britain should have been more than a three-minute scene, practically unrelated to the others, a rotten villain should be either more developed or removed. completely out of the script (why hire actors like Vincent Perez, Tim Roth or Jason Isaacs to use them so badly?) Poor work overall.
