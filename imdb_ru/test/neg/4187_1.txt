Well, take me aside. I have not seen such a bad home movie since the horrible 13 SECONDS or HALF. Someone has to pick this guy's sony handycam! This film proves that the fact that you can make a film on a video camera for $ 20 does not necessarily mean that you have to do it. <br /> <br /> I remember one of the things that Robert Rodriguez wrote in his book “Rebel” “Without Crew” was that when you decided to use the function without a budget, you must use all your assets . Rodriguez says that you need to make an inventory of all the locations and props that you can ask for, steal and borrow from your friends. Robert Rodriquez was friends with the mayor of a city in Mexico, so the mayor allowed him to shoot everything for free. In EL MARIACHI, you got a movie that looked much more expensive than the actual budget. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the director of this film has a copy of this book, and he took her advice to the heart. In this case, he was obviously friends with the guy who owned the cornfield, where they organized a haunted house every year. Looks like a pretty good place for a scary movie, but it's hard to keep an interesting field for 90 minutes. Not a single batch of the KUKUR KIDS series spent more than a few minutes on the corn field. Hitchcock spent only about ten minutes in one in the NORTH-NORTH-WEST. Take at least a hint, man ... corn fields are not suitable for an exciting movie. It would be nice if the director had more friends with more places, because after the first 15 minutes this thing becomes quite tiresome. It looks like a movie costs about 30 dollars. (or how much it cost when entering the cornfield maze). <br /> <br /> Apparently, he could not even find someone who could play in his film, so he played himself. Big mistake. Here's a thought, if you really want to make a movie, find an actor. So, with regard to assets, it seems that the maze of the cornfield is the only thing that the poor man had. Maybe he thought that was enough. In fact, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I KNOW that he thought that was enough, because the film before he won the cherished honor of being a continuation of DARK HARVEST was simply called “Mais: Movie.” Maybe he is already planning MYS: MUSIC or even MYS: MINI SERIES. <br /> <br /> Our Jack of all trades (and yes, part of this statement “Master of Nothing” is definitely appropriate here) is played by a psychic who can tell when something bad happens. Think of a character from DEAD ZONE, but not about such a good actor as Christopher Walken or even Anthony Michael Hall. Psychic dad feels that his two daughters, who are in a corn maze with his mother, will be killed. He is in a hurry to save them. From this point on, the entire film goes to the way Dad Pisic runs around the corn field in search of his two daughters. He finds two ghosts of a little girl from the "Shining" and helps to unravel the mystery of their murder. <br /> <br /> Filmed on Handycam for $ 200. The director threw himself. Edited on iMovie. Improvised story. If this is not enough to keep you from this monstrously banal catastrophe, consider it as the last warning ... ALL FILM occurs in a corn field, boils and ghouls. Here is Guli Guru's advice on how to save some money and at the same time feel that you have seen this movie. The next time you see a corn field, stop the car. Take a flashlight and run there for about 90 minutes.
