Watching this movie, you just have to ask: what do they think? There are so many bad parts in this film that you may feel that it is intentionally as poor as some kind of joke. <br /> <br /> I think the worst part of the film is directing. In this film, there are so many poor uses of angles and other cinematic elements that are ridiculously bad. The funniest example of this would be at the beginning, when party guests receive their invitations by email - the same camera angle is used for each picture (which lasts an awkward 2 seconds), and the same computer screen with the same desktop / window appears / program, etc. It even looks as if the thing is shot on the same set every time. The whole sequence was also completely quiet, without music and sound effects. Overall, it was a bad way to convey the idea that an email was sent all over the city. <br /> <br /> If you listen carefully, you may notice that the music sounds very similar to other movie soundtracks. This is not surprising - most of the songs, including the one that opens the film, are in fact small changes in scores from other films (see if you can guess which ones). I also noticed that the music is not performed by a real orchestra. It sounds as if it was written and played through a low-level midi keyboard. If you are familiar with LucasArts SCUM adventure games, the timbre of each instrument sounds like something from the IMUSE engine. <br /> <br /> Everything else in the movie just sucks. The game is terrible. The script is derived (Ferris Beuller?). There is nothing funny in a movie, unless you consider the whole movie as one big joke played on a paid audience. Don't give it up. Don't even watch it when it is restarted in a comedy. Just forget about it - it's terrible.
