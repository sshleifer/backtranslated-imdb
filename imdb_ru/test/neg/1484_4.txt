Perhaps the time has come to declare 2007 as the International Year of Cinematic Crocodile! At first, a ridiculous “Primitive” appeared about a crocodile named Gustav (!), Managing the swamps in Burundi. Then there was Lake Placid 2, a low profile TV-made sequel to the forgotten original. Thirdly, there is this incredibly derivative and lulling slice of Australian horror, and, finally, I have yet to see the promising “Rogue”. The latter is likely to be the best, given the involvement of Australian terrible talent of Greg MacLean ("Wolf Creek"). “Black Water,” of course, is not a waste of time and film, but this is another rather meaningless film about survival that confuses agony in real life with horror. I apologize for my harshness, especially since I, frankly, pity the people who have gone through this test, but depicting three characters sitting on a tree and whimpering for more than an hour is not my idea of ​​explicit expectation! Three young people travel around Northern Australia and decide to spend the day fishing in remote marshes. It does not take long before a giant and ferocious crocodile overturns its small boat and devours the guide. Grace, Lee and Adam barely manage to escape from the hungry teeth of the reptile, climbing the tree. Despite the fact that most of the time it remains invisible, the crocodile patiently lies in waiting and does not allow them to leave the swamp alive. Yes, it really is very similar to the plot of "Open Water". Replace the numerous invisible sharks with one giant invisible crocodile, and the open sea - with an equally inevitable Australian swamp, and here you have it. Well, okay, "Black Water", at least, has some rare moments of excitement and one impressive water monster. I must say that the crocodile looks fabulously cool, and you anxiously calculate until the next time it wildly comes out of the water. The three-headed actor is doing everything possible to maintain interest in his characters, but how to achieve this by sitting in a tree all the time? The concept based on real events obviously causes a number of limitations, such as limited images of fantastic shooting locations, dialogues, and pretty character drawings.
