How awful is that? Let me count the ways: 1) This is a “click and change” film, which first tells about the UFO investigation, and then turns into sales pressure work for Christianity. C'mon! If the creators of this film reacted so strongly to their message, why disguise it? This annoys unbelievers and pushes the fence in the opposite direction. 2) This is not even a good sales pitch! If the characters of this film asked me to go to church with them, I would run like hell in the opposite direction. They are scary! 3) The game is terrible. They all behave as if they were in an educational film about workplace etiquette. 4) Cinematography is a bad home movie. Wait, in fact it is not even so good. 5) The script is bad, bad, bad. All dialogue, no action. Like a tennis match, they bounce back and forth between a close-up of the talking head. 6) Direction ... in which direction? Oh, there must have been a director somewhere. I urge you to find out where. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, I have some positive reviews about this film. Editing seemed professional, but nothing had changed. Good editing of bad material is still a bad movie. The initial theme of the music was actually very good! Very scary and UFO. It is a pity that the film is not about UFOs. <br /> <br /> If you can’t tell, here’s the bottom line. I wasted my money watching this movie and it made me angry. If they had not disguised what this film really is about, I would say that it was my fault.
