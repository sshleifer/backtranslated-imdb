The aging Roger Moore is back as Bond, this time trying to figure out why Agent 009 was killed, and why he had a Faberge egg fake with him, and where he came from. He enters New Delhi, India, then East Germany, learning of a Russian general trying to detonate a circus nuclear bomb, hoping that NATO will seek complete disarmament so that it can take control of Western Europe and then the rest of the country. world. <br /> <br /> In spite of how it sounds, I think that between Bond and Octopus this is more of a romance than an action movie, and long, but still quite funny. But there are too many attempts at humor; sometimes it seems that it was intended as a comedy. In addition, Timothy Dalton would be better than Roger Moore in this, so there would not be such a big difference in age between Bond and Octopus. <br /> <br /> Useless stuff: a small plane used by Bond in a series of pre-loans now hangs out at Quaker Steak and Lube in Clearwater / Largo, Florida, USA. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of ****
