I know that many people automatically / gave this film a rating of 1, simply because it does not have a huge budget and the best special effects to which they are accustomed. I, however, knew what I got into when I put it in the video recorder. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t think that we will get much lower budget than this one, unless we remove family reunion. The lighting is terrible, the sound quality is sometimes incomprehensible, and the game is very bad for almost all participants. BUT, this is still a funny movie, and the plot is quite interesting. It centers around a guy named Tom Russo (Asbest Felt) who was unlucky with his work. He is very protective of his wife and does not allow her to work, putting even more pressure on himself. When he begins to work more hours, we see how he slowly turns into madness and obsession, and he begins to suspect that his wife is cheating on him, and begins to brutally kill various men (most repairmen) whom he considers responsible. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the bloody effects are extremely cheap, but correspond to the general tone of the film .. The brutal ways that Tom Russo comes up with to kill these people give us an idea that he is crazy. The pace of the film is also very good, and here is rarely a boring moment. The final really does not match the rest of the plot of the film, as it seems that he wants to move from a psycho-slasher film to an imitator of Dawn of the Dead, but nevertheless it is interesting, and I have to give Tim Credit Ritter for wanting to use an unconventional ending . <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I liked this movie, but this is by no means a good movie if it makes sense. His budget is a major stumbling block, and the consequences are too great to lose sight of. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this to people who are completely spoiled by big-budget films and cannot be open to ultra-low budget films. You just do not like it. For others and blood lovers - I say, do it. You will find at least Something redemption in this! <br /> <br /> My rating: D
