It was so bad, I want God to give me an extra two hours of life when I had to put up with it. <br /> <br /> First, the acting skills were equally bad. There was almost no plot, unless the “Story about a shaggy dog ​​with a guy in a poncho from the rain and a skeleton mask instead of a dog” does not matter. <br /> <br /> Editing was ubiquitous, and slow shots of “blood” (red corn syrup flying through the air — no doubt thrown with a spoon) were irritated after the tenth time and infuriated after the hundredth time. <br /> <br /> I like Michael Rucker. He did a good job. It was not good. It was less than good. And I mean, it sucks. Heavy. <br /> <br /> For God's sake, do not watch this movie.
