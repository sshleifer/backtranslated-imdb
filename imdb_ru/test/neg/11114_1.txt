I watched this movie, knowing that it would be terrible, but damn it, if it does not open a new and revolutionary foundation in the field of taking feces as entertainment. The plot of Deep Rising with rough effects and terrible game. The lines in this ... well ... wow, there really is no way to postpone this movie, because I think the words are not yet created in English. The sad part is that the filmmakers thought they were really doing something good. You will not believe your eyes when you see how many films they have ripped off, not even trying to hide it. There are scenes / story devices directly from Deep Rising, Alien, Jurassic Park, Predator, Jeepers Creepers, and the list goes on and on. However, unlike any of these films, this film does not match the celluloid chair. The most amazing thing about this film, besides the fact that he is trying to be competent, but fails, is that Gimli, damn it, in him. How the hell can they afford John Rees Davis, but not decent effects, scripts, actors or scenery. Really terrible ... and not the type of bad that is good.
