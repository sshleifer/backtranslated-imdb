Inuyasha was terrible. This show was incredibly exaggerated, but it's just a boring bunch of anime clichés. Characters are annoying and lifeless, the storyline is boring and endless. I think it would be something interesting if he had better writing, but it seems that the writers are more intent on the show of Inuyasha and his stupid friends to fight some monsters, and then cry again and again about their tragic love affair. a triangle with Kiky and Kagome and many circles around the same thing. The script is stupid and stupid, and the animation is bad. Character design is very ugly, I don’t know why everyone likes it, everyone has the same face! Big eyes, tiny noses, a line like mouth and typical anime haircuts. I find Inuyasha incredibly boring and dull. It should be one of the most overpriced animated shows ever made.
