I'm not sure if it is a comedy or not, but I found it quite funny. Isobel is obsessed with the devil. Somehow a perverted priest and gardener will fix this. Partly exorcism and partly a soap opera - at least you laugh. There is a paranoid jealous dad, a satanic sister, the mother of the Valley of the Dolls, and then the cowboy guy; all to help the skirt, the pursuing priest, fight the demons of dear Isobel. Sometimes it was like an episode with Jerry Springer, but I really paid to see it. Instead of twisting his head, swearing sailors and crucifying a crucifix, as Regan did in the Exorcist; You get a lot of Isobel jumping on her bed, like it's a trampoline hiding in her closet and jumping from a hayloft. Yes, this is Chuck E. Cheese is crazy. So, if you want to watch a horror movie with a quote and a quote that costs a bit of laughter while you wait for the predictable end ... this is your movie.
