There is a fine line between being theatrical and just being forced. Forced action. Forced double. Forced plot. Even a forced photo. There are people who say that “the film develops this way because it’s from Asia,” but I don’t see any coercive elements in Seven Samurai or Sonatina. There is a fine line between being fiction (and every work of art is, in its own way, fiction) and just incredible. On a more personal level, I just don’t feel anything with the film, it doesn’t take me anywhere, and I just can’t believe in a fictional world, it’s offered. This is simply not good, there is something in it or through something that simply does not click.
