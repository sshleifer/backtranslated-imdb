This film was chosen, frankly, like a pig in a bag from our local video store. It turned out it was a pig. The storyline - as it is - was incoherent, inconsistent and predictable. Actors constantly looked confused, pronouncing poorly written lines. The only fun moment in the entire film revolved around the dangers of smoking and the unintended deployment of an airbag. The rest of the film did not have enough to amuse my little daughters (less than ten years old), me, my wife, my mother-in-law, or even a cat or dog. My advice, if you want to borrow this turkey, it will save you money and your time. Look for something else ...
