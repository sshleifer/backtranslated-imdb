I remember when they made a big deal about it when he went out. They showed clips every week on WWF TV, and everyone was excited. He debuted on the first weekend at number two after Indiana Jones and Last Crusade. Then he dived. Critics hated this movie. I do not remember to see one good review. Everyone agreed that it was bad, and sometimes grotesque. I didn’t know what they meant at the time, but now I understand that the movie mentions gay bars, women are severely beaten and almost raped, and bar-rooms with crowded urinals look disgusting. When I was younger, I didn’t care. It was Hulkamania, brother !!! <br /> <br /> Now I find it pretty bad, but from time to time it’s fun to watch him when paired with Bodyslam (with the best storyline). First, Hulk Hogan’s acting skills are simply not great. he is one-dimensional, like a character played in a wrestling ring. And in fact, Rip and the Hulk are not far away from each other. Kurt Fuller is a good actor, but he plays the bad guy badly. He is better in comedic and nervous drama characters. He is simply implausible, like Brell. In this film, there is no special character development, and the characters Randy, brother Rip and trainer Charlie suffer (in the struggle of his unheard-of coach, escorting the fighter to the ring, laughs). Tiny Lister plays Zeus the way he should be played, so there are no problems here. Joan Severence is tolerable, and for all of you, erotic dogs, she has a scene of underwear, laughs. In the end, you understand what's the point? <br /> <br /> In this (as in other wrestling films or in films where wrestlers are depicted as the main star), turn off your brain. You will like it more if you do.
