Sorry to throw out such a good idea. The main idea of ​​the film is a journey to the past lives, which, fortunately, is not a journey through time, but a journey inside a person that has nothing to do with the past or the future. (Perhaps they should not be called past lives in the film at all, when I think about it ... One more minus, I think). It's all in the present, in a different space ... Very interesting, without causing a lot of religious experience. <br /> <br /> However, the music is completely repetitive, melodramatic, sentimental and inappropriate (not to mention "Western"). “!). There should have been more variety and more thought about where the music should be and where not. Memories of romantic scenes take up a lot of space and time and are completely unnecessary. The game is not bad, although the language prevents me from better understanding. <br /> <br /> I think the idea needed a little more thought, development and development. Indoor scenes could have better background settings, because in many cases they seem unreal. In general, I would say that this film leaves much to be desired ...
