I usually criticize twenty Neanderthals for failing to appreciate a film if there are no plastic duels, shootouts and car chases in it. However, in this case the film could be improved with some of these additions. At least an hour later I would not get bored, and I changed channels. <br /> <br /> I am not against the surrealists, and, of course, I am not against paying attention to subtlety or hidden meaning, but there must be some meaning in it. I did not have the feeling that even the author or the director really had a wide vision of something, but they were so immersed in their pretentious visions that they began to consciously dissipate. Or maybe they just got confused themselves. In any case, I don't care. I was bored shit just over an hour without saving grace. <br /> <br /> Although a whole group of other viewers filled this site with excited delusions about the supposed symbolism and cinema workshop, I must respectfully disagree. Perhaps I didn’t learn enough movie lessons to appreciate some inspirational techniques invisible to mere mortals. ... <br /> <br /> Or maybe this movie was just crap. <br /> <br /> I give him a “1” and serve him next to Ishtar.
