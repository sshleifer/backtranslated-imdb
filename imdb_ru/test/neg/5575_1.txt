It should be a GOOD move I have ever seen !!!!! It was not only boring, it was "shut my mouth with a spoon." Where would you find the actors ... on the street corner? Who did the special effects ... Maako? For God's sake, I could make a better movie with my cell phone. And if it wasn't bad enough, you even had extras at the end of the film so that we can see how stupid the actors are in real life. Who ever did the makeup for the aliens ... must have spent $ 5 at your local used costume shop and called it a day. And whoever wrote the description of the movie on the back of the DVD case should be shot. PUHLEEZ !! This is not even 1/8% of what is described. This description is simply to attract people to buy, rent or pay for a ticket to see it. No wonder there was never a trailer for him .... I would drive them all !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Bad actors ... $ 5 <br /> <br /> Special Effects ... $ 5.50 <br /> <br /> Fake Fire .... $ 1.89 (cigarette lighter) < br /> <br /> Time spent watching this movie .... a waste! (I have to sue you for my time watching this)
