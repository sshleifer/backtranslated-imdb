Want a great recipe for failure? Take a crappy, left-wing political plot, add some weak and completely undeveloped characters, and then add the worst episodes the movie has ever known. Let it be stewed during the week (the amount of time it is likely to have spent creating this garbage). <br /> <br /> The result is the film “Steal This Film,” a cinematic experience that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotic low places that have never been thought of before. . <br /> <br /> In this film, all the time I was shown in the face. Words cannot convey how painful it was to look. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can laugh and make fun of. This is not Plan 9 from space. It is a long, boring and sad waste of time. “Steal This Cinema” is the biggest waste of energy and talent I've ever seen. It saddens me when I realize that people * actually * took the time to act in this prank, if you can call it a "game." But then again, when you have bad leadership, bad writing, bad ALL - “acting” is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This film is like a huge disgusting piece of poop that you crave to quickly wash off. existence, fearing that a friend or loved one might somehow see it. I really would like to somehow destroy every copy of this film so that it does not pollute the minds of beginning filmmakers. Thank you, Robert Greenwald, for giving me a newfound respect for all the other films I've ever seen. You showed me what is really terrible, and why I should appreciate all these films, which are just shitty and / or boring.
