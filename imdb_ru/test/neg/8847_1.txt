I never fell asleep during the movie. Never. This film did the impossible. <br /> <br /> Although many claim that Japanese horror films are superior to their American counterparts, this film was a lesson in abundance. As in the film, it was 30 minutes too long. It would help if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and working with the camera, but instead, all we got was an awkward silence and a lot of slow movement. Acting was absolutely terrible, bordering on poor levels of student films, while everyone was fighting to advertise something called a script. Did these people even get any direction? They were persuaded to be boring and boring? Any of them would not surprise me. <br /> <br /> What was even worse was the rather not terrible makeup associated with creatures on the other hand. In any case, they are all smelly. Do not watch this movie. This is all I can say (if you are not insomnia).
