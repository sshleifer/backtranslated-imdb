This film was very disappointing, and, with the exception of a few moments, it did not fly at all. More than anything, it was just stupid. The music was damn bad and the plot was played like a bowling game BYU ?? very predictable (avoiding embarrassment due to winning, splash of touchdowns in the late game, a rally that fails and leads to loss). Essentially, the half-child / half-naive Will (the film collector) and his religiously tangled brother Danny (we will call him just a democrat) belong to Kirby (the film’s Sweet Spirit), the third member of their ill-fated Mormon “boys until the figure of the man and the father of the film (directed by Jill) spoke to Will and straightened him. Probably, Will’s personality changes by 180 degrees, and he instantly becomes a mature and self-conscious group leader. It would be cute, perhaps funny, a 10-minute performance at a roadshow, but the fact that the film lasted 93 minutes really sucks your life out if you watch it through. My advice ?? take the money you usually spend on renting this show, or burn it in your fireplace or flush it down the toilet ?? more entertainment with much less time. If you want to watch the best movie of the same genre, find Saints and Soldiers ?? not a comedy, but an infinitely better show (in fact, Kirby has more fun things in Saints than in SOP).
