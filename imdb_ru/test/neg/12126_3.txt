The “Open Graves” plot is very simple: this is a board game called “Mamba” where players die in real life just as they die in a game. Ridiculous death scenes include killing with the help of computer crabs and snakes. cardboard and deliberately annoying, and there is not even a tiny wait. I liked Eliza Dushku in The Wrong Turn, but she is completely useless and memorable here. The climax with a CGI witch coming from the sea is completely ridiculous and stupid. The only reason to see “Open Graves” is a few interesting camera angles and sexy Eliza Dushku. If such films are the future of horrors, then I give up seriously. Give me any 70s or 80s low-budget horror movie over this modern piece of shit. Generous 3 out of 10.
