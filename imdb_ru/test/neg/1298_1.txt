Perhaps this is the worst movie I've ever seen; I gave him one star simply because it is the lowest possible rating. Who would have thought that Flood would be a good movie? The director and the cast must be ashamed, and then it dawned on me that all of this could be part of the tactics of shambolic bullying. Only propaganda can be so bad. <br /> <br /> The redemptive feature of the Flood is that its disgusting and shameless formulaic storyline makes it ridiculous. If only the characters had the same depth as that created by the flood itself, they still jumped from the sound fragment to the sound fragment without any emotional response. <br /> <br /> The sad thing about this movie is that it could be much better, informative, creative and tense. In many recent British films “Flood” meets with amateur views, where more targeted use of funds could contribute to better entertainment. <br /> <br /> Where was Smithy?
