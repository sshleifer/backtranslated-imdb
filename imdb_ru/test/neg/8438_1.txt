The sound is terrible, the picture is worse than worse, the acting is terrible, the leading female actress is plump, and the story ... wait a minute ... There is no story ...! The plot is really bad, and the name of the film is misleading. If you expect to see Piranha, you may be disappointed. This film has nothing to do with the 1978 and 1981 Piranha films. In fact, I can only remember one scene with Piranha. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about this film, besides the fact that it only lasts about 85 minutes, is the song at the end. It is written and sung by Jim Stein and is called "Love everything that the sun loves." <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie. It is so bad that it is not even funny to watch. I fell asleep after the first 20 minutes, and I'm the kind of person who watches something.
