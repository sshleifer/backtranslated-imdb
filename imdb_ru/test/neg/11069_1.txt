I recently saw a series of films about caves, and this film managed to bring together all the worst sides of this film. You value very little the surroundings of the cave or monster they encounter, while the characters are clichéd (spiritual guy, leader with tragedy in the recent past, etc.), And the final was just weak. It really annoyed me that the director kept shaking the camera or showing almost total darkness to create an atmosphere. I read that this film gave a real idea of ​​the caves, and yes, I think the caves are dark. Showing almost complete darkness for half the film really brought it home. I really liked the “descent”, which, for my money, showed the best game, showed a more tense situation in the caves, better monsters and a good ending. <br /> <br /> **** spoiler ****** <br /> It turns out that the monster is some guy whose plane crashed and his parents died, leaving him to grow in caves . He seems to have developed super strength and speed, but why this is never solved — perhaps the same power that drained their torch batteries, caused it, but during the movie, when someone is killed, it seems like something big with claws that tear apart each victim, see how much blood splashes on the walls!) but in the end it's just some dude with fur draped over him and a mask? I would be willing to skip this if greater heights were reached, but this was hardly the case. Then he starts raping the last caver and throwing credits ... Almost to the point of absurdity, I thought. Sometimes the film is so bad that you can appreciate it and maybe laugh, but this film also does not look easy. <br /> <br /> You watched it, you can not see it!
