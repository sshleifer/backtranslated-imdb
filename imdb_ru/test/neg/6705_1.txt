Despite the fact that "Adam's House" is intended for a mass gay film; that Anthony (John Shaw), who is a curious gay and big cutie, and Adam (Jared Cadwell), who is openly gay, and a close second in his views; that between Anthony and Adam there is 41 minutes of wonderful, convincing and naked lovemaking (sorry, not in the forehead), that this alone can be enough for many of us - despite all this (what I mean) “Adam's House” is a terrible movie most any other standard of film making. Thumbs down. <br /> <br /> Shaw and Cadwell’s acting abilities are either sophomoric, or really suffer from a bad script, directing or editing, or rather their absence. Their love scene, though, is convincing and, perhaps, more related to the fact that they are really addicted to each other, given the rest of their scripts and acting. <br /> <br /> Self-praise by writer / director Jorge Amer (Bonus Feature) as for his film making skills, this is not so. <br /> <br /> So, the script and its absence is the thumb down. In general, acting exceeded all expectations except for Shaw and Cadwell. Alexis Carriker, in the role of Nina, could have been better, with the exception of the limitations mentioned above. Absolutely the worst and unbearable acting skills of Thomas Michael Kappier in the role of Albert Ross, the father of Anthony, who did not even have the quality of the game in elementary school. He truly represents a tremendous failure in casting. <br /> <br /> Actors playing new booth owners are also worthy of really bad acting roles. <br /> <br /> If only the production, editing and post-production were as good as the trailer, this film would be completely different. In the trailer are well-collected fragments of scenes, which primarily attracted me to rent a movie. It is the hope that this gay-oriented film seems to have played a prominent role and was advertised at gay film festivals. <br /> <br /> In general, a film with a lot of emphasis. <br /> <br /> Should I buy / rent and watch it? Only if you have an irresistible yen to see a naked love scene and a few minutes of semi-persuasive dialogue between Anthony and Adam. Or if you really like to watch bad movies.
