Maniratnam, who is often compared in India with outstanding world cinematographers and considered a genius in film production, has once again proved that he can only make shots visually good without offering much food for thought. Forget about pure cinematic pleasure that can be learned from the cinema as a very old form of art. <br /> <br /> Although I would not like to pretend and pretend to be one who has seen all the wonderful films shot around the world, yet any thoughtful and slightly educated moviegoer can determine that his films do not contain any innovative ingenious scenes. , do not contain lingering effects after this and, most often, contain a ridiculous ending and a LOT of melodrama, widely shown in Indian films. <br /> <br /> Maniratnam successfully confirmed my disgust for his films again. <br /> <br /> Sorry for those who claimed otherwise on this forum. My suggestion for you: WATCH SOME BEAUTIFUL MOVIES THROUGH THE WORLD.
