The premise of this movie, in which a talk-show host is running for president as an independent to just shake things up, is fun, interesting, brilliant and even a little inspiring. (I thought about the debate in the West Wing, when Tom Dobbs leaves his podium, thought that Stephen Colbert would announce his candidacy, good times). Therefore, the first 15-20 minutes of this film is very interesting, especially the debate. When he is ultimately elected, it is a pity that because of a computer malfunction you want him to win honestly (although this is unrealistic). <br /> <br /> But after that, this film completely fails. I thought that we would get a great movie, such as “Dave” (1993), in which we will see how it will turn out if the comedian actually controls the country. Instead, the film turns from a comedy to a thriller, a romantic comedy and drama and does not bring any good. Computer crash becomes the main storyline, which really sucks. The boy is disappointing. I give him 3 stars only for the premise and because I really managed to watch this film from beginning to end without stopping it, which is usually good for me.
