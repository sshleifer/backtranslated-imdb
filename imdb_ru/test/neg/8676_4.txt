Well, this latest version of Mansfield Park seemed to be trying to take the sharpness of the theatrical version of 1999 (actually copied some ideas from it), but softened it a bit to bring it in line with the original story. Unfortunately, the result is a rather dull and schizophrenic production. And, as in all other versions of Mansfield Park, Fanny Price's character is not where to find. Instead, it runs a strangely childish, blond blonde who never develops as a character. At least in the 1999 film, the character, whom they call Fanny Price, firmly established itself as a rebellious tomboy who is too smart for her own good. This “Fanny Price” is a complete mystery. Someday I would really like to see the dramatization of Mansfield Park, which actually includes an image of Fanny’s character, written by Jane Austen. Sweet, kind, compassionate girl with a timid personality and fragile physique. She is restrained in a manner and painfully honest, but also strong in her convictions, always faithful, extremely clever and surprisingly perceptive. A little late bloom, only in the eighteenth year, she finally begins to move from an awkward teenager to the composure of a young woman. And she does not want anything in life more than having a real use for those she loves the most. This is an amazingly complex character, which I look forward to once saw him truly
