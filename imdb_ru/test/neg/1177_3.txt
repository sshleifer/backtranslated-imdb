With such a catchy name as “Butcher from the Plain,” this version of Ed Hein and Kane Hodder, playing with him, no doubt, will fly from the shelves for a couple of weeks. Most viewers will be bored foolish with this last look at the life of Ed Jin. /> <br /> The film focuses on Ed's rage and gives us (somewhat) a glimpse of his psychosis and home in Plainfeild. These are the scenes that give the film a much needed push. <br /> <br /> What destroys is the constant focus on the lives of other characters and to a lesser extent on Eds.Big here. <br /> <br /> Kane Hodder is a strange choice for the game Gein, but he copes with it quite well and deserves more acting skills. loans than he gets these days. Prascilla Barnes and Mikael Barriman also appear. <br /> <br /> 3/10
