I am sure that I am in the minority (I know that I am among my friends), but I found this film long, boring and gratuitous. The fact that the role of DENIS LEARY is the cutest character (the only time I liked him at all was in "A Bug's Life"!) Says a lot. The character of Rene Russo was incredibly annoying, and Thomas Crown himself was flat and stereotypical. To say that he was two-dimensional, maybe a little generous. (No, the scenes with his psychiatrist did NOT help make it real.) <br /> <br /> With the exception of two wonderful scenes (both with the participation of the museum caper and NOT with Ren√© Rousseau), this film made me want me to be at home watched television golf.
