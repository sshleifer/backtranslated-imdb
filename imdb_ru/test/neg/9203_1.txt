1) Bad behavior. <br /> <br /> 2) For a group of bastards on an alien planet, it looked like a house, especially with the houses and roads that can be seen in the background. <br /> <br /> 3) Awful plot with stupid karatera making idiotic decisions and carelessly losing precious survival equipment and clothes left, right and center. <br /> <br /> 4) Cool overalls of the fantastic 70s (perhaps the only good thing in this film) <br /> <br /> 5) An interesting ship in the beginning (this crew must have watched Space 1999). Too bad it explodes so early. The rescue ship also sank too quickly. * sigh * <br /> <br /> 6) Anthropologists may find some aspects of the film interesting from the point of view of the behavior of the primate group.
