I watched it start on Friday at noon, working at a computer at home, relaxing a bit after a hectic week, scrubbing some files and answering some messages. He was interrupted several times, so he had problems clarifying all the details (although this is unlikely to work with Hitchcock's proportions, where you can skip the details from the whole story), and, moreover, it was not exactly the “exciting” part of the work. <br /> <br /> So during the commercial, read the only previous comment here (“mgconlan-1”), and you can pretty much agree with its details. <br /> <br /> Not exactly in the category of films so terrible that it’s fascinating “good”, but I would like to catch the tape on launching again (and not watch it on the air), so I can rewind ahead as need and see the parts that I missed this the first time. <br /> <br /> Give him "3 *" because of the attractiveness of the four main characters.
