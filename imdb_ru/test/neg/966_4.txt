This 3-hour television miniseries came home with us from the blockbuster this weekend. The production company apparently spent a lot of money on film sets, costumes (especially Bridget Fonda) and special effects (including the great talking polar bear and reindeer Jim Henson). They had to spend a little more money to get a consistent script. The storyline was so free that it never really converged. You can lose sight of the Irish-accented Germans, but not a captious story. With meaningless free ends, which included a special guest performance of the Devil, this, of course, was not destined to become a Christmas classic. Shame that they spent good performances by two female leaders.
