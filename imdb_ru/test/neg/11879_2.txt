What can I say about this? Such a big Prestige-Production - but in the end? Wasted time, wasted money. <br /> <br /> This work is a historical catastrophe. Just a few examples: <br /> <br /> * August is often called “Guy” - his Name (Pronomen). But the old Romans did not use this name. It will be correct to indicate the surname (Nomen Gentile and Cognomen) or Octavian, Caesar, Augustus. <br /> <br /> * Livia was shown as a tyrannical wife. But this is historically wrong. <br /> <br /> * Julia seemed like a good young woman, but she wasn’t. Adultery and (maybe?) Prostitution and arrogant behavior became the reason for her exile. <br /> <br /> * She was not in the dying bed of her father. She was never allowed to leave her exile. And she was at this time about 50 years old! Not as young as she was shown. That same year, when Augustus died, she committed suicide because Tiberius stopped giving her a pension. <br /> <br /> * August was much more unscrupulous than in this featured film. But the author and director seem to believe that Augustus has Res Gestae. <br /> <br /> What remains? Historically, it is extremely doubtful, it plays poorly, it is poorly built and equipped - 2 points out of 10 - one for Peter O'Toole.
