this film, although it can be considered a successful attempt at comedy, is not at all like a preview. the first half consists of the typical material of Robin Williams, although he really did not make many voices; he was always good in some lines and hit the zest ... somewhere during the elections there is a problem with the computer program that is used in the elections. that's where network 3 comes in ... the woman who helped with this program wants to tell the truth, and the evil corporation wants to shut it up ** spoilers ** her boyfriend even helps them, although it didnâ€™t even specify ... this film could be one from political splendor (perhaps with Sorken during the reign), but he is lacking in a stew made by too many cooks
