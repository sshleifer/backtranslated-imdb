This film has not done this for me, an avid SNL fan for the past 14 years. The portrait of Jamie Hertz was fine, but there was something very unpleasant in the film itself. The facts presented in the film are completely distorted. But Merv Griffin produced it, so it will explain a lot. He has never been to SNL and had nothing to do with it. Points in her life when she was on the SNL, back to front. When we first see her in SNL, walking through the studio with Lorne Michaels, the logo on the wall is from 1988-1989, not 1975. I have never heard of one of them. Truly displeased. This film shows why television films are just television films.
