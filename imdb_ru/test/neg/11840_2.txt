The main storyline of this film is a clich√© and, obviously, was ripped off from the Jurassic Park. The filmmakers did not even try to hide it. It seems that the creation of decent doll dinosaurs did not have enough money, so the viewer sees robot-like toy dinosaurs (from a cheap toy store), which move very unnaturally. This is ridiculous because it is so bad. Acting almost as unnatural as dinosaurs. No one seems really excited to be in this film (which I fully understand). Especially the last half hour is extremely boring, and it is almost impossible to watch it without falling asleep. The only positive comment I would like to make about Raptor is that it does not take as much as 90 minutes.
