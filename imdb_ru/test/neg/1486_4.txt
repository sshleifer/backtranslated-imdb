Everywhere there was a good wait. The cinematography was surprisingly good, considering such a minimal budget. We observe occasional spells of good acting, however, this is quickly blown away by some rather silly lines. It is clear that there will be no intellectual conversation if you sit in the trees while the crocodile is stalking you. Silence would be golden here. Waiting could have been a big game than a vague utterance: “I was sitting in the closet because of the fear of my brother ...” mighty 15-foot crocodile, you decide. Throughout the film, I cannot find a connection or, for that matter, sympathy for the heroes, perhaps because they do not develop a single character in the film. Sometimes good fears occur when a crocodile sneaks up on the heroes, again overshadowed by some dubious scenes. In one case, we should be frightened by an ear swimming in the water, but later we sit next to a decapitated, lifeless corpse and only worry about a broken finger. A certain movie rollercoaster when it comes to logic.
