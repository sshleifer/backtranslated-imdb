As a Christian, I discovered that this film is completely embarrassing. The actors sucked, the script sucked, the cinematography sucked, and the story was so typical. I cannot say that this is a great testimony tool, because I would be too embarrassed to show any of my unsaved friends. There are much better things in Hollywood, and that’s because they put the best in it. Christians produce shitty work and think that everything is in order, because "this is for the Lord." In the Old Testament, people spent huge sums of money to make sacrifices to God. David (or Saul ... I don’t remember) spent roughly $ 50 billion on today's money building a temple for God. But nowadays it is just a pity to spend what can be about $ 30,000 to create a film in order to “testify” to people with this. This is a person, not a product that affects someone. Do not waste your time turning your friends into this one and a half hour. If you want to make a positive impact on people, show them films such as The Matrix, American Beauty, Braveheart, etc., which have something to say and that will really help you.
