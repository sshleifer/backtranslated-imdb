The creators are asking for a huge suspension of disbelief, you give it to them in the hope that if there is a little time, they will convince you that this is possible. Alas, with television films it seems that they specifically intended to make cheap films on the Cosmo profile. With a small budget and large claims, you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience. Not here though. The film receives several points for the good work that the two leading ladies give against all odds, but, unfortunately, this is not enough to save the day. oh, and the less said about the ending, the better. Happy watching movies to all!
