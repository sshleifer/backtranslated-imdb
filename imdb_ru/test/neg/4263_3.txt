A good attempt to tackle the unconventional theme of the May-December romances. However, the treatment is completely unrealistic. Of course, sixty-year-old men may fall in love with young women, but usually they are adult women with whom they have common interests, values ​​and attitudes ... and not neurotic, immature, almost underage girls. Of course, there are exceptions, and they are close to being called pedophiles! Sorry, RGV, but it is unlikely that a sensible and experienced sexist would throw a comfortable family life and become a joke for his peers ... all this for an 18-year-old child who has no practical thoughts in his head and that behaves like an unstable runaway from psychiatric hospital. You do not need to have a PhD in psychology to see that Amitabh’s character is seduced by sex, and that the young woman has unresolved problems with leaving and dad. <br /> <br /> Regarding Vijay’s recurring scene, sitting on the edge of a cliff, contemplating suicide, is about as close to having something in common with Jia, acting as a striking teenager. <br /> <br /> Positive: the actors did a good job, and the cinematography is good.
