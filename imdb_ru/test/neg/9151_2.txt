I just watched a horrible movie called Sleeping Dictionary. One reviewer at the Four Word Film Review (www.fwfr.com) got it right when he wrote “From A to Zzzzzzzzzzz.” This story is about the jerk of an English colonialist who comes to Malaysia to, so to speak, “civilize the savages” and eventually falls in love with his sleeping dictionary. The sleeping dictionary is a Malaysian prostitute who speaks fluent English, who serves the English colonialists and teaches them her native language in exchange for ... well, the film never clarifies this, but I can only assume that he gives her money or something like that. Needless to say, the film focuses more on the “sleeping” part than on the “vocabulary” part of the job description. For our young hero, things get harder when the forbidden novel is aggravated by its culture, his home situation in the soap opera and his own boundless stupidity in every important decision that he makes throughout the film. <br /> <br /> So yes, the film has some serious flaws, but, on the other hand, it brought exactly two things for which I rented it in the first place: a beautifully photographed exotic place and even more beautifully photographed and an exotic woman who plays a sleeping dictionary, Jessica Alba. My friend told me that this crappy film was the most beautiful for her and, damn it, he was right. She is not a great actress and not quite suitable for Malaysians, and it is clear that they use a double body for nudity, but who cares? Jessica Alba has a rare face and figure, which is not only sexy, but also beautiful in the sense that a concert for violin by Vivaldi or a painting by Rembrandt. <br /> <br /> (PS Sorry to all of you feminists who dissuade women’s objectification, the "male look", etc., etc., but I hope you understand what I mean disrespect. )
