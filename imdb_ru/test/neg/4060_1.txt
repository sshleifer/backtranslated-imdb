[ATTENTION: Some spoilers are included, although this is a documentary.] <br /> <br /> I bought this documentary because I like the work of directors D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, including MOON OVER Broadway, STARTUP.COM and WAR ROOM., All the amazing documentaries that I highly recommend Watching this extremely boring and inconspicuous story from the 1988 Depeche Mode tour, what to work with when they started editing this film together. The members of the group were, of course, less than coming on camera; hence, undoubtedly, a contest to add fans to the one-week bus ride was added to liven up things. Indeed, now I mean, come on. Who thought a concert of a synthpop band with three keyboard players and a singer would be a good idea? Of course, I like the music of Depeche Mode, and Martin Gore writes good melodies, but watching them at a concert never seemed interesting, and this film is a proof of positivity. If you're not a HUGE Depeche Mode fan, stay away from this documentary ... it's a waste of time.
