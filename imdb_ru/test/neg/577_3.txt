Must be honest, I like romantic comedies, but it wasn’t what I was hoping for. I thought that Ellen Degenérez had the biggest role that was supposed to be because I didn’t like the two fighting bed partners. It was terrible. Poor Tom Selleck! He was supposed to play with someone who had so much in the picture, while he and Ellen were supposed to be in most of the movie. They were the only plausible. And the only really funny roles played them, not Kate Capshaw and that guy from Everett. Cool, that mom is out of the closet, I thought it was a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> I was just glad I saw it by cable, and I did not pay the money by renting it.
