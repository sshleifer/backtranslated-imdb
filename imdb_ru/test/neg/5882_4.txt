The Jewish Hammer is a smart idea wasted because the execution is weak. As if it often happens with iconoclastic humor, he is too indignant to cause laughter, which is simply not enough. A bad taste humor has two elements - bad taste and humor - and both are needed here, but humor is rather poor. As a result, it is often painful to watch, especially because of the good attempts on the part of the performers, especially Adam Goldberg in the role of Kh.H. True, the references to “Mine” are funny, but only for those who know these films, and they certainly don’t carry the Jewish Hammer. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that many jokes are based on the knowledge of American Jews. culture, and many in the audience just won’t understand the joke.
