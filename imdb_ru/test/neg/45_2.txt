It was a worthy movie for the first half. Too many cheap BOO! moments, but the tension is increasing, the bad guys are creepy, and everything seems to be getting better. Kids aren't particularly deep, but hey, this works for teenagers. <br /> <br /> Then it’s just ridiculous and trying too hard - “why in the world does he / they do that?” moments suppress anyone’s ability to suspend disbelief, the turn includes too many ridiculous coincidences, and the name comes from late attempts to philosophize some meaning in the film, which leads to nowhere and is quickly discarded. In those moments in the theater was a laugh, which in no way was supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> An excellent premise, but just poorly written and does not stick together. Some very good pictures, but they are hard to enjoy when you roll your eyes.
