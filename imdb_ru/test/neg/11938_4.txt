I really wanted to love this film, and not only because Aaron Eckhart was in it, but I thought the premise would be cool because I like movies and shows that revolve around chefs. The cinematography was good, but besides the fact that it revolves around cooks, everything else is just a cliche. Yes, and little Miss Sunshine was very annoyed in this film, although Abigail Breslin seemed a bit annoyed in every film she starred in because she plays many roles where she wants. It has some decent cooking flashes, but the food didn't really play a big role in the film than I expected, which was a big disappointment to me. This film had good potential, the actors were great, but there was very little work with them. I like a nice bright romantic comedy, but it was just soft. And longer than it should be, because he felt much longer than he was. This is not a horrible movie, you just do not miss anything without watching this movie. <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 10
