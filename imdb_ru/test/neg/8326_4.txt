“Black revenge” is an alternative name for “Inhang Khon Khon”, also known as “The Tragic Hero” (1987). I just saw it on VHS, along with the first part of the story, "Gong woo ching" ("Rich and Famous"), also from 1987. (A poster and 2 frames on the page are intended for a set of 4 DVD films with Rod Perry (Black Gestapo)), Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2), Richard Lawson (Black Fist). The fourth film is called Black Six "). Oddly enough, while the characters retain their original names in “Rich and Famous,” in Black Revenge, the character Chow Yun-Fat is named Eddie Shaw, Alex Men (Jie Leung Man) is Harry, and Andy Lau is Johnny. Also confusing is the fact that 1994 is listed as the copyright date of both films. Perhaps it was the year they were christened by the Americans. According to the release dates, data on IMDb, "Tragic Hero" was released before "Rich and Famous". Was there any reason to exit the sequel first? Despite the comments of some users, I liked these films, although they are not among the best in CYF, such as Killer and Hard Boiled, which are really amazing. However, if one day I find the set of two DVDs "Rich and Famous" and "The Tragic Hero", I will buy it without hesitation. We hope that these comments about the “Black Revenge” are being clarified, which also was a mystery to me about where he was in the filmography of Chow Yun-Fat.
