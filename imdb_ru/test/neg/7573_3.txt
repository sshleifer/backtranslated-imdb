In this film, I again seriously doubt whether Armando de Ossorio was a good director or not ... Many fans admire his films BLIND DEAD. This I can understand. But I want to be gothic banal-vampire, like MALENKA, does not show any signs from a gifted director. And this also applies to SERPIENTE DE MAR. There is a terrible game, a dumb storyline, stupid events, much more that can be expected from a bad monster movie, as well as veteran actor Ray Milland, who does everything he can to spill the words in this movie without having much of a clue about that he does in this. Apparently, Milland was already very sick, acting in “SERPIENTE DE MAR” (his last theatrical feature) and leaving with such an absurd bitch as this one, which makes him even more sad. One of the latest appearances with Peter Cushing in a film made for television, directed by Roy Ward Baker (also in 1984), makes little difference to this. <br /> <br /> But a sock-doll / sea serpent is a cry to contemplate. See how he whirls over the lighthouse and crush him. See how he destroys the harbor with the help of miniature boats. Look at it, demolish the bridges and chew charming miniature trains. <br /> <br /> Good, bad temper? Yes. 3/10 and 7/10
