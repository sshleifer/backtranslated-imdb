Artist Daniel King (Chris John) and his girlfriend Laura Peters (Lara Clancy) are invited to move to an old house in Cornwall, in the UK, his rich childhood friend Natasha Carlton (Carol Kentish). Natasha is in love with Daniel, who is ambiguous in her sentimental life. Strange things happen in the house alone, and Laura is amazed and scared. When Laura meets the old mad priest Gabriel Norton (Brian Blessed) on the road, she is advised to immediately leave the house, since evil has dwelt there. But the couple remains and must face tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> What a dirty script and a terrible and funny movie, this "Devil Harvest"! Cinematography and cinematography is not entirely bad, but the amateur performances of Chris John and Carol Kentish and director James Shanks, along with a terrible story, ridiculous situations and dialogues make this film one of the worst I've ever seen in the genre. I sometimes saw on YouTube a couple of college shorts that are better and better than the meaningless and terrible “Devil Harvest”. After all, this is not a horror movie, but a horror movie. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Colheita do Diabo” (“Devil's Harvest”)
