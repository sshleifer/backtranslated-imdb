I must have missed part of this movie ... I asked myself who it is? And when did this happen? It seemed that he was jumping around, but I continued to watch for the fear that I had missed something, and all this would be explained to me. I loved the Lonely Pigeon, but this film had no meaning for me. I loved all the actors, but what happened to the rest of the film? It made me go "what"? at the beginning of each part ... As for the scenery, I thought that everything was in order ... It made me feel as though I was flipping through a book and throwing out pages ... The end also embarrassed me a bit, although I imagine the boy was waiting for his father and should have left you thinking about whether his father will finally come home to his son and whether he will become a father, since his mother is now gone ... I would like to read the book to see what I missed in the film .. I did not expect this one to win any rewards.
