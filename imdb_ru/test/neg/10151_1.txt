I love stupid horror movies, I think the dead are alive, and the bad taste is great, and I think that the slaughter in a dream at party II (not even related to this movie) is funny. But this film is absolutely smelly, I didn’t laugh, I didn’t even enjoy it ... you can see all kinds of mistakes that aren’t even polite. The best scene where a woman leans out of the window is the one where she hits herself on the windowsill? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> Do not give up, thinking that this is due to a series of massacres at an overnight party. It's terrible, and I can't even imagine how it got spread. Rent it with a fake name and burn it, do everything else a favor.
