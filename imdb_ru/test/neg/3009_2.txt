Most of the films that I really like are art house and they rarely appear in the top 10 box office. However, I found Northfork completely incomprehensible. I have no idea what it was about. Writing about another film in the New York Times, Stephen Holden once remarked that some people seem to think that they can throw anything on the screen and make it work like a fairy tale. I thought about this review several times while watching “North Fork”. <br /> <br /> On a scale from one to ten, I gave him two.
