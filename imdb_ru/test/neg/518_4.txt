Underwater is definitely NOT the worst film ever. He has his flaws, such as borrowed shots, a crazy script and nonexistent special effects (this is the worst), but he also has some good points. The acting is surprisingly good, there are many familiar faces that you probably know if you're a fan of b-films like me. <br /> <br /> I was very happy to see Brent Huff playing one of the characters, knowing him mainly from the 80s action movies, and I must admit that he is not a bad actor at all. Fred Williamson, Maxwell Caulfield and Tim Thomrson get limited screen time but are believable in their roles. In this film about Fred Reindeer Ray, Irite Nipar and Nicole Eggert, who look very sexy and very mean. Michael Bailey Smith adds some muscle to the background, like a fur seal. Unfortunately, the only cast that (in my opinion) is completely inappropriate is Kulio. He does not act at all, he speaks as if he did not even read the script, and, being cool at the beginning of the film, he would be shot as a weakling an hour later. Not a good choice. <br /> <br /> Summing up, we can say that this film is a good choice for nightly entertainment. If you can handle the special effects (so many weapons, so much fire and not a single wound on anyone), the annoying work of Culio and the reworked shots from Airport 77, you may end up with this question.
