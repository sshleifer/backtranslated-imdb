It was a waste of $ 9. the film was terrible; all the “scary” parts were meaningless and sadly repetitive. It would seem that all the tense parts could be completely predicted, and did not seem to attract the attention of the audience. In addition, the storyline did not advance at all during the entire film, and it was all just a big setup for grudge. 3. When it seemed that the film was going to make a big plot advance, it turned out to be just a meaningless scene. These directors should follow Hitchcock's example: each scene makes sense. Probably, 90% of the scenes in this film could be left without a change in the plot. Final opinion: do not waste your time, energy or money !!!
