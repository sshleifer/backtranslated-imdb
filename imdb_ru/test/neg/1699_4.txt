If you are a Catalan nationalist-anarcho-socialist with unconditional respect for the mythologies of the Spanish Republic, this film may be for you. The two brothers, the real ones (one of them Mark Recha himself), recreate a fictional version of the real journey that they made through the impressive Catalan countryside, and they recall the story (trays with bullet holes, artillery strikes on the soundtrack) but not shown. The dialogue is very small, and most of it is random in nature: the story is told behind the scenes from a third person, with the voice of the actress posing as the real sister of real brothers. The images have little to do with what kind of storyline exists, and this is a bit. Many of them - stunning, brooding panoramas in the harsh semi-arid mountains and rivers (for example, Terrence Malik or Gus Van Sant - there are a lot of Jerry and Latter-day), interspersed with some stunning still images and still frames. They are best enjoyed in the superb natural sound of the film and without a tedious narration or even random background music (some are pretty good, some are rather strange, but all are gratuitous). The best of what is said in this film is said in these episodes, with their accidental inclusion of power plants and dams without comment. <br /> <br /> Relations between brothers remain fragmentary and general; the main character is a jagger biting a man, never shown. The more Catalan-nationalist anarcho-regardless of the director's obligations are advanced, the richer the story, the unspoken message of the film is distorted, and the more annoyingly narcissistic the experience. Although the director said in a show in New York that the film was conceived from the very beginning with a third person narration, I would like to see its version without narration or music and only with a natural soundtrack and minimalist dialogue - the result may be more touching, and in any case it will not be much less surprising. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, this is most likely the only film that you will see this year, in which the guy enters the frame with a piece of cloth (bathing suit that he wore?) hung from his penis. This is one of the few moments in the whole film in which your interest (sorry) is awakened by something that actually happens on the screen (what is it? Why is it hanging there?), But, as usual, no answers have been given. Very Warholian, very sixties, and not a bit tiring.
