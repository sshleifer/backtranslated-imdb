Well, let's see. Why is this one of the worst films ever? Because there are so many answers to this question, I have a headache. Come on ... World burglars? Mr. Honky? To part with an arab guy? it's just awful, I was not particularly worried about all this white racism shit, but when they did it with an Arab guy, I wanted to get the names of all the writers. It really is not worth watching 3 seconds of this film. This is not even funny-bad, which was my first interpretation. I hope that the person who made this film did not commit suicide, but it seems I donâ€™t see any other options. NEVER watch this movie, if you watch it, you cannot say that you died without regrets.
