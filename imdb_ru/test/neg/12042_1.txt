I thought this film could be a good travesty, or at least a good independent comedy, such as Friday. Instead, it was more like what someone in high school would do with their parents' video camera. It was not only a low budget, which makes this film bad (many great films were made on a low budget), it’s just a bad film, and it wasn’t even bad enough to be a good camp. Case in point: during the first ten minutes of the film, nothing happens except for the three main characters who sit in their room, smoke drugs, put on makeup and answer phone calls. You keep waiting for something to start the story movement, but it never comes. The sound was so bad that I had to turn on the TV completely to almost make out what they were saying (which was not interesting anyway). If I pay for renting a movie, I usually suffer from it, even if it’s bad, but that was all I could do to sit for 20 minutes. It seems that the person before me felt the same, because they did not rewind the tape and stopped in the same place as me. The only reason I rated 1 is because there are no negative numbers in the rating system.
