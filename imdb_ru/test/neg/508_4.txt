The recent death of Stephen Bach, one of the producers of HEAVEN'S GATE, caused the specter of at least a partial revival of the damned movie's reputation. Moreover, the original version, the “long version”, was recently shown on TCM, showing the film, probably the largest audience in its history. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when it first came out on a crowded show in a cinema on 3rd Avenue across from Bloomingdale. I think he was released on Friday and recalled the following Wednesday. Maybe it was not an honest release, but it was a terrible movie. Viewing the full-length version recently confirmed this judgment, and thanks to thirty years of experience watching and writing films, I can better explain why. <br /> <br /> At first there is the terrible phrase “Mise en scene”. “Whose definition is at the same time so simple, but so amorphous, that it baffles even after determination. Basically, this is all that happens in front of the camera. For example, the crowd will be given an action, say, just walk along the sidewalk and start from the spot. When an assistant director shouts about action, the extras will pass through their action. If there is one more double, the additional one will return to the starting position and again go to the “action”. All add-ons do this. Then say that a taxi pulls up to the sidewalk, and the star comes out and hugs another director, while the crowd does its job. This is the stage scene. In the theater, they call it blocking, but the movie is much more multidimensional. <br /> <br /> The importance of determining the stage setting lies in the fact that when the French critics developed their theory of authorship, the opposite of the author was the Métier-en-scene, even more disparagingly called the “traffic cop”. The author was deeply involved in the meaning of the film, and through the work of the director was chosen a theme or themes. Metier-en-scene was basically a man of the company, showing in the film what was conveyed to him on paper. That is the difference between John Ford and Sam Wood. <br /> <br /> The second point is how director Michael Cimino became the director of the film. Cimino first gained fame by shooting the first million dollar commercial. It depicts a Chevrolet descending the Grand Canal in Venice. This commercial has never appeared on any of the greatest commercials of all time, and it is remarkable solely for how expensive it was and how exaggerated it was. The effect is similar to the effect of a three-year-old girl invited to entertain a company that gets its biggest response when she throws a dress over her head. Cute for a three year old, awkward for a thirty year old. So from the very beginning Cimino was praised for the fact that he spent a huge amount of money on some unsurpassed image, and therefore he learned. <br /> <br /> In his first film, “Thunder and Light” (1974), there is a scene where Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are passengers in a madman’s car that drives back and forth, back and forth, until he leaves from the road, and the driver will not open the trunk full of rabbits, which he begins to shoot one after another. I had a feeling that if producer Eastwood did not intervene, the scene would continue until every rabbit was killed. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the GATE of HEAVEN. I think if you watch a movie on a DVD in scraps like a mini-series, it can be impressive. This is because the scenes are directed with such a dense stage setting that each scene looks like an encyclopedia, it’s just tiring to sit out for almost four hours of this. It's like sex, at some point it just becomes a whip. There is an opening 40 minutes, which takes place at Harvard. Brilliantly photographed at Oxford, it is something of a non sequitur. I personally prefer the artistic way of unfolding the story, rather than more commercial _ "Now I will tell you what I tell you" from most films. However, all the preface comes down to one line - Chris Christopherson and John Hurt studied together at Harvard. Now twenty years later ?? All this time, money and effort, not to mention the attention and energy of the audience, just to bring this almost useless piece of information. <br /> <br /> Then, on the street between Christopherson and Mazur, a scene takes place that just continues and continues with the populated city of background additions and horse-drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver tiny exposition information. It is so tiring. There is only one scene after another, like this one. It's like trying to eat thirty pounds of pizza. Then there is this long talk about irrelevant details and unintelligible, meaningless dialogue that continues and continues, tedious and boring. <br /> <br /> Of course, any sketchy scene looks great. In general, it is a rich material about which you can read commendable articles. When viewed in tricks with the ability to fast forward through the boring bits or off, if you feel that the staging is broken, it's mostly painless. But don't let anyone tell you that this is a good movie. When I saw this in 1980, in front of me sat a guy who commented on the scene in which Chris Christofferson sits on a horse, and he turns one way and then the other and does it about six times. "This is symbolic," he said, "because he does not know where to go." In essence, this is based on all the criticism about the Heavenly Gate. <br /> <br /> Look if you want, but warn me, this is not a movie whose time has come, this is a stench that will smell all time. <br /> <br /> HEAVENLY GATES are historically inaccurate to the extreme. I recommend the book by Asa Mercer, The Bandits of the Plains, on the Johnson War.
