I really did not want to write a sharp review of this film, because I sincerely appreciate how hard it is to make any film with an incredibly low budget, not to mention doing something as ambitious as science fiction. <br /> <However, this film is really terrible. The acting game is one of the worst that I had to endure, and as a fan of low-budget films, this is a pretty serious accusation. There are many novice actors who would work on a deferred payment scheme if they believed in the film and what the director was trying to achieve. I am sure that the actors did everything possible, like all the others participating in this performance, but this was simply not enough to accomplish something of such magnitude. <br /> <br /> Then there is a dialogue. Very poor indeed. There is no excuse for this. I got the impression that the script was hastily written in the back seat of a beer mat after some epic binge session. I hesitate to use the word "ridiculous", but this is exactly what is written in the script. I had no sympathy for any of the characters. In fact, they hurt me, and as a result, I often knocked on several of them, Mr. Stirton bent himself, taking on too many roles. Clint Eastwood he is not. Again, there are talented people who are ready to work on a delay if they believe in the project. <br /> <br /> Much has been made of the special effects in this film. For the money they are exceptional, although somewhat abused. It's like someone said, "I have consequences, and I'm going to use it." Whoever worked on computer graphics, he was one of the most talented of this team. <br /> <br /> Simply put, they had no money to make such an ambitious film as this attempt. Kudos for trying this, but unfortunately he cannot achieve his dizzying goals in too many ways. <br /> <br /> I welcome everyone involved in its production, true, but for their next efforts they either need to get a better producer or lower their views to something more manageable. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I cannot recommend this effort to anyone except the most enthusiastic filmmakers or habitual insomnia. If you want to watch a real masterpiece of low-cost science fiction films, try making a “Dark Star” from a certain Mr. John Carpenter.
