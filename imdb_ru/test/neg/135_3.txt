I loved the first 1/3 of this film and thought it would be one of Truffaut's best films. I liked the plot, where a pen friend marries a man from all over the world - an invisible sight. Especially when this woman is a fraud and is responsible for the death of a REAL pen pal so she can take her place! Then she cleaned out her husband's huge bank account and disappeared! I was really intrigued and wanted to see more ... <br /> <br /> And then the film fell apart and became just stupid! Despite the fact that she came from New Caladonia (an island in the Pacific), and he from Reunion (an island in the Indian Ocean), when he sets off on a journey to the south of France, he almost immediately bumps into her. Hmm .... the odds are 187,000,000 to 1, but he finds it. Then, instead of killing her or handing her over to the police, he forgives her — even when she admits that she did. Good - it's hard to believe, but good, ... but then he helps to hide her from a private detective by killing him !!!! No one is so stupid! Yes, the character played by Catherine Deneuve is pretty handsome, but guys, this is just silly. Moreover, if he wanted her to be only a sexual object, then why would he do this for a woman who is often frigid, completely selfish and evil. <br /> <br /> This film, because of its very funny plot, does not deserve such high marks! If you're not a dedicated Truffaut fan, try another film — even one of Truffaut — just NOT this one.
