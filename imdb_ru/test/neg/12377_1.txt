I would like to vote for this film ten, it is so funny. If they wanted it to be so funny, I would give ten. I have to give him 1, but this is the funniest darn you ever want to see. Look at the giant blurry flash on the screen! Where is it from? What is it? He flies, he is terrifying, he is electrified, he is on the strings! This bird has a real personality. I was about ten years old when I first saw him, and when the Big Bird appeared on Sesame Street, I was sure that it was the same thing!
