Makes "The Invasion of the USA" look like the "Apocalypse Now." This can be recommended only to US skinheads, supporters of John Birch or the militia. The idea is very simple: let's shoot them all - scammers, communicators, Latin Americans, everything that is not American. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is bad, poorly written, poorly interpreted, incredibly stupid, but not fun at all. This film can be used as a CIA torture device. oh, sorry, there can be no American tormentors, because they are GOOD
