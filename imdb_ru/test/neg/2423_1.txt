Coach Preachy or Straight Sappy. Poor writing combined with even worse acting skills. You can drink Gatorade after this special school, but I did not, even at the 20th philosophy of Toby Robbins / Islander, the motivational moment. This is too much posturing to be interesting and not informative enough to be informative. I have respect for the coach and the program inspired by this film, but the move itself is terrible. As a person who has been playing rugby for almost 20 years in the States, I was hoping for the best rugby movie (even one that has something to do with rugby). And I can tell you that the hack, performed by a bunch of Khaols and islanders, does not scare (very much like the way all blacks perform it today, seriously, boys, everyone saw it, it's time to remove it) , line up in front of a group of South Africans (real rugby offenders). This is a fake and poorly made film about how to be a real and good person.
