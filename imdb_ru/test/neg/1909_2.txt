Ho hum A rich handsome guy gets into trouble, a poor girl falls in love with him, a jealous ex-boyfriend causes stress .. yadda yadda. I actually laughed out loud in many parts of this film because the next scene was so predictable and just plain silly. When one scene shifted to another, I often wondered how we got there, as if I missed several chapters in a book. <br /> <br /> The script was pretty pathetic, and I didnâ€™t have one, or my wife really cares about any characters except the abandoned guy. Now, if the former guy got an ax and cut a girl and a rich child, then ... then we will have a movie, and all the silly dialogues and jumps in the plot may be acceptable. But since this film is trying to touch and completely skip the boat (and eventually resort to the romantic equivalent of divine intervention to try to tear the tear) ... it just falls very, very flat. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Instead, cut the toenails, you will be more fun.
