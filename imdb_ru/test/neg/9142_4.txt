What a disappointment! I liked John Cleary’s books about Scobie Malone, but there’s not much in common between him and the cinema Malone. In the books he is a city detective who is devoted to his wife and does not get involved in fist fights. In the film, the character was spiced up in a brazen backwater that uses its fists and is not inclined to jump into bed with a gorgeous girl, although it’s not at all what she and other sexual interests of the film see in him, I do not know; Taylor was then 39 years old, and his face became swollen. <br /> <br /> But his character’s stamina is wonderful; he flies from Australia, apparently, goes straight to the commissioner's house (rather unwisely, trying to arrest him while receiving black ties), saves him from being killed (in the process of fighting), goes to the casino with one girl, leaves with another and takes her to sleep So much for changing time zones! On the way back to the commissioner's house (with good knowledge of London lanes), the villains beat him, but he still goes down for breakfast! It is also noteworthy that the commissioner's limousine has a windshield and headlights miraculously repaired within a few minutes of the attempted murder, and that one character deeply believes in the exact timing of a clock-activated bomb. <br /> <br /> The best thing is Joseph Butler’s contempt for uncouth Malone. And, at least, the film is not a London journey, although some scenes occur during tennis week at Wimbledon.
