I was excited about this movie after reading other reviews. What a disappointment! There are so many ways to make this movie bad. Computer graphics were missing, to say the least. I found the acting game tough and incredible. Watch the sand as the lost “electronic pods” are found (what an original name!). Where did all the tracks come from? I immediately recognized parts similar to other films, such as Alien, Black Pitch. Come on, one huge ship to transport a single prisoner? And what about the prisoner? He says he can talk? I kept waiting for something to tie the pieces of the story together, but it never came. If this film was made with a low budget, it shows. The only part of the film I liked was when it finally ended. I do not mean that I liked the final, I did not. I just liked the fact that it was all over. A trip to the dentist would be more enjoyable. In my opinion. don't waste your time on this.
