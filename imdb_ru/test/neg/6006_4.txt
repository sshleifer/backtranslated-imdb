This film was really poor. I went to the theater, expecting something exciting, and instead I was given the opportunity to hone my skills “guess the next plot twist before it happens.” Seriously, the plot was written in a very thick pencil so that everyone can see. Nothing was really shocking. In fact, even the blood was met with such a complete suspension of faith that it really meant nothing. <br /> <br /> Due to the excessive wisdom of hacking and talking to the police at the crime scene, it seemed more and more fake. And the scene where Lambert’s character struggles with clues and reaches his “investigative insight” goes to great lengths to indicate on the level of intelligence expected from the audience - a little. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most annoying aspect of cinematography was the “secret material”: every building in the film, whether it was an election building, a house at noon, or a hospital, suffered from the absence of any noticeable lighting (not to mention the lack of patients) in the case of a hospital). I do not remember a single scene when someone turned on the light switch. It would be nice. <br /> <br /> Mr. Lambert is not really an Oscar-winning actor, so I guess you should take this film to make it worth it. In the end, I came to the conclusion that the only thing that could make this film more interesting was to watch it after watching Warriors. Otherwise, you will have a boring and unoriginal effort, and you will not find anything like this in films of such a genre as Silence of the Lambs.
