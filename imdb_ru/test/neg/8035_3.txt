On the way home, after a day at the beach, four young people seek refuge from the heavy rain in the house of Lord and Lady Alexander after they run out of gas in their car. They do not know this, but the house in which they live should be a place of satanic ritual. Jane (Camilla Keaton), the only woman in the group, should be sacrificed. When her companions rush to her aid, one of them accidentally kills Lady Alexander. Things are really getting out of control, and everyone else attending a black mass is also killed. The four try to escape, but soon discover that there is no salvation from what they saw. One by one they meet their destinies. <br /> <br /> Gong to the tragic ceremony, I was sure I would get pleasure. Slow gothic horror right in my alley. I also really like some of the other Riccardo Frida films, such as “Horrible Dr. Hitchcock”, “The Ghost” and “I Am a Vampire”. The tragic ceremony seemed to be the right thing. Unfortunately, things do not always work as they should. The biggest tragedy of the Tragic Ceremony is the time I spent watching this mess of the film. With some minor exceptions, I didn’t like and didn’t work in the film. Characters are unlikely, the plot is disconnected and schizophrenic, and the move is terrible. There is a story about damned pearls, which will not go anywhere and serve only to confuse things even further. In addition, nothing interesting happens for most of the film. By the time the four units realized that they were in danger, I was already in a state of care. And I do not understand the reviews I read, which praise the actions of Camilla Keaton. I think this is an amazing performance, if you think that an unemotional stunner is an acting game. Three male leads - the very definition of nondescript. They do nothing to stand out. Auxiliary cast includes several genre favorites, such as Luigi Pistilli, Luciana Paluzzi and Paul Muller, but no one can do anything. In fact, Muller’s main contribution is a two-minute monologue at the end of the film that tries to explain what has happened in the last 80 or so minutes. This is a weak attempt to summarize a very weak film.
