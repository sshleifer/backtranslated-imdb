I'm really at a loss as to how anyone can give this film 10 (or even more than 2!). It is full of bad lines, bad games, bad farce, etc. I never thought that I could see a worse game than deliberately bad scenes at the beginning of the UHF, but it was so. And only when you think it could not be worse, it is! Again and again! Could you actually watch it in the theater? It was not worth free on television! My 4-year-old and 1-year-old liked it, but they wanted to see a cat more, and the cat almost never turned on.
