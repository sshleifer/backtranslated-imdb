My friend, who is even more relevant to the cult films of the 1970s than I myself, recommended this to me and actually gave me a copy, which I watched. However, I was not thrilled with the result, how is it ?? or, for that matter, Michael Elliott ?? It was. The film is a hybrid of HOUSE OF WAX (1953) and Texas Chain SAW MASSACRE (1974): indeed, I would venture to say that it served as the basis for the 2005 remake of the first film much more than the “original”. ! So, we have a distant and abandoned Wax Museum of incredibly realistic dummies (guess why this is so?) With his apparently harmless curator (Hammi Chuck Connors), "captured" by an obligatory group of stuck teenagers (among them Tanya Roberts). Does he have a crazy brother too ?? The shades of PSYCHO (1960) are included for good measure, up to the same twist ?? who is supposed to be a mechanical genius (demonstrated in the 'poltergeist', who undoubtedly accompanies the first murder). The film benefits from the score of Pino Donaggio, but, being so derivative and not particularly well prepared for downloading, in fact it ends simply with excessive (and rather confusing) genre effort.
