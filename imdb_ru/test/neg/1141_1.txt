I'm a big fan of the Vacation franchise, and I love Randy Quaid as cousin Eddie, and at least a few backstage names were involved in this project (especially Matty Simmons, who produced or the executive director â€” produced all 4 theatrical releases, and also "Animal House"). For these reasons, I decided that this selection for television might be worth checking out, even without the Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> For the record, I did not expect it to be very good; I just thought it might be some fun fun. So my high level of frustration proves how horrible this full brown movie was. It was stunning, stunning, heartbreaking, terribly scary. However, for some reason I could not stop watching this. This is my disease; I can't get out of the movie or give up the TV show before it ends. Nothing made me want to return two hours of my life more than this film.
