I watched films, as it seems to me, for the last 10 years, and I must say that I never felt so bad that I felt after watching this very large film, it was bad, very bad. There were songs and songs. No one should watch this movie. The director showed that the Germans speak English, which is nonsense. The Germans do not speak English. And in one scene there was a white girl who asked for Kimesh autographs. (Ob, that he must have given her some money) In the promotion they showed that they were preparing for the Laughing rebellion. But I can say that there was only one scene where Himesh was laughing for no reason, maybe he thought he was funny. Khansika is very good. she is like an angel But too young, only 16 years old. If you have a lot of time and you do not know what to do, you should watch this movie, otherwise it is a waste of money.
