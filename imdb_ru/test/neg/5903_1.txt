This movie could be much better. This is a beautiful story that has developed in very difficult times, and yet it was so poorly executed. Leading actors in the past have done an excellent job, and for the most part they do an adequate job in this film. Although sometimes their dialogue seems unnatural and forced. The direction could be more concise. The main part of the criticism should go to the authors who took a good story and made it tiresome. In short, there are thousands of MUCH better ways to spend 2 hours.
