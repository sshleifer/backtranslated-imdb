Am I the only one who thought the meaning of this film was graphic violence? I didn't know anything about Lee Scott when I rented it, and I wouldn't have done that if I had known that most of his previous films were horror movies. It does not interest me at all, I just expected the informative documentation of the 9/11 report. <br /> <br /> Instead, I got an almost incomprehensible film about violence. The only thing I liked about it was that it made me want to read the report and see what the hell this movie was about. <br /> <br /> I wrote this because I am shocked that we became so immune to violence in films and on television that itâ€™s not even worth commenting on bloggers whose reviews I read.
