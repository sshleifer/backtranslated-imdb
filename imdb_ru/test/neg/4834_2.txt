I accidentally saw it on TV and wanted to watch it because I remembered an article in Spin magazine on which the film is based. I was very disappointed. Firstly, if James Belushi is the lead actor in the film, this should be a sign that this is not quite a staged film. Gregory Hines was a world-class dancer, but unfortunately not a great actor. <br /> <br /> In fact, all the actors in this film are either flat or Hammi, who can only be blamed for the director, the weakest link in this film. Charles Carner seemed to be trying to portray Oliver Stone's “JFK” by portraying an alleged conspiracy to cover up “real” killer children, but without using a good script, list A or said talent. It just does not work. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that such a worthy theme for the film did not receive the best treatment.
