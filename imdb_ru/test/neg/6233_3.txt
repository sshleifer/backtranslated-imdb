I have never heard of Polyanka before I once got bored with friends in a local blockbuster, and this caught our attention. The description on the DVD cover captured our interest, but as soon as we inserted it into the DVD player, boredom was just beginning. <br /> <br /> The story took too long. He seemed to be following the same plan as the other films that mention abduction. However, the most tense moments were at the beginning of the film. After this, the sketches were precisely followed, and this made the Clearing non-original. There were too many memories, and the grief of the victim’s family gave nothing interesting and did not improve the character of the film. And I also found that I didn’t like the final, so this probably led to the fact that I didn’t like the movie at all. <br /> <br /> The game was not terrible ... although not the best. Robert Redford gave much better results. The tragic character of Willem Defoe was the only one I really saw developing throughout the storyline, and the viewer really sees this change only in the last ten minutes or so in the film. Helen Mirren as the wife of Robert Redford was flat and followed the same typical pattern as other films that have a tragic and heartbreaking event. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, “Clearing” is not what you need around. Use your money to rent movies for something else ... like "Garden State"?
