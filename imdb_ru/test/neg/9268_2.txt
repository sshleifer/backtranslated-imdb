This is perhaps the most ridiculous nonsense I've ever watched. Three unrelated stories about completely stupid and random things sometimes interrupt the bus and a boring monologue about the relationship of a stupid person. Christ knows why so many people are involved in this. Highlights: A man with a green fridge reads Jean-Paul Sartre, a grubby dinner guest and her horse manure products, a FUNNY foolish woman in a third short film that suspects a guy in a dishonest game just because he showed interest in her common activities Blowers <br /> <br /> I need to spend a few more lines, so it may be worth mentioning some of the more stupid things about the film. The first film tells how a person drives a talking car and obeys its unreasonable requirements for absolutely no apparent reason. The only way to watch this movie is if you were blind and had other debilitating defects in your personality and brain. It's funny ironic, but very tiring, as if you have to chew on a dirty mat for a very long time.
