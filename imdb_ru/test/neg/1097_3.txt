Directed by Yu.S. Cardone represents something a bit scary and a bit creepy, but nothing more. Widowed mother Karen Tunni (Laurie Heuring) inherits a house in the mountains of Pennsylvania; so she takes her two daughters and moves to a vast estate that seems somewhere in the middle of the desert. But this is somewhere, about ninety-some years ago, the tragic accident at the mine claimed the lives of many children who were forced to work in the dark and in the dark. The area and especially the Tunni estate seem to be haunted by the spirits of tiny evil souls. Legend has it that screaming children come out in the moonlight in search of revenge; and you better believe it. Also in the cast: Ben Cross, Scout Taylor-Compton, Chloe Moretz, Julie Rogers and Jeffrey Lewis.
