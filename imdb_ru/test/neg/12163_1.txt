Okay, I think that I’m pretty much a fan of camels, mutilated and ruined stories about Stephen King (when they reach the Screen), like any of us sad masochists, here. I know perfectly well that most of them are done poorly. I expect it. I plan on it. I humbly admit it ... <br /> <br /> But this time ... GUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ... OK, so I THINK that I saw this thing a few years ago ... well. I THOUGHT that I remembered that it was pretty good ... WRONG ... As I said (given verbally, annoyingly, in a roundabout way :) I really did not try to be a snob or expect a lot, but that was a mini thing -series? I have only one thing to say: D ...... R ..... A ..... W ...... NO ..... U ..... T How can you CAN justify dragging things every minute, scene by scene, damn it, INFINITE, absolutely MAD, and breathtakingly SLOW dialogue? I mean EVERY bl ** dy scene where two people “DISCUSS” how they feel back and out, and D ... R ... A ... GI ... T bl ** good ... O ... U ... T After about one and a half hours, which, I think, is about half the time of work (I did not check, sorry :) I was finally fed up! In an hour and a half, what happened ANYTHING than the original accident ...? They ran away while the guy from the Store was killing oculists, news photographers, and MANY and MANY winding dialogues. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I promise that I do not have non-stop thoughtless action; I love a lot of movies where little is happening, but at least when they do speak, and such SIGNIFICANT things are said, and the characters go deeper, thoughts are transferred ... SOMETHING !!! ??? Well, I admit that the actors themselves were not so bad (except for Stephen King, of course :) I liked the guy from the store, I thought both the “older” people were fine. I liked the general and the main woman. Just if they could cut out all the HOURS of the filler, that's all I'm saying. I mean, it's supposed to be a fantastic thriller, sort of ..., right? You know that he actually took the prize when the guy from the Store unnecessarily made one of his MANY time, dialing phone calls, this time he is talking to God, who knows that WHO is becoming emotional (for him anyway) and behaves as if he is not coping. .. WTF !!! ??? This guy was clearly a cold-blooded, effective killer. What was hell about ??? So just multiply it by about 500, and that is why I finally turned it off about half way; it was either so or hang myself, I swear! I mean, there are other King’s “adaptations” that are lame, but at least they MOVE TOGETHER ...! Well, okay, probably, if you CAN understand the “history” itself and don’t mind creeping forward and have SUPERIOR AND DIVINATE patience to wait for the end, it can be worth it. <br /> <br /> But I sincerely and humbly doubt it ... <br /> <br /> I do not write these things very often, but this time I just MUST or I could not sleep at night (as I did) DURING the show! :)
