I had a little hope for this watch film, consisting of frames from old films “Poverty”. Of course, he had the opportunity to appear as something more than a mass video sold in the world. Unfortunately, despite the fact that this film is funny, it still resembles a home movie, but with frames included in it. <br /> <br /> The story concerns a scheduled will reading on a liner at midnight somewhere in the tropics. The ship is sinking and well ... that's the movie. <br /> <br /> The film promises that Karloff, Lugosi, Cheney and others will be removed from old films to interact with new shots. We understand it well, but basically we get a lot of new videos, made in the form of a spiky black and white film, in which new actors play. Old shots mostly intersect to set the scene, but very little of the old and the new actually coincide, so they are clearly simply put on. This is not very convincing and very disappointing, because someone like me was looking for a better movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you know and love the old films “Poverty” (this is very deceptive), it can be worth watching. I would caution against buying it, but you can buy it for about five bucks, the cost of rent), so the choice is yours (although if you can avoid paying, do it). <br /> <br /> Unsatisfactory.
