Watching this movie made me think, why does Universal produce such films? They had a great series of movies with all the classic horror movies. The dawn of the atomic age caused an onslaught of films about giant creatures. Spiders, ants, mantises. With the “Deadly Praying Mantis” we have a giant praying mantis flying across the Arctic, frightening the Eskimos and pursued by the armed forces. The beetle reaches the tunnel in New York, where the soldiers eventually destroy it. Of course, all this has become much more watchable, viewing it on MST. Who thought it was a good idea to start a movie by showing a giant map?
