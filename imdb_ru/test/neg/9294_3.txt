A very delicate topic - a 15-year-old girl, abandoned by her mother as a child, who visits her, continues to be ignored, raped by her mom's boyfriend, will become pregnant. Not enough depth of this situation. Too much time is spent in pursuit with truckers carrying a child. (Interestingly, this child with asthma — you will never see him crying — except once — is fed, diapers changed during the entire truck test.) I would like to see more interconnections, more attention to the fact that this girl was a minor — that was to stand up in court immediately. <br /> <br /> And it was a true story! It deserves a better story than this! <br /> <br /> If it were not for the subject, I would give it closer to 0 point. I rented it at the library. Only later did I find out that it was made for a television movie. <br /> <br /> oh well
