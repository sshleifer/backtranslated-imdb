Well, the name in the resume should tell you everything. FRED OLEN RAY is the modern king of low-budget films, whether for television or for live video (I doubt he shoots more for the silver screen - with the death of the double functions of film B and all the rest). <Br /> <br /> Creator of such iconic (?) Classics as the Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers and Dinosaur Island .... <br /> <br /> Well, I guys like these things. This is mostly entertaining (obviously too, polite and especially cheap), and if he is alone, he is professional - something that cannot be said to all the guys from the cinema movie. <br /> <br /> But this film is one of the weakest in his work. A tasteless game, a boring scenario and sloppy jokes conspire to make the brain lose consciousness in a matter of minutes. If you really want F.O.R. My God (or rather, badly), pay attention to the aforementioned, and generally his things from the 70s and 80s (I think that he has lost a bit of his advantage lately).
