In a quiet town, a couple of girls witness the murder of one of their friends to a strange young guy named Milo, who lives in another part of the city. After the murder, his body was found in the river, and his body was declared dead. So sixteen years later, the weddings return the girls to their city of childhood, and school teacher Claire becomes obsessed with the fact that Milo did not die, because her visions of him are repeated, and her friends die one after another, and no one believes her when she claims Milo is detached from that. So now she goes in search of a terrifying truth. <br /> <br /> When I came across this film, I was skeptical about it, especially when the cover was “From the creators of Anaconda”. , but reading the weird little storyline on the back of the video building, it sounded good and quite refreshing for a change. Well, guess what? I thought it was a good idea at the time, but it was a different story when it came to watching a movie. It seemed that I was trying hard to be smart and very psychologically sound, but this last element did not work out for me, and it was basically a long and mostly unconvincing thriller. Hey, I admit that he had his moments, but it is hardly enough that he was neither frightening nor memorable. But, as the creators of the film, at least, the story does not resonate with those imitation slashers who followed “Scream” and shock horror, is there no obvious humorous humor ?? in fact, there is not even a hint of humor. Although, maybe it was too serious? Moreover, the plot is rather absurd, but this is not its main problem. What a sporadic plot we get, I didn’t know what was happening, as it seems that he does a lot in favor of some supposedly shocking and disturbing episodes. Not! More like irrelevant scenes and clichés causing a yawn, which we see from time to time. You can also see the influence of some of the “good” horror films of the 70s, one of which is “Don't watch now”. This is when our main character continues to see the figure of her past with glasses. The other was supposed to be one of my favorite “Alice, sweet Alice” with a man causing problems, wearing a yellow jacket and committing horrible deaths. An interesting idea, but it is quite superficial and there are too many faults. I liked it better when the scenes dealt with the character’s childhood, as there was something terrible in the performances and circumstances, but when it relied on their adult life, it was mostly tired and without adventure, and the performances were not terrible, but incredibly mundane is hardly a good way to express it. Most of the dialogue made me moan from disbelief, as far as it was contrived and awkward. You will scream "no spirit!" on the screen, because you just can't believe what you hear. Police detective gets the brunt! <br /> <br /> Quality is wise - the film is not bad, in fact it is better than usual, I would say, right on the video. Very nice things. With some inventive and outstanding camera angles and a weak result that works quite well. Another factor that stood out and was key to creating a mood atmosphere was the creeping sound effects, and that cycling bell really leaves the sensation of a bell in your ears. The quiet elementary school setting was well done, and the rest of the action takes place in the house. But just do not expect any real expectations or surprises, since their implementation does not exist. Death is not pleasant, and it is slightly bloody, and it is rather the consequences of what happens to these bodies that are trying to bother you. The villain in this play, Milo Jider's sneaky child, was a little upset, it's good that his voice and yellow jacket really create an imprint to begin with, but it looks like he loses his effect when we come to the conclusion of the film. The fake lines on the video compare him to (move away) Jason, (look) Freddie and (this is not a child's game) Chucky, but you must be joking! Right? He is labeled as "New face of evil", yes, of course. All he needs is to learn manners and solve problems. In general, the film just left me with a sour taste, since I could leave without seeing it. I probably would like me to do. <br /> <br /> Just don't expect too much in this blur of film. Or, better yet, just skip it, since you don’t miss a lot, really.
