I saw this film last night at Berlinale as part of a competition. This was announced as the “world premiere” of the film by the host (although it seems that people here have seen it before). I have to say, I still do not know what to do with the film. I am not familiar with the book, I bought a ticket only two hours before and had limited knowledge of the plot. It seems not enough, because I had problems getting into the movie. Sometimes a movie is told by a Jones character, but for some reason this point of view did not suit me. And I really can't say if some of the laughs that got the film were calculated or not. The cuts were sharp and destructive, the scenes seemed to somehow merge together, and storytelling did not always make sense right away (even without taking into account the supernatural parts) - the actors were really good, but could not somehow save the film. It was interesting, but sometimes only in the sense that I sat and thought about the technical details of making the film and what went wrong with that. I still do not know what mood the director intended to create. It was a strange mixture of light, darkness, supernatural. Unfortunately, this did not attract me at all, and I rather looked at it from the technical side. But thinking about what is wrong with the film while watching is the best sign that the film somehow failed. I would definitely expect something else with the participation of these actors ... very bad!
