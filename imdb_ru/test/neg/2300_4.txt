The killing of Red Comyn in Greyfriars Abbey was far from one of the most terrible things ever committed in the Scottish War of Independence, and the fights (and murders) in churches were not at all unusual. Not so much later, the wife of Robert the Bruce, a daughter, his two sisters were captured during a fight in a church in which people were killed. And comparing it with the massacre at Berwick, when the British killed at least 8,000 non-combatants (some, yes, in the churches), is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a very good movie. This is a little antidote to Robert Bruce’s absolutely ridiculous presentation in Braveheart. Whatever Bruce, it was not a failure. <br /> <br /> It’s a pity that they didn’t cope better with this task, because someone had to make a really GOOD war movie, which is so amazing that it sounds like something that someone came up with by moving from complete defeat at the Battle of Methven to a secret return from cover to the long guerrilla war in Bannockburn. It is not so yet. Poorly done and largely poorly written and acted. Very bad!
