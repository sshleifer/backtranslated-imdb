Ashes of Time was a bold project, but in the end it turned out to be a pretentious film. This film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex way. The plot of the "dust of time" is quite simple and comes down to two words: "love triangle". Because of these "love triangles," the intersection of stories, jealousy, hatred and love are the main dynamics that the characters demonstrate. The narrative is visible through the eyes of Ou-Yan Feng (Leslie Cheung). Ou-Yan Feng lives in the desert, where he acts as a mediator for various swordsmen and becomes an instrument of Destiny, through which revenge is achieved. Unfortunately, Ashes of Time cannot tell these simple stories of love and hate. Wong Kar-wai lost his composure because of the desire to make every frame of the film a picture and aesthetic experience. In fact, besides the casting of beautiful actors (men and women), the rest is a failure in this film. Dialogues are minimalistic and not at all original. Image quality is very unequal, editing is one of the worst (at least to me) in the “sword playing” genre, and, finally, shooting a rare sword battle is very tangled and unattractive. Even an attempt to create art scenes is not always achieved: the so-called erotic scene of "women on horseback" is ridiculous, not erotic and useless. Wong Kar-wai wanted to deliver 100 minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that the film was first about how the story is told. Forgetting that he delivers an awkward film that does not even fulfill its artistic task.
