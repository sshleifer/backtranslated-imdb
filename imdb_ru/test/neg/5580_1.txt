From time to time it's nice to see a really bad movie like this, just so you know how decent the actor Keanu Reeves is compared to him. The premise of this story is good: teenagers go on a boat, a meteor lands in the water, aliens kill teenagers. What do you dislike about it if you like flashy thrillers? But I should have known that something happened when I read that it is only 75 minutes. I thought, “I hate judging films by how long they are. Who said that the film should be 90 minutes? ”But as soon as I took the DVD home from BBuster, I was shocked by the terrible quality of production, acting by directing this completely amateur piece of garbage. The only reason I watched it to the end was because I didn't have cable television, and I already paid four dollars for it. However, there was one ray of light: the actor who played "Chris" is, in fact, decent, and far surpassed this bastard. First of all, the special effects were cheap and inconclusive. Then the aliens - the costumes seemed interesting (rubber costumes), but since most of the movie takes place in the dark, you can't see them! And hardly any of the actors was so convincing as to suspend disbelief. Finally, I have to say that the DVD wrapper was made with much higher production standards than the film itself, which looked like plagiarism, so beware of this when you rent other DVDs. Save 4 dollars and buy a pint of beer.
