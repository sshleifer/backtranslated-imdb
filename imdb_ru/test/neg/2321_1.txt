Absolutely pointless movie with Abbott and Costello. Even our young children will be more and more annoyed by this total mess of the movie. <br /> <br /> Abbott, like Dinklepuss. What was his look. Of course, he had to be part of this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Has anyone noticed that Costello's mother sounded in the film and looked like Faye Bainter? Fortunately for Miss Bainter, she was not in the film. <br /> <br /> Children really have no excitement. The jokes, if any, are pretty stale. Part of the singing is well done, but the lyrics are funny.
