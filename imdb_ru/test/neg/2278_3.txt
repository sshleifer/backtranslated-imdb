This is what used to be called the "female picture" and then the "click of a chick" when times and films became more and more young. The plot is just a soap opera for women and will appeal to only these types. The only attraction for most guys is if they want to see Mary Tyler Moore too thin in swimsuits. (If you, like me, are of a certain age, this may still be enough to look at it.) Otherwise, MTM gives another of its typical games in terms of the amount she has been giving since the early 70s, when she took its close to my heart that she was America's lover. Christina Lati gives another one of those abrasive and unpleasant ideas that seem to be a real part of her as a person and probably only appeal to those of this type. (Sorry, but that seems to be true.) Ted Danson is too young as MTM's husband, and usually gives a slightly creepy appeal if he does not have a working partner who can soften it. And this is not happening here. Allan Burns wrote and directed and probably coped with all this because he used to work with Mary, wrote her as a project for her, and at that moment she had juice to do it. It seems there is no other purpose.
