Almost certainly the installation of women reading the lines (very briefly) and undressing (not very briefly) in front of an anonymous (and uncredited) group - almost certainly including producer Charles Bend. Added random scenes from many Surrender Cinema films (mostly lesbian scenes). Most women like riding horses (Hmmm); there is a Polish woman who does not seem to be interested in acting, despite the fact that she is auditioning; secret; the camera that shoots the actresses undressing behind the screen ... <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Lovell (too fictional, but still beautiful) presents a couple of her own movie scenes and looks at the camera "sexy" (If you like lesbian scenes , they include scenes with Lovell and Vanessa Taylor from Femalian, and they are probably the most beautiful lesbian “couple” in history). An unusual excuse for the film, except for the obvious draw of naked women, frankly boring and boring experience.
