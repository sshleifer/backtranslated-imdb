I saw this film when it was first released in 1986. At that time I was young and enjoyed all the ordinary comedies available, i.e. Monty Python, Jim Belushi and SNL, Steve Martin, Cheech and Chong, so I believe that most of the "sensible" people represent my judgment. <br /> <br /> Absolutely the best part of this movie is the trailer played at the beginning of the movie for my new movie "My Little Pony", which came out. <br /> <br /> This film was so terrible that it was actually pulled out of most cinemas before the first weekly show began. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that someone would spend corporate money here to copy this steaming pile of human waste. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and money on renting or watching this “movie”.
