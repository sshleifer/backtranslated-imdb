Every time I see such a film, my stomach hurts. When I watch a movie, I like to see what I see in everyday life. During the day, I see blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos, etc. How do you make a film and don't even think that other ethnic groups can pass by you? I'm sure they did not do it on purpose, but pay attention. I don't care if it happens in Kansas or in the south of Central. All I saw was one black token. This was typical in the 80s. Hello! This is 2007, when all rappers, singers and sportsmen work as actors. Thomas Hayden Church could pay more attention to its composition. Shouldn't actors be more liberal?
