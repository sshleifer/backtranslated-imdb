Another one in the long line of Conan imitators, who are tired of preying on the success of this film, this Italian monster is about as bad as it appeared. You know that this is a bad sign when your heroes fight invisible enemies, because the film was made so cheap that there was no money for adequate special effects or for hiring real people. I will not even go into the plot, because I will not give anyone any attention and understand the meaning of the plot. Maybe I watched a TV program, but I can not imagine that some version was much better. It all seems random to me. Evil sorcerers, cavemen, giant snakes, medieval castles, grenades and hang gliding ?? none of this fits. It was as if director Joe D'Amato had an epileptic seizure when he was filmed in Cave Dwellers (or in any of the half-dozen movie titles) and threw everything he could think of, regardless of how it was not related or how to fit into the already mysterious plot of the film. The game is bad enough. Miles O'Keefe can never get out of a wet paper bag, and he proves it again in this film. The rest of the cast is equally brutal. Then there is. Well, you understand. It's late, I'm tired, and I've already spent more than enough time to write about this piece of garbage. Believe me ?? Avoid cave dwellers (or whatever you want to call it) at all costs.
