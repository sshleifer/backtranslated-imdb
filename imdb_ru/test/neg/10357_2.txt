Some people say that this show was good in the early years! I do not agree with all of them. The show is just stupid and miserable. My mom hates it, I hate it, my dad hates it, I don't know about my sister, but oh well. Here are a few reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1. CHARACTERS: Infants used as adult characters are stupid. Babies are just premature and annoying. Adults and adults are stupid and unattractive. The worst character is Angelica Pickles (she really does it for your eardrums when you had a long, hard and unhappy day at the office), and also Kimi Finster, who appears later; she is too optimistic and pain in the ass. She cannot decide where she is French or Japanese: it’s not important to know; You know the American citizen, and that's all! Oh, what I'm talking about, all the characters of this show sucks! <br /> <br /> 2. STORIES: Stories are unoriginal and stupid. Make it look like the kids are going on a big adventure, yes, in the backyard shed. In one episode, this little dumb bastard Tommy Pickles Leader broke into the television control room and literally nearly destroyed it. Do not offer children to break the usual T.V Station control stations (in real life, they are paid a lot of money). I can imagine that the broadcasters were supposed to broadcast on this episode, they would probably start looking at their cars during the day, fearing that the child would stop. Sad <br /> <br /> 3. OVER RATED!: The show has dragged on for years, and people are still coming up with stories, new series and by-products for this. Get out! The Simpsons go almost as much time as this, but they are much better and funnier than the children. The show is just overvalued! People, where is your common sense! <br /> <br /> In any case, I’m surprised that television stations all over the world want to broadcast this series even today. The show is complete rubbish and should never have been produced. Two films for this cartoon sucked in the same way! 2/10
