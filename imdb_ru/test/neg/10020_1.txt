Of course, most of the 1980s slasher films were not worth the celluloid <br /> <br /> they were shot at, but this video nightmare may well be the most boring <br /> <br />. <Br /> <br /> Six excited pot-smoking students decide to go camping. Of course, <br /> <br /> and you already know this, a mysterious stranger begins to kill them one by one. The climax is a frantic forester trying to get to the teenagers before the last sweet girl becomes the buzzard. <br /> <br /> The bait. <br /> <br /> John Karl Büchler, my least favorite guy in B-movies, was doing lousy makeup effects here. Cast: Karel Streiken, "<br /> <br /> The Witches of Eastwick" and Addams family films. Unfortunately, he <br /> <br /> does not appear until the very end of the film and is covered with a handful <br /> <br />, which makes it unrecognizable. Steve Bond (does anyone <br /> <br /> remember him?) Plays an early victim role. <br /> <br /> Brown’s direction and the script he wrote both smell like <br /> <br /> Brown bear’s gifts are left in the forest. It complements the film <br /> <br /> with such a large amount of material that it seemed to me that I accidentally shot a special episode of the film Mutual Kingdom of the Wild Kingdom of Omaha <br /> <br />. Most of the actors <br /> <br /> sit by the fire and eat, then go, sit down and eat again <br /> <br />. Forester is involved in the strangest scene ever put in <br /> <br /> in a slasher film: he tells a joke about a frog with a wide maw of a small deer <br /> <br />. Jackie Coogan, who must have forgotten that he once worked in <br /> <br /> with the legends of a silent movie, has two scenes, and he participates in <br /> <br /> in the second the weird scene ever put into a slasher movie: he and <br /> <br /> wild forester talk about cucumber and sandwiches with cream cheese on oat bread ... yes. <br /> <br /> not one minute of waiting here. A killer who survived a forest fire <br /> <br /> in search of an assistant watches students from behind the trees <br /> <br />. We know that this is a killer, because the filmmakers <br /> <br /> duplicated the sound effect of a heartbeat, which helpfully awakens the viewer every few minutes. Instead, skip this pile of pine juice and rent a Halloween <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> This is a rating (R) for physical abuse, slight violence with the use of firearms, blood, <br /> <br /> some profanity, brief nudity of the female sex, light sexual content, sexual links < br /> and drug abuse.
