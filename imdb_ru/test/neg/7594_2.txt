New Year's Day. The next day, after consuming too much vodka of martini and cosmopolitan mixed with sparkling wine at midnight, my wife and I found out that the local cable company offered digital digital channels for free in the month of January. We had a choice - do we use free channels or are we starting to watch eight seasons of the X-Files on DVD, which we received from our daughter at Christmas? <br /> <br /> We chose a digital freebie. since the DVDs do not go anywhere, and we need something around ten twelve-hour days to watch all the X-Files that are starting to run out. The Drive-In Channel offered the classic marathon of three horror films: Asylum (1972), House of the Damned (1996) and Pit and Pendulum (1961). The refuge here is well tested, and Yama and the Pendulum were too late for us to observe them, which meant that we really could only be properly criticized for the House of the Damned. <br /> <br /> To be honest, we tried to be serious about the film, as its stars have quite good acting qualities - Greg Evigan (rewritten by Tekwars by William Shatner) and Alexander Paul (the only Baywatch baby who could play, though she has the body of a ten year old boy). Unfortunately, we soon disappeared into a giggle, under the influence of a small dog hair, when we shouted out the names of the films from which this dog borrowed its scenes: Poltergeist, Shining, Hell House, Ghost House Hill, Ghostbusters! <br /> <br /> The game, especially from the real daughter of Evigan, was not too bad, given the silly scenario with which they had to work. CGI in 1996 was hilarious - at the worst point of the final scene, when it was the worst, it was so bad that my wife and I disappeared into laughter. <br /> <br /> Overall: Acting 4/5, Scenario 2/5, SFX 0/5
