I would agree with another viewer who wrote that this film resembles the unusual comedy of Melanie Griffith / Jeff Daniels, “Something Wild,” in which a rather eccentric free spirit connects with a conservative and very orderly young man, and the two look like a couple and basically, her personality gradually influences him. He loses strength and learns to enjoy their short date. This is exactly what is happening here, with the exception of inserting a convenient eccentric robbing the store, Alex (Rosanna Arquette) as Melanie Griffith and a very careful teenager, Lincoln (not accidentally, played by Devon Hammersall) as Jeff Daniel. In this film, there is even the same twist and dramatic change in the genre, when at the end an eerie, brutal guy suddenly appears, and everything ends up pretty bad. Only here, instead of Ray Liotta playing the role of the movie heads of the 1950s, is Peter Green. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a teenager who lives in his little world. After the suicide of his brother, he experiences some kind of passion for death, and his parents also disconnected, behaving rather strangely (the mother is convinced that Christmas will come soon, despite the fact that this is August). Then, at a party with “guys” (one of whom is played by Jason Hervey from “Wonderful Years”) trying to buy them beer, he runs into Alex, who decides to kidnap him and his friends car (with his permission, of course), and they embark on a mini-adventure through the deserts of the West Coast, robbing convenience stores in the style of Robin Hood and, of course, indulging in ordinary self-knowledge, when everyone asks more about the life of another. But Alex has left a partner in her theft trade, and he does not leave easily. Although we are not constantly reminded of him or about something, as in a recurring memory or in the context of his point of view. At least this was done very cleverly. <br /> <br /> “Do me a favor” (otherwise known as “Souvenirs in trade”) is basically an undeveloped story about criminal intrigue and self-discovery, which lags somewhat behind the first half of the film, but delivers the goods a little later, when Alex and Lincoln arrive at her home from nowhere. By the time the filmmakers stimulate you enough, the film, unfortunately, is almost over. I would recommend that if this is such a story, to which you are in a good mood, and, despite the fact that Rosanna Arquette always gives a good performance (even in a poorly written film), I still recommend catching her in the best possible way: that wild.
