Predator Island begins with six friends, Eric (Tom Dahl), Chris (Dan Gordon) along with Heather (Iris McQuillan Grace), Kim (Jan Baker) and Denise (Melissa Roby) are invited to spend time on Kevin (Michael Vrann). father's party on the high seas. What can go wrong with such a great sounding idea? Well, first of all, a big green meteorite could crash into the sea next to your boat, and an alien life force could emerge from it and try to kill all of you, again, this is just a ridiculously stupid idea, isn't it? <Br /> <br /> Edited, written and directed by Stephen Castle, I thought Predator Island was crap and that was really simple and clear. The worst-case scenario, you know some kind of abomination that is full of very annoying teenage characters who do and say the most stupid things, it is full of cliches and completely predictable, it is almost useless, everything is just Suddenly it happens without any difficulties or explanations, it's boring even after more than 70 minutes, and he has practically no entertainment value, not even unintentional laughter. In fact, in the film there is little that I would call a plot, there is no explanation of why or how this alien creature can capture people's minds or why it can be selective in the sense that in one moment a person will be. ” normal 'the next, when the story demands it and for no apparent reason, they suddenly get green luminous eyes and a sudden desire to turn the ogre. There is not enough horror in it, so-called militants are pitiful, and I really do not want to waste a second to think about Predator Island, not to mention wasting my precious energy typing these words ... <br /> <br /> Director Castle does nothing to make this thing watchable, and the “special effects” are absolutely terrible, this dude from an alien creature won't even get into a science fiction movie from the 50s. The filmmakers even play a few episodic videos with final captions, but this should be the least ridiculous collection of errors in the entire history, I mean, they cannot even be mistaken if you know what I mean! Forget about any decent blood, as there is none, there is a bit of cannibalism and some guts placed in the stomach of unfortunate actors so that another unfortunate actor can take them and pretend to eat. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 150,000. I have to admit that the filmmakers worked on a very low budget, but this is not yet an excuse for making such a bad film. It all looks very cheap and the acting is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> “Predatory Island” is crap, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is, and I just don't understand what anybody gets. In my humble opinion, this should probably be avoided.
