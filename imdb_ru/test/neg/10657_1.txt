... without anything to leave. This film begins with scenes in China with the search for a newborn. Although this is not a new concept, I am not going to give up right now. Then there is a flash forward to youth. The manâ€™s wife and the biological child are fed up with their father, who has neglected them. Although it did not seem culturally accurate, and the film did not attempt to develop these characters or the goal of devotion to the adoptive father, I continued. <br /> <br /> Then we are in Malibu, where we are bombarded by poorly constructed classroom interaction and a terribly low budget (fill in the blank: action / camerawork / lighting). <br /> <br /> I will no longer distribute the plot, because I assume that the synopsis is accurate: the film is meant to show how the Malibu girl, which (although she seems to have compassion and interest initially to help others when she immediately asks her teacher about going to China is spoiled and inattentive, she considers herself a healer and an assistant of body and spirit. <br /> <br /> Lame. LAME, LAME, LAME. <br /> <br /> Now I am admittedly a sharp critic, so maybe take away one of these LAMEs and you will be the center of attention.
