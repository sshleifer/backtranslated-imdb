the usual disclaimer - I do not give 1-star ratings to movies that are harmless, bad, low-budget, and stupid, although they may deserve it. These films are often fun and rated 2-4, based solely on entertainment value, and not on the example of their artistic mastery. This film is perfect for this model. This is a Mexican film with monsters, riddled with an off-screen plot and extremely weak, not so much special effects. Make-up is not so bad, and acting is sometimes quite interesting, but this film is almost as stupid as "Aliens vs. Predator", and the script is not that tricky ("Aliens vs. Predator" can get 1 from me, but I I want to look again, until I did). <br /> <br /> The plot is funny but very confusing. If you read this far, you must really want to know ... The main characters are a group of surprisingly unscientific scientists. Most of them are heroes - sort of - but one (of course) is mad and rather perverted. This mad scientist invents a ridiculous nuclear-powered robot (which is a bit like a tin man from the Wizard of Oz, but he has a human face, inexplicably located inside his head). The Aztec mummy, discovered by the same “scientist” whose wife in a past life turned out to be (and does not ask) an Aztec princess, opposed the robot because of a big “climax”; <br /> <br /> For what it costs, considering the budget and the complete nonsense of the script, this is a very interesting low-budget film about a monster with fools. If you are into such a thing, go for it.
