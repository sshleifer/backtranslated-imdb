The problem with creating such a film, however, is that the finale, the creme de la creme of the film, the battle between two reinforced ships, must be made well. Disappointingly, this scene in the Ironclads is obviously completely made with small model ships in an overgrown bath. There is no tension, there is little explanation of what exactly is happening and what the time frame of the confrontation. <br /> <br /> In the film there are quite a few liberties with the surrounding plot, as in all real stories when they turn. for the film, such as the traitor to the Union and, in particular, the film Betty Stewart (Madsen), a beauty from Virginia. <br /> <br /> He resorts to creating a possibly decent film with an interesting story about iron plates and preaching about the evils of slavery. It was out of place in this historical drama and was a cheap ploy to attract female viewers. It only managed to reduce the positive aspects of the film.
