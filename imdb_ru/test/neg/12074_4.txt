This film tells about the life of a great guitarist who wants to make it big, but acts irresponsibly until almost self-destruct. <br /> <br /> I expected the usual witty dialogs of Woody Allen, sarcasm and humor, but Sweet and Lowdown could not provide them. The main character Emmett Ray is an egocentric, rude, irresponsible and offensive person. He is so unlikely that I do not want to take care of him now or take care of him. I wonder why a film about him should be made. The course of history is slow, which makes the film a terrible bore. Even the great acting of Sean Penn is not able to revive the film to an acceptable level. <br /> <br /> I really like Woody Allen movies, but Sweetness and Depression is a big disappointment.
