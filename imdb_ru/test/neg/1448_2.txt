The government began to look promising, but soon it became boring and tiring to watch. The plot of the ancient Aztec doll, which seizes those who own it. The idea is "decent enough", and this film would be quite interesting if it were made better. However, after the first ten minutes or so, it soon becomes boring; we don't have good death scenes and we have to listen to a lot of talk. In the end, one of the obsessed men meets his death, melting in front of two girls, but this is not very interesting and definitely not terrible. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend the Force to any horror or slash fan, since there is little that can be obtained from it.
