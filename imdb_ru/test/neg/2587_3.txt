The 1987 “Black Widow” by Debra Winger is MUCH better. <br /> <br /> This looks like an unsuccessful version, and Jane Seymour is usually better. <br /> <br /> Chad Allen is pretty poor too. Just play your usual role as a boring rebellious child. <br /> <br /> Maybe both of them from Dr. Quinn should have thrilled us. <br /> <br /> If this is the case, go get a copy of the Black Widow.
