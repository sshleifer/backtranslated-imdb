In the 1930s, Hal Roach Studios was on top of the comedy world with stars such as Laurel and Hardy, Charlie Chase and Little Scammers. Most of these films are exceptional and have stood the time. However, the least well-known product of Roach was the combination of Thelma Todd and Saas Pitts (later Todd was paired with the equally incompetent Patsy Kelly). No matter how hard you try, I just can't stand these pictures - they are just not funny. In addition, unlike Laurel and Hardy, there was not a drop of chemistry between Todd and her two colleagues. Before you just think that I'm a crank, understand that I watched and watched a few hundred Roach films, as well as many other early comedies, so I am well acquainted with the genre in this genre, this team is one of the worst. One of the reasons why I think I'm right on the team is that, being a lower level team in Roach, they were given all the scenarios that no one else wanted. If Stan or Ollie hated the idea of ​​the plot, it was often betrayed by Todd and Pitts / Kelly - and this was usually shown. <br /> <br /> In this film, however, the team is at its lowest level. It’s hard to imagine a comedy with less laughter and a more contrived plot. The film begins with Zasu in the jury and Thelma as a protector. As for Zas, she is a completely annoying moron. NOT an attractive idiot (like Stan Laurel or Lou Costello), but just an annoying and irritable person, energetic and unpleasant. As for Thelma, then, as usual, she is a rather mild “straight person”, and therefore she can do little but react to Zasu’s boorish behavior. <br /> <br /> The story suggests that Thelma protects a client who is accused of selling exploding products. diet pills. Given that the pills are very dangerous, when a lawyer asks Zas to try to swallow him, he seems silly. And although they were called “pills,” they were more like giant black blobs that were more than golf balls. Swallowing them only seemed far-fetched and made no sense - even for comedy. When they discover that she has swallowed a pill, and it is really explosive, everyone panics and runs like idiots until the film ends. <br /> <br /> As I said, I'm not a fan of this team. However, even for those who want to like the film, there is not a single legitimate laugh in the entire short! When I discussed this review with my wife (who also watched the movie with me), she thought that my score 2 was too generous !!
