Well, the film was not terrible, but whoever created the script, he did not even cope with creating the essence of unger. This film was slightly below average and did not tell the story of one of the most interesting people ever born. I propose to read the book "One of a Kind," a true extraordinary story. They left huge parts of their lives. They also did not understand from time to time who he really was. The factual facts of his life were sometimes not in order. And in the end they didnâ€™t really depict the actual person he had. So please do not watch the movie; to read a book. By the way, I'm not just a jerk who feels like you have to be 100% real, but they haven't even come close !!!
