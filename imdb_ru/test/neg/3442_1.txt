Tim Taylor - abusing the acholomic addict. He is a coward and a child and has absolutely no redeeming qualities as an actor or person. The only film with him that gives him pleasure is the “Galactic Quest”, and this is only because his character — the exhausted actor from the formerly popular TV show — was so close to his real life. The rest of the cast is equally bad. I hate the mother and the actress who played her Patricia Richardson, she sucks! There is always a cliché, a stupid woman who is fat, loves opera and cares only for her children, while in real life she proclaims family values ​​and divorces after the birth of twins. And the children's actors were about as interesting as the root canal.
