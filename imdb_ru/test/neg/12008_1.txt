What a horrible movie. Full of clich√©, confusing scenes, a very bad acting game and a disgusting script. It's hard to believe the same guys who wrote "People vs. Larry Flynt" and "Man on the Moon," who wrote this trash. Man, this makes my list of the top 10 worst films of all time. Is this guy, this director, if you can call him that, not aware that the first Problem child was bad enough? Not to mention making a sequel for this !! ?? Surprisingly, this piece of junk films like this can be shown to children, not to mention release! 1 out of 10 *
