A young man named Danny ran away from home and meets a stroller named Bix, who agrees to go along with Danny and watch him ... and his money. They end up in a small town where they meet Carrie - a shy, naive girl working at her father's diner. Bix begins to date Carrie, but is about to leave (because he is a vagabond, you understand? He is useless! Understand?). Meanwhile, the urban creep, Jesse (played by Jack Elam, who is excellently cast), continues to appear in the diner and harass Carrie. Danny continues to carelessly pick up left and right whores (because he is loaded with money - he has almost a hundred dollars!), Which Bix must constantly chase (in this film there are many ambiguous funny overtones between Danny and Bix). In the end, Bicks and Danny decide to leave the city, but troubles are brewing because of a creeping Jesse. <br /> <br /> My review of the film itself: the terrible, outdated film "Restless Youth" from the 50s. <br /> <br /> My review of the film version for MST3K: I have to say that this is one of the best MST3K episodes ever. Riffing is dead all the time. With the exception of a bit of a sad ending, this film is light material for Joel and Bots, especially Danny’s constant failures, from which Bix must save him. Host segments are also pretty good, especially the “Train Song” segment. Hopefully Rhino will release this episode for a home video one day.
