If you read Errol Flynn’s autobiography, My Wicked, Evil Ways, you will see that this film is full of a poetic license. Not that it was important because Errol Flynn was quite generous with a poetic license in his autobiography anyway. Do not worry about spoilers, because there is nothing to spoil. <br /> <br /> It seems to me more reasonable to use the story of a fictional Hollywood actor; then you can go out and find a better actor than Duncan Reger to play it, and you don’t have to worry about the audience saying something like, “But he didn't have a mustache in Captain Blood. Another disadvantage of this film is that it shows Flynn as a two-dimensional character. Flynn was a smart man, well educated, well readable. This film concentrates only on its image. <br /> <br /> Reger is a disaster. The rest of the actors struggle with their scripts. Hal Linden is fine like Warner, and Barbara Hershey makes a believable Damita, although Lily Damita herself did not think so. <br /> <br /> The best thing you can do with this movie is to forget about it and let it slip in gently. away to oblivion. So I write this, I can not imagine.
