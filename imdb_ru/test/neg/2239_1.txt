Little Quentin seems to have mastered the art of having a cake and eating it. <br /> <br /> As usual, a pure sadistic show can be explained as a clever, thought-provoking way to send violence back to the audience. <br /> <br /> Of course, Mr. Tarantino. Violence is Baaad. Sadism is Baaad. It is worth it to make sure. How beautiful it is. <br /> <br /> The youth part of the audience may not be so smart as to follow all the clever references to higher levels of consciousness, but I am sure that one day they will see the light. <br /> <br /> Thank you for making our little world a little better. You deserve a medal.
