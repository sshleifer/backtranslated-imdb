Just watched this movie at Fantasy Filmfest BERLIN. I am not impressed. <br /> <br /> As for the story? Too girlfriends come back from vacation in Mexico. While waiting for their luggage, they meet a couple of boys, who then get on the last and, of course, the wrong bus to the city. On board is also another elderly man, so strangely pictured, that you can immediately guess that he is one of the bad guys. The other is the driver. <br /> <br /> The shuttle takes them to an industrial wasteland, and then one by one they cook, some blood, some cuts to the limbs, some violence, mostly playing with the fear of the girl and there are not too new scary moments, all are dead, except for the driver and the girls. the girls end up in a garage where one of them was killed, after admitting that she was sleeping with the guy of her other friends. The other girl, who is imprisoned, was sold by the remaining kidnapper (yes, the crank was killed) in some cargo box to Asia (cargo harbor - the final picture). At first. Story. Tons of loopholes, questions you ask yourself, weaknesses and a conclusion that is not a good revelation, but causes complete disappointment. I can not understand how such an unprofessional loser had to kidnap dozens of women (as indicated by the box full of driver's licenses ... yeah) Second. The acting. Mediocre at its best. <br /> <br /> Thirdly. Intimidating factor. OK. but I suffered from torture as a means to nothing but myself. Trafficking with people can be a good reason for a horror movie, but it is not used as one, just as a background. <br /> <br /> Fourth, Music and sound. Several successful attempts, but the sound possibilities of the industrial landscape, the warehouse garage and the sounds of trucks have not really been explored. Music? It would have been worse without him, but beyond that. Some pseudo moving theme of a synth string for emotionality, when girls reach their final destination. Ok, I think. <br /> <br /> Verdict: AVOID IT!
