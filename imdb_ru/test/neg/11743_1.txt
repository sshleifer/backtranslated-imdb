Awful film, ill-conceived and rude. The game of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan is so inferior to the actions of Perkins and Lee in the original version, that they must be seen to be believed. There was no reason to make this picture that only underlines how experienced and brilliant Hitchcock was, and how inimitable. In addition, the film has a creeping, all-pervading insensitivity, which is not in the first film. Hitchcock's “Psychopath” was scary and shocking, but you could really feel all the interested parties, even the miserable Normans of Bates. There were moments of pathos, irony and fairies of humor, which the remake does not have. One of the best things about Hitchcock’s film was its incredible and intuitive depth and sense of nuance, when to cut and when to show something, about whether to use a close-up or a long shot, about making an actor sympathetic and when he was scared, and etc. The remake does not have any of these qualities and does not even try to find them. This is an idiotic exercise, which I am amazed at, even when he was released.
