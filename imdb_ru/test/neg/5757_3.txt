Director and FX man John Karl Büchler should not do much to scare me; only his name in the credits is enough to instill fear in my heart. <br /> <br /> His dismal direct video signal from the 80s was on the bottom shelf of the horror section in my local box office. score; twenty years later, and his DVDs occupy the same place. It seems that the more they change, the more they remain unchanged. You can rely on the old JCB, which will serve everything, regardless of the format and regardless of advances in film production technology. <br /> <br /> In this despicable sentence, a group of friends goes to a distant city, where they discover the secret treasure of Jeremiah Stone, AKA, the forty-ninth, evil, leaping from the claims, cannibal miner, who caused chaos in the mid 1800s. Before his death, Jeremiah cursed anyone who had to find his gold, and soon after that, the killer who owned the pickaxe returned, beating off the unfortunate treasure hunters. <br /> <br /> With his terrible scenario, impressive effects up and the villain in the style of Scooby-Doo, "The Curse of the Forty-Nine" - what you need for Bühler. Only persistent fans of the genre Keren Black, Richard Lynch and John Philip Low give this film some kind of confidence, as the rest of the cast gives performances ranging from bad to terrible (although I will forgive Alexander Ford, who is a complete beauty). /> <br /> Even horrible sloka-horror fans will be disappointed, as most women wear clothes, and many deaths occur behind the scenes (which is probably not so bad since the deaths appeared on the screen) . pitiful). <br /> <br /> The Curse of the Forty-Nines is another one of John Carl’s long list of failures.
