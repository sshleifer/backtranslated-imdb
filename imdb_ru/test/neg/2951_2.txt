We were waiting for our turn to watch “Good Girl”, a great movie with Jennifer Aniston in the lead role, when some lady came up with this cheap parody twenty-dollar bill with the advertisement “MANNA FROM HEAVEN”. "Come see this movie!" she said. “You'll like it!” <br /> <br /> Then she introduced us to the director of the film. Now, this should have been our first clue. I mean, in how many cinematographic situations do you have a film director in your lobby asking people to watch it? "Is this a Christian film?" I asked, not really caring anyway. I love Jesus. There is nothing shameful about it. “No!” She said defensively. What a bunch of crap. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad. So bad. And this is not only because of the obvious Christian agenda, but also because of the terrible dialogue, the action that alternates between the wooden and overly exaggerated, and the apparent absence of the editor. The film is too long. If an hour and a half had passed, then perhaps (just maybe) I would not have had to attend a suicide prevention center after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Actually, I'm lying. You see, after an hour of this garbage, we snuck into SWIMFAN. At least thanks to SWIMFAN, we know that this is rubbish before we go to watch a movie. We know to prepare. And SWIMFAN has hot half-naked people. The only thing half naked in this film is the despair of the stars involved, whose apparent lack of script proposals is not at all hidden. And the actress who played the nuns? This is called personality. Get one. <br /> <br /> People shamelessly asking for tickets in the lobby told me that if I liked MY GREAT FAT GREEK WEDDING, then I would love * (their accent, not mine) Mann from heaven. Right. More like: "If you like GLITTER, you will love the MANA FROM HEAVEN." And Mariah can truly surpass any of the clowns from this film. If this is not an insult, then I do not know what it is. <br /> <br /> I collapsed enough. Go see indie movies, but don’t look bad. This is definitely one of the bad. MANNA FROM HEAVEN needs some divine intervention.
