Think of the hero of the action movie "I Know Everything" lights a cigarette in the dark. While trying to hide / look for bad guys. (Probably to give a signal to say that I am coming here) <br /> <br /> This is one of 100 scenes that you can laugh at. (I think the film should be in the comedy category.) <br /> <br /> Horrible direction, terrible script, bad game, cheap special effects. (They used the tunnel to hide there, playing in the dark). <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (it also makes me laugh, looking at these pitiful mistakes)
