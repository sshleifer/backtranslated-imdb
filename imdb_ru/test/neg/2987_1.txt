I do not know how it is rated as high as it is (5.8 at the time of writing), but this film was absolutely terrible. The game was not entirely bad, but in fact it made no sense, and the overall quality was poor. This is obviously a B film (or C, if such a thing exists), and it looks like it was made over the weekend at a friendâ€™s house or something. I'm all for low-budget films, and I usually watch everything I come across, but this one is really very bad. I mean, "The Fanglys" is bad. I don't know what else to say, but I believe in it, because I really sat in this terrible horrible film, and I can save you from the effort ... No worries. Seriously ... Just don't.
