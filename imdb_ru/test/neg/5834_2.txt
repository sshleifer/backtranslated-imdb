This is a space film, or at least I think so. you have half-naked female prisoners in a space prison and a monster on a space station using a virus to infect humanity through sexual contact. It's damn funny. The acting is so bad that the space nuts look like an Emmy Award-winning film. The story is simple. A space prisoner gets a chance to reduce punishment by exploring a space station that has lost contact with humanity. She finds a doctor "experimenting" with women and angry at the alien. She fights with them, and so on and so forth. This is a movie that is worth watching just to get your pants wet with laughter. If you like real science fiction movies, this is no, no, but this is a great mood for a movie buff, because I can guarantee that their movie is better than that.
