People call 976 the “party line” to talk dirty with strangers and may be due to sexual relationships. A crazy, somewhat incestuous sister and a casual transvestite brother use the line to find people to kill, usually married men, but they make no difference! A pair of sixteen-year-old girls also phone for entertainment, pretending that she is older. One of them works as a nanny for a married man who loves her (or anyone else). <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the killer borrowed the vice-police officer when he first discovered one of the victims of brothers and sisters. He teamed up with an assistant district attorney. <br /> <br /> There is nothing special here. Richard Roundtree has a little more than a cameo as a police chief. One of the dirty-talking sixteen-year-olds is played by an actress who also voiced the character Peanuts Peppermint Patty! According to IMDb, another died quite young, just a few years after this film: sad.
