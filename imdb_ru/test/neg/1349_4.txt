I have never seen the original film that others have commented on, so my point of view is just a film without comparison. <br /> <br /> I found that the idea of ​​the film is this: if you only care about yourself, everything will be fine with the world, everything will fall into place, your lovers will love you more, your friends will respect and love you more , your employers will want you more, pay you more, and even your own children and parents will love you more. <br /> <br /> I find this message reprehensible and completely false. <br /> <br /> Glory for a very funny birth scene at the end; there is no mother who will not laugh during this scene. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very disappointing. In this film, I did not support anyone. I thought they were all pathetic personalities who were immersed in themselves, and I didn’t care what happened to them and people didn’t want to watch this movie.
