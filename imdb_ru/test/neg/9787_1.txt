I am shocked to see that so many people have given positive feedback about this “film”. This film has no redemptive factors. The music is not very good, the acting is pathetic, I find it difficult to understand how someone can enjoy this film, not to mention the singing of his "praises." The idea is terrible, some scenes related to the plot (for example, a story about the continuation of love, even if the male romantic interest is a SERIOUS HEAD) are so terrible that I wanted to injure myself by watching them. The fact that there is a scene in which a shriveled head flies under the girl’s shirt so that he can “feel it” and she likes it is a reason enough for everyone associated with this film to die. The reference to "West Side Story" can only be a mockery, since referring to such a wonderful film in such a terrible form is only the basis for the destruction of all copies of this film. In short, this film is terrible in all respects. And if I had my own way, everyone who loves it should go straight to hell ....
