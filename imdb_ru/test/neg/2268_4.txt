Shvaas may have a good story, but the director is completely devoid of talent. He does not know when to stop. When a story encourages people to act in confusion, there are ten minute scenes in which people imitate the action of confusion. When the story requires a little background, there are ten minutes of Concan green scenes. When a story calls a child to throw tantrums ... you understand. <br /> <br /> Not to mention extreme close-ups so you can count the nose hair of people. There are films that need to be watched on the big screen, this film should look on a 13 "TV. Also Amrut Subhash, who plays Asavari, is the worst actress I've seen in a long time. A normal person needs to practice for many years to achieve that it makes it so easy. <br /> <br /> I give it 4/10 solely because the subject is different and the story is not bad. The fact that the film, like Shwaas, The fact that India entered the Oscar, says not much about the state of Indian cinema, but about the state of the Indian judicial committees. not good just because it a piece of art.
