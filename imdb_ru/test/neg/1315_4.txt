Production values ​​for this film do not match the status of a Hollywood blockbuster, and the script does not match the cult status. What remains is a weary, formal attempt at the catastrophe movie genre, which will disappear with ebb. <br /> <br /> A decent cast, or cast, or he doesn't care. Beautiful Joanne Wally cannot do this. Bring any seriousness to the role of Police Commissioner Nash, who wears the most annoying clincher at the waist over his skirt. <br /> <br /> Jessalyn Gilseg plays heavyweight champion as the director of the Thames barrier with the conviction that sweets are a toothpick on the fairground. Her Canadian citizenship and emphasis seems to have been developed to appeal to the transatlantic audience. That, and she fails. Her initial appearance in a tight-fitting pink tracksuit when she comes to work is risky. <br /> <br /> In “The Old Siren Scum, which was right,” Tom Courtney plays as if he were acting in a dream, and various plot twists, designed to arouse his son performed by Robert Carlyle, are struggling to get him any answer. <br /> <br /> Nigel Planer seems determined to perform the ritual of Hari Kari for his shortcomings as director of the Meteorological Service, or for his actions, or both, and only David Suchet appears with some reputation as deputy prime minister. . <br /> <br /> The story was enough, and the cast and effects to produce worthy effort. Alas, this did not happen.
