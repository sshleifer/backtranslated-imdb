An excellent example of a disaster that happens when you combine a complex scenario with two actors chosen for physical attractiveness. I seldom realize the action during the first viewing of the film, because I try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing. In the case of Full Ride, the acting was so weak that the film could not be regarded as a story; I was too busy (during the first and only viewing), alternating laughter and nausea. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for most individual cast members, almost everyone in the ensemble is weak, individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent act. Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are at least physically well chosen, finding a common language in that they look too old for the likely age of their characters. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the script requires particularly intense and persuasive actions to portray its characters, only exposes the overwhelming lack of talent of Smith and Monroe. On the other hand, they know enough not to look directly into the camera, and they do not stutter. <br /> <br /> It would be better to use a less attractive pair that could physically pass at the appropriate age. The main story is not particularly original, it is just another version of “Officer and Gentleman”, but it could serve as a good showcase for a talented couple of “teenage actors”. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
