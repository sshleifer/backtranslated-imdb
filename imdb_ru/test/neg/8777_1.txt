I think it was not completely the director's fault though. The film suffered from an unimaginably stupid decision to tell Clayton Moore (who played a role in the 1950s and was the Lone Ranger with whom we grew up old people), he could not wear a mask in public. Now, notice that the poor fellow did not earn that much money on it, and was not going to take something from this film, but it all seemed ... useless. <br /> <Another thing that hurt the film (except for the lead man, whose voice was so terrible that they had to re-record it) was the fact that in 1981 westerns werenâ€™t so fashionable. John Wayne was dead, and we were just subjected to a ten-year journey of liberal guilt about how the West was built on the genocide of Native Americans. (This and Blazing Saddles sent the whole genre! Scene by the campfire. Enough said!) Hollywood avoided westerns, because then science fiction was great. <br /> <br /> The only scene that emphasized this was after the rescue. drunk President Grant (and, seriously, I would let Grant stay with the bad guys. The country would be better!) Grant asks Tonto what his reward is: "Read your treaties with my people." Yes, that's right, how IT should have happened!
