The film is a gross distortion of the Orthodox way of life and practice. NEVER will a Jewish court impose a divorce between childless couples. Although the concept exists in Jewish law, there are too many conditions for it to ever occur. It is really difficult for the childless couples to cope with their childlessness in a society where children are a very important part of life, but nowhere does their community “reject” them, as shown in the film. They are treated with extreme sensitivity. In fact, many great rabbis have lived their whole lives without children and never considered divorce. <br /> <br /> The image of Yosef, a terrible person, is intended to - perhaps subconsciously - show the behavior of a typical Orthodox person’s man. In reality, it is as typical as a violent rapist drunkard typical of secular society. Both exist in their own worlds, and both are despicable. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that so many people form their opinions about society on the basis of MOVIE (someone who personally biases about the community). I have always thought that only Orthodox Christians, because of their limited and closed lifestyle, judge all secular people on the basis of violence and immoral behavior, which they read about in newspapers or they see in films.
