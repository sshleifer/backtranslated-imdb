I was pleasantly surprised by this. It is actually quite interesting and attractive. The cast is strong, even Dan Cortese. Brooke Shields recovered as an actress. Black and white must have really released her, because I never saw her in this big team playing a regular character. If sold correctly, it can be a medium sized hit.
