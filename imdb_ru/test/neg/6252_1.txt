Good. I admit it. I'm a big fan of bi-movies. Back when Michelle Bauer, Linnie Quigley and Brinke Stevens ruled the chicken coop. And then even bad movies were still good. Unfortunately, this is a bad film, just a bad one. Even a small cameo to Brinke Stevens (repeating her role as Linda in The Slaughter of Loafers) 21 years ago does not help this A group of fans hiding in a fancy cabin after their van breaks. The psyche pursues them one by one, catching them in various states of undressing. Bad script, bad direction and terrible game make it just bad! Skip this turkey and rent a “Slumber party”. 1/2 *
