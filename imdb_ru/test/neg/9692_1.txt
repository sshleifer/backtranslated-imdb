I could not believe what I saw ... (once) brilliant actors, appearing in this terrible effort that should never have been made. The plots are terrible, the dialogues applaud (at first I thought it was fake), and the acting was terrible. Everything in it is bad, from cheap sets to fake backgrounds, an enlarged pile of pictures. Respectable filmmakers are struggling to realize their vision, but this blasphemous, pitiful attempt at a mini-series does it for our television when 3 Oscar winners appear. I can only guess that everyone who participated in this somehow wounded the writer and director and was forced (perhaps at gunpoint) to act in this useless TV.
