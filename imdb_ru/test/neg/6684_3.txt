First: the recent campaign of this film - a huge deception. Judging by the cover, you might think that it was some scandalous film about how Kylie plays a character who has sex, takes drugs and all that. This is just a cheap market scheme. She barely does nothing. Marketing here is incredible, and I am surprised that the filmmakers did not mind. <br /> <br /> The film itself was a huge disappointment to me. It looked like an episode on Sunset Beach, filmed by a sloppy teenager Quentin Tarantino. And this is not a compliment, mind you. <br /> <br /> I think that the weakness of the film is, first of all, history. It seems to be about anything. Just about cool teenagers stumbling over life "on the edge." The characters themselves do have some personality, but the film does not use its potential. As already mentioned, there is no story about any substance. It seems that he describes the cool dialogue in too much detail and as a result looks like a colorful ad for MTV. It definitely has that feeling. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I suppose that some might like it, but I would say that such films are much better.
