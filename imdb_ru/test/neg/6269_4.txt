It is incredible that in 2005 two films with the same story were released. This came out the day before with Tom Cruise. Did they not do this with Truman Capote in the same year and the killer of the Zodiac last year? Interesting. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter / Director David Michael Latt didnâ€™t have the budget of Steven Spielberg, and C. Thomas Howell is not Tom Cruise. This is a pale imitation of a blockbuster who has collected 588 million dollars worldwide. <br /> <br /> The action was minimal, and most of the time we dealt with the nagging of Rett Giles, who played the pastor, who disappointed his god. <br /> <br /> Gary Buzie was creepy like Army LT.
