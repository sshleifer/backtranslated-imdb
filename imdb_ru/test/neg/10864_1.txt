This is easily one of the worst films I've seen in a long time (and I recently saw Starship Troopers 2 !!!). I could not find anything to buy this film. The acting, which is probably the best aspect of the film, is fair at best. Michael Madsen emphasizes this in his standard personality. Denis Hopper does not seem to know who he should be. Vinnie Jones's accent is quaint. The good news is that Leonor Valera looks fantastic. Her game is pretty bad, but I doubt that is why she is there. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is really terrible. It's just rubbish. I don't know who subscribed to this, but they really need to get professional help next time. <br /> <br /> This film is the reason why the IMDB rating system must include zero stars out of ten. Avoid at all costs.
