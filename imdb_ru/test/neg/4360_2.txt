It does not say much. This film Killjoy has the best cinematography and looks more professional than the previous one. This does not mean that it is more professional sound. This terrible last film was about how gangsters kill a child, and then he is pursued by a voodoo clown. I thought the guy who played Killjoy at last was a bad actor, but wow! This Killjoy is, to be honest, the worst actor I've ever seen in any movie, and I've seen a lot of movies. In the last movie, the clown appeared after about 15 minutes, this one is shorter, and the clown did not even appear until after 40 minutes, and its duration is only 65 minutes !!! I give him 2, because the game of some characters is fine.
