Martin Lawrence can be considered a talented person, but those times are long gone. Runteldat shows a person who immediately tries to play a card of sympathy for his position, but takes responsibility for it whenever he thinks it will benefit his ego. The sad truth is that at this stage his best days were behind: his semi-ridiculous show was dead in the water after his colleague left, and to this day he will have a career in sounding and terrible fighters. . <br /> <br /> It seems that this concert film was not created in order to give Lawrence another career momentum after his humiliation, but rather for a child’s attempt to clear the air, while at the same time trying to save what was left of his of life. and somehow turn it into something to be proud of, at some crucial moment when he showed that he had “earned” his fame. Unfortunately, the concert is nothing but Martin with a coarse voice, incoherently trying to be funny, to cause pathos, and then to assert that he doesn’t care because he is hardcore. The sad truth is that this is a real public embarrassment for Lawrence: the way he mumbles, causing a sad laugh of pity, makes you want him to just strip down to his underwear on stage, swing his gun and just repeat it again, There is no real understanding his work in general. As in the children's title, Martin tries to make his last moment of truth his own and failed. He would have better wait for E! A true Hollywood story instead of running onto the stage and making you look like an idiot a second time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the saddest thing about this concert film - more precisely, a career speech - this is what Martin doesn’t think about it. What was to prove this film? Unfortunately, his fame was fleeting, he had a flash in the pan before the underwear incident, and now that the only way to get a job is to combine the work of Will Smith or the production of Pixar. With the same success, they could call this concert “The Tombstone” because it is so. Martin Lawrence just dies here on stage, and this is what happens that could be an interesting career. Now? Just a pathetic note in the story.
