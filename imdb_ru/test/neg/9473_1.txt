I saw Roger Moore singing it on scenes that required running or exercise. He was James Bond, who would be more comfortable sitting in a bar, telling stories with his fellow British knights. Nothing is against older people in age-appropriate roles, but how realistic is it for a 58-year-old boy who is fragile to fight on the wings of airplanes, hang from the side of a train, swim in a swamp with crocodiles, etc. In addition to the fact that OCTOPUSSY was incredibly stupid, stupid and idiotic, the fact that the frail old man was involved in many death-defying stunts made it much easier to laugh at James Bond. By 1983, Roger Moore had clearly looked at his age, and he had long passed the time when he looked as if he could fight young men. I saw this film in the Theater, and the screams of laughter were many and very often. Any authority that was built by James Bond, disappeared after OSTOPUSSII. <br /> <br /> The only thing missing in the “Octopussia” was Benny Hill and his auxiliary staff. Another disadvantage was that the incredibly lame Louis Jordan was one half of the Axis of Evil. Jordan helped make the whole concept even more funny. And the Russian general was a total sucker. "OCTOPUSSY" works better as a parody of comedy, similar to "SPIES LIKE US". <br /> <br /> Even the fight scene on the train was just a bad copy of the same train scenes that were shot in many other films by the best actors. Take the EMPEROR of the NORTH (1972), where Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine fought all along the top and bottom of the train and made him look exciting and real. <br /> <br /> Roger Moore had a thin, frail body in 1983. and yet his understudy was obviously younger, taller, sportier and more muscular. Even the hair color did not match. This only made his fighting scenes more comedic. Moore's tricks looked like those old low-budget films Chop-Sookie Kung-Fu, especially with poor installation. The director seemed to be trying to improve the bad game and the bad stunts by giving several views of the same trick. This only emphasized the difference between Moore and his understudy. The fact that the scenes of the train with Moore were shot in the studio could be seen from the lighting when Moore was in the frame, compared to the external shots of the backup in the real train. Although many of the Bond films must be inferior when it comes to editing their cascading fights. Usually you can clearly see that the actor Bond is not really fighting. Overall, OCTOPUSSY should be considered as one of the worst films ever made, and certainly the worst of the worst Bond films.
