Almost ashamed to say that I even saw this movie. I mean, to create a good zombie film you don't need a lot, except for good special effects, a lot of blood and blood, some scary moments and a decent plot. House of the Dead 2 does any of this right? No, not one. Of course, he is not as bad as his predecessor, from Uwe Bowl, and this is the only thing that scares me in this film. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this film is notorious, with lines like "What do you do for a living?" in response, "I kill zombies" and "I have never been a DJ, I was a soldier." The special effects are confusing even for a TV movie created, I mean seriously, all zombies look like they have bloody lips. In this movie, the armyâ€™s base is a garage, with a table and an open, locked room. could undress in the locker rooms. In fact, it seems that this whole film was shot in high school. <br / > <br /> Also, why are all female soldiers in this film models? And for that matter, why everyone in this film is so ignorant of what is happening, that they just stand, allowing zombies to kill them. Damn it, one guy even tries to give zombie food. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie makes even the worst Scifi Channel movies look fantastic.
