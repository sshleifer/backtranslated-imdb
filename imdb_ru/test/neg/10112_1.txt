Hi guys and girls! Never give up, or, God forbid, buy this piece of garbage. I have rarely seen a film in a genre like this. Acting is actually worse than my friends and I did when we were 7 years old, and in grade 1 I had to speak in front of all my parents and brothers and sisters. In fact, we would be rated at Oscar if we were compared with the actors in “Theme Hunters”. A terrible story, terrible makeup, terrible filming, terrible set, terrible direction, etc. I can't find ANYTHING that was worth the money to watch this movie ... Maybe, apart from all the cats that my girlfriend thought were pretty . Please use your money for other things than this film .... I could not even see the last 15-20 minutes of the film, it was so terrible .. If anyone really liked this film, I would really like to hear from you, and I will try to find out if I can give you any advice in a psychiatrist's office next to you. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10 is actually lower if possible. Not worth the DVD or tape it is on ..
