This is by far the most pathetic film of Indian cinema or any other cinema that he invented. This is just a piece of shit. Some storylines do not hold water. It is a shame that such a respectful actor has dropped to such an extent that he is acting in such a shameful film. his little respect is lost forever. he should have resigned a long time ago, instead of fooling himself and losing all self-respect. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Moreover, I would suggest that Amitabh is already gone. I wonder how IMDb gave some recommendations for this film. There are no such horrible films that could give any recommendations. watching movies like Devdas along with this movie makes a serious injustice to a decent movie. In general, I would say shameless.
