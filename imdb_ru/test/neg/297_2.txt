I looked the first 15 minutes and I can say that there was no consultation with the military. The head of Judith Light (officer) has hair below the shoulders! One of the first officers to meet her when she enters the medical facility where she works is so overweight that there is a gap in his trouser pockets! No - there were no military advisers on this film. Even a former soldier enlisted in the army could help here.
