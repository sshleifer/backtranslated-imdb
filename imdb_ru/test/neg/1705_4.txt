Except for the appearance of the talented Austin Powers imitator Richard Halpern, this photo was your movie with cartoons. Dated references to movies will not help an audience that might face this undertaking in the future. Follow the Groovy Austin Powers in the whirlpool. This is a half cry. <br /> <br /> Bad special effects are overcome by the appearance of numerous stars in scanty outfits, so at least it should entertain one (if that's what you care about). <br /> <br /> For my money, I would rent a DVD with classic parodies, such as “Airplane” or “Lobster Man from Mars”.
