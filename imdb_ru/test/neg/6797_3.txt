It was a terrible show. In short, it was about this child named Doug, who often felt guilty. Seriously, he could feel guilty for having killed a fly, and then for feeling guilty for having killed a fly and so on. The animation was unpleasant and unpleasant, and the jokes were cheap. <br /> <br /> He showed up here in Sweden as part of the "Disney time" show, and I remember that I liked it, but then I turned 13. <br /> <br /> I never understood why the characters were green and purple too. What happened to this? <br /> <br /> A really awful show. Apparently, this gave rise to a film that I have never seen, but I also have no high expectations.
