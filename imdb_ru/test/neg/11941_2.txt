Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart starred in a "romantic" drama about an excited chef played by Zeta-Jones, who eventually carries her niece when her sister dies in a car accident. While she is engaged in family affairs, it replaces Eckhart. <br /> <br /> A funny tale about knick-knacks, no chemistry between the leads (she’s a dead fish, and he’s fine, but nothing special). Watching this, I wondered why anyone would want to see it, since the character of Zeta-Jones is so unpleasant. Come on, she is so obsessed with cooking and, being the best, everything she does is cooking for her therapist or talking about food. Ugh. I will not use any of the many puns that come to mind. I could not finish it.
