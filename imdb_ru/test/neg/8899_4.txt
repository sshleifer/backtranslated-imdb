Another film from the Swedish country country, which is always the northern part. If such people were shown black, then there would be cries for racism and for good reason. <br /> <br /> This is a farce, and you should laugh at the smart cliche of the farce. But this is mostly tedious. Gangster comedy, with bad Russians (as always) and bad (and stupid) Finns. And the most stupid of all, of course, is the Norwegian, according to the prejudices of Stockholm. <br /> <br /> Andreas Wilson is the only one who tries to make a presentation that reminds us of reality. It's not funny. It is not even interesting. The burlesque is too rough to interest you.
