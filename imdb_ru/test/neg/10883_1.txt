Seriously, guys ... I was preparing to write the Razzie Council and recommend this film as the Razzie Champ for 2007 ... until I got to IMDb.com and did not understand that its copyright date is 2006, not 2007. this film could easily become the champion of razzy. This movie sucks! How in the world this piece of shit was overlooked even for Razzie’s nomination in 2006 is not clear to me, because he could easily compete with “Basically, it stinks, too” for the 2006 Razzie championship. <br /> <br /> I rented this film on the recommendation of my neighbor, who told me: "Oh God, after watching this movie, it will take a long time before I stop to rest again!" I could not believe how scary and this film was terrible! The following are possible spoilers, but you won't miss a thing. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all ... the problem ... the rest will stop by itself. Obviously, the director of this shit knows nothing about women. The toilets in this rest stop were on the same level as in the Trainspotting movie. I do not pretend that I know everything I need to know about women, but I know one thing, that women, for the most part, are full and complete hygiene / neat freaks. Given the choice between taking shit to one of these toilets and possibly catching something or squatting in the woods, the woman will choose a squat in the woods. I know, because I went hiking with them before, and they are squatting in the woods without any problems. So right here ... a big hole in the plot is not true. <br /> <br /> Secondly ... she comes out of the rest stop, and her boyfriend who was driving the car is nowhere to be found, neither he nor his car. He just left. She starts shouting his name, wondering where he is. Mmmm ... hello? Are you standing on wet mud ... did it ever occur to you to look for tire tracks? I mean, his car was gone ... she didn't just get up and flew away. And in fact, it makes me think ... I actually looked at her legs, and there was no trace of tread in the dirt. How ... exactly ... did it happen? <br /> <br /> Thirdly ... The Bible with a roar moves the family out of the house on wheels with a strange dwarf in the back, taking a picture of a Polaroid ...? They had absolutely no sense whatsoever, and it was as if the director simply threw them in order to be strange in order to be strange. They had no meaning at all and had no place even in the film. <br /> <br /> Fourth ... oh my god, this is ... I mean, finally ... closer to the end of the film. ... she finally sees the escape hatch on the ceiling inside the rest of the stop. I'm like, "You are ... stupid ... bi ** am. Have you been locked in this rest stop all this time ... and you just ... now ... see ... the escape hatch on the ceiling? I mean ... it’s as if they threw it only because the killer threw gasoline on the floor through the window and was going to light a match.Therefore, she needed to rise to a higher level to avoid burns, and ... oh, look! A great reason for her to rise to a higher level! A rescue hatch on the ceiling! It's like ... Why didn't she go through this before? Most people in this situation and you’d see it from the moment they were locked in this rest stop and pulled the damn thing out of Dodge. When they showed this escape hatch at the end of the movie, I said: “You must be joking.” <br /> <br /> Fifth ... what was the deal with all the people she faced? Continue to just disappear? The girl in the closet in the closet will stop? Dumb cop?? Is she at the end of the movie when she herself was in the broom closet? This has never been explained. Personally, when they did this, I thought to myself, “Oh, Christ on the burglar, this is her. She is a murderer. Wonderful. She killed all these people, I don’t remember how I did it, and the writers of this film just blew off some French horror film, which I can't mention on IMDb.com, or I’ll be blacklisted for playing the final (this film, By the way, also sucked people). "But this is not the case. She was not a murderer, and the whole deal with the disappearance of dead people was never explained. Oh, for God's sake, people, stay away from this film! This film sucked the eggs, and now I have a serious bone, which I can choose with my neighbor. He stands at the front 2 for 1 dollar on Family Video, don't even take it off if someone gives it to you for free!
