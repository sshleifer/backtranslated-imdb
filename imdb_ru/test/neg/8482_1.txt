Well, about 11 years ago, an amazing, funny movie “The Mask” came out, and everyone liked it, and now, 11 years later, the mask is back in this amazing movie, right? WRONG!!!!!!!!!! this movie was the stupidest movie i have ever seen !! I mean, when I rented it, I thought I would laugh so much that I almost pee my pants, like the first time. but after I saw this "sequel", I even gave a barley laugh. I mean not to hurt the director or actors of this film, but that a waste of time and money. So, the plot of the whole story was about this little child, in which there is a part of the mask, and this evil person is following something, because that's all I really got, I would at least add something else to it. so it will be higher than 2 out of 10 stars.
