This movie was just awful. How someone might like this film, and for those who liked it because of jokes, they really should carefully look in the mirror and ask themselves if the stereotypes are not bad. Ignoring the face of racial stereotypes, it was just awful. He never had his moments, if he paid tribute to the 1980s, “Airplane!” He needs to pay some more. Awful game, horrible script writing, even for a movie with Mo'Nick or Tom Arnold. This film was bad from the start, but people could see it all, thinking that the plane would crash. One of the worst films ever, stay away.
