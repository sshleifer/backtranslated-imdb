From time to time I come across such a terribly bad movie that I wonder why films exist. This is one of them. This is a terrible attempt to parody the Godfather with annoying cartoon sounds and bad dialogue. Eddie Disen is just annoying because Tony, an annoying jerk who, at the request of his father Don (William Hickey), takes over the family business. Tony, as I said, is a bit annoying. This makes the whole movie a mess. The movie is terribly insane. This is too cartoonish. The main thing I'm trying to do is that you cannot make a parody of a famous drama, such as The Godfather, with so much caricature. It does not work that way. Believe it or not, you should take the parody of a dramatic film seriously. If you do not take it seriously, it will be too much like a parody. The meaning of parody is that you can't seem too parody. You have to create the impression that you take the film at least a little seriously. It also seems that they are just mocking Woody Allen, and that makes this movie absolutely awful.
