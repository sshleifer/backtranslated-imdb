“Tenchi Muyo In Love 2” is the third film of Tenchi. It seemed that its creators took elements from the first two to make this one. With the risk of giving out spoilers, Tenchi is abducted, and the team must return it. There is nothing new there. Yosho's past love is a bad guy. This was done in the second film. The battle between Aeka and Ryouko begins to get bored. The movie has almost no action movie scenes and very little comedy. Personally, I do not know what the AIC, its manufacturers, thought. I gave this movie a voice 4.
