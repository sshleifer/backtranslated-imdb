I am pretty much a loser for those ghost hunter shows. From cheese dummies, such as Discovery Channel’s Ghosts, to Scooby Doo. Reality show - “Ghostbusters”. When I saw the promo for A & E "Paranormal State", I realized that I would watch. Especially when the “Paranormal State” was imposed on a weak soccer game on Monday evening. <br /> <br /> By the end of the pilot of the “Paranormal State”, when the main “character” in this eerie dance of reality gives the eerie child a bottle of holy water by Max von Sydow and assures him, telling this boy that he, too, had unspecified bad childhood experience with things that “came out of the closet,” and the (catholic) church gave him holy water to reflect things out of the closet. I knew that I had to take another chance at night football on Monday. <br /> <br /> In Paranormal, a group of students from the state of Pennsylvania who got together and started their own. Ghost hunting club. Or society. Or Super Adventure Club. And they run around Pennsylvania, looking for the most terrible ghosts and the lost plot for the movie M. Night Shimalan. <br /> <br /> “They” is a kind of wrong name. A truly paranormal state revolves around a Nittany lion named Ryan Buell, who will probably run the annual Anime Convention of the State of Pennsylvania if it were not for the show. He is often accompanied in the "investigations" by hot staff and some other people who can be seen in the credits, but rarely filmed. Hey, are they ghosts too? <br /> <br /> This is Ryan Buell’s show. The paranormal state is his “conductor,” as we would like to say in Business. And, oh, what a dismal ride on a vehicle that he can be. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that Ryan tells the entire episode of "Paranormal State" in the silent voice of the director? Almost immediately it is annoying, because the obvious intention is to give the ghostly Ryan a hunt for some seriousness, but his filtered monoton only causes grumbling and laughter. Seriously, every serious intonation sounds like the radio chatter from the video game Call of Duty. <br /> <br /> “Investigations” - the plot around which each episode revolves - is interesting on the surface. There are no haunted hotels or restaurants in the Paranormal State. This show is about how to be afraid of the unknown, how good a Catholic, and damn it, they give you things for fear. <br /> <br /> Small children are harassed, things loom in the dark, voices encourage the living to kill, and Aleister Crowley rubs his hands in me. Of the two episodes that I observed, each of them revolved around violent, disgusting persecution involving violent, heinous deaths. <br /> <br /> possible. <br /> <br /> Perhaps not. <br /> <br /> Everything in “Paranormal” is reduced to half an hour, it is blocked by “Psa Bounty - er, Ghostbusters”. Every time there is an interesting, verifiable piece of evidence - killing a family on a farm in the 1800s - evidence is waved in front of the audience like a crook trying to convince you in a bundle of papers that are currently under your leadership. The nose is proof that ten million came from Nigeria, and then pulled out before you can find a good gander. <br /> <br /> At least with the Ghostbusters on the Science Fiction Channel, there is a somewhat excessive need to pull out all possible evidence and present it to the viewer. EVPs that can be farting rats, cold stains in the damn house, and "balls" that even ghostbusters ignore like dust. This is a kind of Scooby-Doo approach that makes Ghostbusters ... almost believable. <br /> <br /> Taking into account that the “Paranormal State” claims to have EVP, but gives the viewer a 10-second video clip of a wave in the Garage Band without sound. Yes, see, EVP, right? People claim to have seen dark figures in the basement ... Well, we just go and look at it ... leaving the night-vision camera in a breathtaking, still image of the living room. Ryan, the fearless leader of this group of Penn graduates, claims to have seen “visions” of the name of a demon he knows who could be involved in paranormal persecution ... But he cannot tell us whether the audience or his team has gotten out of undergraduate because ... he can't. You never say the name of the demon out loud, Ryan tells Co-Ed, who dares to ask, his wide-open eye. <br /> <br /> Well, how very very convenient for you. Especially since this is a television show where viewers cannot read your thoughts. <br /> <br /> “Paranormal state” is all a turn, not prestige. The audience is told what might be happening, but you will never see a bit of evidence that a creepy child sees dead people. Not even a grainy video with chair movement or a black spot between prison cells. Nothing. You just talked about what happened to Ryan, another mechanical voice. <br /> <br /> If you're going to try to scare me, put it on a bit. If you are trying to bow me down, show me a ball or a ball, and let the fat chick, who works in the Hot Topic for a few days, tell me why this black ball is really an ax killer spirit. And if you want me to watch a ghost hunt show, give me something besides chatting with Lorraine Warren in the second episode. <br /> <br /> “Paranormal condition” is a weak sauce. In fact, you should not watch if you do not have enough time to watch TV, or if you have a thin DVD collection. Or if you do not want to know what really happened in this cupboard with holy water.
