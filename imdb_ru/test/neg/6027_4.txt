In fact, I really liked parts of it. It had some interesting twists. But it just left me there, I saw that feeling after all the SAW films. Of course, the finale was different from the typical Peel, but let's face it ... a group of unknowns to each other (or they think so) thrown together in an abandoned chemical plant .... <br /> <br /> But then something loses. No intensity, bad group dynamics, no sense of urgency. <br /> <br /> At the end there are some nice turns, and it is definitely worth seeing if there is nothing else on your plate, but that just left me empty. ... time passed, but it did not satisfy.
