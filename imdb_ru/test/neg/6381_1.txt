For some reason, I just did not like it, and I was embarrassed about how bad it had been since I bought it and watched it with my family. We all hated it with passion. This is a good enough children's film, perhaps in the year when it came out. But think about it: an outdated children's film? What's the point? Children, as a rule, do not like to watch such old films at all, and I don’t understand that adults should choose from this film. <br /> <br /> Some children's movies (like Mary Poppins or The Wizard of Oz) can be enjoyed even now, but Time Bandits are completely outdated. For reference, and I think that this is applicable in this case, I also didn’t like Dr. Strangelove or the spinal cord at all. So, if you do not agree with me in the same outdated films, you might like Time Bandits. <br /> <br /> There is also a terrible case of replaying, as I recall from the “bad guys.” Think of the two stupid "bad pirates" in the "Pirates of C" movies, except that in The Bandits of Time they are not even funny. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I warned you, that's all I can do. People who appreciate this film surely enjoyed it many years ago. If you have not seen it before, do not worry about seeing it now.
