There is nothing in it that the viewer could point out and call "good." The game was boring and soothing. Scenes and cinematography look like they were designed by someone who grew up with Starbucks and tried to make the perfect Gap commercial. Characters have no drive, motivation, or reason for us to take care of them. There is so little interest and tension that it is difficult to follow banal actions and dialogue. And the plot ... if anyone finds it, I'm sure it will be as boring as the rest. <br /> <br /> This is not funny, not romantic, does not affect the person's condition. If you need a good comedy about a stoner, watch Half-Baked; if you want good fossil drama, see Trainspotting. The only reason I gave these 2 stars instead of one is that it is fun to see some familiar faces in the mid-90s. This is a small reason to give the film at least one star, but, again, this is a small film.
