Eaten Alive follows a young woman (Janet Agren) who is looking for her lost sister. It turns out that her sister joined a sect that disappeared into the jungle of Borneo. With Vietnamese veteran Mark beside her, she goes in search of her sister. <br /> <br /> As usual, the acting is not of the highest quality, but you get the poster from the film cannibals Me Me Lai, most of the time is on the screen with a bare chest, the leading woman Janet Agren covered in gold paint and offended soaked in snake blood, among other things. Now it means something! <br /> <br /> But I have to say that it’s hard for me to recommend this headline. If you are a fan of the genre, you will most likely recognize each scene of a bloody film in your favorites. And I mean it literally. Many scenes of bloodshed were filmed in other films about cannibalism, such as “The Man from the Deep River” and “The Last World of Cannibals”. There are probably more films stuck there. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is one of those who unswervingly love to check their list. If you have not seen a single jungle Italian film, you better watch CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, and if you are an avid fan, you have seen most of the bloody scenes in other films.
