This is so bad, I do not know where to start. <br /> <br /> The main role is a good starting point. This is the highest character of Mary Sue, who has little to do with the original character from the book, which was (a little) more trustworthy. No, this is unbeatable, infallible, indomitable and tasteless even beyond the limits of exaggerated standards, that this era of “chicks with swords” that our media have been posting lately. She is a twenty-year-old top model, slim as a match, but rich, already a leader in her academic field, a kung fu master, a natural sniper, and seems to have enough authority to naturally surpass any official, such as weak FBI agents. She is God. <br /> <br /> To balance this, she must be socially awkward (because of her typically abrupt upbringing, which turned her into “Spock”), which gives us a few delightful moments when she wonders what it is “ Star Wars, or “American Idol,” but nevertheless, when it’s really important, she can comfortably show herself as a lead negotiator and diplomat, because she’s so excellent, you know. To top it off, she is played by a wooden actress. <br /> <br /> A more talented Boreanaz serves as a fiery favorite for this design, acting as an awkward comic strip and Watson House. In fact, all that is is a pop parody of the best works, such as Sherlock Holmes, CSI and The X-Files, from which he tries to imitate the sexual tension between the main characters. This, however, is cheaper, since it is delivered with all the subtleties of hitting the elbow in the ribs, but the million million poor factory girls will undoubtedly buy him, hence the crazy rating that this turkey gets. <br /> <br /> In fact, the smallest common denominator is of great importance in this sad puppy, leading to exciting sexual details from the legion of homies who seek to pass it off as bold and fashionable, while the overall tone of the show carries the obvious neoconservative look at things. <br /> <br /> With regard to history, there’s really nothing to visit, since crimes (which always start with some horrible remains) are revealed with the use of non-existent technology, while "strabismus" is attractive but so wrong (women less than guys) adhere to different theories, they are all useless, because the main character has it all from the very beginning, and as soon as it turns out, she comes out and then hits the guy, usually a real cool hombra, with a spin kick here and a slap in the face there. The end.
