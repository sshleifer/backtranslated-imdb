I really don't hate Mirrormask. I just really wanted the movie more than beautiful visuals. The film begins with a young girl named Helana, who works in a circus. But while the other children (supposedly) want to run away to the circus, she wants to run away only from the circus. During heated debates with his mother, Helana wishes her to drop dead. Bad move. Mother gets sick ... with something (presumably cancer) and needs surgery. The night before the operation, she dreams that she travels to a wonderful world consisting of her dreams and nightmares, where she “finds herself”. For me personally, the film became crap as soon as she began to dream. Early scenes show the strange and wonderful world of the circus, and then contrast it with the gloom of a hospital and the mud of an apartment building. But as soon as she dreams, entire films move to the country of computer graphics, where almost everything is a computer image. The problem is that in this dream world there is nothing mysterious and surprising that he should have. while films like The Wizard of Oz seemed tempting to explore the Mirror Mask, we put images on our faces, and then select them to give us another image. There is a slight rhyme or reason for design in this film, and although some things are very nice (the librarian is a masterpiece), they just disappear so quickly that they are soon forgotten. Helana and her partner Valentina are annoying at best and unbearable at worst. In general, Mirrormask is like a cute cola, which you bite and find out that in fact it is ashes. Stick to real kids.
