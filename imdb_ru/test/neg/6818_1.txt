A totally funny movie that makes fun of the college entrance process. Although it is true that the SAT exams are not everything when assessing a student for college, what the film says is completely ridiculous and does not deserve to be repeated or viewed. <br /> <br /> Representatives of college admissions look so stupid people who have an extremely narrow view of the whole process. The film insults hardworking high school students who work long hours and then have to suffer for a long time until they receive a letter of acceptance or rejection of the schools in which they applied. <br /> <br /> This film certainly deserves rejection at all levels.
