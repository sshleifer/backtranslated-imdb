Every time I miss this show on TV, I absolutely and truly want to pull out my eyes and pull out my ears. This is incredibly awful. The jokes are not funny, the acting skills are absolutely terrible, and the whole show as a whole is one big disappointment. I hate Charlotte Arnoldâ€™s courage, and I just want to slap her face or stab her every time I hear her talk. She has no talent, a low IQ, a big waste on society, and I think she would do the world a favor if she would just shut up and go away for a long time. Please, I say this from the bottom of my heart, DO NOT EVEN SEE ONE EPISODE OF THIS SHOW !!!!!! It's not even worth 30 minutes of your life, and there are thousands of better things, including killing yourself, than watching this show for half an hour.
