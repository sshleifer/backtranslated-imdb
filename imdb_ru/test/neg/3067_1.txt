Oh, no need to say anything else. This film actually made me think about suicide. Being a big fan of the wonderful zombie movie genre, I found it to be probably the worst attempt I have ever made. The film has never shown anywhere! What was the point of all this, I feel hopeless and lost. Damn, it was so bad that I can't even justify beating it. I'll just go hang in the closet. Well, now I tried to send my comment, but the server will accept comments no longer than ten lines. So that's it ... Bad, terrible, not where there is enough blood. NO tits !!!!!! How can you get a movie about a zombie without a boob. Actually, the lead role was the damn stance, and the only reason I watched the movie to the end was to, perhaps, accidentally look at it. NO! Of course, there was one line that is worth mentioning, a line that I look forward to someday to use myself (when I just feel the need to get a slap) “This pig will not smoke itself” is so bad.
