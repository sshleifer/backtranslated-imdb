He seems to be a freak. I heard him commenting on “losing control of the show” and telling another guest who brought live animals that he had one rule - “not snakes”. He needs to hire a comedian because his jokes are not convincing. The only reason I look at him is because he has some great guests and groups. <br /> <br /> For a while I watched Craig Ferguson’s show, but his show is even worse. He loves it when the bull plays the fool to burn time. I don't think anyone has a future on late night talk shows. <br /> <br /> The Daily also has an annoying habit of sticking out his tongue to lick his lips. He must do this at least 10 times per show. I like the band Joe Firstman. Carson Daily needs to be clarified before it is too late.
