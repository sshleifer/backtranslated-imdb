The main problem of this film is that he cannot use Bill Murray to the best of his abilities, simply because of his film colleague. <br /> <br /> If it was a road movie with another comedy actor, it could work. Even if they both tried to deliver an elephant across the country, it would allow them to have a little fun. Currently, Murray is still talking to an elephant who cannot respond with witty banter. In essence, this means that Murray is talking to himself, and this makes the film more boring than if he had another character to bounce off. <br /> <br /> Children will love this movie simply because of Elephant, but anyone who wants to look at the sharp delivery of Bill Murray and enjoy the excellent script should look for something else.
