This film was a waste of time. It looks nice, nice settings, works well, looks serious and seems to lead somewhere, so stay tuned for a pending return. It does not happen. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that so much effort could have been put into the film, it was done very professionally, and the result, which seems to be nothing more than a b-film. <br /> <br /> Save your precious time and watch a good French film such as “Les Visiteurs” (ridiculous), “Jean de Florette” or “Manon of Spring”. I can not remember the language in Europa Europa, but this is another great movie - heavy, but very worthy of viewing. <br /> <br /> This film promises a lot, but gives nothing.
