“Alien Express” is one of the worst films I've ever encountered. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. Aliens look like marionettes of rubber socks. The effects would have been mediocre in the 70s, but by today's standards they are simply terrible. Can't they take a snapshot of the real train instead of using the obvious model? <br /> <br /> The game is not great, but in fact dialogue is the worst part. It penetrates your mind. “Do not die from me. Not now". If you ever manage to suspend disbelief for a long enough time to immerse yourself in a movie, you will quickly and painfully return to reality by aliens, a model train, or a clichéd dialogue. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn’t give this film is “1” because it doesn’t deserve to be rated so poorly that some poor fuckers could watch it for the pleasure of a really bad movie.
