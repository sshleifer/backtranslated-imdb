The worst part of all of this is bad scripts leading to a superficial acting game. <br /> <br /> The character of Dreyfus is very repetitive and annoying, and Dreyfus himself has an annoying face to match. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter's character is exaggeratedly selfish, and Hunter herself, as usual, indulges in a serious replay. <br /> <br /> Brad Johnson was wooden. John Goodman made the most of it. <br /> <br /> Moreover, all this death / ghost has since been somewhat exaggerated, and now looks rather unconvincing. <br /> <br /> It is hardly possible to observe only if you like old planes.
