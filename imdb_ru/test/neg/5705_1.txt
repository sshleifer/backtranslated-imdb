If this is not so often found in every “what not to look at” list, then it should be only because those who keep this particular list are not aware of its existence, which, as long as it remains, is an acceptable alternative. I'm not kidding, this is * bad * "movie". Joseph Meeker returns from the dead with various indefinite, supernatural supernatural abilities, the most involved of which seem to appear in a new, more and more ridiculous and ridiculous way (and never frightening and not frightening ... in general, when it comes to the last one it turns out to be just strange, and the attempts of the first one simply do not work, period) outfits and stereotypes / archetypes, and depicted by David Keith (whom I respect in ... well, at least Daredevil), doing more often than not very terribly inconsistent ( which may also be relevant to the scenario) and often super high performance. One or two characters have such incredibly annoying personalities that it hurts to look at them. Editing thinks that it is much smarter than it actually is (and that it was on Earth with a red tint for memories?). Cinematography ... oh dear. Framing, lighting, effective use of the corner (this can be attributed to editing, perhaps, too), please, guys, stop me when I say something that you have ever heard of existence. On the technical side, this is a pretty lousy excuse for the fact that a projector is worth something more worthwhile than unexposed film. But why stop there? The plot is just bad. The basic idea was made, and it was made much better than this (Crow will be alone). The way this is said is useless, and although there is some explanation behind the memories, it still does not satisfy. Pacing almost does not exist. Lead is clearly unlikely, and at the shed door there is more individuality, not to mention the fact that they are also much less wooden. Kelly Perin and Thomas Ian Nicholas? What, in the name of all the good and fair (pun intended) do you do in this? Perin, you were already funny before, on the Drew Carey Show, Nicholas, well, I did not see you in anything that preceded American Pie, but if nothing else, you * were * funny later, and in these performances were deliberate. Dialogue ... the less said the better. The language is unrestrained and tends to be stupid. The violence, unfortunately, has been committed, and they don’t even try to hide it (hints of this might have been a more sensible strategy). Characters, don't start me. Why waste so much energy on depicting uninteresting, sometimes completely illogical events? The more you think about it, the worse it gets. It’s not even passable as a “horrible horror movie” or movie B (it can go very well through the entire alphabet and move on), it cannot scare you on the worst day of your life if it was an electrified repeller. I recommend it only to people who want to disprove how bad it is, and do not say that I did not warn you. 1/10
