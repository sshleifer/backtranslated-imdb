It was the worst movie I've ever seen! My husband and I have over 600 DVDs, most of which are Sci-Fi and the horrors of B-Movies, which are not of the highest quality, but still interesting. The Dracula 300 had absolutely no redemptive qualities! The letter was terrible, and the game was even worse. It took us 3 attempts to go through the entire movie, because we could tolerate it only at 30-minute intervals. We thought it should get better ... we were wrong. I would prefer to watch the embalming of a corpse than to relive it !!! When it ended, my husband and I just looked at each other like "Uh ... is that so?" The end seemed to be more, but they exceeded their apparent budget of $ 500.00 and were like, "Oh, shit ... we went bankrupt ... finish it now ... quickly ... credit credits!"
