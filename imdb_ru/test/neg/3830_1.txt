I was invited to an early film show about four months before it was released. I had to watch a movie, and then fill the bag with my thoughts. It was the most difficult thing to sit on the ground. The show just crawls, and you quickly begin to want you to be dead. The fact is that there are two types of Mormon films. Good ones with real good stories, and shitty ones that just stink. Saints and soldiers, now there is a good film. But with these comedies, screenwriters and actors just try too hard. In fact, they try to be funny when itâ€™s not. No wonder why such a small target audience for these films; they are filled with "internal jokes" that are not funny from the very beginning, and they are just trying to make fun of ordinary things. This is the story that makes the film, and the stories for these films are just weak. I bet you can guess what my package looked like when I was told to fill it after the movie. ;)
