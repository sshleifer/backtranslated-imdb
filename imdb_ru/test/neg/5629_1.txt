SPOILERS FOLLOW - and I have not even seen it. <br /> <br /> Let me guess ... the murder is connected with an evil developer who wants to master the riverbank, and Dickens was killed because he was trying to uncover a similar vile story. If someone who has seen this can tell me, if I am half right, you will save me the time it may take to watch something worthwhile, and the rest of us will know to avoid both this film and its enthusiastic reviewers. On the other hand, it * sounds * intriguing; but if it were good, would it have been given with a Sunday rag? And what is Foley's track record anyway? <br /> <br /> ... So, as a civil service, I managed to put up with it. This is worse than Swept Away. Indeed. I read the stories of eight-year-olds with more drama than this. Really terrible. And I was half right.
