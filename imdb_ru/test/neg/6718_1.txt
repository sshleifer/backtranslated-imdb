Lord have mercy! Why was this movie made? Why did Seagal and rising star Max Ryan agree to be in it? A foreigner is so painfully bad in every conceivable relationship that it is amazing. <br /> <br /> The film has a very cheap look. As a budget for a couple of bucks, it was far beyond their reach. Worse, manufacturers are aware of this and are trying to make it look smooth to compensate for this. The result is a movie that just doesn't look right. The fighting scenes are so boring and edited "discretely" that they hide the fact that Stephen Seagal is no longer in good shape. None of them is attractive or exciting. The plot is nonsense, which in no way interests and has no uniqueness to it. Places in Eastern Europe (a cunning step on the part of producers to reduce the budget or lack of it) look unpleasant and should not serve as a backdrop for the “action” (what action?) <br /> And what about the name? As far as I could tell, everyone in the film was foreigners. Which name refers to the name? <br /> <br /> The DVD has anamorphic 1.85: 1 widescreen format and Dolby 5.1 sound. None of them is great enough to guarantee even one rent. A foreigner is not worth a second of your time. Gotta love this slogan though! "If they think they can stop him, they are completely wrong." Sheesh!
