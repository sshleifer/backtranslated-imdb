Billed as a romantic comedy against the early years of World War II, it is not able to deliver. The problem is that although he is beautifully photographed, he does not have a coherent story line or narration. Starting as a murder mystery, it gives no hope to its actors, as it wanders through recent history. Depardieu is lost in the trivial role, with which he is clearly not comfortable to play. Ajani can not bear the picture. Hero not; Obviously, the imitation of the role of the “wrongly accused” Hitchcock does not have a balance. Neither heroic, nor comic, nor stressful. <br /> <br /> It could be a good movie. I remember “The Lady disappears”, which combined seriousness, romance and comedy in a serious film about fascism.
