We all saw bad movies, well, this one shoots the cake. I saw this box with the Junior films, which looked many times from my many travels to the horror section in the local video store, and I was a little interested, it seems to pay homage to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so I thought I would get it. Mistake! Junior sucks hard, long and readily. In other words, this is really bad. Although it does win my reward for the most creative use of bikini tops. TO AVOID !!
