Naked Dina Troy! <br /> <br /> Brother Richie Chuck (from “Happy Days”) with reverse Mohawk! <br /> <br /> Death Wish 3 has it all and more, including one clever scene in which the character of Chuck Bronson is set up. a device like a mousetrap that brains punk when it opens a window. <br /> <br /> Chuck also puts a board with nails on the floor near another window and smiles when he comes back and sees bloody footprints as he leaves. <br /> <br /> All I can say about Death Wish 3 is that it is one of the most incomprehensible “serious” films I have ever seen - loaded to the limit with lawlessness, and almost zero answer police, despite the use of military weapons to mow punks into the account. <br /> <br /> As I understand it, Bronson denied this film, but gladly cashed a check on the Golan Globe. <br /> <br /> If you like high-quality movies, avoid it, but if you need a cheap donkey, watch it.
