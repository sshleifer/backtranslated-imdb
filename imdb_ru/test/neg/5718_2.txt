After a long hard night at Walkabout in Islington, I needed a meal. I had a sore throat, my wallet was empty, and I stopped to chat with a drug addict at the bus stop, trying to sell me gasoline. Today I watched “Red Sonya” and I can honestly say that last night I felt much better than now. Bridget Nielsen heads a bunch of kicking warriors of various shapes and sizes to get the green rock from some evil queen whose motives are never fully explained. Yes, it is so good. <br /> <br /> “Red Sonya” is not in the genre known for excellent films, until Peter Jackson came with a certain Oscar-trilogy. In fact, the best film about swords and witchcraft that I could come up with before The Lord of the Rings was George W. Willow. Perhaps in this regard, you need to calm down a bit in this film. But I can not - it is poorly written, badly entered (with the exception of Paul Smith, who is just average) and terribly complex. The film is just as convincing as the episode from the Flintstones, with costumes and decorations that seemingly were shot straight from the bedrock. Considering the original material of comics, it is easy to forgive various plot inconsistencies. Why Sonya insists on saving the most annoying child, in this world or in this, is confusing. His personality seems to switch from a spoiled guy to a polite gentleman when the switch clicks. Schwarzenegger demonstrates less charisma than a field filled with cows, and just goes through the movements, an ideal actor for his breakthrough role in the Terminator. <br /> <br /> Making a movie is easy when you fall, but the fact remains that it is not a very good movie, for that matter. When Nielsen mourns the death of his sister, and Schwarzenegger gently puts his hand on her shoulder to console her, and then he blurts out, with such a characteristic German accent, "she is dead," then you realize that a rough ride awaits you. A few smiles were raised in inappropriate places, such as the priestesses of the temple, who, when they were sent to die in a hole in the ground, seemed to enjoy this experience - at least judging by the orgasm moans that seemed to echo around the place. If you have to watch a fantastic movie of the eighties that was not porn, watch "Willow" (but never take that as a melody of approval). Actually, take yourself to your local multiplex and show Peter Jackson what a wonderful job he did with Lord of the Rings. Believe me, “11 Oscars” really means that this is a great movie - unlike the bloody “Titanic”.
