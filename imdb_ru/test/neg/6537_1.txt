Despite many positive reviews, this is a very slow film with three essentially good actors, improvising the most banal dialogue you have ever heard. This is another road movie that really is not going anywhere. The camera is often out of focus, and constant panning in some too long scenes is annoying. <br /> <br /> These three characters are attractive but pleasing to the note. The cast also sets what should be the intergalactic record for using the weary word "dude." (Even Howard Stern refused this weary pseudo-pronoun.) <br /> <br /> Three main actors and one supporting actor show great promise. They are clearly comfortable and boldly allow themselves to be portrayed as small and even stupid. All the characters in the characters seem brave lovers who have generously volunteered to pronounce a few lines ... Indeed, they are all physically well suited for their roles. <br /> <br /> Overall, a dull 90 minutes that seem like an eternity, These are among my ten worst films of all time.
