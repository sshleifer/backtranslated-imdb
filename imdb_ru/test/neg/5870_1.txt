It is often difficult to determine which of the best films you have ever seen, as this may vary depending on the genre, the preferences of the actors / actresses or even the mood in which you are on a certain day! Having said that, this film, in my opinion, is the worst film I have ever seen !! I thought the acting was awful (was anyone?), The plot was just stupid, and the prop was completely fake. Is it possible to create production with a smaller budget, without being an amateur production? I do not think so. Even the friends with whom I watched the movie agreed that this is the worst video we have ever made, and to this day we still joke about that night when we watched this movie.
