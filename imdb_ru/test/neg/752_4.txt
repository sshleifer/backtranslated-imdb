Usually Jane Austenâ€™s productions on the BBC are pretty good, but Northanger Abbey is just weird. What were they thinking about? In this film, the little charm of Austin and ironically imitates the gothic novels that Austin ridiculed so wonderfully. Not only are the "gothic" sequences tasteless, excessive and frankly stupid. The actress who plays Miss Morland is poorly played, without a clear call to attract the attention of a suitable bachelor, and although I rather liked the creepy Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, he is a little different from the novel, even when she is conducting a dialogue in the book. Robert Hardy played the role of General Tilney in one of his few terrible "ham" performances. This film was so strange and strange that I actually watched it again to enjoy how strange it was.
