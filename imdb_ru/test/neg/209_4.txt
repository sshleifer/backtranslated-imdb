Dillon, Fishbourne, Reno, had to unite for much smarter efforts, because this slide was in category B and could be made with nameless actors and a much smaller budget, since in any case 2 armored trucks and a wasted Warehouse could not be too lot. Since the authors failed to come up with a reasonable plan for the robbery, they set their sights on the drama of the situation, but there was also nothing to use there. Fishbourne and Renault do not bring anything to this film, except for media interest, they are just expensive advertising. Dillon is fine, but it was a walk in the park. The choice of the protagonist, Ti Hackett, is rather boring, and the final with the “reward” is rather childish. A waste of time, money, actors, and so on.
