Carol Lombard and James Stewart are diligently trying to bring some life and meaning to this strangely constructed film about the misfortunes of the newlyweds. The scenes are reproduced as if they were distributed between different directors, each of whom had a different goal. Some of them are cute Capra, some talkers, some melodramatic, and some surprisingly noir. There is even an extended sequence of adventures when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard. It is difficult to say which scenes are the most irrelevant when the film as a whole is so chaotic, and the plot line is not entirely believable. Worth seeing only for film students or movie fans â€” some smaller roles, such as Judge Doolittle and the fearless pilot, are also very well played.
