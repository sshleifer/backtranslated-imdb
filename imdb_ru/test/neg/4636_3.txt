Here is an example number 87 358 of the anti-biblical prejudices of Hollywood, so typical of them. <br /> <br /> Ray Liotta’s wife first did this, and women are interviewed for the position of housekeeper. The first interviewer is an old-fashioned person (clothing, manners, speech) who immediately sets strict rules, stating that “there will be two hours of Bible study every day.” <br /> <br /> This said, of course, that it sounded like reading the Bible was the worst punishment you could ever inflict on anyone, especially on a child. Once again, the Bible equates to sultry, mean people. This woman, of course, is immediately fired. <br /> <br /> Naturally, a liberal black woman (Whoopi Goldberg - who else?) is the one who is hired and, voila, saves the day! <br /> <br /> Yawn.
