This film is a shame, especially considering that Andrzej Wajda is not an amateur, but a professional director. However, this film does not give anything that you could count on. <br /> <br /> First of all, I am Polish, so I can tell the whole story of the issue, because I read books. But how can you say that there is even a war in this film - a group of people goes here and there, some soldiers scream ... Is it really World War II or soldiers on vacation? <br /> <br /> Acting and dialogue are bad, unhappy. A.Żmijewski, D.Stenka, M.Komorowska, W.Kowalski, A.Chyra fit into their roles, the rest (Polish) actors are irrelevant (first of all M.Ostaszewska, one of the leading characters, which is a bad choice). 99% of the dialogues are not pronounced, they are simply placed there, it was difficult for the actors to play, and it’s not surprising if you consider what strange things they had to say. <br /> <br /> And this brings us to the most disappointing problem - you cannot feel it. Everything is so theatrical, artificial. There is no real life, no feelings in it. There are many original shots from the Second World War, and, guess what, the material is much more powerful, dramatic, than what A. Waid did. <br /> <br /> I see only one positive - despite the historical mistakes (as an abbreviation of ZSRR; this was done for propaganda purposes after 1945, to please the Polish, that ZSRS disappeared, and now was ZSRR, but in 1940 there was no ZSRR!) Tips (yes, this is a fact, not controversial gossip). Great, two hours for a 5-10 minute scene. <br /> <br /> In any case, time and potential are wasted. This is a tragedy of epic proportions, a desire to fight in 1939 (hardly shown), and not a declaration of war against the Soviet Union by the Polish authorities (yes! It is not shown here), shortly thereafter imprisonment of soldiers, life in terrible conditions (not shown here) and fear what comes next (barely shown), and then ... extermination. Hand in hand with the Germans - the Soviets destroyed the Polish nation, aimed at the people who formed the backbone of Poland. Unfortunately, they succeed, and the results are still visible to this day.
