The reason why this movie sucks, do these people even read the Bible? Everything in the film was about Moses, God kept away from him. IT WAS NOT! God directed everything, he told them where to go and what to do. Also, people wandered for 40 years AFTER they arrived at Kanan and betrayed God again! They did not roam for 40 years, and then suddenly found it. It was a punishment for their doubts. Maybe if the people who shot the film first took the Bible, they would say: “Oh, no, we all misunderstood, try again.” Everything about this movie was about Moses. They made God look like a jerk who kept fussing with Moses all the time. NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!! God was theirs all the time, and he wanted people to see that he cares about them. How dare they say otherwise, even close to the aisle. And they didn't let Moses because he was angry with people and clearly did not obey God! He greatly sinned, and he was told that he would not be allowed to enter. When did Moses run away and cry out to God for everything in the Bible? NEVER!!!!!! Actually read your story before you figure out what you think is a good idea. In addition, all of this God remained out of it for the most part and made them do it themselves, this is not true !!! God did everything for the people, he provided them with all possible means, and God told them where to go. He was there all the time. All that we have to do is, in a sense, true, but then it is not so! Yes, today He does not work for everyone to see, but then he actually killed people after the golden calf! God worked directly with people. Read the Bible next time, Echo Bridge or do not shoot another Bible movie.
