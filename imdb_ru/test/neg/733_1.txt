I watched "Fuckland" a long time ago. I lied if I say that I remember it in detail; what I remember most vividly is the irritation that provoked me, and the feeling of the complete waste of precious money and time, not only of my time and money invested in watching a film, but also of the director. <br /> <br /> Presumably, “Fuckland” is a critic of Argentines, introducing us (I am also an Argentine) to little people who take responsibility and even boast about small, ridiculous victories and think that we are the best thing that God (which is also Argentine) created. I'm not going to argue about this. This is probably a true statement about a fairly large part of the population (by the way, the part I despise). And even if it’s not, it’s not my point of view. The worst sin that Fuckland committed was to make such a statement about its own director. <br /> <br /> The continuous impression I received was that the director was too busy trying to impress us to sneak up the camera inside the islands, to worry about making a good (even mediocre) film. Many of the duplicates made by the hidden camera are meaningless. The director chooses to show off with the stupid edition of the old military duplicates and their own. And there is no plot at all. <br /> <br /> Moreover, this film proudly presents the Dogme certificate before opening titles, only in order not to respect its principles (for example, is the director’s inclusion in the credits a further sign of his pride?). <br /> <br /> I found the film offensive not as an Argentinian, but as an observer. I felt unappreciated. Fuckland is just one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
