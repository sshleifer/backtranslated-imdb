Since the characters start with "Unknown" personalities, they are not identified by name, so you start with handsome James Caviesel waking up in a warehouse. He learns that the place is tightly locked. Do not ask - the windows are made of protective glass, and it is impossible to get out. Four other men awakening make him a quintet: Mr. Caviesel in his “Denim Jacket”, Barry Pepper in the “Ranger's Shirt”, Greg Kinnear with “Broken Nose”, Joe Pantoliano as the “Bound Man” chair and Jeremy Sisto shot and “handcuffed” . Oh dude ?? <br /> <br /> These five men have collective amnesia. They think that three of them are kidnappers, and two are victims, but they do not know who is who or who is who. Forgetfulness occurs due to leakage in the pipe. Do not ask - it happens. Meanwhile, lead lawyer David Selby (in the role of Parker) sends his police officers to disclose the abduction, and one of the men Bridget Moynahan (in the role of Eliza Coles) frantically waits. But the criminal gang leader, Peter Stormare in Snakeskin Boots, is also on his way to the stage. <br /> <br /> As in the synopsis on the DVD it says: “As secrets are revealed, so the clues are solved (men) must run over time to find out who is good and who is evil in order to stay alive.” Unfortunately , the story reads much better than on tape. When the secrets are finally revealed, and the memories become clear, there is no longer any interest in what happened. It’s just that the director Simon Brand has a great premise with the idea of ​​Matthew Waney, but they make easy investments in characters holding the short end of the stick . <br /> <br /> **** Anonymous (1/11/06) Simon Brand ~ James Kavizel, Barry Pepper, Greg Kinnear, David Selby
