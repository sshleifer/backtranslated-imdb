I've always had this painful curiosity when it comes to notorious and unpopular films. I also always liked bad-this-good movies, you look at someone who really liked recent children's films filled with cheese, such as Catwoman and Thunderbirds (2004). <br /> <br /> I looked at this. It turned out that all critics are right about that. This is a large flop, but unlike many flops, at any level he doesn’t even enjoy, doesn’t even joke. This is just one boring gangster festival after another. <br /> <br /> I was warned. I did not listen. I'm a fool. <br /> <br /> Don't be a fool, do not waste time and money on this pile of garbage.
