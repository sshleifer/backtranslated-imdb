This show is driving me crazy. This goes against what the family should be, even if it is intended for comedy. The show is supposed to follow Dave and Vicky Gold (Michael Rapaport and Anita Barone) when they bring up three teenage children: Hilary, Larry and Mike. Good prerequisites for comedy - yes, but this does not mean that it will be a good show. <br /> <br /> I don’t think I’ve ever heard rude conversations between parents and children and vice versa. The only conversation that seems to be present in the show is control of the children by the parents and gender. I know that sexual intercourse is usually a subject that teenagers often talk about, but it rises in almost every episode without meaning to it. In one episode that I just watched, parents gave their daughter Hilary a car, and you never thought that they were somehow related to how they talk to each other, and how parents talk about how Hilary looks like his slave. "<br /> <br /> The show fails at the comedy level the most. I never laughed at this show, even one of the many attempts to watch it, and I’m the person who gave films such as Animal House and Dumb and Dumber are very high ratings. Michael Rapaport is a very good actor, and why he decided to spoil his career by removing this piece of dirty show, I don’t know. <br /> <br /> Parents, make sure your children never, and I mean, never don't watch it. Teenagers, you will probably laugh at it only because of sexually explicit references, but none of this on will not work, and then you will feel quite empty. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2/5 Stars.
