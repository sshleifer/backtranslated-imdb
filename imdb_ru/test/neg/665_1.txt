After watching this movie, I have nothing but contempt for any of those who participated in the creation of this terrible film. On the one hand, as a general comment, the storyline was literally incredible and filled with incredible cliches around. Obviously, the same applies to the dialogue, which condones the lowest common denominator and can offer absolutely zero unpredictable original lines. The acting was terrible, and Kane throughout the film showed a variety of emotions. Even the use of modern special effects failed, since each pillar was easily distinguishable from its real counterpart. In general, I would not recommend anyone to even think about viewing this function, since it will probably spend 83 (not even 90!) Minutes of your life.
