Oh, where the hell should I start? Give a brief summary of the story? No, either you have already heard, or do not want. In any case, it sucks. Very similar to the movie. I turned out to be a big fan of horror films, and I must say that this is one of the most stupid and most awkward films that I have ever experienced displeasure when watching. <br /> <br /> The script is terribly stupid. The story begins too quickly, without the slightest wait or accumulation. All these torture scenes would be VERY more effective if we gave even a tiny crap for the characters. Since the first scene in the film is when teenage girls meet captain Howdy, how the hell do we have to sympathize with them? First, they seem stupid when they go to a party with a guy they don’t even know, and secondly, we don’t even know their damn names! Why the hell don't I care if they live or die? Not to mention that they really have the courage to try to make us feel sympathy for the captain. Hello after he was "transformed"? YOU ARE WELCOME! I greeted when he got it only desert He deserved them! Damn, he deserves the worst! In addition, we are forced to sit in a meaningless erroneous sequence, taken directly from “The Silence of the Lambs” (and here it is HORRIBLE! Of course, he will give them a false address! And even if he gave them the real address), you do not think that he will wait and not pierce Johnson for some guy upstairs? MISSING!) <br /> <br /> Then there is a dialogue. Everything Captain Howdy says is either ridiculous or just silly. "The dead are so horribly dead when they are dead" ?? What the hell is this ?! Dee Snyder at some point says: "Knowledge is power." Well, if that's true, this film has absolutely no power at all. <br /> <br /> Then there are plot holes. Yes, I know this is a horror movie (well, well, a horror movie), but damn it! You could drive a truck into these holes! First of all, these are the coolest cops I've ever seen! EVER !! I mean, dear God, these guys are morons! Call for backup, idiots! Secondly, how the hell did this huge septum ring fall out of Captain Howdy's nose ?! Obviously, this shrill expert says: “This is the biggest I’ve ever seen,” but if he’s as damn big, how the hell could he fall so easily? Did Captain Howdy just leave him at the crime scene because he wanted to be caught? They definitely didn't make it seem like he did. Besides, they will NEVER release Captain Howdy, and I know it from a damn fact. He will be in prison for the rest of his life, and there is no escape from it. Moreover, let him return to his old house, where he killed / tortured everyone. IMPOSSIBLE AND INDEPENDENT. <br /> <br /> And now the acting skills. Dear God, these people suck. Linda Cardellini is the only thing that is good in this film. She is balanced and amazing. It is a pity that she hardly gets a good chance to play in this piece of shit. Amy Smart appears for about 10 minutes and then disappears. Even the usually interesting Robert Englund is underused and inefficient here. Dee Snyder plays a madman without talent. I have never felt threatened, intimidated or intimidated. I would prefer to see Dee Snyder as Alexis Arquette in Bride Chucky. It would be much more fun to see this mediocre hacker joke from cute psychopaths. <br /> <br /> Dee Snyder just sucks. He can't act (one of the least scary villains I've ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damned movie in a dream?), And he is clearly dumber than the crazy Jessica Simpson! This film is just a way for Dee Snider to show all the strange nonsense that he knows about self-destruction and modern primitives and blah blah blah. Either it was done before, or it simply did not need to be done. I was bored throughout this damned. <br /> <br /> Actor sucks, music slop, scenario sucks, sucks rhythm, sucks special effects, direction sucks ... in fact, this film sucks. This film is trying to be a serious and complex thriller / horror film, and it fails with a bang. He cannot frighten, shake or disturb in any form, path or form. This is probably one of the least effective and completely non-original films I've ever seen in my whole life. A piece of cinematic garbage is captured on celluloid. <br /> <br /> “Strange Country” gets 0 out of 10. Avoid at all costs. Not the slightest pleasure.
