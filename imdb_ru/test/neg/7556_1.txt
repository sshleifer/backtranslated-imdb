I cannot recall any details of this film, except that the situation looked terribly familiar. Then I realized that this was filmed at the Lazy Lizard Hostel in Moab, Utah. It was one of my favorite places to visit when I was younger and wandered around the country. The guy who owns / manages the hostel, managed to get himself into the movies. All I remember about the plot of the film is that it involves jeeps and naked women. It's great to look only for scenery (I mean rock) ... If you are just looking for a soft core of porn, you probably will be better served elsewhere. I do not even know whether this film is available on tape or DVD.
