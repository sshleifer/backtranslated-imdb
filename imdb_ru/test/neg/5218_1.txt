When you watch the creation of this DVD — they tell you what is being done here — they retell the biblical story of good and evil and try to preach to its mainstream audience. In modern society, such as ours, the film fails. This film shows too many sheep. People are too empowered for this type of sermon today. <br /> <br /> As regards acting, managerial and technical functions, everything is fine with them. Chuck Norris is really all right as an angel, since the unpredictable appearance of Norris as an angel is no more absurd than Tommy Smothers was in the comedy series of the 1960s.
