I saw this film only once, when I was about 14 years old, but I was very glad that they made a film about the 45th division. Being from Oklahoma and especially now that both of my sons are members of the 45th, I would like it to be released on DVD. I may sound a bit biased, but the 45th Division sometimes does not receive the recognition it deserves today. The History Channel always talks about other infantry divisions when it comes to World War II and Korea, but you rarely hear the 45th mentioned. One of the scenes that really stood out for me was when Indian codecs and the puzzled expression on the face of German soldiers were at work when they could not understand this language. I am glad that all Native American codes receive the recognition they deserve.
