I am the only one who noticed that the “realism” of the 19th century ship is wrong. In fact, this is the 15th century, about 1620, if memory serves me right, because the “realistic” ship in the film is “Mayflower”, now, as far as I know, “Mayflower” NEVER traveled to Australia Australia I don't know who did the research and development for this film, but using Mayflower and the hope that no one will notice is really bad work. <br /> <br /> They even printed it on the cover and on the DVD. I wonder how other people noticed this little mistake? Not to mention the fact that the film itself was just awful, I would have expected better from Sam Neil.
