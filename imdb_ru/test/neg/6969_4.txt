Director and author of the famous / infamous Edward D. Wood Jr. using a pseudonym (Daniel Davies), starring Glenn / Glenda. This is an almost radical transvestism documentary; Wood himself is a crossdresser with a fetish for the Angora sweaters. It seems miles of footage, and the rambling Bela Lugosi is used to stretch this strange and awkward film to 67 minutes. Police inspector (Lyle Talbot) is looking for an enlightener from the psychiatrist Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell) to better understand the emotionality and location of transvestites. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast: Delores Fuller, “Tommy” Haynes Captain DeZita and sister Wooda Evelyn. Notable: Farrell also acts as a narrator. And Fuller later helped write the songs included in the films of Elvis Presley BLUE HAWAII, KISSIN 'COUSINS & KID GALAHAD.
