“Marked by death” (1990) spends more time on the sequence of actions than on focusing on his characters. After his first two impressive efforts, “Above the Law” (1988) and “Hard to Kill” (1989), this third painting by Steven Seagal clarifies the idea: anyone who opposes him should look like a fool; bad guys just to make it look good. <br /> <br /> Seagal steadily gathered an audience that seemed a bit larger than those who follow the antics of Chuck Norris or Jean Claude. Van Damme. <br /> <br /> In the movie “Marked by Death,” Seagal throws off any pretense in style and begins to completely throttle. This film contains a lot of graphic violence, blood and nudity, which seem to be present only for some reason, besides to please hooligan moviegoers who cannot distinguish action films telling a story from those that simply cause thrills without rhymes or causes, and he deserves some real blame for this omission in taste as a producer of Marked for Death. <br /> <br /> Seagal plays John Hatcher, a retired DEA agent who returns home to Chicago, where his family is attacked by a Jamaican street gang that attacks his sister's house, and the film proves that it is not squeamish when the niece Hatcher (Daniel Harris) shoots crossfire. Hatcher is angry, and he decides to team up with his old friend Max (Keith David), a school gym teacher, and Charles (Tom Wright), a Jamaican policeman. <br /> <br /> Naturally, Hatcher declares war on the main bad guy, a Jamaican voodoo priest who is not afraid, nicknamed Winding (Basil Wallace), a nickname that obviously means "outrageous replay". <br /> <br /> And it’s almost unbelievable when Seagal selects different members of the gang: he knocks out the eye of one guy, he breaks the back of the guy and breaks numerous arms and limbs. <br /> All the logic for this film is thrown out of the window - that is, through glass, that is. Why isn't Hatcher and his friends being charged for all the damage they cause to the property or the number of bodies that have accumulated? And how did they get a cache of automatic weapons from Illinois to Jamaica by plane, without being discovered? <br /> <br /> Seagal has the stoicism of Clint Eastwood, who the fans seem to like, and despite the fact that he has played three different characters in so many films, everyone is dressed in black oriental robes and wears a tail. One of the problems I’m facing in Seagal’s films is that the main characters never seem to be in serious danger, and since he’s the star, of course, no one can wear gloves on him other than the bad guy. <All of Segal’s characters are interchangeable, as are most of the plotlines and sequences of actions. Regardless of whether he is disguised as a ship cook, fireman or police officer from Los Angeles wearing beads of love, Seagal is always Seagal, and that is exactly what his fans want. In fact, the similarity of these films is such that, if I wanted, I could take an old review, change the names and get fairly accurate information about the new film. Not that I ever really did this ...
