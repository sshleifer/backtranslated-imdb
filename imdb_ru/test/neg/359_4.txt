“The Man with the Golden Hand” (film) is a worthy tool for Frank Sinatra’s career, but fails terribly as a good adaptation of a fantastic book. You always hear about how books “change” when they turn into films - things are cut out, fall into a dead end, etc. Well, you can't even say that they “changed something” with the film - they just told a completely different story. Character and setting are one and the same, but not an unambiguous description, the depth of the men and women of the Polish Chicago in the book. As for the situation, it became just a game scene with unnecessary players in the "supporting role", who walk too eagerly along the claustrophobic inner streets. The film is a completely stunned, completely different look at Frankie Machines and drug addiction. When this happens, Zosh, Frankie, Sparrow lose their psychological advantage. Frankie's drumming, a humble dream in the book, becomes his complete passion in the film (probably because Sinatra is a musician). And drug addiction is considered as exploitative slok. The game is decent, especially the snake-like Louis, which is more menacing in the film than the book. But it's just a shame that this film can be called a classic along with the book on which it is “based,” the real story about Frankie Machine. The film simply shows that Hollywood can "make things right without giving it a meaning and adding a happy ending." In this case, they just completely changed it, turning an important and realistic story into a Hollywood fluff. I'm pretty damn sure because I read the book first, so I can't honestly relate to the film, knowing how good the book is. I was actually thinking about turning off the film (and I never do it), just so that I would not be confused by the stupid story with the beauty of the book. But this is an overrated film, and although it’s not so bad, the book should stand first, as well as the first. And that was to remain the only story about Division Street and Frankie Machine.
