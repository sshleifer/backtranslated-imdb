“Fool for Love” is one of several forgotten films made by Robert Altman in the 1980s. This screen adaptation of the play of Sam Shepard, in which Shepard plays the main role, is simply not very good. During his fascinating career, Altman made many not very good films, and in many cases he was to blame. But here I think that Shepard’s fault is that he wrote such a fragile play. Direction Altman guaranteed performances approx. considering what the actors have to work with, but this non-essential scenario leads to nothing and takes time. <br /> <br /> Shepard is Eddie, a stuntman who has a love / hate relationship with May (Kim Basinger), They fight endlessly for an evening spent in some kind of dusty motel in the middle of nowhere, while the mysterious the man (Harry Dean Stanton), who can be either a figurative or a literal father for Eddie and May, is quietly watching. Randy Quaid completes the cast of four, acting as a gentleman. <br /> <br /> The only dramatic hook in the whole plot is the suggestion that Eddie and May are incestuous. However, this hook looks more like a trick than anything else. The script does not consider their relationship in detail and does not use their relationship to explore more universal topics. Shepard and Basiner create eccentric educated characters who get annoyed during the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid can do little but give back shots. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film is especially bad when Eddie and May’s past stories begin to play back in the memories because of the monotonous, sleepy voice. <br /> <br /> Mel before another from Altman's experiments failed. <br /> <br /> Rating: C-
