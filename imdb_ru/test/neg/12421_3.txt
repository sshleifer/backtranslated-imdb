Wild Rebels are bad fun, but also frustrating because of the real or at least executable elements of the story. This applies to the driver of a racing car (Steve Alaimo), who is entangled in a group of bikers called “Angels of Satan” who hang out a lot until they decide to rob a bank. Meanwhile, the police will also recruit Alaimo to tell them what the angels are doing and where they will rob further. It’s not even the fact that the film is really too “out of date”, although, of course, it carries quite rough and stupid music in the film (from a group on the stage in one scene to Alyimo’s “performance”, if you can call it a dragon, to the usual total score). <br /> <br /> Just the creator of the film no longer cares that there will be a bit more logic, direction and best actors in the roles. As I did not have a big dislike for the film, as I did with Hellcats, but it almost left me a little indifferent to all this as well. What can be unpredictable comes only with such stupid things as the name of the city of Florida (“Citrusville”, ho-ho). So lately he has not been deprived of the status of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The commentary on the film is good, even if once or twice I almost wanted to hear what the characters say on the screen, in case it has any value. Wild Rebels can be a better time if you have six packages and low expectations, but, as it would be, I would not watch it again.
