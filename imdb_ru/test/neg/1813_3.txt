Despite the great cast and plot potential, this film falls through on many levels. I was convinced that the director was new. The film is very badly edited, shows a lot of unimportant and annoying flashes, it has very noticeable nonsense and has no tense atmosphere. The question that I had repeatedly during the viewing was: "So what?". I do not care about the main character and what happens to him. The point is not that the story is not convincing, but how it is told. The film tells the story. TERM It's like an actor who mumbles his lines, not knowing what he is saying. The film simply tells about the events that occur without any soul. And the director is to blame. He does not know how to make something interesting, stressful or pleasant. (And believe me, I'm not the one who wants to see cruel 8 or 2 fast 2 crap. On the contrary, I especially like slow movies.) So I was sure that the director was a newcomer. But, to my amazement, this man has many years of experience and has worked as a cinematographer or camera assistant in many amazing productions. I think then he had a bad year.
