I remember watching this movie on TV a few years ago. It was so bad, I can only remember those scenes that made me die of laughter. The only summary of the plot that I can give you (without any spoilers) is a photo of a home movie made by college guys with high scores. <br /> <br /> (The spoiler alert starts here ...) When the movie starts, the guy ran, pursued by “Police Demon”, when in fact he was being chased by a Halloween costume. A car appears out of nowhere, knocking the guy who was running. Does it make him fly over him, and what does the driver do ??? Watching a man when he falls, gets into the car and drives away. What type of crazy fool will do this? I would at least ask if everything is alright with the guy. <br /> <br /> Then a dark-skinned guy looks straight into the face of a demon cop, and then tells reporters: "I didn’t look good" at him. /> <br /> Then in the alley there is a scene where this girl with an afro pulls a small small machine out of her machine gun. It could not possibly be suitable! so bad. <br /> <br /> The cops in the film can't even jump over the fence, and the action is so wooden that wooden boards bark like the best actors. <br /> <br /> In general, this film brings shame to Hollywood, much more than any other failure. as far as I can tell.
