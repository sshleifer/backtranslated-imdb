A young couple on the road, doing their own thing and having casual sex in their car in broad daylight. And yet, suddenly, their psychopath in a scary and rusty pickup truck threatens them and terrorizes them. Hmm, where have I seen this premise before? Oh, yes, now I remember, we had already seen it a thousand times before, and about nine hundred and ninety-nine other cases were much better than “Rest Stop”! This weak and pitiful new film offends even the most demanding horror fans, as there is not one original twist or memorable stunt in it. This is very sadistic and disgusting, but every click of a teen murderer these days is sadistic and nasty, so this is no longer a surprise. The absolute main problem with this production is an incredibly large number of blunt plot holes and meaningless subplots. Writer / director John Shiban damn well understood that the ultra-thin storyline was almost not enough to fill the entire film, and thus he fills his film, like a turkey on Thanksgiving, with an abnormal and meaningless addition. Nicole's boyfriend disappears at an abandoned dirty stop in California. Killing her character immediately would not have led to a very long film, and so she subsequently meets a family of freaks on wheels, suffers from visions (?) In which she talks to previous victims of the abnormal killer, and she has deep emotional (and boring conversations with police that simply will not die, even if the truck hit him ... twice! Stupid stories never come to anything, and they are certainly the most pitiful and desperate attempts to increase the length of the film I've ever seen. Shiban should have paid more attention to the increase in tension and made her main characters a little more sympathetic. Jamie Alexandra Nicole's character is an annoying and brainless girl, and you will not care if she survived the test or not. Her boyfriend Jesse and a police officer both whined to losers, and their cruel deaths were still not painful enough if you asked me, I counted exactly three episodes, including torture and unnecessary injuries that were terrible and quite exciting, to make me sadistic smile on my face. This is still too little for a modern horror movie. In fact, “Rest Stop” is just a pitiful attempt to cash in on the success of films such as Wolf Creek and Hostel, but it's better to watch the originals. It was the first film of a new production company called Raw Feed. They advertise themselves as a new name in horror, but they will have to come up with something much better than “Rest Stop” if they want us to believe it.
