This movie is pathetic in every way. Bad game, horrible script (was there one?), Terrible editing, lousy cinematography, cheap humor. Just awful. <br /> <br /> I saw The Wish Master a couple of weeks before this movie, and I thought it was the killer of the worst movie of the year. Then I saw “The Pest” and suddenly “The Wishmaster” did not seem so bad at all. <br /> <br /> Bad Bad Bad. Painfully bad.
