The film is annoying. <br /> <br /> Technically, too often you see unfocused and very rudely edited scenes. You can easily get a cleaner movie using a decent amateur camera and $ 100 video editing software. On earth, a man on the street does not mean careless editing. Unfocused scenes that do not contain important statements should be deleted. The same applies to the head / arm / other objects of the object remaining in the frame. My 8 year old son already knows this. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long. The essence (anti-globalization) is clear after 30 minutes, why bother with everything else. After the interview with James Suckling, I pressed the “Stop” button. What is the waist of time. <br /> <br /> The main theme just doesn't work for me anymore. I have seen too many small wineries that produce mediocre, commercialized wines, and many large wineries that produce great and unique wines. The film identifies small producers as those who produce wines with greater individuality, or terroir. Larger ones are accused of producing "internationalized" or "commercialized" wines. The film is trying to make a black and white statement in a world full of gray tones. However, the film did not confirm this statement. They look at a couple of sporadic examples, “associate” some major producers (Frescobaldi) with fascism and give “interviews” with key people. Well, all the small manufacturers spent the Second World War in the resistance? Is it appropriate to see that Parker is dealing with Bulldogs? The film is very manipulative and unconvincing.
