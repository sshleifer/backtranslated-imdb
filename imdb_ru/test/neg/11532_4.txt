I found this to be a very watchable movie. There was some good stunt work that gave a significant degree of excitement and expectation to the story. However, in order for the plot to work, it was necessary to suspend credulity several times. For example, despite the loss of the transmission cable, clutches, and harnesses, when the pilot pulled the chassis by hand, they, fortunately, found a spare aircraft board complete with Caribbeans. According to the plot, drilling a hole in the storage ceiling will cause the alarm system to turn off in the storage when the system is reactivated (I cannot understand why), according to Daltry, there a battery-powered drill cannot drill through the storage ceiling, however, they just had a hydraulic a drill with hoses and fittings to match equally convenient take-off points in the aircraftâ€™s hydraulic system located above the roof. Since the aircraft has a closed hydraulic system, it is difficult to understand how this can be done without affecting the control system or, at least, without setting the hydraulic pressure signals in the cabin. Taking it for the sake of plot, it takes them a few minutes to drill a small hole in the top of the vault (they can drill the tension before the Fed gets to test a false alarm), but since the vault the door closed and before the Fed walked a few feet to The second security door, they punched a squire-hole in the roof of the vault, large enough for them to pass. For the sake of good yarn, you can take all the theses and other inconsistencies, but the film spoiled for me what the writers tried to explain that until this moment was a fairly predictable ending, they killed two heroes (if you can call the shards heroes). One of Ketchum and Brooks was shot and thrown from 747 at an altitude of 10,000 feet, and the other sly one slid along a cable between two planes, the Daltry villain with one hand manages to unhook a cable that carries an adult weight with air pressure of several hundred miles per hour. him and allows him to fall to death. And yet, in the following sequence, these two without any explanation (however dubious or improbable), they miraculously did not survive from 10,000 feet and managed to arrange a complex scam to get the money. The only comment about survival was for Sophie that her brother was a bad shot. Don't wait for an Oscar nomination for this.
