Sorry, but I do not understand how the studio copes with this. The film is just not worth it. Perhaps, as a theatrical play, but, of course, not as a film! And why do they call it a thriller ??? Outside the game is a good game, but I did not expect anything less from these wonderful actors. Robert Redford plays very well, and Willem Defoe is convincing enough as a soft "bad guy." Helen Mirren can play almost any role and always (still) looks beautiful to me;). I'm also a fan of her British detectives. However, they just can not save this boring movie, I'm sorry. I hope that from this director “Peter Jan Brugge” we will not get to many films anymore, because he obviously does not understand the meaning of the words “suspense and thriller”.
