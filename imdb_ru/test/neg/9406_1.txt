Another entry in the Pacino-As-Mentor subgenre. You know what the matter is: a young desperate man with a terrible flaw (in this case Matthew McConaughey, trying to start a celebrity career, holding onto the shoulders of Pacino - hey, didn’t it work for Keanu and Colin, didn’t he?) (Pacino, naturally). Young Hotshot is learning from the Father of the Figures all that is needed for a profitable, but humiliating career (this time it’s a football handicap). The father’s figure plays in “Young Hotshot” with money, prostitutes, and power, but we all know that this depressive state of affairs faces decay and despair. , that is, until the Young Hotshot finds his moral center, rejecting the Father's Figure and all or almost all that he stands for. (Obviously, Stone’s Wall Street largely sets the ground rules for the Pacino-as-Mentor subgenre.) <br /> <br /> We’re also going to take these last-day Pacino films as a parallel to reality. Again, you know the exercise: the Living-Legend actor demonstrates his undeniable superiority compared to a younger younger actor. The latter can tolerate and smile in the process, but he must admit that he will not get any of the good lines, and even more so to get the opportunity to chew on the main decorations before the junction. Now it must be said that in fact in the canon Pacino as-Mentor there are two good films: “The Scent of a Woman” and “Donnie Brasco”. In the first case, it was a show for one person, anyway; in the latter case, Pacino met his rival in the role of stealing the scene in the person of Johnny Depp. Nevertheless, these two films were serious, and not just an exercise in demonstration swimming for the sake of demonstration swimming. Pacino is damn sure that his younger film colleagues from the time of Brasco are not as charismatic as Depp. By the way, none of this speaks very well about the Actor Living Legends. Like his contemporary De Niro, Pacino spent the last 10 or 15 years resting on his laurels. “Two for Money” is the worst example, even worse than “The Devil's Advocate”, who at least had the virtues of showing nude Connie Nielsen and chronological behavior before this film. Well, that's what happens when you're crowned King, damn early, just ask Marlon Brando. Honestly, I saw too many Al Pacino films with the same plot — and the same replay with a star — to be more charitable. Did I say "none of this says well"? In fact, it is humiliating for all participants, including the paying audience. No one is going to blame Matthew McConaughey for being a Shakespearean actor, but even he doesn’t deserve the role of a second violin in this unbearable old show-off with an additional implication that he, McConaughey, never compares with Greatness It Al. <br /> <br /> I did not lose space on the plot details. If you want a quick overview, IMDb provides a quick summary, although I think I set out a rather comprehensive summary in my first paragraph. In fact, you have seen this movie before. Many times. The special environment in "Two for the Money" is a shabby world (in fact, the underworld) of sports injuries. Pacino has an office of "betting consultants," that is, middlemen between you and your bookmaker, and even hosts a show for people with disabilities on cable television, organized jointly with several of his best guys. One thing the film got was the carelessness of such shows. But, one thing that they made a mistake was the constant use of the words "gamble" and "gamble." If you have ever seen ProLine or other such shows, you will NEVER, NEVER hear Jim Feist and his colleagues say the word "gamble." They ask you to call 1-900 to get their choice. but, if you were, say, from Mars, you would not know what you should have done with these picks. “Gambling” is an F-word in sports-related television shows - strictly verbeno. <br /> <br /> You know, gambling is illegal. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10
