I found this film a big disappointment, especially considering the cast. Characters are not believable, as are the absurd circumstances in which they find themselves. The only part of the film that I liked was when the most annoying characters were finally killed. Special effects consist mainly of scenes with dead or dying bodies. Typical unimaginable click slasher. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to believe, to make it impossible to believe that a reclusive creature that sneaks up with goats in the middle of the night can be captured by a group of clumsy, noisy idiots. , despite the fact that the creature escaped capture or even photographing. <br /> <br /> The man who removes the impossible to capture the Chupacabra alive is our one-dimensional Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito). The only thing Dr. Pena is more obsessed with than being is his dart. The dart that worked was just a bullet failure. <br /> <br /> The captain of the ship (John Rhys-Davies) is presented as a “war veteran”. He uses his military skills, forcing his people to shoot at a creature, regardless of which ship they were on. Seals, which appear out of nowhere, repeat shooting all over. <br /> <br /> Dylan Neal plays an insurance investigator who was brought aboard a cruise ship to catch a thief. He spends most of the film with someone who is trying to kill the creature at the moment. <br /> <br /> The creature doesn't even closely resemble a chupacabra. It does not behave like one either. Instead of a small, shy, secretive animal that secretly hunts at night, we get the bulletproof Freddy Krueger, who kills everything in sight. A simple Google search would be very useful for authors and a special effects team.
