I know that the original "Psycho" was a classic, and it was a mistake to rework it, a ESPECIALLY offscreen remake. I think it was more or less proved by the rest of the comments here. But there are more problems with this film than with this. <br /> <br /> The first problem is color. The original film was shot in black and white, but few realize that the original was shot AFTER the color film was invented. The choice of black and white film was partly a budget issue, but it was also Hitchcock’s stylistic choice. This is not to say that the remake should have been redone in black and white, but the colors of this film are too wrong. The most dominant colors in the film are orange and green, especially on Marion, which should not be a bright character. Bright colors make it look like a happy movie, and when horrific events occur in these color schemes, it is more like a cartoon, and the public tends to laugh rather than shout. <br /> <br /> The second problem is lighting. This is a dark, dark story that needs to be accentuated by dim lighting, but this remake seemed to not only fail, but seemed to go in the opposite direction. Most of the scenes are very bright, even when it is illogical, because it is in the NIGHT! <br /> <br /> Another obvious problem is the game of Vince Vaughn. Yes, he copes with the awkwardness and insanity of Norman Bates, I do not deny him that. But there is one element in the character that he could not show: softness. The character must have some kind of deceptive friendliness, at least at first, which then disappears as soon as we become aware of the truth about him. Besides the fact that he is a character trait of Norman Bates, this is a recognized trait of the character of ALL PSYCHOPATS !!!! <br /> <br /> There are several good aspects to this movie. Some performances are great. As I said, Vince Vaughn was very close to taking a decent image of Norman Bates. Viggo Mortensen and Julian Moore were great together, and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original, which was a welcome change. Anne Heche may have been cruel, but, unlike Janet Lee, who was falsely advertised as one of the biggest stars of the film, Anne Heche received the last bill in the first credits. <br /> <br /> I read on the cover of a copy of the novel Psycho, which Gus Van Sant claimed was not a remake of Hitchcock’s film, but rather a new adaptation of the original novel. Now I want me to buy this book and keep a comment, because after watching this movie, this comment is probably the most fun thing I've ever seen. In this film there were no attempts to hide the fact that he was ripped from the original, and it would be much more plausible if Van Sant tried to tell us that he is really a three-ton monkey from the planet Zafrumalaks. So many copies were copied exactly, without any real thought about why Hitchcock created the original frame in this way. For example, a scene in which Sam and Lila talk, and their faces are completely covered in shadow. Hitchcock covered the faces of these actors in the shadows, because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so that no one could see their horrible actions, not because of any artistic or stylistic goal. <br /> <br /> In other words, my review is about as meaningless as the film itself, in which he repeats what has already been said. Like everything here, I recommend you not to waste your time on this film and get the original.
