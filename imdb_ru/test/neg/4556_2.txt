This film was so bad that it became enjoyable. If you want to see how the soap operas decided to shoot an action movie, this is for you! Reappraisal, irrelevant incidents, an implausible dialogue - all this is there. The protagonist has a split personality and cannot decide whether he is a thief, a loving father or a hero who risks his life for others. He is believable in any of these roles. This sets the standard for many other characters. The boss of a company whose building is set on fire shows the same unpredictability as his wife. And the highlight - who took the "chip" - I can not believe. I found myself laughing heartily, and for this reason I recommend you watch it.
