This is one of those innocuous and slightly captivating small films that seek to make you love them more. But, like many others, this material is not strong enough to successfully complete a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> Filing promises: three transvestites drive a bus through an Outback from Sydney to Alice Springs. They face many challenges - with homophobic locals, with the engine, with their past. <br /> <br /> The real problem is in the dialogue. Wings are good (although Pierceâ€™s persistence becomes tedious), but one-liners and epithets feel compelled where they should be thrown away by accident. Characters should not laugh at their own jokes. <br /> <br /> Scriptwriter / director Elliott also finds it necessary to chop on himself incredibly inappropriate shots of bright suits for dragging against the backdrop of bright desert, such as cheap makeup. For a film about self-confidence and about being yourself, everything in itself seems unsafe.
