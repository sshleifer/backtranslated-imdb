Being a fan of Bruce Campbell for almost two decades, I was pleased to have the opportunity to see his latest movie on the big screen with a man present. Unfortunately, The Screaming Brain Man was a disappointment in itself. <br /> <br /> Filming in Bulgaria, where the sci-fi channel is filming original films on Saturday, - “The Man with the Screaming Brain” A curious mix of the horrors of the B-movie of the 50s, a comedy with body switching, cruel vengeance in places and endured farce with a touch of romantic reconciliation. If this does not make sense, then "The Man with the Screaming Brain" also does not. Campbell plays the CEO of a pharmaceutical company who visits Bulgaria with his estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in a half-finished metro system of the former communist country. These two get along with the former KGB agent, who became a taxi driver, and all three end up meeting their death in the hands of a vengeful Gypsy. <br /> <br /> A local scientist (Stacy Kitsch) and his blunt assistant (Ted) Raymi, who developed a method that allows tissue to be transplanted without the possibility of rejection, steals bodies and places a part of the driver’s taxi driver into Campbell’s damaged skull. In addition, they place the brain of his wife in a robotic body, which they simply have at hand. <br /> <br /> Campbell escapes, with a hastily reworked skull and the voice of a taxi driver, whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his body — echoed in his head — sets out to find and kill the gypsy. (His robot wife does the same.) <br /> <br /> But first, there is an attempt to imitate Steve Martin / Lily Tomlin “All of Me”, when Campbell’s two personalities fight for dominance over dinner at a restaurant. Just as he played his own evil hand in “Evil Dead II,” Campbell knows how to make his body seem populated by more than one mind. <br /> <br /> Sometimes “Shouting” is the closest thing about Steve Martin’s “The Man with Two Brains” movie, because it also takes a silly approach to the science fiction cliches of the 50s. However, he is trying too hard to get too small a result, and this is twice as much for the half-understood Bulgarian Ted Raimi who gets too much time on the screen. (I have nothing against Raymee, he’s just better in smaller doses.) In the end, it’s not too outrageous (or ridiculous) to satisfy as a hoax, and not so serious as to enjoy as B film stylization. I was glad that Campbell had already left the show by the time he stopped, because he was afraid to say: “Gee, Bruce, it was really ... something.” <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best praise I can give as a film is that at least the images stuck to the emulsion. And it was twice as good as Alien Apocalypse.
