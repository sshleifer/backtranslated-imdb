The adaptation of the film Heart of Darkness is disappointing, both in the film and in the presentation of the classic story of Joseph Conrad. <br /> <br /> There are several small differences between the book and the film, but this is expected in any transition from book to film. Kurtz dies elsewhere; the manager does not accompany Marlowe on his journey; Kurtz's mistress spends much more time with him than in the story. The real problem is the amount of footage that is inserted into the film, but has no basis in the real story. For some reason, the director considers it necessary to “revive” several scenes by adding drama or actions that rarely have any meaning and are not always important for the story. Some examples that come to mind are Kurtz's “mistress,” kicking Marlow on the head and knocking him down. Nothing happens while he is unconscious, and Marlow has not even provoked the attack. A couple of hours pass, and he wakes up: a waste of time. Kurtz has a domestic monkey, which for some random reason kills by whim. In addition, when Marlow leaves Kurtz, he makes a “noble” decision to leave all the priceless ivory he received, for no real reason. Another drawback is the character of Kurtz. John Malkovich is a terrible choice to play the person who is called tall and inspiring: a person with a team presence. He practically whispers all his lines, which in the hands of a more capable actor could be very provocative. I can not remove the image of John Malkovich, playing a mentally retarded farmer in the film "Mice and People", when I watch how he spoiled the role of Kurtz. Overall, I would rate the movie on 3 out of 10 stars. This is a good film, if you read the book and want to watch it in the form of a film, perhaps to help you visualize the scene, but I would never recommend it as a source of entertainment.
