This film is one of the worst films of all time. I'm a little upset that this film is not on the 100th place; he deserves a seat of at least 60 or 70 on this list. This is not just a movie, I think it's bad MST3K style; it's just bad This is one of the few films that I really hate. Freddy Got Fingered falls into the same category as the bad. <br /> <br /> This story tells that a daughter (Gugino) goes to California to go to school, and comes back with Kroll (Shore) and tries to learn how to be a farmer. Then the guy tries to set up Shore so that the girl leaves Crawl and returns to him. It ends, and what remains of the audience can go. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of this film is for Pauly Shore to attack the camera and try to be funny; but I would say that he fails 100% of the time. Their terrible inaccurate and outdated view of farms and farms is insulting, and in this film it is worthless to watch. If you think to see it: do not. Once, when I watched a movie, I felt that I was watching it for 5 or 6 hours. If you have already seen this; you have my sympathy.
