I will recommend it in one way only ... it was innovative. Innovative does not mean that it is a good film, it means that it can give you an idea of ​​what you can take and implement in your own films. <br /> <br /> Simple story ... well ... simple. I got to the point that I didn’t care whether they destroyed a building or not. If I had to hear this girl’s annoying giggle again, I swear I’d throw the DVD out the window. And there is also the main character. They try to make him attractive, but he is a crazy pervert! Sniffs bra for girls, sneaks up to her when she is naked, puts a bra on her eyes when he sleeps, puts a bra on a sexy doll (which takes off her panties while he sleeps, and puts them on her doll). hmm) <br /> <br /> What annoys me even more is the crappy tone. In the DVD photo gallery, you can see how the movie looked like before they polished it and added color shade (also in digital form). The film looked much better without effect ... so they donated, being a good film just to be fanciful ... ba. I could understand using similar tricks if the quality of the film were shitty. <br /> <br /> I think most people who liked this movie just liked it, because the chick was naked for a good 5-10 minutes. It is not comparable with delicacies (as many try to do). Delicacies have characters that you can love and love ... these people just grunt and giggle. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would also like to point out that it also looked like a German impressionistic film, similar to the old silence. One of the problems of most foreign, especially feature films, is that they focus on creating artistic composition and forget about the "space" of the scene. This leads to the fact that the audience does not quite understand what is happening, because it does not understand the space around. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is rubbish. The short film on the DVD "Surprise" was much better.
