Could you people stop believing everything this man says. Get your facts right before you start praising this liar. He's not even <br /> <br /> from Flint. He just says to keep his blue collar. He is <br /> <br /> of a rich suburb near Flint. I mean, he went to a private school. <br /> <br /> His parents paid for him to go to school. Wow, it seems that <br /> <br /> they have been hit hard by Flint, going to a landfill. He was also born in Canada. Oh wait, that makes him a Canadian citizen. I wish he just moved there. Instead, he lives here in his New York apartment for $ 1 million. Here is the working class right there. I definitely can not wait for his DVD. I want him here talking about how big corporations are bad. Where do I get these DVDs? Oh, yes, at Target and Wal-Mart. The two largest corporations in America, which were also the only two stores, allowed them to sell.
