I put this movie on 4, because I'm a solid fan of the video game series. the graphics and animations are excellent and it's nice to see the whole gang in computer graphics. Sephiroth is still cool. <br /> <br /> Now, for the reasons he got only 4 points, the characters feel like wooden boards with one of the worst voices. acting skills I've ever seen (I watched an epic movie). <br /> <br /> the movie seems so cloud-oriented that even fans are embarrassed by it and the cloud. The clouds have mentioned so much that you do not want to see him in this film. <br /> <br /> The villains received an award for the worst villains of all who ever existed (I was more frightened by an evil western witch) <br /> <br /> All the other characters in this movie just fit in the film to bow Fans, and this does not mean that <br /> <br /> Rises with a cold chalok ??? <br /> Summary: I have been waiting for this film for 9 years, and this is what I get for the big senseless and boring scene, I beg the head of the square Seniks to shoot the person responsible for this recording of each copy of the film and any other person participates this creates a new film from the ashes (it would be nice to make a film live and based on the original game)
