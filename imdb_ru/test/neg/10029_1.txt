I made 3 bad films to watch with friends in my dorm room. <br /> <br /> Leprechaun 4, Jack Frost and Prey. <br /> <br /> I picked up Jack and Lep 4 because they are healthy. famous bad movies that i have never seen. <br /> <br /> I chose this film because it corresponded to the “How to find a bad film” guide on badmovies.org. There is no real description, there are no photos of the film on the back, and I have never heard of it, should have been the winner :) <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS, but this movie is so terrible that it doesn't matter: P) <br /> <br /> This is a REAL bad movie, Lep 4 and Jack Frost are stupid on purpose, this is stupid despite the best efforts of the cast and crew. <br /> <br /> This “movie” starts in many ways like the Evil Dead, even the actors look the same and have the same dressing style. Unlike the Evil Dead, it never picks up speed. For the film "Slasher" it's pretty boring, in 80 minutes 6 people are killed, but they are scattered so far that it quickly becomes boring. <br /> <br /> The director threw a lot of boring shots into animals hunting, obviously, to keep up with the whole theme of “Prey”, but they do nothing to promote the story and are pretty boring. The mountain is terrible. All these additional shots were supposed to compensate for the lack of a script and plot. <br /> <br /> The last 5 minutes of a movie are shot mostly in slow motion, which is another way to increase the duration. The "climax" is such a joke, it is difficult to laugh at it, it is so bad. On the back of the box it says: “The end is shocking and will haunt you.” Yes, this is so, it will shock you that someone can inflict such a terrible "plot twist" on the film and "chase" you, because you will not believe that you paid to watch this shit. <br /> <br /> Also the slogan "This is not a man, and he has an ax!" One person is killed with an ax in the whole film, and he is off-screen. <br /> <br /> True 1 out of 10. I love to laugh at bad movies, but this one is so bad that it lacks the courtesy quality. No bad night movie can be compared without a true movie in which characters are built: P
