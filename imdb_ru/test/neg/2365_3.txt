TNT Jackson is not completely inaccessible to watch. But either the version I saw on the DVD was edited using weeds, or the script itself is the lowest level of sausage in the mill / bluesploiting. Or maybe both. <br /> <br /> Jeanne Bell was supposed to be a game partner at some point in her career, and the film makes the most of the connection, showing her breasts at least twice as much as they really needed (including a fun scene from topless which I was sure was supposed to be funny). I admit, they are pretty cute. However, she is sort of medium-sized and has no Foxy Brown charisma, not even Cleopatra Jones. Although in the film she has moments when she is acting as an actress, but it would be nice if the director pushed her a little harder, or the script gave her a chance to do more than just show “attitude” and kick people. br /> <br /> Speaking of kicking people, fight scenes (another supposed reason to watch a movie like this one) are pretty badly done. There is no real choreography to talk about, just people posing and sticking their legs and fists in the general direction of their opponents. One minor exception is a pleasant moment with an adversary equipped with folding knives butterflies; the other is the sequence at the very end, where the obvious understudy for Bell (and, perhaps, for Stan Shaw) jumps around and does some decent sweeps and bases for a minute or two before Bell / Jackson knocks out the enemy's liver, Shaw falls and the script just stops. (Again, I recognize that this is very much the tradition of sho-brother since time immemorial). <br /> <br /> There are several actors who are actually better than the film deserves (I'm thinking of "Joe" and the guy playing the drug lord's right hand). Halfway through a decent funky soundtrack complements the action on the screen and adds a star to the rating. There is a half-dark sex scene that can be almost effective despite itself. <br /> <br /> This scene is intended exclusively for back-exploiting fans. I saw it out of pure curiosity, and I don’t regret that I took the time. But I can’t imagine that I want to find the time to see it again if I don’t decide to write a thesis about the intersection of pop culture “Kung Fu Theater” and “Foxy Brown”.
