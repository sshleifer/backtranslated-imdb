Solo - fighter about Terminator-like android, which was created and prepared for the military. When a fault is found, it is issued for deprogramming. Instead of death, he decides to escape to the jungles of Central America, where he finds refuge in the village. The military is driving him there, which leads to a large battle feast. <br /> <br /> Mario Van Peebles does a good job with Android. His movements and gestures look mechanical enough to do the work. Current scientific realism is abandoned to become a good action hero. And it works; fighting scenes are not so spectacular, but they are not so bad. The game from the other characters is pretty bad, but I did not expect anything too good. The special effects were also decent. <br /> <br /> Solo is decent, like an action movie, but very easily forgotten. He lacks the substance that most films possess. But if you just want to spend a couple of hours without much thought, it will do the job.
