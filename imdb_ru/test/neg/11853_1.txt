This film was really terrible. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is worth seeing because it features the world's most unnecessary sex scene. I mean, this went on for about 7 to 8 minutes (repeating the same “movements” over and over again), which is almost 10% of the entire movie! I did not laugh as hard as I laughed at it for a long time. <br /> <br /> In this film there were some very strange and meaningless events, but the one that I found funny was when (without For some reason) the helicopter landed and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits run into the complex closer to the end. After 2 minutes, they run out again. What the hell was that for ?? In addition, the tiny white loader, which magically turned into a huge yellow excavator, was pretty classic. I believed it was because they used footage from the Carnosaur trilogy to patch this absolute donkey. I will have to watch them now! <br /> <br /> The film is worth watching for a laugh or two, but if you do not find bad movies funny, stay away!
