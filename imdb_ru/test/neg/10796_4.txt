First of all, since I am one of those who have never seen the MST3K version of this film, I cannot comment on this. <br /> <br /> However, I REALLY saw the original version of this film. a movie on a sci-fi channel, and I thought it was as good as everything else on that channel. In fact, I thought it was one of their best deals. <br /> <br /> I noticed, looking at the comments here, that people who write in detail about SOULTAKER with a small amount of intelligence, thoughtfulness and maturity tend to at least a FEW things about this film and thatâ€™s right. In its original form, the most reasonable people, I think, would probably rate it at least 4 or 5 stars out of 10. For me, the average is five, and I think this film is about average for science fiction. <br /> <br /> Unlike the above, I also noticed that reviewers who seem immature, dull and light and, as a result, break away from where I stand are the same who cannot find anything good. In this film, this is basically rubbish for no reason, based ONLY on the fact that it split and screwed up on MST3K. Or, if they saw both cuts, it seems that they were strongly biased by viewing MST3K for a start.
