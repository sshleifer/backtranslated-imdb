I usually don’t consider turning off a movie if it’s really NOT bad. A home-grown film that I wouldn't even include. The plot is interesting, but acting and writing are too restrained. I did not care about the characters. Any film that uses narcotics and unreasonable nudity as main points is not commendable. Characters spent time climbing up and believe me, this is the only way to watch this movie.
