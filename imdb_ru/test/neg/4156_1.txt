Many times the description "full of sound and rage, meaningless" is used and is correct for the purpose. Unfortunately, "Code 46" lacks either sound or rage. A little rage would be very valuable. The character of Tim Robbins (William) is so lacking in passion that the idea of ​​his instant falling in love with Maria (Samantha Morton) seems almost absurd. These people are so impassive that one can ask whether the water supply of this future world was dispensed with torosin. The film reigns the atmosphere of the “Brave New World”, which is supported by each shooting scene with overexposure for 2-3 stops. Unfortunately, this technique becomes tedious and rather heavy on the eyes. The terrible confusion of languages ​​also becomes tiresome when there seems to be no obvious reason for its existence. Many futuristic, fantasy films are criticized for flare-up and irrelevant. There is no flash or substance in this movie. This is code 6 completely.
