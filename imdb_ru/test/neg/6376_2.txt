First of all, the name "DAILY" - FALSE. <br /> <br /> Each “Daily Show” program opens with the date of its creation on the screen, followed by a pause and announcement of the opening. For many days, when they re-launch the daily show, they look through the tape and skip the date and start with the announcement of the opening, creating a false impression that the show is new. It's a lie. There is no mention of this being relayed. And such nonsense is just a small indicator of how cunning and deceptive this show is. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is only 4 nights a week. This is not quite “daily”, that is, from Monday to Friday, another flaw, for which I am grateful. <br /> <br /> It is sad to think that many ignorant young people use this fake news program as their main, often the only, news source. This leaves them sadly ignorant and much worse - poorly misinformed. <br /> <br /> Although this is a politically left liberal left side, sometimes this show can be fun. However, its reliability is low. Facts and information are often cleverly distorted to fit authors' agendas. It is often difficult to tell where the facts end and the fiction and comedy begin. The result is pre-learned, rethought information intended for persuasion and influence. This is called PROPAGANDA. <br /> <br /> Remote interviews are far behind in editing. <br /> <br /> I really lose myself when I fight with God and Christians, which happens too often. However, you will never hear anything vaguely anti-Semitic. <br /> <br /> If John Stewart and his company attacked someone other than Christians, that would be insulting. The names in the credits explain the source.
