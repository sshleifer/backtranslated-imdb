Well, I'm a big fan and follower of Elizabeth Berkley. I bought it on DVD from my boyfriend's eBay birthday. We sat down to watch it, and it was so boring. I do not remember to laugh once. It was only for about an hour and a half, and it seemed to take forever. Elizabeth is great at this though. Maybe it's because I'm a big fan of Elizabeth Berkeley. If she had not been in this, I would not have watched it, but every time she came, my face was lit up. Unfortunately, even Elizabeth could not save this film. Only a common story and a horrible comedy make this film, which you would rather miss than spend an hour and a half of your life. This is a very forgetful movie.
