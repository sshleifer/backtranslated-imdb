This film as a whole would have received far more votes from me, and I will talk about why, but first of all it gets four stars and should remain on four stars due to the ridiculously tasteless roles of directors in rape and sexual abuse. Not far from the film, Oyama commits sexual violence against the woman he saved earlier, and although she is briefly upset because of his actions, this attitude lasts only about five minutes before loving adoration begins, and it transfers her character throughout the film. I know that many will argue that it is not so important in kung fu bit-em-ap, and as a fan of childbirth, I cannot say that this is all so unusual, but this does not prevent him from being absolutely tasteless every time I I will see. <br /> <br /> What I will say in defense of this film is that it is to look at martial arts or even a fighter of any kind who does not allow the hero to be left behind. Oyama is portrayed as a rapist and murderer; a social outcast whose only student becomes completely mentally unstable before being shot by the police. The last shots of the film leave the feeling that Oyama himself is ready for a serious breakdown and seems no longer to care about the woman he had previously attacked loving him, and has since pursued him with devotion, like a puppy. <Br /> <br /> Regardless of whether or not this was the purpose of the film, one cannot help but feel the hope that Oyama might be on the verge of suicide by the end of the film. This is a rare emotional treatment from the genre of martial arts, and itâ€™s interesting to watch a movie that leaves you feeling that its violence is not worth celebrating. If only the bullfighter karate had a better attitude to the topic of sexual abuse, creating greater emotional depth and recognition between the two characters, or leaving it all together, this film would be much more interesting.
