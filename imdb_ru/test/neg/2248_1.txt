This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this film? A group of Americans enters the Nazi-occupied France and begins to kill the Germans. You see how they scalp their enemies and beat them to death with baseball bats. Of course, joking. <br /> <br /> Some will say that this film is a parody of a certain genre. For parody, this is not witty or funny. Content is zero. This is extremely brutal and disgusting. Below him lies a subtle political message, because again the "good guys" kill the "bad Nazis." The whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it over. Could you imagine a plot in which the Nazis (joking) kill everyone in the Warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not, but this film is about this, except for the fact that it satisfies the strange moral expectations of a certain audience: to kill people is so great when they are made by the right people. <br /> <br /> This film only works because of the hidden Nazi ideology under it. He does not consider the enemy to be human. And if the latter should be an element of fun, I am happy to announce that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Another mystery - how can such violence fascinate an American? the crowd, while a bit of nudity will scare them. But if naked body is pornography, this film with all its cruelty of pure pornography is at its worst. <br /> <br /> Inglorious bastards senseless, boring and tasteless waste of time and money.
