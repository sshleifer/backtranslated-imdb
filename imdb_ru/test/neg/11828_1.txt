Ah, Animorphs. I loved the series of books and eagerly ate each of them in high school, and when I heard about the television adaptation, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> God, what was my final product. I think for me that was the moment when Nickelodeon stopped being cool programming and more general. <br /> <br /> So what happened to the show? Let me count the ways: 1. The characters were HORRIBLE WRONG. In the books, the animators were somewhere between 12-14, the television actors were at least 18. I remember being horrified when I first saw the pictures of the actors. <br /> <br /> 2. A terrible game / bad letter. I don't know who was to blame, so I fell into the lumpy mass, what it was. Perhaps it was the fact that the accelerated age of the actors interfered with humor, which, at least, is nice for the 13-year-old, because Marco is not funny. In fact, I do not remember a single comic moment from the group, and there were several. The actors, of course, did not help the letter, which was mild at its best and dizzyingly miserable at worst. <br /> <br /> 3. My lord, they were stingy with the budget. The final result of some andalites was to convince Viacom to pull out the cork ... There were crevices on their heads, which clearly indicated who the helmet was. <br /> <br /> 4. Back to the cast - Rachel, of course, was the biggest disappointment, far from being a warrior in the books, the best equivalent in the series was “scarecrow”. In addition, I know that Cassie was an idealist, but there is a difference between an “idealist” and an “idiot”. <br /> <br /> 5. One of the worst discoveries in history. Should the music be so obvious? 6. Answering question 6, “yes”, because everything else was dumbfounded, so why would not less expected less intelligent viewers get a thick, brick-like song from a rap-rap robbery or some other devil? /> <br /> Since then, there have been big disappointments (Iraq, 2004), but in case I didn’t clarify myself, this show was a shit and an abomination for a series of books from which it was to be based.
