Suburban children meet the forest. Killjoy is better in this part. He is more evil and strong. However, much of the acting is just as bad as the first. Sometimes characters tell each other things that are both meaningless and unconvincing. I made a mistake to watch this sober. You will probably like it more if you donâ€™t ;-). If you have not stopped loving clowns after the first film, you will definitely want to after the second one too ..... ;-) <br /> <br /> Problem children and their observers go to a camp in the forest, And what a coincidence, their car broke down right in the middle of the forest and ..... at night? It is just their luck. They find a house, and one of them was shot, one of the observers is left behind (why I do not know), and the rest eventually find another house. There is a voodoo priestess living in this house ..... but she is not responsible for Killjoy's resurrection. Who is this then? Well, you better watch the movie and find out for yourself ....
