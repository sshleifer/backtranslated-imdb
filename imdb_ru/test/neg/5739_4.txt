This turned out to be a rare case of poliziottesco, made with British funding; Unfortunately, the result is unremarkable (except for its extreme trouble and the approach of the border camp), despite the stars and the director. The first is run by wooden Franco Nero and ultra-Hummer Telly Savalas as a pair of potential robbers (if someone can believe any of the actors who usually emit a cool spirit as a duet of clumsy rogues, he is more trusting than me!). <br /> <br /> Their "work" goes awry (ends with murder and is burdened with boxes with cutlery instead of precious stones!) ?? however, inappropriate criminals see a way out of their dilemma when they inadvertently “kidnap” the son of a British diplomat (erroneous Lester, who even gets hit on the happy trigger Sawalas, where he hurts at one point). However, they never redeem him, and their sole intention is to cross the border with France; Nero's girlfriend is following them (Eli Galleani wasted): soon enough, but she has enough, and she decides to run away while the others are sleeping; Crazy Savalas notices this and, following the girl, kills her. Meanwhile, Nero and Lester woke up ?? The former thinks that his accomplices transported him twice, so he goes on the run with the boy in tow; after a brief spell in the country estate of a rich old woman (in which Nero and Leicester give the rear nude rear parts for free!), Savalas catches up with them. They continue their journey where the trio encounters a family of German tourists: is the situation degenerating to such an extent that Savalas closes them in his trailer and throws the plot into the river ?? although he himself suffered greatly in the process; as a rule, everything ends up being killed by “heavyweights” as soon as they are about to reach the border. <br /> <br /> So the film contains most of the typical elements of the genre ?? untidiness, sadism, violence, car chases (the consequences of an initial robbery, when a fleeing car causes chaos in the narrow streets of the city and even breaks the funeral procession, just a farce), etc. One slightly interesting aspect of this is that, after all, does Leicester himself appear to be definitely (irrevocably?) marked by experience ?? feel the excitement when an act of violence is committed.
