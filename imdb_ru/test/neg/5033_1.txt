I turned it off for the first five minutes. It is very painful and disturbing, the moment when I turned it off was when a beautiful white horse was allowed into the slaughterhouse, and its skull was pierced with a small tubular instrument. This creature lay on the floor in a state of shock before it died. The narrator said that the animal dies instantly, it is not. I disagree with graphic realism towards animals, insects, or any living thing. I was very disappointed since I just watched Eyes Without a Face, it was a brilliant film, and this short film was attached, which spoiled my night â€” because I couldn't hurt a fly, let alone watch wild documentary. /> <br /> While reading the other reviews on this page, I noticed that they used words like aesthetics - this is not art or beauty. I can imagine that the documentary will be very clear and deep, but not aesthetic.
