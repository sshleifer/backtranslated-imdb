The film "Formula" about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilean, who will inherit a fortune, he is involved in the affairs of the bad guys and in love with a beautiful woman lawyer (Vargas) This is very similar to a television film, not very exciting. The only reason I bothered to see this was because Valentina Vargas was in it. There are no real surprises here, although it's nice to see Vargas. Chilean landscapes look great, but the role of Malcolm McDowell is very small and adds little to the film. Michael Ironside, as usual, plays the bad guy, but this is not one of his most memorable parts. Chase scenes are standard fare.
