The fact that this film was distributed free of charge in a single national newspaper that didn’t bother me was somewhat distracting me from watching, but since I came across a copy that the local charity store distributes for free. I felt I could watch it with a clear conscience. <br /> <br /> The film does have its own moments, the memory of the place on Thameside is beautifully done, but I feel that I suffer from several too many mistakes. First, Vinnie Jones is simply unconvincing as a journalist. While Winnie himself is an interesting character, the truth is that he simply does not have the opportunity to play a role like this one. <br /> <br /> Secondly, who will take with them the lost manuscript, which they were told was “priceless”? It seemed that everywhere, wherever Mr. Jones was, this manuscript went with him! Thirdly, the whole aspect of Dickens, although it seems important, hinders what could be an interesting film about corruption in the highest circles. Maybe I’m just a little fat, but I really couldn’t understand the meaning of Dickens’s “story in story” style. It added nothing to the film and only confused things when things became interesting in the modern storyline. <br /> <br /> The only praise I will give to filmmakers is that, at least, they tried something a little different. I'm all for British independent films that are trying to be “out of left field,” but this is not “Red Road” or “This is England.” That it is a bit of a mess, and too long in it. Yes, it is partly entertaining, but in the end I felt that the two films merged into one, and both failed. (In addition, I can't help but think that I saw something similar that was recently made on TV by Ian Banks in Edinburgh with the story of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes).
