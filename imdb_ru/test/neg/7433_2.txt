I always liked Bill Murray in films such as Lost Translation, and the trailer for this movie looked very good, but the result was very disappointing. Mostly Murray plays Jack Corcorin, who recently learned that his father is dead, and he should hear his will. He learns that his father was a clown, because he left a big shoe, his squeaky nose and his main legacy, an elephant! The only way Jack can get rid of this elephant is to travel 4,000 miles in four days and give it to a safe zoo for $ 30,000. Also starring Pat Hingle as Vernon. There are tiny tiny moments of humor, such as tilting the truck in front and Murray’s screaming, but overall it’s pointless. Pretty poor!
