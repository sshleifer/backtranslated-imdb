I am a long-time fan of the original of this film (Bella Martha / Most often Martha), and everything that makes this film magnificent and enjoyable is missing from this. I miss the slow tempo, the character set and their style in small gestures, the dominance of lights and moods and movements in the dialogue. I don't think the story itself is enough. Martha / Kate are more solitary, and Mario / Nick is not a clown. In most cases, things that make one scene gorgeous in the original do not work in its copy here. Small changes relieve stress. My opinion is that you should go and see the original. This will cost the inconvenience of subtitles.
