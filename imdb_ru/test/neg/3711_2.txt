With this film, itâ€™s hard to find something worthy of praise. This is not the worst picture ever made, but it does not say much. The plot is rather incoherent and unbelievable; it seems that the producers wanted to make a space film, but decided to do it underwater in order to capitalize on the success of The Abyss. In some scenes, it seems that the story really was originally devoted to the cosmos; The submarine has a chassis, technicians are worried about breaking the rubber wetsuit at a depth of several kilometers, when the pressure crushes the diver and the suit, like an empty beer can. <br /> <br /> The film begins well, with a plan to restore the lost naval submarine. After that, the film is immersed with Siren 2. <br /> <br /> The effects are so-so. Navigation screens are all made on Commodore 64 (remember, this is 1990, not 1983), the submarine is controlled like no other submarine; instead of control panels, officers have keyboards with which they enter sequences of long numbers to control various ship functions. The interior of the ship is not too convincing. <br /> <br /> The final scenes go from awkward to absurd. Welcome to the fifties, you can check that you do not believe in disbelief. <br /> <br /> I see no pleasure factor here. The film is neither good nor ridiculously bad in the style of MST3k (until you get to the final scene), it's like eating a little bad apple.
