What was I thinking when I rented this one? What did the distributor think when he copied the tape and sent it to Holland? What did someone really want to see this crap? ***? <br /> <br /> We are talking about astronauts who fall into the trouble of outer space (the memory of Apollo 13, but not even in the shadow of this beautiful film), and they want to go home. If you are filming such a film, you should be glad that you will leave the Earth as far as possible! <br /> <br /> This film wants to ride a small wave of space films in 1998 (Deep Beat and Armageddon), and this one falls through everywhere. A deep blow and Armageddon were not perfect either (far from it), but at least they were worth seeing once (and maybe one more time when we are all old). They gave a little fun. Max Q no. It gives annoyance. OK OK. This is a television film, but does it mean that you are allowed to come up with such a mess? <br /> <br /> If you are not suffocated from your own vomiting to the end (from all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue), you must have been bored to death because of this waste of time. <br /> <br /> In the end, when the space shuttle lands, the worst will come ... No, I can't spoil 'this one (IMDb guidelines forbid it). So you have to see for yourself. NOT! DON'T SEE THIS (excuse me), but rent a movie that is worth renting (for example, Battlefield Earth ... just kidding!) <br /> <br /> Probably the worst I've ever seen.
