This film is a lot like the Cannibal Holocaust. If it were not for the useless killing of animals in the name of "shock" ("Oh, look at us, we are hardcore, we would add real death to our films"), these films would fall into my dusty classic of the regiment - I am a big fan of films of cannibals and zombies. But in fact, this is another example of how a shock of horror grabbed the last straws of a heap in a desperate desire to make a bad film cause more excitement. To summarize, a sharp flip of blood with limited circulation. A 70's blood fan should try this, but anyone with modern ethics and tastes should choose something a little better written for their popcorn festival.
