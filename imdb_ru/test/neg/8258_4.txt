In the Red Letters, Coyote is the whirlwind of a college professor who writes to a prison woman and gets more than he expected. There are two reasons to watch this film ... Kinski is one and Piven is another, although their sparks are difficult to shine in such a complete directorial catastrophe. With "Red Letters", everything is not so ... convoluted, lousy script, camera, editing and, above all, acting, which is not quite suitable for Coyote, etc. not worth the time
