The worst thing about this film is that it should not have been so terrible. <br /> <br /> They had a good budget, although many films; they made him look smooth and beautiful, and, best of all, they had a savvy lesbian audience from the 21st century who would take a lesbian positive film ... and yet the writer and director tried their best to raise every slightly reworked film about Lesbian torment and confusion in boarding schools, (you know, the place where all lesbian love lives and dies). <br /> <br /> This is a topic that was made again and again and AGAIN in the film, but it seems to the audience that if someone uses this voting forum as a hint, there’s not enough. <br /> <br /> Each element of this story was so excessive, excessively false and contrived, that it was painful to look through our fingers. The main characters say everything: a crazy, abandoned, brilliant, brutal rebel lesbian girl (well, they took a very pretty lady like Piper Perabo and tried to torment her, but it didn't stick) seducing a pretty rich girl who was destined to betray her. <br /> <br /> At every step, a character 3 is watching them, sluggish, good-natured, with wide eyes, an observer of a good girl. I say “every step” because she shares all her thoughts with the audience through the toughest, most senseless monologues. <br /> <br /> It seems that her lines were written by a fifteen-year-old girl, although they try to sound so hard to sound like a fifteen-year-old boy, well, you know, well ... talk. “Hearing them (making love) with their noises was um, you know, well, well ... well!” She talks about her two meaningless roommates who ride on the bed next to her. <br /> <br /> She later asks Graham Green - an experienced Native American actor who is completely lost in the role of gardener (!) "Is it wrong to take care of what people think?" <br /> <br /> Sorry, but she is a teenager, or she is 7 years old? <br /> <br /> Of course, Piper Perabo (like Polly, tortured) dyke and others do well with the terrible lines that they have to pronounce. Perabo has a good level of energy and is obviously very comfortable in front of the camera. She would have succeeded in a decent project, so this is by no means a criticism of acting. <br /> <br /> But this story is shameless in that it perpetuates all the stereotypes about lesbians, united in one character. They could not dwell on the fact that she (Polly) was an evil, insanely passionate, secret genius who had completed mathematical tasks for a silent teacher. Yes, but that is after she argues with a teacher who dares to accuse her of “chatter”. <br /> <br /> "This is the word that THEY (men) use against the USA (women)!" she says, stamping out of class. <br /> <br /> Is this EVERYTHING a writer could invent? Or maybe we should ask: why stop there? <br /> <br /> Poole & Co. he continued and made Polly a poetic dark child who communicates with wild hawks, shouting their name in the forest. <br /> <br /> Prompt slow motion, science fiction, Xena's atmosphere! <br /> <br /> Then we write her mother ... (most lesbians are orphans suffering from love, in case you were in the dark). <br /> <br /> Then we have two teachers (one alarmed, one crazy) with loose ties who hover around the whole action (the school looks terribly big for only 2 teachers) ... and cast the child’s dark looks seductress / bird girls. Hmmm Interestingly, something is good, you know ... there is a funny fun between these TWO TEACHERS ?????? <br /> <br /> There is no simple excuse for the fact that this is badly done. Suffering happens, but undoubtedly the writer and director know that lesbians exist in much more sophisticated times than this moron. <br /> <br /> I can’t reveal the end out of respect for those who force themselves to sit until the end, but if you don’t laugh, I can only guess that you are crying. And not for the right reason. And I do not mean dull scenes.
