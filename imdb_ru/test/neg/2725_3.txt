The Vindicator opens with an unforgettable monkey scene in a cage attacking a bursting little toy robot as part of a scientific experiment. This occasional rape sold it for me, and I am pleased to report that the rest of the Vindicator had a real feast with cheese. <br /> <br /> Vindicator talks about a scientist (David McIlvright) who was nearly killed by an explosion in his laboratory, whose tattered remains were placed in an experimental suit / armor. For some incomprehensible reason, he is equipped with an activator of the reaction to rage, a device built into his brain that will turn him into a killer if he makes physical contact with any other person. They give some stupid explanation about how this is a necessary defense mechanism, but I don’t see any logic in installing such a device if you don’t want a frantic cyborg killing machine. This is especially funny when it is indicated that the suit that Carl wears is actually an experimental spacesuit. What is the possible need for an astronaut to turn into an incredible Hulk during a mission? He, as expected, breaks out of the laboratory and begins to fight the cunning scientists who put a suit on him, along with the ninja killer Hunter, played by Pam Greer (no, really). <br /> <br /> Avenger herself looks like a pretty damn stupid. This is basically a man in a twisted gold foil costume. He also has a constantly bewildered look that doesn’t inspire fear or even compassion. I think you can't blame him for this, most people watching a movie will have the same look on their faces. <br /> <br /> The scene with the actors is very bad: “I’m not sure that the character’s emotions or thoughts are that at this moment I’ll pick up the phone and spit out my dialogue in a casual tone, trying not to look at the acting school of the camera . The actor playing a frightened black scientist even struggles with this latter part. <br /> <br /> It was after this first accidental death that the Zastavschik was persecuting scientists. Oddly enough, the whole activator of the reaction to rage "touch me and I will kill you" does not play such a big role, as you would expect from Carl, pursuing his former colleges in a rather detached manner. There was one scene where he pretty brutally kills some street punks who are pushing him. I know that for street teams it’s appropriate to randomly attack the main characters of eighties films, but surely one of them must have realized that it could be a bad idea to attack an awkward cyborg guy, even if he looks like a retarded cousin C3PO. Since they don’t even seem surprised to see a disfigured golden cyborg walking down the street, as if it was a daily occurrence for them. The only time this activator of the reaction to rage appears in the film is when old Karl cannot hug his wife. When Hunter tries to turn it against him, throwing it into himself to make him kill, he casually notices that he has reprogrammed himself (off-screen, of course) to prevent this from happening. They might not mention the Rage Response Activator activator and just tell the story of revenge, and that would not matter much for the film. <br /> <br /> There is an amusing sequence in the sewer: Greer and her henchmen hunt down the vindicator. Because of his armored hide, they are all armed with a weapon that shoots "evaporating acid." For some strange reason, when this weapon shoots, it is represented on the screen with cartoon red lines that extend towards their targets ala Ghostbusters. Retribution resists by pulling the gas pipe out of the wall and burning all of Greer's thugs in a huge strip of flame that goes outside. The resulting fireball is so huge and strong that it comes out of sewers from a man’s hatch and explodes a van, which is occupied by several scientists. It is rather strange that Greer runs away, rushing into deep water an inch, despite the fact that she was closest to the Vindicator. This is one of several fake fire explosions throughout the entire film, including the death of a fanatical black scientist, when the redeemer sends his van off a cliff. (This is after they captured the "Avenger", seriously catching him in a giant piece of gello-no). <br /> <br /> There is also one disturbing and long and inappropriate sequence in which an overweight, traitorous friend of Karl, who looks like a poor man's Ned Beatty, shows his passion for Karl’s wife and tries to rape her. It lasts about 5-10 minutes and is full of alarming shots of a guy slapping his wife's face, spinning over her and trying to pull off her dress. This is at least strange, and it seems that he is really out of order with most of the rest of the film, which is kind of cartoonish and more than life in its cruelty. <br /> <br /> The film finale includes Retribution, battling a whole bunch of other guys in battle suits. For some reason, all these other guys are less cool than Carl, some of them are sent by his wife simply because they have a protruding tube on their side. Fortunately for Carl, the suit he is wearing is devoid of this crucial design flaw. The only really memorable piece by the end is Greer's death. Doing what I had never seen a villain do in a movie before, in the middle of her confrontation with Defender, she decides that she really has no chance against him, and, in fact, pulls out her own brain with his gun.
