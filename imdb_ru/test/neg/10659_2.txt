The pace of this film is rather slow. Katy’s trip to China takes about 70 minutes (which, as we know, she will do) and 30 minutes to wrap everything up. The storyline is so predictable that you know everything in about 5 minutes. Nothing surprises you. I assume that the film is a film about coming of age, but the film is full of stereotypes that are completely unbearable: <br /> <br /> Katie is a beauty that understands what it looks like, boys and shopping is not all. She understands that she can "feel" and "see the real world." Touch. <br /> <br /> A mother is a strong, nervous, screaming mother (very innovative) that a strong man needs to take care of. <br /> <br /> The father is patient and always understanding and takes care of the incapable woman. <br /> <br /> The guy who wants to get only in her pants. <br /> <br /> A Chinese clown comedian who does not know how to speak English properly and made a mockery. The Hollywood thought dropped these characters in the mid-50s. <br /> <br /> A nurse, who sometimes knows everything how to do in China, at the next moment is an exact replica of the mother, that is, the woman who cannot cope with the situation or knows something. <br /> <br /> Deformed Chinese woman, who with the help of us, westerns, gets help and becomes a beautiful girl. Because in China (the third world country according to the film) there is nothing and, therefore, we need our charity. Gah, wake up and feel the smell of being grabbed. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is poverty in China, but the idea of ​​help from western countries (read the USA) is so superficial and happy that the end of sad and disgusting Shanghai (where the film is going) is the most expanding and developing city in the world at the moment. <br /> <br /> The Chinese father has such a good and kind heart that in the end he has one desire ... be a cowboy with a white hat ... <br /> <br /> Teacher (Sean Astin) , which has this really amazing story (not), which he tells without feelings. Why sean? WHY!? <br /> <br />, etc. It is difficult to find a “real” person in the entire film. <br /> <br /> This is nothing like a good movie for Americans younger than age 15. If you want to learn something about the world, see, for example, Hotel Rwanda instead. For a better story about life or coming of age, I suggest you watch the Italian “Cinema Paradiso”, which received an award for the best foreign film academy a few years ago. <br /> <br /> The only nice thing about the film is the small cityscapes that truly capture some (not all) of the beautiful Chinese countryside. I was there and saw some of them.
