Ring! Ring! If you were a hot line of horror directors, how can we help you? Mm ?? Yes ?? Pronto! I mean hello my name is rugge ?? uh, call me on my initials rd Well, Mr. RD, what's the problem? Well, the reviews about my last film "Dial: Help" were negative and harsh, and, to be honest, I myself feel that my career was going through better times. Well, Mr. RD, and why do you think that is the case? Well, I gained fame and well-deserved cult status thanks to my scandalous and shocking film about wild cannibal tribes devouring the film crew, and another about ruthless thugs terrorizing rich people in the house on the edge of the park, for which I borrowed the idea from Wes Craven, but "Dial: Help" rotates on ?? uh ?? Nevermind! No, no, Mr. RD, go ahead and tell me what the film is about. Hmm, this is a spiritually obsessed phone line that pursues the sex model and kills the people around it. Oh, I see. This premise does sound a bit silly and not as overwhelming as cannibals or rapists, but I suppose there are deeper themes in your film, right? Oh yes, of course ?? What do you mean by that? Well, isn't the symbolism of the telephone line for another kind of terror? Or maybe it all happens in your heroine's mind? No no ?? Itâ€™s about the phone going crazy and killing people with cord, vibration, electricity, or even ordinary coins. Interestingly, Mr. RD, but how do you explain to the viewer all these supernatural things at the end of the film? You see, I thought that a slowly unfolding story about a phone puzzle would not be so important or relevant, so I just concentrated on handling all the possible phone tricks I could think of. Phone tricks? What do you have in mind? You know, like the wind blowing through the horn, the piercing tones of a set and the turntables ejection into the air! Very original, Mr. RD, but not entirely horrible, and as an experienced director you should know that, in the end, people expect a sensible clarification of all these events. Oh, but there is! All this is connected with negative and unrevealed energy, if I remember correctly! It's all a bit unclear, I admit. Hm ?? Understand. Oh, well, as they always say, a good movie is based on more elements than just a story. Have you at least handled some of your usual trademarks in the film so that your fans at least recognize your style? I did my best! The Lord knows that I tried, but murder and bloodshed are just not shocking anyone! Sorry, Mr. RD, what about sex? Everyone likes that in their horror films there is slovenliness and nudity, and you yourself said that the film is about the sexual model in danger! Yes, but ?? But what, Mr. RD? Well, frankly, we advertised "Dial: Help" as an erotic thriller with Charlotte Lewis exposing shots on the cover, but in fact there is no sex in the film, and Charlotte even refused to go topless. Mr RD! Now I am very disappointed, it just shamelessly tears people off and lures them with false promises! I know, I know, and I am ashamed, but I just wanted everyone to rent Dial: Help and love it! Well, in conclusion, I can console you by saying that every major director is entitled to several erroneous decisions that will not affect his / her career immediately, but next time be more careful and do a little research first, well, Mr. P .D.? I will; thank you! You are welcome. Tell me, do you have any ideas for future films? Yes, as a fact, I do! I was thinking about making Giallo with a killer washing machine! Doesn't that sound fascinating? Hello? Hello?
