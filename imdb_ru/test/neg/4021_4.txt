I saw about half a dozen low-cost poor B westerns that Ken Maynard made in the 1930s, and I am always amazed how poor he was of an actor. How could he become a leading cowboy actor? It is said that he could very well ride in silence, but he does not do anything particularly impressive in these later sound films. Nevertheless, perhaps he got the lead because he was big and could drive. <br /> <br /> The Ghost Rancher is not as bad as some of the other Ken Maynard films I've seen, but it's still not so much. Some of the other characters call him a “young guy” a couple of times, where it seems to me that he is as old as other older actors. <br /> <br /> And if this is not stupid enough, this film is quite a serious problem with the script. At some point, one of the characters makes a remark about how the ghost prevented the well from being poisoned, which has not yet happened. In a couple of minutes we will see this particular scene. No, it was not a memory. At first I thought that maybe when Treeline Films did a DVD transfer, they could turn over two drums. But in those days the films contained about 11 minutes of the film, and the whole process of the coup took only 3 or 4 minutes. Everything else was in a logical order. Thus, it appears that this was a real problem of continuity in the original film. Maybe this is one of the reasons why Colony Pictures didn't last very long.
