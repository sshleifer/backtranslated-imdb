Four guys (jacks) go to the restaurant business with the fifth guy and lose their common sense. They allow themselves to be mistreated worse than textile workers at the turn of the century, just without leaving the situation. This is truly one of the worst films I've ever seen. I just hope that I can resell this item to someone who might like it. <br /> <br /> It is true that it holds your attention if you can let illogical plot events not bother you too much However, it is very stupid, especially when a stranger enters the restaurant. Who is he? Guess. <br /> <br />
