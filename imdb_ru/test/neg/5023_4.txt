Honestly, the popularity of this show makes me sad. Inuyasha, of course, is not scary - he has a few good moments, an occasional flash of clever humor and, unlike many anime, dignity. However, it completely lacks the basic elements of a worthwhile story. From the very beginning, his premise is doomed to be stereotypical. The main plot is centered around the collection of gem shards before they can be possessed by evil, and, as one might suppose, is a completely general epic science fiction novel. This story follows the familiar pattern of dealing with various enemies for pieces of a precious stone, and therefore it is quite predictable, it lacks complexity and it is easy to lose interest in it. But, as many animes show, a bad premise can be saved by deep realistic characters. Unfortunately, no one saves the story of Inuyashi. Kagome, the main character, is a stereotypical anime character (and too reminiscent of Akane, the main character of the previous work by the author of the original comic book Ranma 1/2); she is friendly to other women, but applies to many men, especially her love interest, with unjust, shameless, unjustified cruelty. Inuyasha is tough looking, but sweet on the inside, and Miroku is a sad "pervert" character. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages continue with what happens to this plot and these characters - namely, nothing. Despite constant action, the story does not progress. Despite regular romantic moments, no major relationship. Despite enough time, the characters never change. And to add cherry to the ice cream of mediocrity, all this stagnation stretched for about 150 episodes. <br /> <br /> My last criticism of this anime is animation. Although this, of course, is not ugly, it demonstrates an almost disrespectful laziness on the part of the creators. The animators seem to rejoice at the long scenes in which Inuyasha jumps through the air with the whistle of the wind, in which they have little left to do but move the background. <br /> <br /> In short, with all the wonderful animations of the world he has his fingertips on the keyboard, there is absolutely no reason to watch Inuyasha.
