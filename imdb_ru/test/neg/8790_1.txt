This film was obscenely obvious and predictable. Scenes were poorly written and acted even worse. After the horrible scenes, there was a horrible script filled with meaningless and ill thought through lines. I would never offer this film to those who make sense to watch decent films. This film was not only with the same ideas as the Bachelor and the Hen Night show, but also contained many parts in which you could know what the next move and scenario would be without even watching the movie before. The casting was fine, but the actors played characters there terribly with more drama than they should have used, and said that you need to quickly change the channel. As a note, please do not watch this movie.
