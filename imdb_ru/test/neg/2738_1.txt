The screenplay of this film is indistinguishable from others, especially from “The Core”, another bad movie. It's clear why Luke Perry doesn't get a lot of work, but to see his favorite lieutenant commander Worth (Michael Dorn) put up with something like that is just sad. <br /> <br /> I really can't think of one twist of the plot that is not visible a mile away. This is not an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> The special effects are very bad, even by television standards. The lava flow at the beginning of the film, signaling the impending global catastrophe, begins at a very amateur level. And from this moment it does not get better.
