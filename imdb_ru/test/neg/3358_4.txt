Below the average action / melodrama in which sweet Mrs. Greer looks into the eyes that comes to the aid of her father (Rudi Challenger) and his partner (Austin Stoker from the original "Assault on Precinct 13"), whose credit business is threatened. <br /> <br /> I will be frank - I agree with several other user comments on this movie. Sheba, Baby has a less than satisfactory scenario, a direction that is not particularly prominent, fighting scenes that are at best moderately interesting, and one of the more indescribable roles supporting Miss Greer (although there is an important supporting role for D'Urville) Martin, also a familiar name in Blaxpoitation). I have the feeling that this ordinary film may have been compiled quickly, just to capitalize on its huge popularity then. <br /> <br /> Of course it was great to see Stoker again, although Mrs. Greer doesn’t have a role — or a dialogue — as she has in other films, although she does what she does best and plays cheeky, sexy sister with a mission of revenge. <br /> <br /> A relentless soul / funky soundtrack is at least enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Mostly recommended for those who want to see everything in the repertoire of the film Pam Greer. <br /> <br /> 4/10
