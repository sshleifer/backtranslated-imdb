I can not believe that this film gets the rating, which he is here on IMDb. Of course, I came to the conclusion that IMDb is somewhat useless to actually find out whether a movie is good or not, since 99% of films are rated from 6 to 7. This is the conclusion and failure of crowdsourcing on the Internet. For this purpose, on average, most people are taken, and, unfortunately, most people are just inclined to light entertainment and have a good time. But I digress. Film. I really do not want to spend my time writing about it. Let's just say, I discovered that it was created specifically for two groups of people, young adolescents, at an age when insurgents of any kind just fall into a dead end, and gothic types who just love to strangle any gothic fantasy about vampires that they can get into arms. If you are not in one of these categories, you will find this film absurd. I really enjoyed the first Underworld. It was fresh at the time and had some sharp quality. The second one was a bit of a trial plot, but sometimes I liked directing and cinematography. But this whole movie was like a science fiction channel or even a TV series. I found the actors redirected. Their body language turned into unnatural idealistic postures that seemed contrived. The lines were spat out, as young actors would spit out the lines of Shakespeare, reveling in their own egoistic glory, being in such a role, but at the same time grossly hammering in the role. The plot was dry and predictable from the start. I found that I wanted things to just “move forward”, as it was very easy to say what was going to happen. At first I tried to take care, but my brain was forced to turn off. By the end of the climax, I actually caught myself falling asleep. There were so many conflicting parts that did not make sense, so it’s not even worth listing them all. If you are a teenager with acne or chronic goth, then be sure to keep it. For the rest of us, forget about it, as I am going to do right now.
