Sometimes, when I hear that the casting list will come together for 2 hours in a film, I hope and pray that this is good, not for my 10 bucks or 2 hours, but for these actors. career. In the case of “Be Cool”, everything went in vain. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, John Travolta (aka Chile-Palmer) and music director performed by James Woods ride in the car, talking about the continuation of the film, and most are not good. If you look at the fact that this scene was filmed in the same way that Quentin Tarrantino filmed his car scene in “Pulp Fiction” and listen to a dialogue that cannot but help, consider whether this is 1) a statement of refusal from the audience, that the film will suck, or 2) an attempt to make the audience laugh at the sheer humor of two people talking about the continuation in the continuation. Oh, the irony! (If you are interested, choice 1 is correct.) The cool and cunning Chili Palmer from the first and good movie “Get Shorty” was revived to play in the music business of professionals. He steals a young hot singer (Christina Milian) from her Jewish manager (Vince Vaughn) from her ghetto and turns her into a singing sensation. Of course, a film about a former gangster cannot be complete without new gangsters causing chaos. This time, their favorite mobsters are Russians, played by American actors who cannot behave in Russian if my whole family hit them on the head with their bare Russian hands. <br /> <br /> As a Russian, I wasn’t so much offended by the way the Russians are depicted in this film, but instead, as a writer, I was more offended by the terrible dialogue. This film tried too hard to make the audience laugh. This turned potentially good lines into redundancy. Russian, black and funny jokes were the same, only paraphrased a couple of hundred times. After he named the character Rock af ***** (he plays gay bodyguard Vince Vaughn) and the character Cedric Entertainer ***** (he played a black rapper with an environment that threatens those who don't play it marks with weapons) I wanted to get out of the cinema because it was painful to sit. If it was “Get Shorty,” none of this would even need to be shot in a film to create a drama, or really laugh badly. <br /> <br /> What was missing in this film, which was not in the movie “Get Shorty” was hot, spicy attitude of Chile. He is a completely different person in this sequel. First, the old chili would have more dialogue. John Travolta doesn’t have more than 20 speech lines in “Be Cool”, because he plays out from repeated lines and from one hundred and two episodic episodes of the most casual celebrities. I won’t spoil the shock, exposing all the cameos for those who actually plan to watch this movie (PLEASE, NOT !!!), but I will say that I will always be surprised that these people announced to be in a film of such insanity. <br /> <br /> Even more stupid was a very unconvincing dance with Travolta and Uma Thurman (she plays widower James Woods, who LAKILI killed in the first 10 minutes of the film), Tarrantino never created “Criminal Fiction "for such an idiot as the director of" Be cool "to mess with him. This dance number was boring, long and just pulsating. Playing Black Eyed Peas in a 10-person club didn't make the scene memorable. <br /> <br /> There were so many holes in the plot that I left the theater, asking myself WHY ?! Everything about this movie was a big question. I just did not understand. I could not even explain to you why the Russians were chasing after all or why this film was shot because I was confused. All I took from this film is that everyone in Los Angeles has an assistant, and the only way this film was probably funded was through all the advertising on Diet Coke, Yahoo !, Honda Insight Hybrid, T- Mobile, Trimspa (even the representative in the film itself) and the Bad Writers Guild. Holes in the plot, stupid dialogue, too many random cameos, a terrible game (even professionals) and a not very exciting attempt to imitate Pulp Fiction make this movie the worst movie of 2005, and this is only the third month of the year.
