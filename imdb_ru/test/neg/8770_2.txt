... do not waste time viewing this conceited project. My comment was deleted twice for reasons that I still have to understand, except for the suspicion that someone related to "Gone" is not happy with what I had to say. So, this time I brought the matter down to trifles with an excerpt from my original comments, which in no way can be perceived as a personal attack on anyone or as an unfair comment: <br /> <br /> "" Gone "- it is a kind of train wreck that gives new meaning to the words. A terrible, unnatural dialogue, a scenario that simply flutters like a fish out of water, acting that would embarrass the most egocentric of public theatrical divas, cinematography ADR, special visual effects that are not there, pedestrian music that does not fully support either mood or emotion, terrible editing with completely meaningless freezing and fading, no artistic ru manners, which could be talked about - the litany of evil just goes on and on ... I felt sincerely deceived because of the time it took me to rewind forward most of the time ... time that could have been better spent time, staring at the wall ... Under no circumstances should anyone be lucky enough that they themselves read this topic in this “film”, because long before it is over, they will want to be “delighted” before they made this mistake. ” <br /> <br /> Case closed. Amen.
