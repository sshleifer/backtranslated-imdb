This seventh (yes, you read it right - seventh) film “Master of Dolls” shows how a crazy group of dolls appeared; French puppeteer, who uses them to take revenge on a group of ancient mummies who pursue him as soon as they learn that he holds the secret of life. He was taught this by the sorcerer, who was also on the run, before his death. He used this power to revive normal puppets. This sequel is basically nonsense, sprinkled with even more nonsense, like most of the Puppet Master sequels. Because of the PG13 rating, we don't even get any funny puppet killings. If you think about it, there are no damned puppet murders. If there was one franchise that needed to be cut off, it would be this one. No more .... God, please, no more ...
