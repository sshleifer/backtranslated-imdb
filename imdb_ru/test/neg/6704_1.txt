First of all, I’m gay, although I don’t live my life in the so-called “Community”, and because of these films, gay movies are not my favorite genre, because 90% of them are crap. Like this. If I could give it a zero, I would. (I do not understand all the positive comments, unless they were made by the people who made this film) I actually stopped it at the 24-minute mark, when the so-called “Anthony” kissed Adam near the restaurant for no reason at all. And how does a son steal from a diner, if he doesn't even live in the city? Bank transfers? The acting was awesome! Sound editing? (Listen to “Anthony” and Adam when they sit on the fence and have lunch. Every time the camera switches between two so-called actors, the sound changes as if there was no filter on the microphone) Do not shoot seriously, or God forbid, buy this film. Awful Awful Awful and just stupid plot.
