Just finished watching this movie. I could not imagine that I was watching this on VHS, because there were scenes where I needed subtitles to hear the accent or sound effect, even if the scene itself was in English. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is quite attractive. Several CG effects were very obvious inserts, but the effects of prosthetics / creation were not bad. Not perfect, but photography and editing (which were pretty good) did a lot. In general, the acting was bad, although I can not say how much you can blame the director, who had never seen the actors before. The exception, I think, was M. Gomez (Usya). She stole every scene in which she participated, and not only because of a very beautiful face, but in her performance there was something like an urgency that none of the others had. The letter could have been much better - the plot was still unmistakably Lovecraft, and many details of Lovecraft were written in it, but personally I could do without most of the dialogue.
