I am a music lover and was excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I was ready to go halfway through the movie. I did not identify with any of the characters, which meant that I didn’t care what happened to them, and I completely lost interest in the story. On the good side, Ed Harris looked exactly like Beethoven, and the 9th symphony is always good to hear, so that part of the film became tolerable. In addition, the parts where they talk about the bridge almost bought out the entire film, but this could not hold me to the end. The actors did what they could with what they had to work with, but the script simply did not fit to make it even remotely interesting. A little about “wash me” was a complete rubbish. I wonder how many actors needed to be done for this (I could not have said these lines without bursting out laughter). In any case, such a shame, it could be much better.
