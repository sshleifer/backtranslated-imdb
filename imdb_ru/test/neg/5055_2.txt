I heard that this movie was bad? They even warned me that it was terrible, but for some reason (probably Katie Holmes) I was still watching him when he was on national television. Watching movies by Kevin Williamson means torturing! His scenarios are not funny, definitely not scary and not quite creative. Mrs. Tingle’s training breathes the same annoying atmosphere as his brainless TV series “Dawson Creek”, and is probably intended for the same target group. Even before the credits began, 5 people already wanted to embrace and said that the terrible "I love you." It doesn’t get better, because the soundtrack is filled with annoying pop / rock, and the storyline is very thin. Three students on the verge of leaving school were caught cheating by the worst teacher in the school. Do you know, every school has such a teacher? To save their skin, they try to convince Mrs. Tingle that they were not going to cheat, but this attempt is terribly wrong. The typical high school humor is completely lost to me, an overdose of feelings is pathetic, and the action (with the exception of Helen Mirren) is disgusting. I'm sure Katie Holmes can act ?? Is this a fact confirmed by her role in "Dar" ?? but she urgently needs to stop accepting useless female roles. As mentioned earlier, the only positive reviews come to the brilliant caste of Helen Mirren as obstinate. It's like Kathleen Turner in The Serial Mom! The role fits her perfectly, and you can't imagine someone else playing her. In addition, this is teenage nonsense, which can be avoided.
