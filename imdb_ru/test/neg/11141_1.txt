This is absolute nonsense, created in order to shock and inspire the mindset of the 60s. Acting is completely wooden, consisting mainly of advertising, which leads to the fact that actors who do not meet the standard, begin to repeat the first thing that they can think about. <br /> <br /> The end result is a poorly written piece that is read by people who have no idea and do not care. The only exception is the main character, Joe (played by Joe Dullesandro), who spends most of the film in a numb daze (either in stone or in the only one who can play!). Please don’t think I don’t "understand" Warhol - it’s just and just a starter who should never have left the cinema class.
