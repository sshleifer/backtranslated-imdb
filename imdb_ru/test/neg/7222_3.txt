Riggs and Merto returned, but the magic of the first film broke up. The storyline is just awful! I mean, South African diplomats are smuggling in myths to the United States. It just hurts! And accents are absolutely pitiable! No one can get a South African focus on Afrikaans right? Or will we forever hear how the British or Americans make them sound like drunken Dutch? The only guy who got the right emphasis on Afrikaans was Tim Robbins in Catch A Fire. Another thing I didn't like about this movie was when Danny Glover so recklessly described the African accent as crappy! I mean slap Afrikaans. There is also enough hypocrisy in this movie to throw me out. I mean, the character of Mel Gibson is the same as that of diplomats, but then he sleeps with his PA type of! Do not waste your time watching this trash of an unexamined movie. If you want to watch a movie that does not offend a cultural group, rent Die Hard 2.
