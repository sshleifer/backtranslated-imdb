I HATE FILMS WHICH ARE END, HOW IT, HOW IT !!!!!! <br /> <br /> This 16-millimeter catastrophe is full of clichés, stereotypical characters, a common, complete “plot” and terrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this “Film” we have an Aggressive Black Guy, Girlfriend of Black Guys, Blonde Bitch, Possible Lesbian “hacker chick”, Pedophile teacher ... Bla, Bla, Bla .... And then Pumpkin Man. <br /> <br /> "Do you think someone goes too far behind the legend?" This question is asked near the end of the film. Scream 2 is too far-reaching. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ***** I usually don’t fall into spoilers, but I have to rant .... <br /> <br /> Sleep? It was all a dream !!!!! This is the easiest way to finish a movie. "I don’t know how to explain all this, and we don’t have any more money ... Let's make it all a dream." This must have been thought by the director / producer / actor / guy from FX. Yes, the director is Mr. E.’s character. He did almost everything in this trash movie. This is such a good ending ... And what a director, well, so he did all the abductions! What does this have to do with the film? Of course, blacks are killed, a bitchy girl is killed, a teacher is killed, who has had sexual harassment with students in the past (he is the main suspect) .... YuK YuK YuK !!! This film made me burn in my heart. <br /> <br /> Senseless, meaningless, made with parents Visa and Mastercards (which means that it probably still pays off), this film is dull, boring and just stupid. ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the loans. The way they submitted the names, etc., at the beginning and at the end. It had an eerie feeling for it. It is a pity that the film did not hit! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
