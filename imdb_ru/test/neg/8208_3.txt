This film is trying to be more than it is. First, the game is terrible. You have to overcome the incredibly poor delivery of lines and terrible emotion. The plot is quite interesting. There is a shipwreck (obviously, because it was made of thread and cork), and a couple of guys are on the shore. If it wasnâ€™t bad enough, then some guy named Comte de Sade lives there too. He lives in fear of pirates and is crazy. In any case, he has a big slave, a young woman and a few dogs. There is another woman who does not speak, and his wife, who is leper. In any case, everything becomes bad, as these people have to deal with this crazy business. He is arrogant and loves to pose and deliver lines. The rest of the film is about escaping. This has an ironic ending, which I will not disclose, and it kind of saves the film. I would not worry about you.
