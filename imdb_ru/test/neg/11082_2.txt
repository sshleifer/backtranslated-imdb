The Cavern: 2 of 10: Blair Witch meets The Cave and I have a headache. <br /> <br /> I have something to ask all film schools if you could teach future directors how to hold a camera properly. Turning the camera around like Aunt Betty with 12 drinks causes a headache. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film is, first of all, the directors of the visual environment, who may want to direct their cameras in the general direction of action. The film also requires light to work. Perhaps you should use a light source so that you can see the effect on the screen. I know this is a cave film, but absolutely nothing to be afraid of watching black tar for a few minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> In this regard, showing a movie upside down does not mean confusion on the screen, it indicates a confusion in the editing booth. <br /> <br /> Last note for the director. I'm sure there was a good reason to have a terribly fake CGI fire. I honestly can not think about it. <br /> <br /> Now about the screenwriter. Try to make at least one character enjoyable. I would prefer two or more, but one decent person can help me, for whom I can be sick or caring. Also, if you have memories, make them relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> If you have an unexpected ending, it’s best if it doesn’t contradict every thing that precedes it. And try adding a few quaint terms to the cave film. Perhaps you wanted to start with "speleking". <br /> <br /> “The Cave” is a rather bad film, poorly filmed with a confusing, incredible and anti-climatic ending.
