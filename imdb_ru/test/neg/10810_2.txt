Well, I saw this movie at Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I did see this movie, so I decided to leave a comment on it. I just once again like how Joe gets stuck with disgusting roles, while his brother and nephew only get Oscar winning left and right. Soultaker is technically what you would call a movie that was supposed to be a good one. It seems that the director and the actors took this film very seriously and had very funny effects, a story that had no special meaning, not to mention rather coarse acting skills. This is one of my favorite episodes of MST3K, simple, because a lot of what they mention is what we think about throughout the film, and I will explain why in a moment. <br /> <br /> Natalie and Zack are a couple who broke up and are now trying to think things over. But since Zack is in the upper class, and Natalie is in the middle class, it just won't work. But on the way home, he and his friends are in a car accident, and now the angel of death / Soultaker is chasing them to fulfill his share of the soul. But it also seems that he had some other vital relationship with Natalie and he just could not move on. So now Natalie and Zach must fight against the constantly emerging five million times a minute to save their souls and lives. <br /> <br /> Well, I believe that Zeppelin was wrong when he sang that there is a ladder to heaven, I wonder if Black Sabbith was right, lol. In fact, there are many holes in these films in the plot, as if no one sees the characters and cannot be killed, but somehow they can still press the buttons and open the doors? The Angel of Death had a very strange face, and it was a little distracting from the story itself. Soultaker was just a lousy movie that was hasty and made you feel so bad about Joe, the underrated brother Shin / Estoves. <br /> <br /> 2/10
