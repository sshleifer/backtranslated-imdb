Incredibly disappointed. The pace was slow. The characters are incredible, and throughout the film as a whole, I feel bored and dissatisfied. There was no real story that could make you revolve around the movie and interest you. The robbery itself never caused any excitement and did not look very good, although it did not pass through it. <br /> <br /> There was not enough depth or background for any character, and I was looking forward to the character of Lawrence Fishburne, unfortunately, Lawrence is not The idea how to play a gangster brata and is very preferable as a pleasant character. Short Columbus, one of my favorite actors (stomping in the yard), let me down with his performance, his character was grim, and you could hardly understand what caused his reasoning. <br /> <br /> The only character who, I think, suggested something the film was Milo Ventimiglia (Peter Petrelli in Heroes). Although his character is rather small and insignificant, I think his touch was added to a boring movie. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, buy a DVD if you want to find a new way to waste your time.
