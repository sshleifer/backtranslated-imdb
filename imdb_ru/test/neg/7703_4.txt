Let me first say that I am a big fan of Abbie Hoffman and read “Steal This Book” and “Steal This Urine Analysis”. I'm also an even bigger fan of Jerry Rubin. But his film was a disgusting pile of rubbish that made a very original version of Abby Hoffman. The director did not dare to make Abby Hoffman interesting in this film. They called Stu Albert a fantastic cartoon character, devoid of intelligence, who was a professor at Berkeley for the Christmas holidays. Well, they did a terrible role for Anita Hoffman, they did a terrible role for Jerry Rubin’s character. I just assume that the film does not correspond to the news I saw about Abby or the books he wrote. The film just did not fit and upset me. Oh yeah, and this is the worst voice I've ever heard of Richard Nixon. This is one of the few films that I have ever shot, but I could not sit through until the end, because I have a passion for Abby Hoffman and his unhappy squad Yippies, and this film was simply poorly made. And it hurt me that now that people are watching a movie about gypsies, they will see a terrible adaptation and will not get a true sense of reality. Instead, they get Hollywood shit shawls. <br /> <br />
