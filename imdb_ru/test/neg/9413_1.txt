I am usually a big fan of Pacino (Scarfeis, Serpico, Devils' advocate), but since the appearance of the smell of a woman he largely plays the same role and shouts a lot. There were no cute characters in this movie to keep warm. Brandon, played by Bongo McConaughey, is the least handsome of this group. He was nowhere close to real man. Pacino was hopelessly unlikely, and, my God, how old is Rene Russo? The only bright light of this wretched mess was a hot prostitute with perfect lipstick, and she has only 10 lines. Even the usually reliable Jeremy Piven was completely incredible. <br /> <br /> A note for filmmakers, they usually do not work if only one of the main characters is at least a bit cute (a noticeable exception is Scarface). When the film closes and old Brandon is at the airport, I only thought that the plane would fall to the airport and kill Brandon.
