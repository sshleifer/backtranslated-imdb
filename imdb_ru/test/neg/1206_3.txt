No need to check the logic. There's nothing here. But on the other hand, there are MANY really great movies that completely lack logic, so why bother? <br /> <br /> I like and do not like this movie. I like it, because the sequence of actions in the air is really great, you can see a lot of fights with dogs. I also like the F-16, this is a very cool aircraft. <br /> <br /> But too many stupid things to make me really enjoy them. I believe that it is dishonest to wish for some kind of continuity, as it is difficult to make a really good fighter film, but I also think that there must be some sense of reason. <br /> <br /> And I have a question: do they fly from California to the Middle East on an F-16 without refueling? I would like this to happen.
