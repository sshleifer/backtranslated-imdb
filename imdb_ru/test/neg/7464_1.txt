Linda Lovelace was the victim of the sadistic hater Chuck Trainor. I do not understand how sex with a dog (as well as animal abuse) may seem funny or amusing. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was forced to make these films. I know that some people will criticize this comment, but I firmly believe that films of this type kindle a fire of hatred and even more misogynistic feelings towards women. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects, not people. We call ourselves "civilized," but I feel that we have a long way to go before we can scratch the surface of civilization.
