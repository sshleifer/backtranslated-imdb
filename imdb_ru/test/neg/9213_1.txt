Why I did not like the film, except for the obvious disgrace of the actors themselves, that someone might believe such nonsense. <br /> <br /> First of all, the Second Coming of Christ will be at the end of words, and when Jesus Christ comes on the Day of Judgment, he will not come, as He did before, in human form. He will come in all His Glory as God, and we will be judged not only for our sins, but also for the consequences of our actions. All will be! Secondly, I saw the eternal gay pride illustrated in this film with all the indisputable "I read the Bible last night, and it is not written anywhere." Well it is. Moses quotes 3 different occasions that men who make love to other men, or women who make love to each other, as if men and wife should be killed because they never inherit the kingdom of God because they are dirty! If we really followed the biblical word for word, there would be a penalty now, wouldnâ€™t it? But I think that misinforming people does more harm than it would be ... It was in the Old Testament. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of crazy people in psychiatric wards who consider themselves the Son of God, but to make a film after it really makes you think about how many idiots a film can make.
