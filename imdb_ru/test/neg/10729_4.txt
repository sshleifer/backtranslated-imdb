Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey, Tea Leoni) find themselves on the unemployment line when the corporation Dick works for turns out to be in a corruption scandal, and after a desperate and unsuccessful attempt to find a job, the duo turn to crime to get it out of poverty. <br /> <br /> I have always been a fan of Jim Carrey. It has been a while since he starred in a comedy. The last was Bruce Almighty, which was pretty good. He proved that he can do serious dramas, but comedy is his real element. Fun with Dick and Jane proves he still has it. Although the film was funny, it was still disappointing. It was not as funny as I thought. It’s worth seeing once, although, unlike most Kerry films, it doesn’t have a good repetition. Part of the problem is the script. I was surprised that the script was weak, as this is the same guy who made the “Forty Year Old Maid”. Some of the jokes just fail, and sometimes they seem to be trying too hard. If Jim Carrey was not in it, the film would have been much worse. <br /> <br /> Next to Jim Carrey is Tea Leoni. She is a good actress, but she is not very funny. She doesn't fit very well with Kerry, and she seems to have called in her talk. They had to go with someone else. The cast includes Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins and Aaron Michael Jenkins. The latter is played by Billy Harper, and he actually gives a decent performance. He was not as annoying as most child stars. Alec Baldwin was fine, and Richard Jenkins tried too hard to be funny. To be honest, I'm here a bit biased. The film as a whole was rather average, but I liked it more because of Jim Carrey's performance. Jim Carrey fans will love it, but that's it. After all, Fun with Dick and Jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes, but it's not very memorable. Rating 6/10
