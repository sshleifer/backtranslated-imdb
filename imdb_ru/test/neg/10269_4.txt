Typically thought-out production of HBO with a first-class cast, rich atmosphere of a small town and several beautiful narrative vignettes adorned with above-average production figures. <br /> <br /> But, and this is a huge “but”, various plots, inhabited by some pleasant, mostly annoying caricatures, thin as paper and walk and stretch in boring pieces for more than three long hours. <br /> <br /> Often a stupid story oscillates between a melodrama, not having fun. Enough and personal drama, not at all being deep. <br /> <br /> Shame, because some scenes really shine. Two or three, that is. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 dirty Paul Newmans
