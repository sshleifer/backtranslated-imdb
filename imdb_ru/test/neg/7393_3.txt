Well, they sent it on TV from midnight to 2 am - it seems the time has come to watch it, and then go to bed ... <br /> <br /> No, in fact it didn’t liven up my expectations. I think the Dogma concept is good because the film gets closer to what really happens between the characters involved, when you remove all the unnecessary effects and mood-creating music. But again, this concept requires some interesting actions between the characters. <br /> <br /> I cannot say that I know King Lear very well (the version of Shakespeare), if I knew the play, I would probably be able to predict much of the film. <br /> <br /> Well, a crisis can bring the best and worst sides of a character on display - and we certainly see some bad sides. Oh yes, the paint of civilization and culture can be very thin, and behind this paint you can find an animal. <br /> <br /> If you compare it with “Italiensk for begyndere” (Italian for beginners) or “Mifunes sidste sang” (last Mifune song), you see the same thing, but the opposite: a crisis can certainly make people look at their lives more constructively. And if you dare, you can win. <br /> <br /> When the film ended, I thought: “Oh, that’s why I haven’t seen it before ...” The film has its own beauty, the quality of the work of the operator, actors, etc. Good. But the script may need something more. The plot may not hurt.
