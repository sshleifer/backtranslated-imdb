I expected this movie to be terribly awful. Like "What dreams may come" or "The Truman Show" or something like that. Well, they sold him for Â£ 3.99 at my local HMV, and he had Giovanni Ribisi on the cover. and I was sure it would be rubbish. Perhaps this is the only reason I could watch this film, because my standards have never been so high.
