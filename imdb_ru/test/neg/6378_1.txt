Comedy works best when it is related to the truth. But even in this case, it takes some effort to joke that everyone likes, and even the most irritable viewers can smile. When I look at the Daily Show, I see the whole thing “it's funny because it's true,” but I don’t see the effort and often I don’t see if they are funny or just try to make a point (I notice it in mainly in interview segments). The daily show began as a parody of the news, by definition they made fun of how the media reproduced their own news, pretending to be inept and dumb reporters and news hosts, and they took up tons of questions from science to the cinema, and sometimes from politics, and then from john. Stuart came ... and everything went to hell. The first years of John Stewart’s reign were perhaps golden, although it was so funny, but then 2004 came, and from that moment you start to notice a huge chance in the show. The humor of the show is outdated, Colbert is gone, Steve Carell is gone, many of the best presenters have remained, and now it’s mostly about John Stewart, and the series has turned from a parody into a half-serious news show, in fact, Evening News, but with some gags here and there . For those who have not seen the show and cannot understand what to watch on cable, I will give you a brief description of what the show is about (at least until 2009): - Bush, Cheney and all Republicans (if it happens, that they hold an opinion shared by democrats as well) stupid, evil, corrupt and hypocritical, all those who adhere to conservative convictions are also evil, corrupt and hypocritical; - people who doubt the artificial theory of global warming are angry and stupid; -vote Democrat; There I saved you 25 minutes of your time, go see something else. At first I thought that the producers had stolen the show for their personal political goals, but when I actually see the interview, it becomes quite clear what I am talking about (which I mentioned above), but I will come back to this in a moment. First, the humor in The Daily Show, according to John Stewart, expects you to find the random footage quoted by Bush, Cheney, or the occasional Republican with humor, because it's good because. John sets up a joke, setting it in the writers specific context, and expects a random quote to somehow create a zest. So, if you do not “understand” the context, it is completely useless as an acceptable humor. In addition, the Daily Show expects you to laugh when they show the montage of one politician, the speaker, and in another separate video something else, inserting again into the context that the writers expect from you, and thus doing so funny why? Well, because John said so. Now imagine that the Daily Show uses this formula countless times over the course of several weeks every week, and you will begin to understand what used to be a happy holiday, which now represents 25 minutes of just a silent look (yes, even in black Lewis) At first, a lot of effort was put into these jokes, but now this is much less obvious. And the interview has the strangest sense of prejudice I've ever seen. John Stewart calls Bill O'Reilly the bully, but what does that make him when he craps up to every single actor and democrat (John Kerry earlier, Obama today), who appears on the show and looks down on respected Republicans and experienced conservative journalists? such as Bill Kristol's own Weekly Standard? He puts them in some kind of people's tribunal, as if they were accused of a crime, often any person in the series who favors Bush is portrayed as nonsense, as if this person is not related to reality and assumes that he speaks for most of America This is the de facto approach to any conservative, unless they share this point of view with the Democrats, if so, then this is an endless holiday of love. But still, it doesn’t matter, in John’s eyes, you’ve already made a mistake before you entered the show, and you’re still wrong after the words. This kind of treatment you get if you are something remotely right. Now you have to wonder what relation this may have to humor. I wonder what will happen if the Democrats win the White House ...
