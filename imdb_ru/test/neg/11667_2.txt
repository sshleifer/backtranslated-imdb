I originally wrote a sarcastic, disgusting comment about this pathetic piece of manure, but every time I presented a review, I received "it contains a very long word that is not allowed," also words that were not written with errors were rated incorrect . <br /> <br /> Now the word that has been evaluated for too long has not been identified. After numerous attempts to exclude words, I had a lurking suspicion that the IMDb site is politically sensitive and is set to automatically reject certain words. Nothing I wrote was in itself indecent or racist. But after deleting all the longest words, the same message was repeated over and over, and the words that were not evaluated as typos suddenly became erroneous! <br /> <br /> Police PC everywhere
