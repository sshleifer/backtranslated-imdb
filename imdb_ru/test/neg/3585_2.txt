Egads. <br /> <br /> I used to think that Keann Reeves was the worst actor in Hollywood. I'm not sure anymore, Willie fiercely competes with Kinna in his film “I'm Made of Plaster” <br /> <br /> Combine this with the fact that there is practically no plot, and not just one pretty character, and it’s quite difficult to recommend this turkey. <br /> <br /> Natasha is trying her best, but even Julia Roberts cannot save this film from suspense. <br /> <br /> Avoid this if it is already too late and there is nothing more. - Oh, damn it, in that case just read the book.
