I really like Harrison Ford, so I readily rented this film just to be disappointed every minute. Mr Ford seemed to be walking through very warm water in search of a place to urinate. His colleague was very good and had the best features. This story intrigued me, but the mistake — a BIG MISTAKE — because everyone identifies with a driver's license or passport before they board any American commercial aircraft, left me many questions about the plot. <br /> <br /> I could care less about these people. In fact, the plot of the interior investigation was more interesting than two lovers killed during a first class flight to Miami. <br /> <br /> I’m disappointed with the director Sydney Pollack, who gave us the classic Tootsie and other films. It is a waste of time and energy.
