Poisonous avenger ... <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this film is that a person whom the ordinary population would call this person more free, and then, being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste, mutated into a superhero who completely disfigured sounded normal even for 1985. This film is listed as horror ... I even read about the cult following this series .... <br /> <br /> Now this film was even given when it was “Made” was so bad that I could not stop watching ... the game is terrible even for an independent film, which, I think, was to become part of a horror movie ... <br /> <br /> Drug trafficking, sumo, Godzilla entrance .... I am all for films that promote anti-drugs ... damn, I even like Godzilla and a good sumo ... I'm not into that, but even now I think that sumo will love heights to slap the movie 1000 ru to and ground salt in the eyes of the people who made this film ... <br /> <br /> Personally, I’m almost ready to write to the film company that did this and ask for them in about 87 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> For me, 1 out of 10 is too high, it’s too bad that there is not a single (zero) or even negative integer number that can be put into a movie. <br /> In other words, this film is JUNK ...... it would be better to see how the paint dries and cope with explosive diarrhea, and then you will have to watch this film someday again ... I was would be the first person to use not only the packaging of this film as kindling, but I would like a good movie and script.
