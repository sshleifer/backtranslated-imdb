This film transforms the facts of the life of Anna and Mary into something unrecognizable. To make Mary Boleyn, who was actually a rather dim and stupid creature, and make her “good” sister just stupid. In fact, it was Ann who was a much more interesting character, and that is why her life, and not Mary, is so often told. <br /> <br /> In response to the previous review, I fail to see how Anna’s life was so “criminal” ... for me Henry was the real culprit. Whatever Anna’s motives for winning the king and abandoning her attachments, in order to get the crown and husband, it is necessary to take into account the time when these real events took place. Anne, compared to most of the courtiers at the time, was a relatively innocent figure. Most modern historians ignore or disprove most of the myths and slander that this film perpetuates in it, and I have never heard of anyone who really believes the rumors, which she slept with her brother. This film is so sensational and fake that it goes crazy with the idea that someone, not knowing anything about this historical period, can leave, believing everything that this film has presented as a “fact”. <br /> <br /> I won "I don’t even get into a strange movie shooting ... but I’m sure that the cameras were not invented in the 16th century, so I don’t understand why Ann and Mary talk to one of them for of the whole film ... this is a really bad plot plot, which, to put it mildly, is annoying and annoying. <br /> <br /> Ann from Thousand Days is also not accurate, but infinitely more interesting and at least approaching the story of one of the most intriguing women in history. Don't even think about renting it ... it's two hours you never get back!
