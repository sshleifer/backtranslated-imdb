A supposed documentary that attempts to explore the science fiction films of the 1950s and how they touched (and re-reflected) America. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott and James Cameron give interviews, and Mark Hamill says. <br /> <br /> Pretty awful. The “ideas” presented are not new, for example, the “cold war” and the threat of nuclear war have affected a whole generation of children. Well-Spirit! They are trying to cover all the different subgenres of science fiction films of the 1950s - films with big mistakes, invaders from space films, etc. This is good, but they choose the most obvious films and analyze them too much to death. already. It was cool to watch clips from “Rocketship XM”, “Destination Moon”, “Forbidden Planet”, “The Thing” and “Day when the Earth Has Stopped”, but everything the directors said was so incredibly obvious to any viewer that this offensively. Despite the fact that it took less than an hour, I was bored for 30 minutes. This gives 2 for some clips, but nothing else.
