I think Walter Pijon was badly mistaken in this film. Just not believable in the role. Barbara Eden was beautiful and played her part well. No one was unforgettable at all. <br /> <br /> I remember how the show came out of this movie when I was a little kid. I even think that I had a plastic "view of the sea" that would sink into the water and was perfect for playing in the bathroom. A long time ago. <br /> <br /> As for the other criticism I read for this film: it is certainly unfair to judge special effects or scientific knowledge 4 decades ago by today's standards. The effects were fine in 1961. Not very, but good. As for science, it was funny even for 1961. No excuse. In addition, the sub was terribly roomy. I understand that the Navy refused any assistance in this film at all, so perhaps the filmmakers simply did not know. <br /> <br /> In general, I was tired of the film. (And I'm a science fiction fan.) I can't recommend it. Rating: D-
