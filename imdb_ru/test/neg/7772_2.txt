Lazy writing, bad play and wood staging lead us to a 2005 Canadian production of a TV movie called HUSH, which should not be confused with eight other films of the same name. Tori Spelling and her hubby doctor move from SanFran to his small hometown where they run into his old boyfriend who decides that she still loves him. She will become pregnant from Tori's baby (do not ask) and will start knocking down anyone who can stop her from when she plans to reunite with her old flame. It is not worth mentioning the actors playing an old friend and the doctor, since they act more flatly than flatly. Tori is not much better, but at least itâ€™s worth focusing on, because the plot twists here and there before coming to a very unconvincing and too familiar conclusion. Take a look instead, HAND WHICH ROCKET.
