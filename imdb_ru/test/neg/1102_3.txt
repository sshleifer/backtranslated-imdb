I cannot believe that I allowed myself to do this favor in this film, which my friends ask me at the beginning of this April 14, 2007. This film is certainly a pain in the ass in the theater and painfully boring, I did not even feel the bloody blow from his “frightening scenes”, which I consider to be a complete inability to attract my audience. The worst even trampled on me, because my girlfriend did not come to the theater on time, because she was busy helping her boyfriend in finding the right lodge to stay for one night. I was not very disappointed with this question, but this film is really important for me, a bad plot, a useless plot, naively created, and I don’t know what to say more. <br /> <br /> The name does not match. In any case, I do not suppose that creeps and horrors could not convince us, the audience, perhaps beating animals could cause more creeps if they showed it in cinemas in a real situational game. . Good luck to all who try to see it.
