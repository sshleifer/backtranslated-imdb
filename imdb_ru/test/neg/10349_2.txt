I tried to watch it twice, although I could not go through any of the episodes. For me, in principle, this is simply not funny. I can tell where I should laugh, but I can't. I have never seen the original, so I do not compare. I also love comedies, including comedies like “Married ... With Children and Family,” but this show is just not for me. The jokes are lame and flat, and the game is mostly annoying. The commercials made it look interesting, but it is not. They try too hard to be different, and try to force humor. This style usually does not work too well. I don't think this show ends the season. Of course, I could be wrong.
