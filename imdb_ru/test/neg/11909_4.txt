It is assumed that the premise of this film is that the departure of generations during World War II in America with its fanaticism in the form of apple pie and hypocritical morality was a terrible tragedy. These horrible hippies seem to have spoiled everything. <br /> <br /> What holds the film together are great performances, especially Lemmon, which are really wonderful. Otherwise, we have a boring drama about life (just over 24 hours from Jackâ€™s life) with complaints. <br /> <br /> I found it to be hard work to sit down.
