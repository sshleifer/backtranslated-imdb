This is close to the worst movie I've ever seen. The writer starts you so that you stand on the side of Jasper (Josh Hartnett). When he did absolutely nothing wrong, Sam (Lily Sobieski) leaves him behind Kelly (Chris Klein), so that you are angry at Sam. You don't let in what she feels, so her feelings for Kelly are not real to you, and their relationship is fake. It pulls you in any direction, and it becomes quite tiresome and annoying. The only good thing in this film that I've seen is the actors. <br /> <br />
