Hard sell: British playwright Ronald Harwood turns his autobiographical drama into a loud, loud film about the Shakespearean theater troupe of World War II, dotted with an elderly, noisy, brilliant, but unreliable star at the end of his leash. The active assistant of the actor is working hard to have his master combed and dressed in the play “King Lear” (during an air raid!), But both men lose control of their situation. Based on the passing years of actor Donald Wulfit, whose chest of drawers was Ronald Harwood, this famous performance seemed to be a welcome paradise for those who like to chew landscapes. Unfortunately, Albert Finney (at this point in his career is not at all elderly) seems too strong and quick-witted to play an actor; Finney (and Oscar-nominated director Peter Yeats) cannot modulate Sir's moods and connectivity episodes so that it makes sense to us, so in one scene he stops the train with a commanding echo of his voice, and in the next he falls curiously. With such a death, a person in the process of deteriorating health and abilities, it can be assumed that a dedicated assistant will make a lot of efforts to protect his boss (and his future), but servant Tom Courtney pushes badgers and encourages Finney to bear rather than rest. Courtney, who played this role on stage (and was nominated for an Oscar with Finney for the best male role), is much better tuned to his role, and as a result his bleating teams and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film. These two, fortunately, do not peck at each other’s heads, and screenwriter Harwood is careful not to fall into a pattern of love hate (which can be perceived in the first act of the film); but without a comparison of the servant and the celebrity in this portrait there is nothing to watch, except for the deterioration of narcissism, a hint of what was once. * 1/2 of ****
