During the 1990s, several attempts were made to revive the old Matsumoto series. Yoshinobu Nishizaki tried to revive the old saga about Yamato in the form of the ridiculously bad Yamato 2520, which was completely abandoned after two episodes. Captain Harlock survived the tangled and meaningless Saga of Harlok, while the Galaxy Express 999 transferred this hack from a movie made under his name. <br /> <br /> If you saw The Queen of the Millenniums, you will remember that it was a wonderful film in its own way. Maetel Legend is trying to talk about the continuation of this already completed chapter, and also finds a way to suck it. <br /> <br /> This film covers all the annoying aspects of a universal science fiction film, mixed with poorly melodrama, keeping up, and to add insult to injury, throws in some of the most famous characters from the Matsumoto universe. <br /> <br /> The only redemptive aspect of this film is good artwork, but the rest is so surprisingly bad that this film cannot save you from total loss. <br /> <br /> If you like Queen Millennia or the Galaxy Express, do yourself a favor and skip this movie. You will thank me.
