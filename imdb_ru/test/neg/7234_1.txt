Greetings, Moviegoers! Watching Octopus II, I reflect on his inherent limp in the horror genre of Octopus / Crocodile / Dinosaur. Many moviegoers can blame a bad game, a meaningless script, or a poorly composed plot as reasons that cause OCD to hesitate. These reasons may indeed be difficult, but this is precisely the difficulty in shooting an OCD film that lies at the heart of lameness. <br /> <br /> You see, technology does not yet exist to make realistic, full-size OCD and CGI technology currently used in studios do not have the ability to seamlessly fit into the real environment and characters. Even with the help of smart cinema, you can only shoot the semi-dark depths of a sea / semi-dark forest / semi-dark cave / semi-dark corridor so many times that a science fiction fan bothers the genre completely (OCD subgenre, that is). <br /> <br /> What can you do, you ask? I would not advise to take the genre smoothly, but you need to explore a different path. We cannot truly return to the time of the “black disappearance” when someone was killed. Or can we? If we cannot achieve the goal of realism, we must compensate for this in other ways, such as plot twists, insinuations and ingenuity in photography. <br /> <br /> These will be inventive and alternative methods that lameness disease, so common in the OCD sub-genre, will be cured.
