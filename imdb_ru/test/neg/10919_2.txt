I write this 10 minutes before the end of the film. Now I feel comfortable when I write this, because, unfortunately, I know exactly how this movie will end. <br /> <br /> The idea is quite simple: a mad dog at large in a small town kills people. Excellent - simple plot for the terrible fun camp of the 80s. <br /> <br /> Uh .. no. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that it is based on the book (Stephen King), and you can tell me that this should not really be adapted for the film, at least not with the same plot. What for? Because it's boring! The first 45 minutes try to give depth to their main characters and create tension. However, it lasts too long (half the film!) - the characters are unlikely, and we still never care about them, and it just creates zero uncertainty. The easiest movie (in terms of plot and time) is to compare this with it with classic jaws. All that Jaws does is right, Cujo does wrong. Jaws have created good characters and a genuine sense of fear. Kuj does neither. Jaws effectively create a scary, creepy villain in his shark. Cujo has a dirty St. Bernard, growling and jumping, and nothing more. Jaws are exciting and unpredictable. Kuj—ë is a tireless drift that remains predictable to the very end. <br /> <br /> Also confusing are the many plots that simply act as boring red herring for the main plot of the film. <br /> <br /> If this film was rewritten for a big screen, and he had the best director, it could be good. But it is not. It was a waste of 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> People here say that this is one of the best adaptations of King - sorry, you were not mistaken. The fog is a hundred times better, the Solvent is 10 times better, and even the one with cats is twice as good! This is in my opinion one of the worst! The only good thing was that the action scenes with the dog looked real, even if they were boring. <br /> <br /> Movies are over, and not better. Avoid.
