An unintentionally funny early melodrama with Kay Francis as the Countess Balakireff stalking everyone in her pants. At the beginning of the film, she "throws away" the groom because he is too young before heading to the chauffeur! The high-quality English set in which it moves is such a banal bunch of hummoffers that it is ridiculous. But the topper is Basil Rathbone, like an Italian violinist with Chico Marx accent! "My violet! How can I play Eet again!" "Patricia, I have a cold head!" It is not polite.
