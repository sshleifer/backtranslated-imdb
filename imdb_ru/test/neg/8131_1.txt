I involuntarily fell into this “trap” of the film. <br /> <br /> If I could turn back the clock or just get a refund, I would be happy. <br /> <br /> It was at 7:30 pm and the Cinderella Man didn’t start until 10pm, so I rushed to the theater to catch a movie that started at 7:20 pm ... and I dare say that God stretched out his hand (or removed it) and allowed me to punish myself for my film gluttony, watching this film. <br /> <br /> It may be unfair to criticize a film that was not aimed at my heterosexual male cohort, but there is no excuse for lousy sound and video editing. This film was at best a decent budget for high school students ... and I think I saw better in these games of French shorts that we used to do with Louis Lalup. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is because I'm Canadian, and this film was for the film crew of Los Angeles and their sympathizers. Woe was me when I realized that then the entire audience, with the exception of me, got mad at all the jokes and participants ... I completely understood the hint of humor ... but I just could not tell. <br /> <br /> This show did show me how supposedly gay people meet and build relationships. However, even if it was their goal in the film, I feel that “Gayness” was focused on too much ... humanity seemed to be lacking ... but, again, perhaps this was the point ... just be avant-garde ... and to splash. <br /> <br /> I think with a low budget and bad equipment, you have to make your movie as loud as possible to get a mob and a refund, I really wish I could just read my Sheldon Van Auken instead of this. Hehe ... I was completely the wrong audience.
