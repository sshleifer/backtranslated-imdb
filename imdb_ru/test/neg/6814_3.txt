Very stern, very boring, without real drama. Why not just shoot a documentary? This is not exactly the passion of Joan of Arc. The only reason to see the chronicle is to hear speeches. I love Bach's music, and even it was difficult for me to endure this suffering of the film. The great Gustav Leonhardt plays (in two senses of the word) Bach. We do not feel him as an actor, because he has so little to do radically. Basically, he purposefully or angrily leaves from different rooms. Of course, Bach's life was not a film about Errol Flynn. It was really quite boring and more than difficult. This probably means that life is not a terrific candidate for a film. Music, of course, is another story. I recommend Bach Station. Much more information, on the one hand, and some understanding of music, in the end, why Bach interests us first.
