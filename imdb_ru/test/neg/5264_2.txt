In order not to be bored during “Love and Sex”, I first tried to recall all the films that imitated: “Parting” with Russell Crowe and Salma Hayek (although this was a more original ending), “About the last night with Rob Low and many TV shows. <br /> <br /> The second admired how great Framke Janssen was, so I couldn’t believe for a second that she might have trouble dating. She is certainly ready to give Julia Roberts for money, literally - and wasn't Julia in some movie with the same plot or another? <br /> <br /> The third one tried to find out why the writer / director tried to give the hero John Favreau a Jewish name Adam Levy; he even admires the ham sandwich meal. <br /> <br /> The fourth tried to understand why some critics gave a good overview, which is why I was in the theater. <br /> <br /> (originally written 02.09.2000)
