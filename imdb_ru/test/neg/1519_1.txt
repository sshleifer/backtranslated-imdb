The Bottom room, crossed with Fawlty Towers, sounds great! Nevertheless, Ade Edmonson & Rik Mayall managed to create a film that raises a sensation. Ten years ago, Rick Meyalla’s mad look and Edie’s idiocy were funny, now they are just annoying. <br /> <br /> The film promised - although the most terrible hotel in Britain is not a new idea - but could not be implemented, the Saving Graces were competent actions from Simon (Exploded, The Big Train) Pegg and Helen Mathieu, and the film lasts only 90 minutes Sorry guys but you really hit the bottom
