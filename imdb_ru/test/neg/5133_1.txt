I loved the Heavenly Creatures and tried to catch them when they were turned on. <br /> <br /> So imagine how pleased I was when I discovered “Love and Suicide” while watching NetFlix. Repeating Heavenly Creatures, an easy choice, to the top of my line it went. <br /> <br /> I watched it for the last time, felt comfortable and waited. What I thought was some kind of shitty preview of a movie about the fossil high school jokes (I laughed out loud once or twice, thinking that I “just lowered the bar right on the video”) and turned out to be a movie. Awful acting game, amateur direction, weak dialogue. I usually like low-budget films, they have something tangible and real, because they can not afford to escape from the "meat" - action, directing, plot, story. I would compare this with the fact that a student who did not attend the exam knows that he will fail, and just puts his head on the table and sleeps. <br /> <br /> In the hands of others the plot will be a serious potential. <br /> <br /> Don't expect magic or even iconic classics, such as, say, Divine's Polyester or Showgirls, at least there you will learn to expect a bad game. <br /> <br /> Love & Suicide has turned from worst to worst to the worst movie I've ever seen.
