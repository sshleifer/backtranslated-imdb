Once, back in the 1940s, there lived an actress named Veronica Lake. A beautiful, talented young woman who was once in great demand with many big-budget Hollywood films. Fast forward in the late 1960s, age, alcoholism and general bad luck tarnished all favorite actresses. Now Miss Lake decides that the time has come to follow in the footsteps of her peers (?) Joan Crawford and Bette Davis and return to the kind and reliable Horror. But the Feast of Flesh? Indeed? She could not be so washed. Speaking thinly, Carnal Feast is a lifeless heap of rubbish, perhaps one of the 5 worst films I've ever seen, and I've seen them all. Lake plays a scientist who, together with the Nazis, is plotting to bring Hitler back to life by conducting youth rebuilding experiments involving the larvae, or the larvae. If you're not a big fan of Heather Hughes, run away and never look back !! <br /> <br /> I know very little about this man from Veronica Lake, as well as about the films of the 40s, but to think that such a successful career really became so dark is actually rather sad. The flesh of Pira is almost impossible to pass, and almost, I mean absolutely. Director Brad Grinter, director of the Nudist camp shots, and the man who, by coincidence, brought us the best B-film ever made, Blood Freak, just a couple of years later. It is worth thinking, but what was the Blood Freak like, if Grinter hadn’t starred with Steve Hawks? If so, God bless Steve Hawks. You might not think that the Religious, bloodthirsty monster from Turkey might be SO better than experiments with Maggoth and Hitler, but this is true. So forget that you’ve ever heard of this, and go and find the Bloody Ugly, he’s just waiting to entertain you. Fast forward a couple of years later, Veronica Lake dies of Hepititis, broke and forgotten. The end. I hate you, the feast of flesh. 1/10
