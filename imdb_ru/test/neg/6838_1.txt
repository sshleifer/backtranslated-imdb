Spoilers !! Bruce Willis, part-time funny and funny guy playing a Latin American assassin nicknamed the prairies of an African garbage man? I assume that all good Latin American nicknames, such as Sicatriz (Scar), Scorpion, Viper, Cobra, Snake, Tarantula, Latigo (whip), Navaja (blade), etc. Were unavailable ?? And why was any South American assassin familiar with a terrorist from the Irish Republican Army? The last time I checked, the IRA is not going to open its headquarters in South America. And why is some Irish terrorist stern and tired of war looks like a middle-aged Richard Gere? I thought that maybe this film would be a parody of The Crying Game, when Gere's character was introduced as a person who was going to hunt down Jackal. What a bad casting! And why would the FBI hire lecherous terrorists to track down the killers? It seems that a terrorist goes to mass destruction, and the killer usually hits one target in a non-spectacular way. But Gere is the only person who ever saw Willis alive, according to the FBI. I thought that this film was supposed to be a remake of a very good film “The Day of the Jackal”, but this film is just a stupid version of “Killers” with Stallone and Banderas. Both of these films are really stupid, and partly stupidity is that because the audience makes us watch Bruce Willis go through his exercises, we have to say: “Wow, isn't he smart!” PROFESSIONAL with Jean Reno was much better the movie about the killers. “Jackal” is just a film about two middle-aged, fat, millionaire actors who can be paid for what they stand for, look beautiful and pretend to be smart! "Jackal" is so poor that I expected that Sly Stallone, Dennis Rodman, Mickey Rourke and Jean Claude Van Damme will be shot in a cameo as "other" assassins or the FBI. Needless to say, the Jackal escaped the FBI for twenty-five years, but as soon as Richard Gere gets to work, it's only a few days before the Jackal becomes caput! I guess the positive meaning of this film is: “Thanks to the terrorists, our streets are protected from murderers.” In general, the "Jackal" no redemptive qualities.
