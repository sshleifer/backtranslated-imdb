I am amazed that the Hospital was so well received by critics and the public. I found it dull, visually ugly and meaningless at all. After the first almost 40-minute observations, the film does improve (relatively), but it remains TOO far-fetched (not to mention unfunny) to be successful as a satire, and makes too little sense to succeed in drama. The indefinite tone of the film is his biggest mistake, eclipsing even Scottâ€™s stunning (as usual) performance.
