This program was shown in the early morning time slot at the space research station SPACE. I am amazed that someone will pay for it or pass it on; it's incredibly amateur. <br /> <br /> The entire series is a sequence of short monologues or scenes performed on the set, which looks like a cabinet with a bunch of printed circuit boards attached to the wall. There is very little continuity between the scenes and there is no plot. A typical scene revolves around some silly joke or special effect and lasts only a minute or so. The dialogue does not make sense, and special effects look like Photoshop filters. All the actors are adults, but I literally saw school plays with the best scripts and plays. This program is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Each scene may work as an internode; filler between the show instead of advertising. Combining all the scenes makes the material limitations extremely obvious.
