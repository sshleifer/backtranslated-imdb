It was a Hindi film. Hindi = Horrible. reasons: cheap dialogues, cheap special effects, cheap direction + stretching max. 2-hour movie for 3 hours. <br /> <br />% ^^^^^ spoiler ... a little %%%%%: <br /> <br /> Specifically for this film: 1. Dialogues are not funny. they are cheesy and cheap. Although Akshay tried his best, and I admire him, the comedy was not at all funny! I laughed only 3 times during this movie. 2. The first half of the film was useless for the history of the second half. the second half was a real story / film. The first half was the time of passage / build 3. Characters are not designed properly. Paresh Rawal is smart in the first half, idiot in the second half / rest of the film. in fact, we do not develop any feelings and do not care about akshay and govinda. their characters are stupid nothing else. they do not seem to struggle in their difficulties. The jokes are funny, but they are not funny in a very serious scene. gang characters and drug smugglers are stupid and have been used in the last 20 films. There is nothing new about these characters. Again, they seemed silly for being funny. however stupid = funny when stupidity is the norm throughout the entire movie. the only character that made sense was Lara Datta with a real story. 4. The special effects were crap. in the end, the man falls from the fire truck ladder. You notice that they are not really on the stairs in the air. secondly, people start to take off when the stairs start to move. People can't take off the stairs as they move ... they fall straight to the ground because of something called gravity. 5. The whole movie was dubbed. All dialogs were recorded after the film. The lips of the actors almost did not synchronize with the dialogues. <br /> <br /> There are probably many other reasons why this film was crap, but I can't remember them. Look at this masterpiece of shitty Indian films of stupid, even stupid director, and you will agree with my review. If you like films in Hindi, please increase your expectations regarding decent quality films in Hindi. <br /> <br /> Let me say that not all films in Hindi are bad. I like some. I did not like this <br /> 1.5 / 10 (1.5 for Akshay and Laraâ€™s effort)
