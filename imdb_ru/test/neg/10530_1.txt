Seagal fans are wary - he doesnâ€™t take action scenes for nearly an hour in this mess. Instead, Seagal is ABSENT from numerous battles, allowing Ja Rule to convincingly lose every battle. In fact, Ja Rule could have become an upcoming militant star, but Hollywood should allow him to at least reach puberty (what should happen in a few years ...) Also, what type of commando / terrorist wears clothes with a bare stomach? The chick in this crime looks like a backup singer for Christina Aguilera. Back to Seagal - When he finally takes off, this is his stunt stunt (HEAVYLY CONFIRMED to look like a bloated Seagal) doing most of the work and accepting falls. I don't remember aikido either. It's just your standard punches and kicks that you would see in any martial arts turkey dedicated to live video. Not even "so bad, it's funny." Just boring ...
