After 30 minutes .. mostly fast forward, deleted it from my recorder. The first film about Critters was self-consciously funny, for example, the “conversation” between the little animals shortly before the grandmother carried them off the porch. This film just idle, expecting someone to remove it and relieve suffering. <br /> <br /> I can’t imagine someone who worked on this turkey to be proud of it. <br /> <br /> One was fun, four just awful. Do not worry, even if the alternative is to re-view the TBS "700 Club" fundraiser, you will at least laugh a little there (and the "alien" makeup looks more likely ... granular).
