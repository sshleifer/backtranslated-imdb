I saw it with high expectations. Come on, this is Akshay Kumar, Govinda and Paresh Rawal, who are all great in their comedy, I really hoped for a riot of laughter. Unfortunately, this is not at all what I got ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, nothing in this film made me laugh out loud. There were times when I laughed at one or two things, but nothing made me laugh. In short, it was an unlucky comedy, and, in a sense, it was something of a copycat, Hera Pheri. <br /> <br /> I think that of the three main guys, the role of Pares Raval was the strongest. It was not the biggest role, but it certainly stood out more than Govinda or Akshay. Their performances were fine, I think. Nothing fancy, just mediocre. Although Govinda caught Akshayâ€™s attention not only in several scenes. Lara Datta and Tanushri Datta also appear in this film, and both of them were pretty bad. The role of Lara did not move me and did not make me laugh, and the character of Tanushri Datta just got on my nerves! Music seems to be the only good thing in Bhagam Bhag. My favorite song is "Tere Bin", then "Afreen", which I really liked. "Signal" and the title song "Bhagam Bhag" are also worth listening to. <br /> <br /> You either like it or not. And judging by the bad comedy and the lack of direction, I do not think you will.
