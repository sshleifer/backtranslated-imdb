This film is terrible, and do not blame Jesus Franco, because it is not his fault. <br /> <br /> This film was made by Wells for many years, when he received money to put the team and actors together. do some shooting. How much of the film was actually made by Wells is unclear, although this is not the entire film or all the episodes, since several “key” episodes, such as Quixote in the cinema, are in the hands of collectors or patrons who will not abandon them. The film is a little less than two hours here, and it would be hard for me to imagine that it really will ever work. I hold an opinion, based on several comments that Wells made before he died, that he never intended to produce a film, but collected it as a personal toy. <br /> <br /> Here there is for the most part a beautiful shot, but sharply dead. Very little happens during the first hour, except Quixote and Sancho, roaming the countryside. Bored would be a good description of the material. In the second hour Quixote falls into modern Spain and in a series of not very successful episodes tells about everyday life. This is not to say that there were not a few pleasant moments, the mill and the chicken sequences are pretty good, but basically this is a huge waste of film and time. <br /> <br /> “Completed” Jesús Franco, who was the assistant director of Wells in The Superb Chimes at midnight, we have several fragments of the film that were put together as best we can. Many people crucified Franco as the reason why the film stinks, but, to be honest, you can't make a good film out of shitty material. One critic officially stated that he had seen another version of the film in the 1970s, which meant that Franco himself invented this version and destroyed it. Although this may be true, I have come across stories about how Wells cut and cut the film many times over the years, since he could never do it right. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible, no matter how you cut it. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I can only think about how good the director is Wells. In addition to citizen Kane, almost all of his films suffer from a budget deficit or interfere, so we still have an excuse that many of his films "would be better if only ...". How do we know? How can we know? Perhaps Wells was a less talented man than we thought, and many of his frontier films are simply not so good, and never would be. Although this is not the place to argue about Wells' place in the history of cinema, Don Quixote's surviving material, suggesting that it roughly corresponds to what Wells conceived (I think it is), is a good reason to rethink how we We look at the person and his work. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 for good sequences (although 2 out of 10 is probably closer to reality)
