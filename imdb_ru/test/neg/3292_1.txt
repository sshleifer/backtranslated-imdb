How can such things still be done? Wasn Seinfeld, “Arrested Development”, “Office”, etc. Did you not kill this old-fashioned non-funny nonsense? Apparently, no ... <br /> <br /> I'm actually quite a fan of Michael Rappoport and I liked his various roles and minor roles (Copland, Friends), but in this he sucks, but with this scenario it will be fight any. <br /> <br /> My wife likes it. But she is Brazilian. And if you have ever seen a typical Brazilian comedy, you would understand why she thought it was so funny. <br /> <br /> Just to demonstrate how predictable the show is and prove my point, I guessed that the following 3 or 4 story events / stories would be at the time of its viewing and were correct almost verbatim! I felt very complacent. It annoyed my wife because she hates it when I do this (I can understand why, but I felt good, so it went!)
