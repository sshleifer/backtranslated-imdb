Well, first of all, the twins are exactly the same. there is not one girly and the other is a tomboy (although Ashley is higher than Mary-Kate), and their guys are not even French, so this is bad because they pretend to be Lamo accents. This is also not so bad, not better. I'm a big fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley, don't get me wrong. the plot is fine and it's funny to watch. This is not the movie that you would watch again and again. But hey, when they shot this film, they were still new to making their own movie. Girls also act as if they are 13, but if you are a young viewer, this is a good movie. Itâ€™s not very good if you are over 13 years old, unless you are a parent watching a movie with your children. Then, it's OK. Good luck to you MK + A in your future films!
