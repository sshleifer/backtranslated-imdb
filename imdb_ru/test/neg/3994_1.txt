Let me understand this directly ... Does the "Church" have a safe "blocking" mechanism to prevent the spirits from leaving, but the final decision is to put it on the ground ?! LOFL! Maybe I miss the plot. Maybe this guy from the Ed Wood School of Cinematography or something like that. This film is as useless as the church itself. Hey ... maybe that's the point. The entire segment of Baby-esq Rosemary was hilarious. I can go to my corner Halloween costume shop and get better resistance than this. The whole movie must be redone. Properly. There were so many things that were understated ... so many things that could make me jump out of my seat and jump over the ceiling. I'm not sure that the mistake is in writing or editing, but what I saw should not have such a high rating.
