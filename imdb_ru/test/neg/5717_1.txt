Roots and some really bad actors, but for the movie Golan-Globus about the same level. I saw this film in 1985 mainly because I liked films about swords and witchcraft (what was I thinking about?). In it, Arnold plays the supreme lord, trying to make sure that the ancient talisman is destroyed before he blows up the world. Bridget Nielsen - the main character, who at that time was Sly's girlfriend and a rather bad actress. Film producers love to play the role of Playboy. women who cannot play in low-budget films. Bridget smears him when Sonia, and Arnold plays the role of Lord Calidor. There is also Sandal Bergman (who was in the original film about Conan as Valeria), here she plays the evil queen Gedren, the obvious camp for her role as Conan. And then one of the most annoying children's actors on the screen (Ernie Reyes) in the role of Prince Tharn, who should have been hit in the face and sent to bed. Some of the sword fights are not so bad, but the music really sucks. The special effects are cheap and look very 70s, like the explosion of the evil queen's castle at the climax of the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, a film with a very low face value, but movie lovers may like its ease.
