What is wrong with CURACAO (also known as DEADLY CURRENTS, although the reason for the name change is that I have no idea) can probably be summarized when a woman says to her lover: <br /> <br /> â€œKeep me baby, I am trying to fall asleep "<br /> <br /> The problem is not in the dialogue or the method of its delivery, but in the fact that the actress has a Central European accent. Nothing wrong with that until it turns out that her character is from Philadelphia in the United States! This is what struck me in this thriller when I watched it - how the accents do not correspond to their characters. In addition to the filly woman with a German accent, we see a South African with an English accent, a local police chief who sounds like he is an Irishman posing as a Gestapo officer, and, worst of all, George Scott playing someone who is either Dutch , or a British with an accent It seems that this may be an American shade of South African. Soon you stop following what is on the screen and end up concentrating on what kind of nationality a character can be because of the strange way they speak. It is interesting to note that this site did not give this film its country of origin. With so many different actors from different countries, you feel that this was done by the United Nations <br /> <br /> Even if you are not interested in accents or dialects, you may still have to abandon action after action because CURACAO less plot. Things like a boat explosion, a hostage situation and a hero recruited as an intelligence agent for South Africa are happening, but you have to scratch your head, wondering where the hell it all goes. i was lost
