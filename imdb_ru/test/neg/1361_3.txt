This film, through its protagonist, states that the world is, in fact, sadness and pain, and those who ignore it have blinders. You can argue, it's true or not. But even if you accept it as true, the end of the film, or A) disputes this, saying that in tragic situations there can be something good, or B) forgets about it and uses a stamped assembly to leave the mood of the audience elevated. <br /> <br /> The fact that the film metaphorically justifies its main character, presenting him as a sympathetic character, despite any evidence of this sympathy, demonstrates contempt for the characters that were most convincing in the film. <br /> <br /> In this film, there is a script that does not match in its theme and direction, which does not bring the ending into line with the rest of the film. Each cast gives excellent performances, especially Spacey, Olin, Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson. It's a shame that they were not supported by the best writer / director.
