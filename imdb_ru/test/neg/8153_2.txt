A cyclone is a piece of garbage with a small redemption value, even on its entertainment front so bad. A friend of mine took a ribbon from a crowded Saint Vincent DePole bin. Well, it might be a bit dodgy, but it was meant to be a garbage bin, not a crappy old VHS bin, something that the less fortunate members of our society really don't need to make their lives better. This can be considered a favor. Watching a movie like "Cyclone" really only exacerbates their problems. In any case, the basic premise of a woman with a super-powerful motorcycle, which is armed to the teeth with rockets and lasers, is not even used properly. Two “chases” at high speeds include vehicles moving at speeds of less than 40 km / h, and a super-fast motorcycle that can be overtaken by a trashy old station wagon does not inspire fear when you get into the car. It. In the climax of the film, there is only one scene where the bike uses a stupid weapon, and it is ridiculous ineffective or just ridiculous when it is. This includes laser beams that look as if they should come out of the hands of an evil wizard from an eighties cheese sword and witchcraft that produced large flashes of flame that do not seem to have a noticeable effect on their targets, even when they hit right . The rest of the film is tiring, it's hard to watch the filler. Many bad actors, and even Combs and Landau suck at it, most of whom seem to have been removed from a set of porn films to stand sharing a really bad dialogue in a desperate attempt at pus to send a barely coherent section. There are several poorly organized sequences of battles and some painfully unfunny comic relief scenes with some cops and the owner of a motorcycle repair shop. Benny Hill's comedy of humor: an agitated old man can't stop staring at female chest grades. In fact, scenes with “money” in which the bike is involved actually do things that are few and inconclusive, and the rest is clumsy filler. Skip this.
