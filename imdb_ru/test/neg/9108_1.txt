This is so bad, it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party I'm going to. From the very beginning it is clear that Steve Gutenburg took this role seriously ... other principles went on as usual. I think they felt how much it smelled at an early stage, and they went through the movements for their salaries. Sean Bean "acted" as usual, but he was impatient to share the space on the screen with any of the principles before the final scene, where he looked like an actor walking to a high school scene who defined the contrast in this way. Some actors don't look scruffy. Some actors should not gain momentum. These two statements refer to Steve’s “Police Academy”. His scruffy look turns into a vagabond and the poor, and his stirring makes him look bumpy and not hefty. Connect this with one of the worst dialogue scenarios in Hollywood history, and you’ll make a bad movie. I can only guess that all the principles really needed money for remodeling or something, or their agents signed them before the script was written by the monkeys who had to print it. I would really like to know the background of this disaster.
