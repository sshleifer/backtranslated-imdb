Jeffrey Wright, director of Romper Stomper, transports Shakespeare's Macbeth to the modern underworld of Melbourne, Australia. The result is a semi-precious piece of cinema. Sam Worthington - Macbeth, and walks, looking very shy and bored. Victoria Hill, who wrote the script with Wright, is Lady Macbeth, and she is not terrible and not good. Lachy Hulme, who plays McDuff, is the only actor in the cast who radiates any power. The rest, including Gary Sweet, wasted and misdirected. Filmed on HD by the late Will Gibson, the films lack character. Everything is too clean and intentionally lit. The direction of Wright is not very inspiring, and the sequence of actions is confusing and inept. The film is mistakenly positioned as "the most brutal Australian film in the entire history," sometimes it is cruel and quite bloody, but it does not give a single impressive moment. Slow and terribly pretentious, this one more version of the classic play with a silver screen is the personification of an incompetent person.
