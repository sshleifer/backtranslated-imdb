My roommate and I have another friend who works for a local blockbuster. He finds really awful films for us and talks about them. One of them was the movie "Christmas Horror" with former professional wrestler Bill Goldberg as Satna Klaus's killer. We did not watch it immediately, but did not think that something could be worse. Apparently, we were wrong. We were shown this directorial film "Starring" by Ken Shamrock against the murderous stuffed animal. At first, we thought that Ken would actually BE a killer scarecrow, and so we wanted to watch, but he didnâ€™t, and it made the movie worse. What absolutely destroyed the movie was a teen drama. If you want to keep your brain cells from trying to escape from your head, NEVER SEE THIS MOVIE.
