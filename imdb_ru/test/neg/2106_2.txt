Really, really awful. I don't even know where to start. This is an excellent example of a film that does not know what to do with yourself. I'm not sure that I could even assign a category on my own, except that I am quite sure that this is a slap in the face to everyone, everywhere. Even unborn. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it seemed to me that I was watching a parody or some kind of farce. Sometimes just a bad movie. But I continued holding out for porn, which, I am afraid that almost (but not quite) does not exist. <br /> <br /> Some one advised skipping to the final. I would definitely support this emotion. The last five minutes are intense and surely contain some of the best films / cgi you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood would be proud.
