This film fails on every count. For a start, it is pretentious, the desire to be "significant" and fail miserably. The scenario was banal to the extreme, no one ever said anything interesting. It was impossible to take care of any of the characters. The knight was a selfless waste of time, while Sienna Miller was just a waste of time. A little about the soldier who went to war was a cliche even before the Atonement film used it. Using the Second World War as a background was in itself a cliché ... bombs, shelters at subway stations, etc. ... used to bring in some much-needed drama. Why someone thought for a moment that this film was worth it to do it, completely beyond my comprehension. It was another case: “Let's make the costumes look authentic, not to mention the plot, script or action!”
