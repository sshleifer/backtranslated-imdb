It was a much-promoted film before its release, but it was unsuccessful. I never talked to one person who ever loved this movie. I agree: I did not like it either. Perhaps one of the main reasons why this was not a box office success was the fact that there was nothing in the story but unattractive characters. <br /> <br /> For a while there — I don’t know if it’s still true — I didn’t have In any movie in which Laura Linney or Dylan Walsh played something BUT annoying characters. <br /> <br /> This stupid story makes this film a big disappointment, especially considering this big build-up. Do filmmakers with such a stupid dialogue really think that this will be a hit?
