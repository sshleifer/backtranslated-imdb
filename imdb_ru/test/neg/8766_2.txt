The downside of the DVD to the film enthusiastically states: “Whose is Quentin Tarantino from Christian Films” This is not so much an insult to Quentin, as Christian films. This film is poorly written, rigidly filmed and edited with meaningless intensity. Scenes are played in a confusing and unrealistic way and alternate with some good time-lapse photography. Memories, transitions to gray, freeze-frames that indicate time (no matter in history), are made for no apparent reason, except to give the film more cinematic authenticity. The camera is random, some good shots of the crane are cut out with ridiculous installations that have no meaning. Bad blocking and lighting make the viewer think about who is talking to whom in many scenes. Oh, and the sound is terrible. The special effects were decent and fortunately limited. But this is all just technical. The film is not involved on an emotional level. The dialogue sounds so false, and the actors seem to read it only a moment before the camera starts to rotate. History ... things that happen consistently have no motivation. Characters are struggling to master a single dimension. And the heroes must bet on Christianity and faith in every single scene. Take M. Knight in the queue, and in exciting Christian films it is not necessary for the characters to pronounce the name of Jesus Christ in every scene so that the film is a Christian. Perfection! Please do not try to show this to your unsaved friends with any expectations other than laughter.
