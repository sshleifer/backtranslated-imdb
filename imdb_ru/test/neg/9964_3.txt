A paranoid scientist creates a wolf man, transforming the wolf's blood into a meek, quiet, but very large gardener to prove his hypothesis. Thus, the gardener begins the nightly rampage, and the scientist tries to use it to regain his powers, but his former colleagues denied him the fake nature. The Island of Dr. Moreau, Frankenstein, and various films about wolves are mixed together in a terribly outdated, stupid, moral play. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the plot is pedantic and unoriginal at best, this film is not too badly made and interesting to watch as a representative of the horror film of its time. Like most crazy film scientists, this is a weak warning against fooling around with Mother Nature. He does not have the strength or intellectual problems of Frankenstein, but he never extends his reach. The action is tolerable, like cinematography, and the film moves forward in an entertainment video. Some dialogues are completely ridiculous, but, hey ... it's just a film - and minus one in it. There are also some good snapshots of a wolf and a bit of humor so that the film is not taken too seriously - always a plus for this genre.
