For a thriller to cause fear, anxiety, or any emotion, the story must be believable. There is nothing believable or realistic in this film. The main characters have several opportunities to escape or turn over the tables, but each time they manage to screw it up. Antagonists who allegedly plan this and set up their shuttle specifically for catching people, undoubtedly, leave a lot of improvisational weapons around. In fact, there is one scene where an “intelligent” girl puts a gun to the head of the main bad guy and decides to scold him, not to pull the trigger. It was a completely predictable, brainless thriller. Each character was one dimensional. The “victims” were the usual limp, brainless sheep that deserved to be killed. Is there anyone on this planet who can write an intellectual thriller?
