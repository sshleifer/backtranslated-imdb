This film was a rather strange viewing experience. The film is clearly based on the play. Now I am sure that in this film everything works fine in the play, but in the film it does not seem interesting enough to watch. The film is too “stage”, and they did not even bother to change some of the dialogues to make it more suitable for the film. Instead, what is presented now is literally a re-filming of a stage performance with unsurpassed characters and a staged dialogue. Because of all this, the storyline really doesn’t work, and the film becomes an almost complete boring and outdated viewing experience. <br /> <br /> It will take some time before you realize that this is a comedy. watch. At first you think that this is a drama that you are watching with bizarre characters, but as the movie progresses you will notice that the film is more like a tragicomedy that really leans more towards the comedy genre than the drama genre. br /> <br /> Characters and dialogues are what makes this film bizarre and excessive, which sometimes really becomes inaccessible for observation. Of course the actors are great; Peter O'Toole and Suzanne York, among others, but in fact they do not raise the film to the level “watchable enough”. <br /> <br /> The story seems completely disoriented. In fact, this story does not say anything and mainly focuses on the characters of brothers and sisters played by Peter O'Toole and Suzanne York. But what exactly is this story about? The film feels like pointless and outdated, which has little to offer. As I said before; I am sure that the plot is good and interesting to watch on the stage, but as a film it really does not fit and just will not work. <br /> <br /> Editing is just awful, and sometimes it even becomes a bad laugh in certain episodes. <br /> <br /> From director J. Lee Thompson, who, obviously, made films are much better than this rather unsuccessful, stage play, translated on the screen, a project. <br /> <br /> worth your time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
