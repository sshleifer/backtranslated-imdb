One of the worst movies I've ever seen was Carrie (the first!). Now, as in other films, they completely destroyed the Carrie franchise with The Rage: Carrie 2. From the very beginning, the film hums like a geriatrics in a battered van. There is hardly any scare, and this film is full of all the different school stereotypes (that is, a football athlete, a crazy fan leader, followers, and, of course, black nail polish in losers). Another sad thing about this show is that you know what happens when you see the opening credits. Of course, of course, the girl is terribly humiliated, and then turns into a crazy mental killer ... yawn ... <br /> <br /> I was there. Made it. <br /> <br /> Even the actors look as if they were forced to star in this film. Emily Bergl is just as scary as a cabbage doll, while Jack London ... let's say, I didn't pay to watch the wood play. In addition to the actors, the memories are more likely to be annoying than to connect with the first film. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that if you can carry objects around, like Carrie, then, for the love of God, radiate yourself from this theater ... ...
