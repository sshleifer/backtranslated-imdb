I honestly do not understand why people love this show so much. My friend watches this, and since I love science fiction, I tried to watch, because the plot of the show sounded promising, but in fact it’s really a very boring show. The only thing that won't wake you up during this show is the CGI effects, similar to video games, and the complete abuse of dolls. Notice that I call it dolls, because they really look like dolls, not like aliens. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which; dolls and makeup effects are terribly used in this show. You have this guy who is best called an alien / dwarf hybrid, you have a pale girl who looks like a vampire of a crappy one, you have a floating alien with a frog rodent ... It’s just not necessary the extent that you feel abstracted from the whole storyline about the lost astronaut. <br /> <br /> Each episode is also too independent. The creators of this show led it in such a way that each episode almost resembles a whole other series. At least until the moment when you see the main characters / doll again, that is. The whole story about the return of the main character to the ground is the way to the points relegated to the background. Acting is also pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: if you need good science fiction, just look elsewhere. In my opinion, this is not even real science fiction, since the show is more focused on fantasy elements with all puppet and strange dreams. And if you just want to see the dolls, then I invite you to watch a puppet show and feel the joy that this abomination of the show has come to an end. <br /> <br /> by the way; Doesn't anyone have a deja vu with the concept of a living spacecraft? Ohyeah is true; Doctor Who started this concept almost 30 years ago! This show is like a collection of science fiction remnants. The scenarios and events that were abandoned for a good reason were picked up by this terrible show.
