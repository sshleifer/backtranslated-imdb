The Boston Black movies have some strengths - mainly because the tempo is fast and the hero is cheerful and calm even in the worst of circumstances. But the plot is often cruel, and inexorable comic bits often kill the tempo (if the plot turns out to be atypically good) or are simply unfunny and irrelevant. <br /> <br /> In this case, Blackie pursues a refugee escapee (Steve Cochran in a very poor performance), who is fixated on the beautiful Nina Foch (who does a good, rather fine acting job). Inspector Farraday, of course, believes that Blackie has become a killer maniac (at least he has evidence for this), and he is incompetently trying to put him in jail because Blackie is pursuing the real killer. The plot has possibilities, but every time a real tension arises, we get a non-funny comedy. It seems that no one in Colombia understood that in the film about the pursuit of a really dangerous maniac, cute little comedy stories about how to hide an uncomfortable body from an inspector destroy any voluntary suspension of disbelief. (We can only conclude that our smart hero - an idiot - is deadly for such a film.) <br /> <br /> This is not worth the time. For a well-prepared episode of this series, see Alias ​​Boston Blackie.
