Anthony Perkins and Sophia Loren are absolutely gorgeous in this app. 1840 "Western". This in itself, however, does not help a ridiculous story with countless historically incorrect elements. <br /> <br /> Birl Ives is convincing as a tyrannical patriarch who is over 70 years old, an egoist who vows to see his 100th birthday. His wild dance at the party he gives to his neighbors will make someone notice (this guy is SEVETY SIX?). Always muttering bible verses, he demands respect, driving away sons and friends with his complacent ranting and emotional cruelties. <br /> <br /> The love affair between Perkins and Lauren at first seems absurd, but becomes a believable near end. There is a lot of drama, but not enough to feel good. This scene was clearly written for the scene and was dated even when it was filmed. Perkins whistles "My Bonnie" in the 1840s, although the song was not written until 1882. <br /> <br /> Critics who knock Sophia Lawrence about “English proficiency” are rather petty. I found her English flawless and completely audible. Being a Neapolitan, Lauren speaks an excellent dialect, which often had to be duplicated into "real Italian." However, her “accent” almost does not affect how she speaks English. As a German of the first American of the first generation, I can appreciate the efforts of those who study English as a second or even third or fourth language. <br /> <br /> “Desire under the elms” is a drama (or even a tragedy). ) in the classical sense. For my pleasure, there was not enough logical history and total "return" for the time spent. Fans of the stars will not want to miss it, while others will tune in at your own risk!
