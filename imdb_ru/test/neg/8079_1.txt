when I watched this shit, it reminded me of the name of the movie FIRE, which owns this garbage, on fire. I do not even know what to say, that the actor's explosion exploded, the fire looked really false, Andy, chicks, not exactly a supermodel. And finally, I do not know what you people are complaining about, I have this damned film, yes, happy birthday to me. Well, I think it could be worse, I could look behind 2. And, even worse, I have a whole set of DVD fire, volcano, earthquake, avalanche. All I miss is the stunning movie Tornado, which I heard sucks.
