The film had no excitement and there was nothing that could interest you. There was nothing interesting, funny, dramatic or romantic in the film !!! How can a movie be romantic if a girl never finds a suitable boyfriend until they see him for the last time, how does the movie end ??? Perhaps the second part will be romantic, but someone else will have to risk spending their money! I have nothing more to say except for not wasting my time !!! There was nothing interesting, funny, dramatic or romantic in the film !!! There was nothing interesting, funny, dramatic or romantic in the film !!! There was nothing interesting, funny, dramatic or romantic in the film !!! There was nothing interesting, funny, dramatic or romantic in the film !!!
