Well, let's be realistic about this. No one goes to the cinema produced by WWE Films (whose owner challenged God to a duel), directed by a former porn director (a man gave to the world Between Lanit trilogy), starring a wrestler named Kane, and expects a little piece of art on a golden platter. If you do, you probably need to find something other than watching movies to take your time. <br /> <br /> So what can we expect from such a film? This is what I was looking forward to: <br /> <br /> 1) Bad game. 2) A rather non-existent, clichéd plotline. 3) Kane is walking with a wrinkled, sour face, indicating that his nostrils had just found a potato salad, which he had lost a month ago. 4) Tons and tons of blood. <br /> <br /> Well, if you crave some kind of “bad, funny” entertainment, then this can satisfy your appetite, because it benefits all indicators. <br /> <br /> Obviously, these films are best seen for free, but if you decide to donate money at the box office, have fun and make a game of them. The filmmakers are good enough to introduce us to each of the annoying offenders, highlighting their names and offenses on the screen. This will help you write down who you want to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate. <br /> <br /> I also invite you and your friends to record every moment of stupidity and madness that you can find. Count them at the end and see who will come the most. I think my grand total was 107; can you beat it I personally want to know how after 35 years of fire in this abandoned hotel there is electricity, running water and an elevator? <br /> <br /> I know, I know that the filmmakers assume that if you pay to see it, you obviously don’t think too much about what you spend your money on, and therefore, most likely, you will not think too much about how stupid the film will be, but that does not mean that we cannot point this out and laugh at it. <br /> <br /> I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which will be convicted and recommended for demolition by any reasonable inspector) into a homeless shelter, and they think this is the best way to get it. removed to give the eight punks a few mops and brooms. Yep <br /> <br /> I think you know what to expect, but I feel the need to give you a couple of warnings. First, if you hate communication with the crowd, regardless of the film, then you can stay away. People in the audience acted as if they were on a real wrestling show. Screams "Kill him, Kane!" and "I hope you die first!" and "Chokeslam!" echoed through the theater, demonstrating what I hope is NOT the best America can offer. I usually do not appreciate such interaction with the audience, but for such a cheesy holiday, I thought that the comment added to the entertainment value. However, I see how this can annoy others. <br /> <br /> Secondly, and this should not justify an explanation, the film does not shy away from blood. If you look like a big, ugly dude pulling eyeballs out of their sockets, you don't cry out “fun night in the movies!” for you then you know well how to keep your dough. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was a little surprised at the extreme lack of dialogue on the part of Kane. I didn’t expect him to put in an acting clinic, but I hoped that he would have some cute little catchphrase like “Say good night” (his character’s last name is “Good night”) right before he kills the victim . Instead, he uttered four words in the whole film - “Noooooooo!” And “I see it.” But hey, he delivered them flawlessly! <br /> <br /> If I were the bad guy in the film, then my phrase would be something like “Put your BETS!” or “All bets are off!” <br /> <br /> This will rule and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror films, such as See No Evil, which cause so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to call them comedy. Feel free to send me your suggestions. In the meantime, we'll just call them terrible!
