This movie is just bad. First, the story is just weird and poorly written. That leaves you with questions when you're done. Sometimes this is normal, but not in this case. <br /> <br /> This is nothing special. Adults do a normal job, but children, given that they are children, do not work very well. I thought the lead role, Jan Costello as Mickey, was the worst. Well, to be honest, I'm not sure that this was the main role. I never understood who this movie was about. Mickey or Pete. <br /> <br /> There were some shots that stood out, but in general there was nothing exciting about the cinema. The sound, however, was better. There was a good bill. A small adventure game, although for me it did not look like an adventure film. It contained some elements of an adventure film, but it was rather a drama. However, it was difficult to say for whom this film. Children? Barely There is too much language and violence for this. Adults? I dont know. It had many elements of children's cinema. It was like an adult film in a children's film. <br /> <br /> The story was just weird. I have no idea what it was about. You were thrown right to it without knowing anything, but all the time there were references to what you felt you should know. For example, the fact that the parents of the children were dead, and that Mickey blamed it on Pete. You expected to find out what happened, but you never knew. <br /> <br /> All together this movie was a bad and waste of time. There was no drive in it. Nothing that really could move the story forward. This is not what you spend your Saturday night on.
