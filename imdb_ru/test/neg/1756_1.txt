The two main characters, an Englishman and an Australian, filming the history of the American civil war in Romania, have not the slightest spark between them, they are absolutely incredible as lovers and not at all sympathetic. There is no history, no characterization, practically nothing to keep the eyelids apart during this endless boring festival. Renee Zellwegger, who was also hopelessly mistaken, practically chews the fence posts, but at least watching her embarrassment, brings some comic relief. Nicole Kidman is too small for the role and has no idea what is going on. The role of Jude Law could have been equally played by other Romanian extras. The only requirement is to wander through the forest, looking stupid, watching the parade of guest stars stealing the show. Not that it mattered, because all the roles of guest stars were completely unnecessary, as they did not advance the so-called story one iota. And as if all this was not enough, the author found it necessary to throw a spinning, spinning kung-fu jumping from horses. What is it about?
