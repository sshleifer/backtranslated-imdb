Although many Billie Dove fans are delighted with her work here, I have to go. As a socially significant member of the British smart set, her British accent is largely absent, and her linear readings sound the same as linear, and her emotions seem trance and heavy. Basil Rathbone, as a rule, is a wonderful actor, seems reckless everywhere, and also speaks with a strange accent - in his case, something like Italian, although we cannot be sure. The script manages to keep its exact ethnicity secret. In addition, he is hampered by a script that gives him one of those old cinematic diseases, something related to nerves, which requires surgery. The only real entertainment is the famous Kay Francis with a sporty patent bean with side curls in the role of a depraved countess who shamelessly devours men, including Ratbone, and then spits them out. She copes with her unique aplomb. She is the only living thing in this dead sea of ​​film.
