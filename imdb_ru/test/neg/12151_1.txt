First of all, I don’t know if I should use my imagination in this film, or the director tried to save money or limit the budget! That's all .... <br /> <br /> Basically there were so many years and gaps that I don’t understand, as if the film jumped from 9 to 20 years to 30, and so many gaps that you ask questions how the hell did this happen? and why? I think this is a big stream. Forget the reviews that constantly complain about the story, this film has not only historical problems, but also so many flaws. So most people keep saying that in cinema you will lose all cinematography such as rivers, deserts, etc. It’s true that they are beautiful, so I was waiting for the release of Blu-Ray 1080p. OK! beautiful scenes, but what's the point? I turned off the movie after an hour and a half, I just lost interest. The film continued to do the same, jumping over the years (at least Mr. Director, for example, 2 years after 10 years!) I mean, I couldn’t watch a movie, I lost understanding of what was happening! In any case, I would like to include spoilers, but when you decide to watch this movie, just ask yourself how it happened? You will understand what I mean! Do not watch this movie, it is a waste of time.
