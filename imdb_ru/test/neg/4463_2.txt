The film begins magnificently in 1872 with a brutal bloody fight between Dracula (Christopher Lee) and van Helsing (Peter Cushing). Dracula pierces and dissolves in the dust, and Van Helsing also dies. Someone collects the ashes of Dracula and bury him in the church grounds. The transition to 1972 is where the movie falls apart. <br /> <br /> We are instantly struck by the loud, bad 70s music, HORRIBLE fashion and silly dialogue. When this was done, Hummer was losing money and decided to try something to get hit. Entering Dracula in the 1970s was NOT a good idea. Fashion, music and dialogue badly date the film. We get acquainted with a handful of annoying children aged 20 and over who decided to have a Black Mass “for laughter”. Naturally, they are in the church (now abandoned) and, naturally, revive Dracula. It’s good that Van Helsing’s descendant is near ... but Dracula follows his niece (Stephanie Beecham) in retaliation. <br /> <br /> Lee and Cushing, as always, are great in their roles and the film always receives a much needed energy on the screen. The beginning and end of the battles are the highlights of the film (although the ending is badly damaged by the lousy music of the 70s). Also, the chief ringleader of children is called Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neem) - a truly stupid name that dates back to the 1940s. The film also depicts the queen of screams Caroline Munro, who looks just great. The film is well directed and fairly well played, but the plot is stupid, the constant flow of the 70s mod, the dialogue and music is annoying very quickly, and I was mostly bored. <br /> <br /> Most Hammer fans agree - it was one of the worst movies about Dracula - its sequel (“Satanic Rites of Dracula”) was the worst - and the last movie about Hammer Dracula. It gets 2 - only for Cushing and Lee.
