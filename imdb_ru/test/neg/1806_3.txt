If you have ever heard the saying “A book is always better than a movie,” “Heart of Darkness” is no exception to the rule. I suppose it was much easier for me to understand the details of the novel over the film, because I read the book out loud in English classes. We discussed each paragraph in great detail, so I quickly understood the concept. I could not understand the plot also while watching a movie. This may be because there were no discussions in the class, but I believe that it was also because I could not draw my own pictures in the memory of the events of the novel. If you belong to the type of people who believe in this famous maxim, then leave the film “Heart of Darkness” from your to-do list.
