To be honest - this short film sucks. the mannequin used in the necro scene is fairly well made, but still deceptive enough to spoil the viewing experience. The dug DVD is crisp and clear, and I did not decide whether it would help or make it more difficult. If the film were a bit grainy, it could add some "eeriness factor" to what is happening. I have no idea why in this film there is so much excitement around him, except for the subject, but, to be honest, the scenes of necrophilia in films such as NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q are among others more shocking than in AFTERMATH. All this talk about the fact that a film about loneliness, and any other deep philosophy - is a bull ****. This is an expensive, beautifully taken poop. This is not so shocking, it is not so disgusting. if you insist on watching it, rent it. I give him 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit films about necrophilia (for us, the sick, there definitely should be more choice;) - the shooting is good, and they really have a bit of "gore" (if you look at a rubber doll being cut is considered blood ...) but other than that, absolutely nothing happens for this over-promoted confusion. On the other hand, GENESIS - “Continuation” by Cerda for AFTERMATH (now available as a “double feature”, released in the films “Unearthed”) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film that really shows what a good director Cerda is when he is given the right material. Although I don't give a damn about AFTERMATH, GENESIS is so good that I will forgive Cerda and will definitely watch him in the future ...
