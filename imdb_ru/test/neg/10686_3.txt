The animal eating scenes (the geek) were not as bad as you think. After viewing Mondo Cane and Mondo Magic, these scenes are medium. The worst was when the guy ate his head off the mouse. But they were so fast and there were few of them that they did not bother me. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie was just interesting. I always like to hear stupid voices behind the scenes. They never sound the way you think an actor / actress sounds in real life. I liked the bright colors worn by the princesses. The pictures of the strange bugs were also cool. The youngest princess looked REALLY young, almost 14 or so. The fighting scenes were not as long and boring as most battle scenes, so it was good. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
