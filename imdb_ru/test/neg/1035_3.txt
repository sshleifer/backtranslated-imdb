A frustrating documentary. The son of Louis Kahn, who only minimally saw his father in childhood, because he was a member of only one of the three separate families created by his father, undertakes the task of trying to learn more about his father, exploring his architecture and his life. It sounds like a great idea for a documentary, but eventually it becomes flat and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the main problem is that Kahn’s son, Nathaniel, is not just one of the film’s main characters - he is also a director, a writer, a producer, an interviewer and a narrator. Nathaniel seems too inexperienced and perhaps too close to the material to function well in any of these roles. In addition, although he looks like a pretty good guy, he doesn’t have much of a screen presence, so the fact that he is the only permanent member of the film becomes wearable. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel also looks like an unprepared and amateur interviewer - there are a few moments when the interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement, and the camera shows a picture of Nathaniel showing a slightly more empty look. and a kind of timid "aha", as if he'd panicked a little, that he would have to come up with something to say in response. At times, I felt embarrassed watching people who may have had some really interesting things to say about Cana (or at least the best things about their time), as if realizing that they were in the hands of the interviewer. who was going to rely on them to direct the conversation. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel’s double role as a documentary and lost son seems to be doing more to harm the film than to help. It is felt that some of the respondents are a little reluctant to talk about the negative aspects of Kahn’s personality and career, perhaps because Nathaniel is not clear if he wants to dig into the truth or simply wants to hear good stories about his father - preferably those that confirm his hope, that his dad really cared more about Nathaniel and his mother than it seems likely. His passive approach as an interviewer can come directly from this conflict. The only person Nathaniel pushes is his own mother, but this talk is usually a bit like a bad teen drama (“Aren't you angry, Mom?”) And they don’t offer anything to help us (or Nathaniel) understand Kahn or the loyalty he aroused in others. <br /> <br /> What the film lacks is the formation of an experienced and independent side, not excluding Nathaniel, but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience. The independent director could have stayed away from the material, thought more about what the interviewees could give, and, we hope, cut out those parts of the documentary process that simply do not work, such as a strange episode with a guy who claims to have seen Kahn die. (which looked as though Nathaniel had just gotten into some kind of crazed one) or whatever related to meeting Kana's cousin, who has nothing to add about Cana or Nathaniel. Too many times Nathaniel makes us watch as he stands in or near the Canon building for strangers to tell them that his father was a designer. (Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa so sir. Mmm ... I have to go.) I understand why these things can be important for Nathaniel and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting, but this is one of those examples where the Documentary film can be TOO TOO personal. <br /> <br /> In general, I thought that the assessment written for the film was excellent! (But one of the strangest moments in all of this was for me when, during a tour of the Kimball Art Museum, Kan quotes voice-over as a comparison of Beethoven’s architecture and Fifth Symphony. Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. Error? Error? Who knows? It’s made me laugh.) <br /> <br /> Kahn was a great architect, and it is clear that he was an unusual person and had an intriguing life story. There is definitely a good documentary about him. One of them sympathizes with the search for Nathaniel’s father, whom he did not know, but I’m not sure that this is an interesting story. Neither works so well in this film.
