When I first heard about this film, I eagerly went out to rent it, thinking (by mistake) that it was one of those films that it was so bad and that pleasure awaited me. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, the pace is agonizing, overwhelmingly slow. The pace does not even begin to rise until the last 15-20 minutes of the film! The plot was boring, and the ending was meaningless and confusing. For those who are looking for a stupid horror movie with cheap sensations, look elsewhere. This film provides ease in the peaks, but it really lacks the "thrill", cheap or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Instead, try "Kids Game".
