This movie is perfect for cheese zombie lovers. This is a movie that you can laugh from acting to terrible zombies. At the same time, I gave 4 points out of 10 for the effort, because horror is a complex genre. According to the list, the bad moments of this film are as follows. <br /> <br /> # Bad makeup # terrible sound and sound effects # very bad continuity # funny dialogue # one song played throughout the entire film # Stein could not work, and, in my opinion, one of the worst, what I saw was # a terrible end # a racist moment and the theft of a Simpson character named <br /> <br /> good moments # good suit # police officers seemed to have better acting experience # actors with fewer roles or smaller roles seemed were better # good attempt with blood <br /> <br /> I don’t want to watch a movie bad, funny with to mute because of these bad moments, and I think that's what makes this film fine. if it was a little better, I don’t think it would have made any difference, but it wouldn’t be interesting to see a remake with the same cast of actors, as I think they may have improved over the last 7 years.
