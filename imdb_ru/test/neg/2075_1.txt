This film is advertised everywhere in Spain with the help of a huge advertising campaign, after watching which you realize that someone has stolen your money. Paz Vega is terrible, like Carmen, she is not at all natural and looks like she does the cover of a fashion magazine in all shots (“the best” is when she is like an Andalusian woman ... she can speak Basque and Freely like Jose, but the story is very slow, the plot does not work, and the script is really very, very bad ... I think Penelope Cruz (the film was written for her) Carmen would be much more reliable and sexy. <br /> <br /> What a waste of time and money
