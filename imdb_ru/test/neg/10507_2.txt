As I said, sometimes a low budget is good. You can see a good movie without a lot of additional information that can hide a piece of shit. Well ... it was that piece of shit. Anyway, I thought it was humor, unfortunately, the humor was unintended. The only indecisive actor came from Bill Smith and his role was cut out (this is a joke) There was never Bill Smith and there were no actors who could play. Even Gerald Okamura sucks, and he was shot in almost 40 films. The fighting scenes were ridiculous and made me feel like I could kick all of them $% # @ # $ The sound was terrible, as if the whole sound was recorded on the set. My 10-year-old could write a better script ... By the way, my 10-year-old fell asleep ... no kidding. I give B + to edit to cut the film only to 90 minutes ... 60 minutes would be A +.
