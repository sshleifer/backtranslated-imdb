I thought Throttle has potential, but I thought it could be a much better movie. He had interesting twists, but some of them seemed meaningless. When displaying the background for two main characters, some of them really seemed erroneous. Most of them were useless and did not help the film at all. It was also not the best hour of Dennis Hopper. However, the main saving grace of this film for me was Michael Madsen. His performance was excellent. In this film, he almost makes Mr. Blond look like a nice guy. In general, it was watchable. However, I remained to think that some things could have been done differently. These things would make the film much better, in my opinion.
