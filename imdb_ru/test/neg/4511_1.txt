This is really an alteration that should never have gone out of the stable. It has two shots that act in completely different layers. At the top of their game are Joan Plowight and Maximilian Shell. Every nuance of francs is in sight. At the foot of the rock Melissa Gilbert and Doris Roberts. I can't imagine how Shell and Plowright play so well when Gilbert and Roberts work on their antimagic. Gilbert destroys every scene in which she plays. Itâ€™s like "Father knows best in the ghetto." She is Anne Frank Light. Her run on Helen Keller was thin, but not terrible. This is blasphemy. Doris Roberts annoys Mrs. Van Damme. She is a totally inappropriate choice to play a sexually hungry woman whose flirtatious, unsatisfied presence has caused so many problems with hat-asherhua. It should have been played by a woman who could convince us that at least she remembered how voluptuous it was. Her weight is not a problem. Joan Pvolight could play this role nicely. Roberts was at the top of his career when it was done, receiving a lot of press and a lot of opportunities. Her performance here shows her weakness as a shameful actress. <br /> <br /> James Coco and Clive Revill, most of their scenes with Gilbert and Roberts, and although they are strong, they are completely unable to repair the damage done by their partners. Revil is a cunning actor capable of such a landmark performance as Ed Wynn in the original film. He gets no support from Gilbert. It drains the color of each scene. <br /> <br /> I anxiously read the comments of those of you who grew up watching this version, filled with affection for these performances. This is the lesson of how the version you see is first attached to you. It makes me reconsider my affection for some of the worst products that I loved as a child. I urge you to see the original. He has very few weak points, and he is a cut above the mess.
