This series takes a classic story and makes it rubbish. Robin is somehow puzzled by a moose man in the forest and is involved in all sorts of druids and frank satanic episodes. The story is more about avoiding an evil sheriff than helping the poor. This is hardly watchable. And to top it all off, they kill Robin at the end of the second episode and replace him with another actor. This show may seem fantastic to some people, but this is not a Robin Hood show. If you want Robin to fight under the name of King Richards against Prince John and the sheriff, and if you want Robin to feed the poor and oppressed, watch the classic TV series or the BBC novelties.
