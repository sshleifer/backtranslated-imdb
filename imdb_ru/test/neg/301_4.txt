*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I read a little about Dahmer and saw a new film about Dahmer (with the same name) before. This film here focuses more on victims and murders, too little on Dahmer himself. The film “Dahmer” had the opposite problem, it was too little about his crimes and too much about him. <br /> <br /> I didn’t find acting to my satisfaction; he also had a certain amateur feeling, especially the probation officer. It also seemed that Dahmer’s actions worsened each time he played against the actor of probation. But I could be wrong about this. <br /> <br /> I was a little annoyed that some of the scenes were quite disturbing, but the filmmakers seemed to be trying to show the “real deal” about what he did anyway. This is normal, but what I do not understand then is why the guy who ran away from his apartment when Dahmer left for a beer was not depicted naked, because it was so. It does not matter much, but it simply deprives the quality of films that such details are not taken into account. What was not shown, or even not really hinted at, was Damer's sexual obsession with the dead. Again, I don’t mind if they don’T SHOW it, but at least they could mention it or embed it in a movie in some way. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think that a really good film about Dahmer is still a film that includes not only Damers’s crimes, but who he was and why he did what he did. I think that 1.5 or 2 hours is simply not enough to understand the complexity of all this. This film was just an episode (sorry for the pun) of Damers’s life and personality and does not give you a “close to good” understanding of his life or personality. <br /> <br /> 4/10
