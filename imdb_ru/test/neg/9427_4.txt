An anonymous film that anyone could ever make. Where are Anthony Mann, the director of such classic works as “El Cid”, “Naked Spur” or “Man of Laramie”? <br /> <br /> These are amazing pictures of planes in the clouds, shot with love. The story is very banal and almost completely devoid of drama. The couple lives an almost ordinary life, and the user, complaining about the choice of Juni Ellison for his wife, IMHO, completely misses the point of view. With her less attractive look, in her hoarse voice, she was the perfect housewife needed for the script. At that time, women were barefoot and pregnant: there was not a single woman among the base staff, even workplaces on the desk. All they had to do was worry about their hobbies, who fought for democracy and against an enemy whose name we had never heard, but in 1955 it was not difficult to guess about it. <br /> <br /> One of them I wonder why a young man who has never watched Mann’s movie should choose this film among all his great films?
