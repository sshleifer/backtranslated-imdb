My reasoning about watching this film (despite the fact that it was free) was more or less out of curiosity ... a little, little curiosity ... I was not so familiar with this "biographical" film directly to Mr. Gein’s video account and discovered during the opening credits that in the main role he played the icon of horror Kane Hodder. My emotions have changed not only out of curiosity, but also because of a glimpse of a soft anticipation of what his image of Gain will look like. Also in the credits (among the gloomy photographs of Ed's crimes) were Michael Berryman and Priscilla Barnes. “Good,” I thought to myself ... “It can be a little funny.” When the film began and progressed (slowly), my microscopic confidence (or, as I call it, “micro-hope”) in this film completely disappeared, and I was stuck in an overwhelming sense of humiliation when I died a little while watching this movie. a pile of manure. Hodder, who is widely known and respected for his past work as an unstoppable serial killer, inaccurately puts it into play, turning Eddie Heyne from a soft recluse into a clumsy, full-scale killing machine. He hides at night, killing cemetery rangers, robbing his grave and teenage friends, leaving Plainfield in a panic, since the local sheriff’s government seems to be doing nothing to correct the dangerous situation. The deputy and his mom have a warm little relationship that gave me a vague feeling inside (or it could be just a cyanide pill that I swallowed halfway through this turkey). I'm not sure what the meaning of this film was, and, obviously, the director did not know anything about the subject with which he worked. There are already so many films related to the story of Gein that if the “Ed Ed Gein” stills are not found, I don’t want to see them on the shelves anymore. If you want a more authentic movie of this kind, check out the 2001 Ed Gein (2001 in the Light of the Moon).
