First of all, you should not take this film seriously. Unfortunately, this in itself is serious, but nothing can be done about it. This ninja anime film should be a major achievement in spoiling what could be a cute, if unoriginal, story with bad plot twists, ridiculous time-savers, and one outrageous guest appearance that makes you laugh or moan ( or both, like me). <br /> <br /> Although I am usually a fan of anime ninja / samurai (ninja scroll and Ruruni Kenshin), this one should be an exception. For information, from a technical point of view, this film was very well animated and designed. This is just a plot that stinks. The authors of this film clearly decided (for what reason I don’t know) that they could somehow make up for the absence of the script if the character is halfway around the world in search of a treasure with which (he finds out) his father fought and died for. In the process, he rescues a black slave named Sam, meets a French girl who lives in an Apache village, makes friends with a ninja clan, whose members then try to kill him, meet more family members than he knew he had in the weirdest place and circumstances (and whom everyone subsequently dies at some point in the film). <br /> <br /> Even so far, these ridiculous turns of the plot could be justified, but then two “guest appearances” occurred. # 1: After the ridiculous opening of clichés with two cowboys, Giro meets a man who introduces himself as "Mark Twain." At this point, you probably say, "What the ****? !!" This “meeting” serves one purpose: it completely discredits the film, which is trying to add to itself an educated historical background. I was disappointed that the authors did their best to explore the USA of the 1860s, and could not understand that the real name of “Mark Twain” was Samuel Clemens. # 2: When Jiro finally finds the treasure, it turns out that it belonged to Captain Kidd. Now I hear the moans of disgust. <br /> <br /> Finally, there are running scenes. These scenes show running characters statically moving behind them for a few minutes, and there are plenty of them. It is these scenes that make this film lasting 2 hours and 12 minutes and last a week and a half. <br /> <br /> If you and your friends are looking for a bad movie with subtitles that simply requires to be ridiculed from, this is it. Feel free to make fun of every possible aspect of it, and have fun. Just don't take it seriously. 3/10
