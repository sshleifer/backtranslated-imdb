I saw this short film on DVD for Ridley Scott's “Duelists.” Before the film, Scott was not presented, it has just begun. <br /> <br /> “Boy and Bike” is hardly an example of another Ridley Scott work, he has no resemblance. The film shows a boy played by Tony Scott, riding a bike. Guess what? That's pretty all that happens. The boy rolls around, incoherently and randomly engaging in dialogue. The film was shot in black and white, and since it was shot by director Ridley Scott, I was expecting some cool cinematic or visually striking scenes. Instead, I was treated with nothing. This film is not even good for the first effort. However, I recommend that any Ridley Scott fan check this at least once.
