I am not particularly against the creative ideas embodied in these films, but seriously. There is no one part of the game in this movie. This seems to be a trend, buy it right, and then just make a movie that has nothing to do with what the fans want. This slaughter is almost interesting because you know that you get away with hiding behind the lack of skills and control over money (not yours), which allows you to do it. Play the game, or hire someone, and please make a real movie, or stand in the boxing ring and get your ass when you are not there. <br /> <br /> wow, 9 lines of text and I was done. I had to add blah so I offended you, I'm sorry
