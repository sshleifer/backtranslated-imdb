Besides Frank Kress (who played Abraham Gentry), the appearance of Henny Youngman and the last seconds of the film, there was nothing particularly good about this film. Why he is currently rated at 5.3 and adored by some reviewers, I don’t understand - the film is at 99.44% crap ... and exactly what I expected from director Hershell Gordon Lewis. In the 1960s and 70s, Lewis was known for shooting a series of incredibly low cost budget films, such as BLOOD FEAST and MONSTER A GO-GO. However, in recent years he has been dubbed “the father of blood”, and he has many, many fans — fans who ignore the ineptitude of his work and focus only on how innovative some of his films were. But apart from the liberal use of false blood and real courage, in the depths of his heart his films are just crap - and don’t believe the bills 9 and 10 for his films. It's like putting a velvet picture of Elvis in the Louvre !! <br /> <br /> A film about a series of horrific murders committed by strippers. When I say "disgusting," it's very bloody and sick for 1972 - although by today's standards, special effects look surprisingly lame. Thus, although in the film there are very deviant and brutal murders (I would not explain them - they are due to a rather sick mind and demonstrate a particularly sick disregard for women), at least they will not make you sick, because they were made so bad. Obviously, in many cases they cut rubber dolls and mannequins. But forcing them to perform some sick actions, even if they are unrealistic, is rather unpleasant and shows a lot of misogyny. <br /> <br /> The only hope in the film, since the police are all idiots, this is a guy named Abraham Gentry, whose manners and style of speech are very close to the role of actor David Loughary from the early films of John Waters. Although his game is bad, he is so bright and funny that he retained my interest. He can be quite funny and, oddly enough, this is the only film he has ever done !! It was also strange that so many women wanted him - especially because they simply did not look like him. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the people in the film, they are cretins and idiots who may not act. Actually, I hoped that MORE would be killed - they really expected it! None of their acting skills was ever believable, and, apparently, the director NEVER replayed any scenes - since most of the scenes in the film were worse than any of Ed Wood's masterpieces, PLAN 9 FROM OUR SPACE. In fact, for many women in the film, the only reason for their appearance in the film is that they want to take off their clothes. Now I know that it will sound rather vicious, but most of them were incredibly unattractive and looked like drug addicts who undress to get their next fix. When these ladies take off their clothes, people in the crowd give them money to put it on (wow - Henny Youngman SHOULD say this in the movie)! But given the budgets of Lewis, these were probably the best "actresses" he could get. <br /> <br /> Overall, a dirty bucket of bile that can be worse than most other director films ... and that says a lot! He is cruel (but stupid) against women (referring to him as meat and things that must be disfigured) and completely incompetent from beginning to end.
