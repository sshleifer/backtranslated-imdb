Granted, this film is well made, but it makes no sense and does not make sense in how they made 2 hours look like 3 just a small love story, <br /> <br /> this could be a bold and beautiful episode or ok in short, please do not watch this film, because every 5 minutes there is a song to wake you up from sleep, I gave this film 1/10, because it was the lowest, and no it is not completely based on real events, more half of them are made up. I repeat, the direction of the photo is 7 or 8 out of 10, but the movie is too much, the nasal voice of the actor just makes me want to blow my nose. If you're not a real fan of the grid, this movie is a huge no-no.
