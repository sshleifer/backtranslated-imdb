Fake films have reached the point that Mel Brooks in “Producers” (1968) said: “Don't be stupid, be smarter. Come and join the Nazi party. ” It brought us amazing movies, such as Young Frankenstein, Airplane! And even Naked Gun. But the good ones die young. Fortunately, the genre managed to go all the way until the end of the 90s. And then ... The Wyana brothers unleashed the apocalypse: "A terrible movie." Suddenly, the word "deception" became a hint of gross sexual jokes. Most films claiming to be tricksters since then have followed suit, including Scary Movie 2, Movie Date, and the movie to kill the Epic Movie genre. Of course, there were some reliefs. These were Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Will Ferell began to fake the car in almost all sports. In addition, the Wyana Brothers left Terrible Films, and they were made by reliable Zucker Brothers. While these films had a certain value in salvation, the genre was tragically doomed to be films, loved only by pre-puberty men, who had just discovered what an erection is. People who have not researched the term "fake", but also cut and pasted movies together to laugh. No heart, no brain, just cheap glue. Unfortunately, “Returns” has been added to the list. Dave Kohner (who played a major role in “The Leader” with Ferrell) defeats the outsider team to beat the coach (Carl Weathers from “Happy Gilmour”), who brought him back to coaching. Koechner showed himself promising as a supporting actor, but as the presenter in this film, he just sounds on the script. It sounds too strong, as if passionately reading the cold. In addition, jokes about being washed by the coach, who during the film encourages the team to fail at school and then run away from the police in their underwear, have been made before. Yes, this is a fake movie. But let's remember that even parodies can have quality. Give the characters dignity and a kind of sophisticated look at modern society. In addition, dependence on stereotypes will no longer make us laugh (who knew that one film with people speaking jivi could lead to gang stereotypes (not really, but you see)) Although I confess that I laughed at least a few once ... it was not up to par. The football team had many stereotypes within it, including the Mexican, the daring athlete, the fat man, the skinny nerd, and the mentally retarded. Even the only woman in the team was reduced to stereotypical female humor, being mostly poorly dressed and giving out hints. In fact, her character, like most others, never developed. This is the sad state of affairs for this movie. If he did not depend on stupid sexual jokes, he could have done something for himself. In fact, this film is likely to be the subject of a joke along with Epic Film. Kohner really deserved better. The scenario was generally poorly thought out, even calling the championship "Toilet". So yes. fake movies are dying. There is a movie called “Meet the Spartans” (be ahead of the trend, boycott now!), Which includes a parody of the breakdown of Britney Spears. So let these children continue to get an erection ... but people grow and lose them. We need support. One day they will learn to stop a fake and repair them. I hope one of the heroes will be “Get Smart”, created by master Mel Brooks, which will be released next year. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5 (stars)
