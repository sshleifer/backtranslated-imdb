Do not pay attention to rave reviews about this film here. This is Wan Damme's worst movie and one of the worst I've ever seen. It may appeal to someone without any depth, someone else need to be entertained only by shots and explosions. <br /> <br /> Seeing that it was directed by Peter Hyams, I realized that Peter did not have the talent of the director, but he very well removes explosions and the like. However, films need other elements; for example, history. It had none. This may explain the horror of some of the recent Mr. Hyams films, and hardly any better than this one, really. <br /> <br /> One can not help but wonder how some people ever fell for the camera.
