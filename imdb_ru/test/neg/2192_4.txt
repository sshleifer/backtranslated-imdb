Lots of fire, thousands of extras in battle scenes, lots of beautiful scenery. I do not think that the plot supported such huge expenses. This story could have been told much more effectively and more reasonably, psychologically, if there had not been such a large number of macho bombing in production. In my experience, Chinese films tend to be like that. and I think it distracts from the film.
