Honestly, this could be the worst movie I've ever seen. And I saw a spider child, not this earth. Hell, I even saw 200 motels. Having just discovered the Freaks and Geeks series and wondering at Linda Cardelliniâ€™s acting skills, I checked the reviews and decided it was worth a try. This is the last time I will rely on a review in IMDb. I did not understand that MORONS wrote IMDb reviews while they waited for an answer to their calls on AM radio. <br /> <br /> This film is so far from bad that simple words cannot express the wretchedness of its emetic state. Seriously. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you think that Will Farrell is really very funny if you consider Adam Sandler to be a comedy genius. Watch this movie, but PLEASE DON'T BREED!
