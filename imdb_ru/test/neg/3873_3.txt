The original name always seemed to me a rather exaggerated definition for a bunch of gangsters. Still; Their presence on the screen was, at least, emphasized by a group of top-quality actors who supported Yul Brynner. Most of them were movie stars in their own right. <br /> <br /> however; this first sequel was a pale imitation, when the group now consisted mainly of players on list B and C, who were mediocre rather than magnificent. It was a similar installation. "Chris" Brynner had to hire another team of bandits to solve the problems of the Mexican peasants again. Another tyrant gave them grief. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the originality and freshness of the first film, which is now spent, this remake could not offer anything else. The budget was obviously very limited. This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the script below par, which borrowed a lot from the earlier classics. It was also more than half an hour shorter than the original John Sturges. However, we still had recurring agony and moralizing, which sometimes even made the first one a bit rude. However, there was no decent acting, action or location to balance things. Shooting was less expensive. He could not convey a wide range of landscapes that made up most of the original. <br /> <br /> in general; he just lacked imagination. The first film was a hit, and this continuation of the pedestrian, obviously, was collected as quickly as possible and cheaper, in order to cynically earn on the previous success. And it shows. This is a sensation created for television. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
