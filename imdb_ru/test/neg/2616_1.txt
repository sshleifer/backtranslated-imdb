The very disappointing 7th chapter of this slowly dying series. Obviously, the budget was extremely low. This film was made for one and one reason. Sell ​​Puppet Master toys! Fans, like me from the series, decided on the basis of what I read and heard that the only one in the series is worse than this, the Puppet Master Curse. In turn, turns us away from the series. <br /> <br /> Choosing a PG-13 movie for any reason did not work in favor of the movie. The plot seemed to be almost there, but was easily lost in a continuous stream of nonsense. <br /> <br /> The only film in the series that is worth seeing is also Dekoto's director, part 3 - Revenge of Toulon. <br /> <br /> Of course, I prefer the scenery in the film. <br /> <br /> Ugh!
