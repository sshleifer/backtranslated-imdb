This film was embarrassing. Ulma Thurman looked like she had a disease, and John Travolta looked like she was walking in a dream. I expected this to be a continuation of Shorty, not a semi-baked remake of the same movie (except that some characters have different names and clothes). <br /> <br /> I would not advise this to the film to my worst enemy. I feel that I have been robbed, and Hollywood deceived me again, so that I could see another horrible sequel (I also suffered from Alien vs. Predator). <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say about this movie is that this is my vote for the worst movie of 2005!
