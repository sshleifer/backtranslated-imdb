The use of the term "comedy" in connection with this documentary is an insult to the art of comedy, and even worse - the pain caused to the audience of this performance. Almost nothing was funny. <br /> <br /> This documentary followed a small group of “comics” on the road as they traveled from town to town to perform in small clubs. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that their conversations and behavior outside the stage and on stage are indistinguishable, but, unfortunately, are equally unfunny. <br /> <br /> One can understand the self-deception of the grandeur that famous comedians possess, but it is more difficult to understand the sounds of laughter heard from their audience. Apparently, these are the same audiences for whom unfortunate comedies on television are intended. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was the worst movie I've ever watched in the last 50 or so years of watching movies.
