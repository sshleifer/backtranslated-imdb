I entered this low-expectations film, knowing the legacy of Uwe Boll as a director and screenwriter, and I was still disappointed. Uwe Boll finds a way to make every film in which he participates, worse and worse. The overall concept was not bad; a person who was bored with his life as a stockbroker becomes a serial killer. But the problem with the film is that there is nothing in common between them, it goes straight from the stockbroker to the serial killer. There are no actors without a name in the film, and I understand why, after watching the film, I do not understand why any actor with a career would like to participate in this film. Anyone who abandoned it made a career as a favor. And if you have not seen this, do yourself a favor, but do not. <br /> <br /> I give Sanctimony 3 of 10
