As much as I love Ellen Barkin (which is really undervalued), I have to boo this movie. If you can't tell who did it and why in the first half hour you obviously never saw a psychosexual thriller or never watched 20/20. It is as if filmmakers and actors do not care that the way they film it, and the way they play the characters, would be a dead hand. <br /> <br /> In general, this film serves to include dirty perverts who love to mix violence and sex. Not a funny movie to see through it, although if you like Ellen Barkin, it would be nice to see her tough lady.
