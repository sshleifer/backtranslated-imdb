I saw this film twice, once a few years ago in college, and again last weekend. Although I absolutely despised him for the first time, I decided to give him one more chance. Terrence Malik is clearly a respected director, and it seems that IMDb viewers at least appreciate the film very much. But, unfortunately, it seems that my tastes have not changed at all. <br /> <br /> How to start? First, the story of Linda Manz is terrible. Her voice is so annoying from this terrible New York accent (please do not try to convince me that Chicagoans say so, but they do not). She herself admitted that she just sat down and talked about random things, which does not make her a talented actress. She doesn't even play! I came to IMDb, expecting to see it torn apart, as her performance is ridiculous, but people really enjoyed it! She is simply unattractive in all respects - I continued to hope that Malik would just kill her. <br /> <br /> Other actors were fine, but, of course, nothing special. Adams was probably the strongest in the cast, but she also had the only decent role. Except for the old guy - he was pretty good. <br /> <br /> Speaking of acting, how could Shepard’s character be so ridiculously stupid ?? He bought the brother and sister act, because ... uh, why would he buy it? Bill and Abby took every opportunity to be touchy, as if they did not understand that their lives depended on very platonic actions. It was just incredible. Finally, after a considerable amount of time, Farmer suddenly realizes that “Oh God, they are together!” Then he goes after Bill with a gun, but instead, it seems, he falls into Bill’s hand and ends with a deadly knife wound. <br /> <br /> Speaking of this, the fate of the characters was just as stupid (I say, lazy). Of course, Bill must die - how can it be more boring than to shoot a bunch of policemen in a pond? Abby continues her happy life, getting on the train and feeling really pleased with how it all happened. And the tedious narrator accidentally finds her dead friend, and they go off into the sunset. But this is normal, because Malik never gave me any reason to take care of the characters. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, this film stretches endlessly without any real plot twists and turns. I can not believe that this is only 94 minutes - I could swear that I sat in my place for 3 hours. The sudden locust catastrophe was like throwing the Bible to my face; I am completely fine with metaphors and allusions, but this was completely overwhelming. It is clear that the message was: "Do not marry money, otherwise something bad will happen to you." Very original. <br /> <br /> I understand that “Days of Heaven”, like all Terrence Malick films, are intended for art. And I certainly agree that the cinema is simply amazing, and the magic footage of the hour adds a unique aura to the film. But I need not only beautiful pictures to enjoy the film, but this one just did not do it for me.
