It was shown on the premium channel, so I did not understand that it was made for television. Despite this, I like some movies about life (Lifestyle here in the UK), but it was awful. The family was so stupid, "I love you, mother," "I love you even more, dear." Then, after they were hacked a second time, 10 minutes later, they were again in it, “I love you, mother,” big smiles, etc. She calls her husband and tells him not to worry about returning home. Only the guy who wanted them to die broke them, and the crazy one lives next to them, who needs help? She has a teenage daughter and a cat (briefly) to look after her. <br /> <br /> However, as a comedy, I would rate it at 7. I could even show it to my friends next time I have them round. It can be great fun after a bottle of vodka or 10!
