This film was one of the worst films I have ever seen. This film is delayed, and I almost turned it off, but I did it. I did not expect anything great, but I expected more than that. It’s good that I work in a video store and saw it for free, because I wouldn’t have spent a penny on this film. I gave this film 2 just because I’ve seen worse. If I were you, I would stay away from this, very far.
