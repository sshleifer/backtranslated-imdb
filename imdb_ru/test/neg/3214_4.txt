I don't like anything more than a kung fu movie that plays for a laugh. This is the main reason why I can not stand Jackie Chan (or his counterparts). I must add that he was not always a clown. “My young aunt” is the martial arts of the worst kind. This is a great example of how a subgenre was destroyed by endless silly antics and childish behavior. If you are not 5 years old, I really do not understand how someone might find this film funny. But humor is really a very subjective thing. Personally, I think that this approach has caused irreparable damage to the favorite genre. I really thought that leading lady Kara Hui was very nice here. But it was so hard for me to sit in this that I couldn’t enjoy her wonderful performance. If you do not mind all this nonsense, you might like it. I know not.
