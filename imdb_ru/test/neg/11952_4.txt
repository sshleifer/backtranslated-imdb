In this film there were all the possibilities and great feelings, a beautiful love story ... the cast is perfect, visual works, original backgrounds, characters work ... but the story moves from one chess movement to the next in the most predictable way ... not one character in The film does not have the depth or depth explained by the director. All we know about Catherine Zeta-Jones's character is that she is obsessed with her world ... nobody is allowed, and no one challenges her world ... this is obvious ... but all other characters have their own dimensions that are never actually explored or exposed ... Aaron Eckhart's character could offer much more, but he didnâ€™t allow, the character of Abigail Breslin is so simple to understand that her performance is somewhat predictable and fake ... finally , everything returns to the forced bur th world Catherine Zeta-Jones, to which the audience never comes fully ... honestly its rapid world - nothing like the image of selfish, obsessed, spoiled lady, which most people will not have much time or sympathy in the real world. The director was supposed to make her a hero and never does .... in the end, it was Eckhart's character who ultimately wins because he wins. <br /> <br /> Not a lousy movie, just a movie that could be much better, with a greater depth of personalities that can be explained and revealed. <br /> <br /> Cheers
