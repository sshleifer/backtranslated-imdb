I enjoyed the first "Poisonous Avenger", but the sequel just didn't work. There are some funny jokes in the debut involving family members for the blind, but after that I was just bored. The sequel is also filled with unusual humor. Only this time it is not funny! Most jokes revolve around crisp Japanese stereotypes. It seems almost every Japanese character is chopping fish. Does everyone in Japan cut fish? The films of “Troma” are known for their almost disrespectful attitude, but if you are going to use humor with racial stereotypes, at least make it ridiculous. I can't laugh if they give me the same crap I have seen a million times before! One thing for which I must pay tribute is unreasonable nudity. There is even more gratuitous nudity than in the first. But overall, I was very disappointed, and the film ends with a tedious chase scene that made me puff and puff, dying to make the film black. At least in the film there is one funny line in which I cried with laughter. After the villain speaks a line from Shakespeare to one of the local residents, the citizen (elderly woman) replies: "Damn, you're from David Mamet." <br /> <br /> My rating: 3 (out of 10)
