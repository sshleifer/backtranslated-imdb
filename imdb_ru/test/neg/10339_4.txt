Despite the small number of beautifully executed scenes, this recording (the fourth) seems tired. Toshiharu Ikeda, who shot the magnificent "Little Mermaid" and the original Japanese film "Evil Dead", shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise. <br /> <br /> The villain becomes obsessed with a conservative woman who reluctantly appears in a porn photo shoot. Predictability tracing, stalking, assault and rape comes. <br /> <br /> The main product of roman porn sex. And sex is mixed with violence. Both are potentially exciting topics, of course, but not when there is so little effort to keep them fresh. A masturbation scene in which a woman forces her to open her hole with a pencil (using a condom) is too small to be late. <br /> <br /> The motive of rain continues, and the final scene of the film brings relief.
