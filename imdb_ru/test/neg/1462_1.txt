This film was pretentious, funny and just ridiculous. The filming technique reminded me of MTV. I'm a Hartley fan. But what was he thinking about? Much more thoughts could go into this film, given the subject. It may have been a real theoretical battle for good and evil, but Hartley seemed to be using the pedestal technique to wake the viewer.
