When you watch this movie, you immediately notice the crappy elements of a standard television movie ... although throughout the whole movie the plot changes (if you are bold enough to say that this movie has a plot) belong to the book and are not original ... and with each movie KEPT GETTING WORSE! <br /> <br /> Candace Cameron Bure, known for her role as DJ Tanner in the popular TV show Full House, is not very convincing as the obsessed twenty. avenge the death of the Possessors. I think she's a great actress ... just not in a thriller. <br /> <br /> The shooting was dirty, and, as I said, the plot is stale ... although, watching it, I knew that the machine gun was waiting for me. cheese, I had no idea how much worse this movie could become ... <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie ... unless you made a movie and you donâ€™t write well
