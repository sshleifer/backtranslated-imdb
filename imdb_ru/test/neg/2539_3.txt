On the way back from London, I looked that She was a Man; apparently air canada has a crap cinema policy. Perhaps this is not the best way to start a review of this movie. Amanda Bynes plays a girl who loves football so much that she pretends to be a twin brother to join the team at a boarding school throughout the city. Even if you check your opinion at the door (for a 6-hour flight you must), the story is implausible and ridiculous. There are a few moments of humor, mostly from comedian David Cross as a principle, but the intricate love polygon doesnâ€™t really inspire emotion, although it is cleverly mixed (with the reservation of thoughtless plausibility). The end is as ridiculously meaningless as the rest. I think if I were a 12-year-old girl, I would really like it.
