This movie sucks. From start to finish, it was predictable. Absolutely there was no chemistry between Pierce and Mumba's chick. The plot went nowhere, floating away into oblivion. All this led to the fact that the film was very funny in its stupidity. And I wanted to strangle Orlando Jones, the guy just needs to leave.
