“Nero,” as the name of the film in Germany, is another attempt to show one of the most interesting Roman emperors, Lucius Domitius Achenobarb, better known as Nero. Although this attempt, at least, tried to show more historically accurate Nero than the funny but completely fictional Nero, Peter Ustinov played in “Quo Vadis!” It is still a serious failure. And to those IMDb commentators who still believe that Sueton and Tacitus propaganda is true, please read the book about Nero, which was published less than 20 years ago. Nero did not burn Rome, it is proven! He did not kill Britannica. He did not torture, did not kill or maim for pleasure, he was the first emperor who banned gladiatorial fights. The film still shows a lot of mistakes, mistakes and, by the way, made in a really cheap style, especially the sets were cheap and inconclusive, the palace looked like a villa, the city itself looked like ... well, like a cheap set. The game was between good and subordinate, the music was almost insignificant, and the film soon deteriorated after Nero became emperor in a hurried, poorly edited mess without any clear narrative structure. Thus, there is still potential for the epic biography of Nero, which reveals the true Nero, who was one of the best emperors who ruled Rome, despite the lies of Sueton et al.
