Based on the true story of two young Americans who sold national secrets to the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, Falcon and Snowman want to be tense and philosophical at the same time, and in both cases fail. It is less le Carré than who cares. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton is shooting the role of Christopher Beuys, a former seminarian who is disgusted with Watergate and middle class values ​​around him, probably not the guy hired by the company to launch spy satellites for the CIA. Sean Penn plays his friend drug dealer Don Lee, who himself delivers the secret files to the Soviet embassy in Mexico City by courier Beuys. Unusual synthesis of jazz, lack of sympathy or emotional attachment to someone, as well as many scenes in which guys are angry in the rooms - all this combines in itself what a decent thriller with a moral dilemma can have. <br /> <br /> This is indeed the Penn Film, despite the second billing; his character talks to Russians, and Hatton plays with his favorite falcon. Hatton looks like he was woken up five minutes before they called the “action”. With Penn, this is a terrific punch, regardless of whether you get a brilliant game or an excellent one. There is a bit of that, and second, especially in the second half, when Lee switches from coke to heroin. He squeals. He snorts. He breaks up the Russian embassy at parties. He is beaten by phone books. He spits at himself in the mirror, a big jerk, whom he must have saved on the paparazzi. "I don't know who my friends are anymore!" he is screaming. Just tiring to watch him. <br /> <br /> Penn seems to have somewhat modeled Lee on Dustin Hoffman’s “Ratso Rizzo” from The Midnight Cowboy, with excessively nasal readings of the line and constant eye movement. John Schlesinger shot the film just like Midnight Cowboy, but he seemed to mean another Hoffman's Graduate, throwing scene after scene with Beuys and Lee by the pool, trying to decide how to live in their lives. . their gilded cell. It is a pity that no one offered plastic. <br /> <br /> From the first frames, the news feed of the American recession, compared with Boyce and his bird, “Falcon” makes it clear that this is a film with messages, although the message itself is far from clear, probably because the characters never get into focus. Should Boyce be an idealist? Or is he just a mercenary? Hatton and Schlesinger do not seem to know, which complicates us. Meanwhile, opportunities to establish some kind of expectation, such as Boyce stealing documents from the top-secret “Black Shelter” where he works, or Lee, playing games with Russians, are interrupted by jumps to the scenes of the couple with their families and friends. This is the normality of the story that Schlesinger finds interesting, but this is the least interesting aspect for us. <br /> <br /> Good stuff: It’s interesting to watch a film that works in the spirit of the 1970s as early as this one, with reference to Maria Muldaur and Tan. Dorian Harewood, remembered in the “Full Metal Jacket”, has a good role in the role of Boys Gene's paranoid colleague, who shows Boys how to make margaritas with the help of a shredder, but has some serious problems with Nem under his party. Macon McCalman also works perfectly differently, like a boss who gives Beuys his job with a high level of security. David Suchet, as a representative of the Russian embassy who deals with Lee, creates an amazing mixture of threat and friendliness. <br /> <br /> But “Falcon and Snowman” is worth or falls on the question of the two main characters, and neither the actors nor Schlesinger can find many answers. Worse, after more than two hours in their alternately wild and catatonic company, you do not need answers. You just want these loans to roll.
