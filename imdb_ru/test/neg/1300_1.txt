The previous poster suggested that the military would not submit to the police in the event of a disaster, as shown in the film. In fact, the military role will be to provide assistance to civilian authorities when asked for. Civilian authorities will retain primacy. In practice, the army will take about 48 hours to mobilize itself, while the presence of London in London will be insignificant, especially given current foreign commitments. Even then they will depend on the call to TA. <br /> <br /> With regard to COBRA, we got the impression that it was a full-fledged government emergency department, even the mention of the Cobra police unit. In fact, COBRA means a briefing for the Cabinet of Ministers "A." This is just a room where PM or DPM meet with their consultants to discuss the current situation!
