I used to think that this could not be worse than Army of the Dead, but this load of shit makes the above movie look like The Godfather !! The special effects are terrible (makes the original Nintendo graphics look like HDTV). As for acting, I went to the play with my 6-year-old niece, and she gave the Oscar a decent idea compared to these actors and actresses on the D-List, So, in principle, if I had a gun on the head and on the head, to choose between re-watching this movie or cutting your own hand with a blunt knife, this is a difficult choice !! You know what, who still needs two hands?
