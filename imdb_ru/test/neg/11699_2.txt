Perhaps this is because I read Peter Straubâ€™s wonderful book before watching a movie, but I was terribly disappointed with this movie. In my opinion, the filmmakers removed everything that made the story interesting and unique, and replaced it with more common elements in the Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> This is also very bad, because in this film there is a terrific cast, especially Fred Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Melvin Douglas, John Houseman and the then little-known Alice Creg. They just do not give anything special. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was ready to leave halfway, but a friend convinced me to stay until the end, as he was sure that it needed to be done better. He apologized to me during the closing credits.
