If you are not interested in seeing 2-hour footage of picturesque mountains with hysterical characters, lots of stories and cheap 70s blood (and not so), I would advise avoiding this film. It winds up for a long time, too long and has a rather annoying amateur feeling to it. Masterpiece? No, the usual thriller, shot in the usual style, in a magnificent Italian landscape. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of the slow films of 1970, when there is a plot to delight and entertain you. In this case, it did not work for me. The plot is banal, intertwined with superficial and stereotypical characters, supported by cheerful angry mobs and a typical Italian widow, dressed in all black, sobbing. <br /> <br /> If you are unfamiliar and unfamiliar with the Italian countryside, the film is probably worth seeing, as the landscape itself is impressive and quite spectacular. This film, however, is not unusual, there are much better Italian horror films than this one. Nothing else, like a holiday yawn. 5/10
