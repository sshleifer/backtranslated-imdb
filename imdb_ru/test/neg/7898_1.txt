Hmmm Soul Plane was to be a parody of the "black comedy" in the well-known film "Airplane". This film is a black comedy made at its worst. Stereotypes can be funny, and often they happen. But in this picture it is disgusting. Well, you have clubs, sex, drugs, all the rude things people associate today with the "urban" culture. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Tom Arnold in this film is the saving grace of this film, if it ever was. D.L. Hewley should never have taken a script. Kevin Hart plays a bad lead here ... his appearance in this film is likely to annoy many. The appearance of the “Method of Man” and “Snoop” was their worst. <br /> <br /> I'm just happy I didn't pay to watch this movie ...
