Being a history buff, I made this film because of the topic. The idea of ​​Ellis Island’s experience at the turn of the century, centered on one small group, intrigues. Unfortunately, the film is crumbling. Most of the story is just boring; Nothing special happens for long stretches. The director uses blunt images (offered in the form of sequences of dreams) in an explicit attempt to destroy the glacial rhythm, but instead he conflicts with the authentic look and feel of the film. Characters are also poorly traced. In the end, we don't really care about them as we should. It's a shame that it was not something that could be. I still would like to watch a good film about the experience of American immigrants, but it is not.
