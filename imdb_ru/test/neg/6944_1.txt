This is the worst movie I've ever seen from Bollywood this year. I can not lie, my wife really liked this movie. It was not Bobby Deol or Arjun Rampal, who made this film incredible, but it was Amish Patel. She plays the role of a blind woman who gets in trouble when she nearly falls from the mountain, where (fortunately for her) the hero Arjun Rampal comes to save her (in the middle of nowhere). It amazes me how a blind girl realizes the danger when she is about to fall from the mountain because she cannot see her surroundings. From this scene I began to watch the movie very carefully, and in each scene there was a flaw in the game Amish Patel. The way she plays a blind girl is very bad. The only way she does it is not to look into the eyes of the person with whom she is talking. When I saw this film, I respected Rani Mukherjee more for her performance in the movie “Black.” Amish will never reach this level as an actress. <br /> <br /> In any case, she falls in love with Arjuna Rampala. This is a cliché story. Sudden Arjun is killed by a man who is madly in love with Amish. Amish is desperate, but then Bobby enters the movie. He also falls in love with a blind girl. In my opinion, Bobby Deol is a great actor, but he cannot pull the film to a higher level, where Amish Patel buries him deep in the ground. I have to say that Bobby deserves better roles in better films than he has received so far. Bobby grew up in acting from the first movie his favorite daddy gave him. He acted so badly in Barsaat, but when you see how he plays now, you feel a shiver and believe every word he says. Only a high-potential film, such as the Yash Kopra film, must meet his path. <br /> <br /> Well, when Amish also falls in love with Bobby, someone enters her life. Arjun Rampal is not dead! Who believes this shit? I do not. Why didn't they give their role to one of the ugly guys from the movie family (Shushant Singh or Ahriman Ramsey) and didn't give Bobby a role in one of the blockbusters with Amitabh Bachchan? Sorry if my comment sounds like a scream for an actor such as Bobby, give him a big role, but he deserves much more than an Amish movie (big screen, face) Patel. This film was so terrible that I regret buying it.
