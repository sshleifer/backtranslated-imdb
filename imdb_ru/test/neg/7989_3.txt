"Menlo Park Wizard" was deeply responsible for many things that we take for granted in 2007: even if he did not invent them without competitors or helpers, he gave birth to electric light, phonograph, movie camera, electric car battery, electric network ( perhaps his most important, but least mentioned, invention), a pre-fabricated house and innovations in telephone and telegraph communication, as well as a device for removing the tape and an early voting machine. The total number of patents exceeds 1000, which is much more than any other American inventor. <br /> <br /> But Edison was a ruthless business rival. He often had extensive legal fights for the advantage of his inventions over competitors. The best example is the telephone, where he was one of seven or eight opponents with lawsuits against Alexander Graham Bell. In fact, Edison's invention was not a central idea, which Bell and Gray came up with independently of each other in 1876, but an improvement in the sound quality of the receiver and transmitter of the telephone, which Bell did not develop. However, this was part of the huge 1888 Supreme Court decision, which was the longest decision of the US Supreme Court (the single volume of their reports!), Written by Chief Justice Morrison Wate - which, by the way, killed the poor Chief Justice from overwork for several weeks to complete it. <br /> <br /> In 1886, Edison found an equally ruthless competitor in the field of electrical networks for large cities. It was George Westinghouse, the inventor of the railroad air breakthrough. The firm Westinghouse received the help of a new inventor and former assistant of Edison Nikola Tesla. Tesla developed the "alternating current", which was Edison's "direct current" competitive system. The Edison system was basically a direct electrical system. The Tesla system allowed switching current from one circuit to another — in fact, it was a better and more efficient system. But Edison was determined to break this rival with an ad campaign. <br /> <br /> It all started with power lines. In the beginning, Edison sent his lines under the ground so that they were not endangered due to weather conditions. But Westinghouse was forced to keep its lines on the open telephone lines. When there were several accidental deaths from repairmen on the Westinghouse lines (one incident in particular, when the repairman was burned alive in front of hundreds of scared observers in the business district of Manhattan), Edison began to insist that alternating current was much more dangerous than DC <br /> <br /> One of the results of all this was that Edison helped some of the subsidiary inventors to purchase Westinghouse alternators and dynamos for the electric chair. Edison himself has always denied that he invented the electric chair, but he helped several smaller pieces along the way — read the “ECDON AND ELECTRIC CHAIRS” by Mark Essig for the full story (New York: WALKER & COMPANY, 2003). <br /> <br /> Edison himself experiments with cats and dogs (he was happy to show experiments to the public). Ultimately, despite helping to invent a new method of execution, Edison could not supplant public support for alternating current. But he never stopped trying. <br /> <br /> In 1903, he had the opportunity to combine his campaign against Westinghouse and A.S. with his invention of the camera. He helped “kill” a famous public elephant (“Tops”) who killed several people. He did this by killing the poor beast with an electric current from A.S. But all the killings on the film - and it can be seen to this day. This is a pitiful movie — no matter what poor Topsy did, it was a poor beast, not a Machiavellian killer. At that moment, when we see explosions of electricity sparks that show the death of an elephant, we realize that this will end soon, but the sudden collapse of the “Tops” is still an unpleasant sight. The film leaves a bad taste in the mouths of viewers of modern cinema. And yet, unfortunately, this probably benefited Edison - his description of the film in his film catalog shows real pride in his achievements here. In 1903, many Americans could watch this exciting entertainment. Someone is glad that today more and more people are terrified - sometimes you can feel that the human race has improved a little.
