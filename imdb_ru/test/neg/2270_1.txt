Comparisons between the 1995 version and this are inevitable. Unfortunately, this version is far from perfect. <br /> <br /> Casting did not inspire and acted wooden. It seems that the director did not read the book, so he did not understand the characters. <br /> <br /> Sir Walter Elliot is portrayed as pompous, but his unintended stupidity, which Redgrave brilliantly imprinted (in the 1995 version), is nowhere to be found. <br /> <br /> Sisters Musgrove are so unattractive that no one understands why Wentworth or anyone else looked at them. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wentworth and Ann is senseless. <br /> <br /> In the 1995 version, Hinds and Ruth were able to convey the depth of emotion they felt towards each other, with their body language and facial expression. In this film, it is difficult to understand that Ann spent years in regret, if not read the book. <br /> <br /> This production does not reflect the emotional complexity of the relationship of the main characters. <br /> In the scene, when Wentworth comes to Ann and Mary at breakfast, it seems to the audience that, as Mary thinks, they are only small acquaintances. <br /> <br /> In the 1995 version, when Wentworth enters (the first time he sees her in years), the tension is thick. Resentment comes from Wentworth in waves, while Ann is almost defeated. <br /> <br /> In this version, when Wentworth is caring for Lucia, it seems that he is really nested, that is, there are no undercurrents. In the 1995 version, the viewer sees Wentworth's anger at Ann. He parades his courting in front of Anna, as if to say: "Look what you quit, I don't need you anymore or I don't want you." <br /> <br /> However, he doesn’t care if she suffers, as the scene where he asks his sister and admiral to take Anna home. In the 1995 version, the viewer feels Anna’s shock that he will not care if she is tired, we also feel the discomfort of Wentworth that he still cares. In this version, he just walks with Lucia, as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> The main scene in which Ann talks to Harville about who loves the longest, a man or a woman, is completely spoiled. The actors simply repeat the lines without emotional attachments. <br /> <br /> When Ann reads a letter from Wentworth, she seems to be reading the shopping list. <br /> <br /> Compare this with the 1995 version, where the viewer feels Anna’s joy at her second chance. We are with her when she reads the letter. The director of both actors read the letter, and you hear both of their voices. Wentworth is full of disappointment, passion and hope, while Ann is at first mistrustful, and then develops into joy. <br /> <br /> In this performance there are more scenes after the revelation, perhaps because it was necessary to explain to the viewer what had just happened. The 1995 version did not need an explanation, we knew and were happy for the characters. The only thing with this production in her favor is that she kept the plot of Mrs. Smith untouched, and the 1995 version did not. <br /> <br /> The 1995 version, however, included part of the original Austin finals. The scene in which the admiral orders Wentworth to find out if Ann and Mr. Elliott would like to return to their home (which he and Mrs Croft rent) after they marry. <br /> <br /> This is a production that should be avoided at all costs.
