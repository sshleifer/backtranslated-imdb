After reading a lot of good things about it, I finally looked at the “clearing”. With a group of great actors such as Redford and Defoe, one could at least expect a decent film. After the closing credits ended, I was still shocked at how bad and incoherent this film really was. <br /> <br /> Should it be a “feature film”? I don't think so, because he is too melodramatic for that. The bad thing is that the drama seems too forced and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The truth is that the script makes absolutely no sense. First of all, he never explains the motives behind the actions of any characters, he simply outweighs their so-called "personal problems." What is so bad about the Redford character's life that he needs to “clean this up”? The fact that he sometimes cheats on his wife? The guy is a millionaire who had a good life, he has an excellent son and an excellent daughter, a wife who loves him (and a girlfriend, who also seems to be much higher than the general type of woman lover) and a newborn grandson. The only problem seems to be that he ... worked hard all his life to be successful, what person.So ?? It seems that his hard work really paid off, and there are actually no real problems with his life. <br /> <br /> Then we approach the character Dapho: here is someone who was the manager of one of the companies of Redford and was fired. Why is this guy unemployed for ... eight years ??? It seems that he must have some kind of good education in order to have a job similar to the one he had at the beginning and seems to be a man with solid ideas about his work (as can be seen from the memories of the conversation he had with Redford when worked for him). Why can't such a person get a decent job and a decent life? Because he was fired once? Absolutely unreal. <br /> <br /> In the film, these people are really portrayed as "Exhausted Souls" or something like that, and it sounds very silly. In fact, I would say that if the creators of this film tried something to say something about the American dream, then they failed miserably. <br /> <br /> As for the real events taking place during the film, they also have no sense. In fact, the last 20 minutes of the film seem offensive to the viewer. because there is not a single thing that really makes any sense. In Redf Rada, it seems, has about 1000 chances of salvation, but he does not do that. At some point he is ready to run away, and yet he misses his chance because he feels sorry for his captor and does not want to hurt him !!! Then Dapho raises his pistol out of the water and mud, which should be useless (if you shoot a pistol after the pistol was in the water and dirt can blow it in your face) and the pistol is in perfect condition !!! How unemployed, useless (as depicted in this film) and mentally unbalanced character, so easily manages to outwit the whole FBI, brings the story of this film to the levels of the “twilight zone”. to finish the viewer. <br /> <br /> This film is pretending to be something, but it’s not (ie a high-quality, complex psychological thriller). Unfortunately, he fails so badly that he becomes a catastrophe, and this word describes this film as the best: disaster.
