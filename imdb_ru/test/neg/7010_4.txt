*** SPOILERS *** Hot and sexy Linda Blair as the witch Amelia Reynolds is very upset by her friend and rival witch in Eric Barrens, Julie Strain. Amelia makes her husband Hal, Edward Albert, get promoted to his job at the law firm Giger & Greengrass for the more worthy Larry Barnes, Larry Poindexter, who turned out to be married to Eric, made her cast a spell on Hal, making him lose control over your car and eventually almost commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Larry, having learned about Erica’s attempt on the life of his best friend, fiercely fights with her, with the result that Erica fell from the balcony and died. It is when Larry returns to his ex-wife Carol, Rochelle Sanson, that everything starts to get hot, emotionally and sexually. Evil Amelia is trying to get Eric's dead spirit to capture Carol's body and eventually kill Larry, whom she considers responsible for the injury to her husband Hal, which has left him locked in a wheelchair forever. <br /> <br /> Not much history, but a lot of cheese and mild actions with poor Larry, whom Amelia manipulates through Erika’s resurrection, which plans to kill him as soon as possible when he turns away from her. Amelia is a little dumbfounded, not knowing exactly who is and who does not threaten her. Amelia even makes her poor and innocent gardener Stan Michael Parks first lose his family while breaking into a bloody house, and then his mind accused by the police of murder, and finally in life, having been killed by Amail himself. When he ran into Reynolds' house, under her control, as insane as the hatter trying to kill her and crippled Hal. <br /> <br /> Larry Parks looked and behaved so strangely that you had the feeling that he accidentally stepped onto the Witch movie set and ended up in the cast that played his role as Stan. Without the help or benefit of the script, he improvised, and then slowly realized how terrible this film really is. Stan, killed early in the film, was a big plus for him, as he did not have to suffer, as we do, watching the whole movie without a mind or daze. <br /> <br /> It becomes obvious to you as well as to the creators of The Sorceress that all these machinations on the screen must come to some encouraging and successful conclusion, and for the final completion of the film a tricky ending is put. The ending is about the best, except for Miss Blair and the rest of the very well-to-do actors, what can be said about the film.
