To begin with, I am not a person who appreciates films that I have not seen, and I am not the one who evaluates films 1 when they do not deserve it. This film was really so bad. The main plot was extremely formal, and, although it was not magnificent, the plot deserved about 5 points. What really bothered me was something about swimming in a movie. I have compiled a small list of things that are not suitable for swimming this film. <br /> <br /> 1. No character development. 2. No sense of time. 3. Completely inaccurate swimming scenes, which include: a. A team of six swimmers is going to the so-called "national" and "regional", without mentioning how they qualify. b. This is the same team that the hell went for it, without any real meeting at any time of the film. with. The competitive program moves from the high school to the club team back to high school, and then again to the club team. In the scene where Ellis interviews for work, the banners depict victories in high school and places in national tournaments, but the team consists of 5-12 swimmers, depending on which of the 3 competitions is taking place. e. A team of 5 guys and a girl win the national / regions. e. Said girl won the men's tournament "100 butterflies." d. In this race, according to the girl, she defeats two guys from the team that last year was in the top three in the country. The announcer changes the race from 200 breasts to 100 breasts back to 200 again in an interval of about 45 seconds. I. In the last relay, 4X100, which floats in a pool 50 meters long, one swimmer makes two turns. j. In the same relay, anchor swimmer teams go crazy and go off the blocks, causing inspiring talk of pep, which lasts about two and a half minutes, or about 3 times longer than the leg can take at national level competitions. j. The film begins in July or August, if it is assumed that Ellis submitted an application before the beginning of the school year, and the pool was to be closed after 3 months, so if we assume that both of these facts are true, the swimmers stopped swimming. to win national / regional, in less than two, since the pool had to be cleaned, and the children did not start practicing for a while. l I'm sure there are a couple hundred more, I'm just trying to block them from my memory. 4. In the film, there is no mention of the time of swimmers. 5. If you are going to make a film about swimming, it would be nice to hire additional ones who can swim well. 6. The scene where a child is kicked under water is physically impossible. <br /> <br /> However, all the swimming scenes were too slow, the swimmers had a terrible technique, and the idea of ​​being able to claim the National Assembly for three months after learning to swim simply offends swimmers everywhere. <br /> <br /> Well, if you still don’t believe me, let me say that this film is one of the 5 worst films I have. ever seen, and it comes from the guy who owns Gigli, Soul Plane, Manos: Hands of Fate, Skullduggery, and any other amount of all the crap that was filmed. Please, do not go!
