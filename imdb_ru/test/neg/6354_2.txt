They should be. I will list them so that you can check them one by one: <br /> <br /> - Police regularly leave tens of millions of dollars in cash and drugs, simply because they have no evidence of the Service. <br /> <br /> - When you are shot, you always grunt the same way and fly back the same way, even if there is never a trace on your body. <br /> <br /> - The police cannot detect the sound of gunfire and do not think that something is suspicious when a phone call from an undercover police officer during a high-level drug and money transaction was shot with this gun shot. <br /> <br /> - The bad guy’s machine gunners can hit mannequins with one shot, but they can't hit a big, bulky martial artist with 100. <br /> <br /> - If you launch a rocket car in the parking lot, the following three Cars on the same line will explode evenly at intervals of 15 seconds. <br /> <br /> - In addition to the last item, all cheap cars are always parked next to each other. <br /> <br /> - the smoke caused by the firing of a rocket launcher is much greater than the amount of smoke caused by the explosion of four cars. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games, far surpassing anything that any other gaming company can create on five diskettes. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games, far surpassing everything that any other gaming company has to offer, have graphics similar to those of Windows 3.1. <br /> <br /> - Floppy disks can be read even after they have been shot. <br /> <br /> - Half drunk guys in bars are closely watching the news when they are in the pub, and have a deep understanding of modern American military history, Agent Orange, and high-ranking military officials pedigrees. However, they can formulate their point of view only through dialogue, which sounds silly if someone is over seven years old. <br /> <br /> - Despite the fact that bar fights take place almost every hour, this bar is only one employee who pours beer and is engaged in security. Of course, he knows martial arts. <br /> <br /> - Gold medal Olympians regularly make a simple transition to corporate executives of software development companies for several years. <br /> <br /> - a woman who works for a company specializing in computer games knows everything about how to win a game she has never played, is constantly in awe of her rival's great games and can give facts and numbers relating to her company's rivals — but she did not know that they overtook almost all other companies in the field in large corporate mergers. <br /> <br /> - Bad guys always die in slow motion. Is always. <br /> <br /> - Wives tell their husbands that they are pregnant, admiring the courage of their man to kill the bad guys. <br /> <br /> - Wives do a great job of policing their husband; This may explain why she whines and complains so much every time he has to go to work. Although this does not explain why she adores him so much every time he gets up in the morning, and she can read about his suicidal escapes. <br /> <br /> - A police officer is quite typical to participate in kidnapping, kill tons of people three times and stop various illegal transactions for several million dollars a week. <br /> <br /> - When trying to lose a car that is following you, it is reasonable to continue driving under the speed limit And if you follow the cop, subtlety is not important - you can walk it for miles and then park next to it. He will not notice. <br /> <br /> - All cops are experienced martial arts masters. <br /> <br /> - You can hit a guy at a distance of four meters. <br /> <br /> - People scream or grumble from pain when they are punched or kicked, but when their arm is broken, they make no sound. <br /> <br /> The bad guys clean their bloody axes with handkerchiefs, and then leave them in your pocket for a few days. <br /> <br /> - When struck with a single sharp blow, pieces of wood break up strong stairs in six or more places at the same time. <br /> <br /> - The photograph and the listed special features on the back of the DVD cabinet do not have to be on the DVD. Advertised interactive menus? Why not without a menu at all! Index of the advertised scene? Why not have it all as a single scene / chapter, and don't need an index! Similarly, you can use the font and heading of the Matrix in the tag line, and in no case be plagiarized. <br /> <br /> For all this, I’m shocked that 12 of the top 15 actors never acted again.
