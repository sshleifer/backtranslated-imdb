I was 12 years old when this film was released and I adored it. The song was inspiring, and I was pleased when I watched it several times in the cinema. I had a soundtrack album, and I played this song again and again. <br /> <br /> 26 years later ... I am ashamed. I just sat and watched it with my two daughters who liked it, but my adult cynical adult eyes hated it. This is very badly targeted in many places, and, considering that it is directed by Lionel Jeffries, I really wanted to enjoy it. The character animation was so rough, but the backgrounds were pretty good. I remember how critics said at the time that this was a bad film and it was terrified, but now I agree. <br /> <br /> This is an old film, yes, compared to what can be achieved now, maybe that's why I thought it was good then. But this does not justify him for a bad game, directing and carelessness. The voice of the main child actor seems dubbed, which is also very distracting. I can not understand what they were trying to achieve when they were shooting, everything that he became was a weak film.
