I usually do not write reviews, in fact, I never write reviews. This film was so terrible that it actually inspired me to get started. Virtual sexuality tries to be frivolous and insolent youthful comedy concerning ordinary attributes; virginity, boys, etc., except for the main character, apparently, turns into her ideal boy, whom she created with the help of a machine at a technology fair. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting? Well, it is not. Acting is the most indecisive and terrible I've ever seen. Unfortunately, they seem to genuinely support the script and the film, which probably explains why I have never seen them in any memorable production since then. I did not bother to find out the names of the actors and their characters. The leading lady doesn’t admire or enchant you, and thus you don’t care about her at all. A leading lady's girlfriend does not cause sympathy, even when the script shouts loudly for you to feel sorry for him. The only boost he gets from you is extreme anger and sudden violence. The only half decent actor was a blond presenter who, despite his miserable weak role, really gave everything he could, which was not very much in the light of such terrible work. I won't even talk about acting abominations, which are the “bad guys” of the plot. But then again, what's the plot? <br /> <br /> I watched this film incredulously, since I had no idea how anyone would have the stupid courage to write such a script, not to invent, produce, act and direct it. I can only wonder. The only reason why my companion and I continued to watch such a disfigured example of a film was an incredulous laugh, which he managed to ignite because cohesion, logic, class, and even an impotent plotline were ignored during the film’s half hour. I absolutely do not know why someone wanted to break the film industry by publishing it to the public. This is a joke from the film, and it is best to collect dust in warehouses until the end of eternity. 1/2 out of 10. If that.
