So ... this is what is considered high art for such as the SXSW Film Festival and Sundance, huh? Well, I suppose I can tell, as long as the story, the script, the dialogues, the acting (with the exception of Mrs. Aselton), the cinematography and the editing, are completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I remember telling other friends who made movies a few years ago that the biggest problem with digital video was that we now needed to go through a sea of ​​shit to get to something what is worth seeing, now that anyone and his brother (or brothers in the case of Duplass') can escape and make a film. "Chubby chair." Should I say more? <br /> <br /> This full-length video is another chapter in the dark, ever-expanding world of dudeology films; young guns armed with a DVX100A, a few thousand dollars, a hastily written petty script and some friends whom they call actors who decided to make a film one fine day and voila! Don't get me wrong - I'm all about independent movies (i.e., Hollyver sucks). But, having said this, you cannot argue with some of the realities of this system. <br /> <br /> If the Duplass Brothers would have to go out and collect a real budget and attract real producers, it is clear that such a scenario would never be green! And therein lies the problem. There is no longer such a thing as an inspection process for preparing films (sorry ... video) for production. Just take a DV / P2 camera and go! Worse yet, high-profile festivals like the ones mentioned above actually support and encourage such nonsense. And why? Just because there is no budget. <br /> <br /> I think that it is very important, especially in today's climate of indie films, to stop letting video producers appreciate language, calling themselves "directors." There is a big difference in my book. When you need to go out and actually line up your screenplay, asking friends and relatives or business people for real money to make a feature film, knowing about potential losses at stake, then you will understand what it means to be a “director.” But quitting Several hundred Sam's Club for some videotapes, a little soda and chips - this does not mean. <br /> <br /> Oh ... and by the way ... I have to mention how annoying it was to listen to a woman who during the whole film was called "dude." Even Marc Borchardt reserves this overly abused pseudonym for his male friends only if it is at least charming when it comes to his buddy Mike! <br /> <br /> I think it’s time for the indie film community to start calling these crappy budgetless videos about who they are and at the same time scolding prestigious festivals for giving such occasional efforts, high praise. Either that, or ask these festivals to at least kindly add a new category to their festival line-ups ... "Dude Films".
