This film looked like it was urgently released for some reason. Definitely not a good movie. So incredible. The scene where the president (Holbrook) was in the center of the city and walked among the people was a farce. The common people would not have had the opportunity to be within 30 yards of the president in such a situation in real life. If it were not for the blood and profanity, it was filmed as a television film. It could be decent if it were done differently. The talents of Holbrooke (the president) were never implemented in this film. Shatner is fine. Production values ​​in this film leave much to be desired. In general, I think it would be better for most people not to waste time looking at this case.
