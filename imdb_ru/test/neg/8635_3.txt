The original version of George Sluizer's “The Disappearing”, “The Man Who Wanted to Know,” offers one of the most silent alarming sociopaths of European cinema and one of the most memorable finals of all time (unscrupulously kidnapped Tarantino for Kill Bill, volume two), but in it there is much more. offer than that. Playing with the chronology and turning over the usual clichés of the standard plots “The Lady disappears”, she also offers excellent characterization and strong, undervalued, but convincing performances. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can only assume that when it came to the In the remake, Sluizer was so determined that no one else would get a chance to spoil his film when he was capable of it, but few could anticipate how completely he will destroy his own work. His career has never recovered from this catastrophic mistake. <br /> <br /> The main culprit is Jeff Bridges ’amazing presentation, which has been thought out to the smallest detail to a truly catastrophic level. A friend who produced one of his earlier films noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor while you were preventing him from thinking about what he was doing, and this film is proof of pudding. Each movement is overly mechanical in its accuracy, making it look like a rusty windup toy, while its voice is a bizarre mix of Tutsi, Latka Gravas from Taxi and Dalek, who all took lessons from Doc-t-E Vil. There is no banality of evil here, just crazy, walking around with an invisible sign above his head, saying: “Please. Let me. To me. Kill You. Thank. For yours. Consideration. But the blame here really needs to be shared. None of the performances is good: often they don't even look good? Kifer Sutherland looks more like a hamster than a distraught man in his wit in hasty scenes at Nancy Travis gas station floundering heavily, and Sandra Bullock does not seem at all like an obsession object. Not that the director or writer Todd Graff helped them. The script is especially weak. The chronology has been changed. Focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the pair when opening the film. Worse is the impulse in which the film is located, draining the life and character of each scene in its race to get to the next one. Instead of high / low mood in a couple's relationship, or, apparently, an accidental but careful determination of a sense of place, we simply get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he is probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy end, Stan Dard woman chased after Nutter in the forest, something dangerous with the lame moment “Let's end with a joke, like a TV cop show” ?? better not go there ?? This is the advice that holds for this whole movie wreck. Even shockingly soft and boring, Jerry Goldsmith can't do anything about it.
