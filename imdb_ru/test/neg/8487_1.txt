Well, I had the opportunity to watch this movie the other day. I didn’t know what to expect since I’ve never seen a trailer and the like ... but what I found out just by watching the first 10 minutes is that this film is the worst thing I've ever had the misfortune to see . <Br /> <br /> I would like to give this film a rating of 0. The first 10 minutes were bad, but as soon as I went to the party scene, I just wanted to enter a coma, it was really badly done. The actors did not have any direction, there was no real story, I read some reviews, which say that it’s good if you have a small child to have fun for 90 minutes, etc. ... but actually Why should we expose children to this kind of film? He has a bad humor, a rough and rough comedy at best, and she focuses on bad special effects to fill 80% of the time. I'm sure a few people in Hollywood will take to the streets after the bombs of this film. <br /> <br /> In addition, as 39 people can give this film 10 points. has some mental problems and or works in a film company. This film should average 1.5 / 10 instead of the current 2.3 / 10 due to people who rated it 10. Really sad.
