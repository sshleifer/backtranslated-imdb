The postapocalyptic warrior leaves to save some nun, and on the way meets cyber-punks on skates who want to kick his ass. This is one of the most difficult to watch movies. There are scenes with silence that seem to last several hours before someone leaves with the next badly written, poorly functioning line. There are sequences of actions that continue to be repeated - and we are not talking about fast fiery 1-2-3 repetitions on a particularly good beat that was popular with Oriental directors, we talk many, many repetitions of long, bad battle sequences. At first, this is incredibly confusing. , but then it quickly becomes annoying when you watch the 30-second sequence for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time. Any kind of plot or vision is lost in the confusing continuity, the only thing that keeps this film in the video player (except for a bet from a friend, that I could not watch it all the time without asking to turn it off) and safely disposed of so as not to harm anyone else) the fact that this film, although painful, unintentionally hilarious, I am not at all a fan of those films like “so bad it is funny,” but in some parts it was in tears. Other points to pay attention to are the quality of the sound and image, but this is forgivable, since it is obvious that money was the main problem in making this film. The final verdict is the King of the “so bad that they are funny” genre, anyone who has such a video evening genre should get a copy. Also, let's not forget that this is actually the worst movie I've ever seen.
