Oh, what an original title for a very cheesy movie. Rewriting is fun, because voices and mouths never match. As a result, I had no idea what was happening when I watched this mess unfold. There are memories inside the memories, and there is no real time until the very end. The Aztec ceremony made me laugh. I repeated it twice and got a better workout. The Aztec lady singing is comic and dances and costumes are a scream. Some guy has a face full of acids, a lot of struggle, you have no idea who the character is (not that I really care about him), and this is a complete mess. Yes, and the real fight does not happen for some time, so during the movie feel free to get up, take a nap, go on a trip. You will not miss anything exciting.
