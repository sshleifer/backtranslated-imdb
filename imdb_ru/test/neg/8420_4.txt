Dry and disrespectful, but, unfortunately, unfamiliar satire of detective films, with the stone face of Michael Kane, who plays the British author of bad crime stories, traveling to the Mediterranean to help write the memoirs of a potential gangster; he soon realizes that he is being watched, and his life is in danger. Kane talks about what is happening with considerable cunning and sarcastic sarcasm, but his real work is devoid of energy (Kane’s sudden outbursts of anger or frustration seem to come from nowhere, and he doesn’t meet anyone on the screen). Other actors (in particular, Mickey Rooney, gray-haired Lionel Stander and Lizabeth Scott) do an excellent job with colorfully contrived roles, although Al Lettieri has an offensive role because he clearly disguises himself as a homosexual (Lettieri is insulted, unable to defend himself, an unenviable position) . Writer-director Mike Hodges has a good idea (to make fun of detective films of the 1940s without jeopardizing abrupt conversations and situations), but he has no keen sense of humor. When the double of Bogart - asking a question about a falcon - is the best joke, then the next one is really anemic. ** from ****
