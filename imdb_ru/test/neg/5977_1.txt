The title makes the audience believe that watching this funny movie and, perhaps, much better when it is viewed under the influence, but this is not good at all. One 15-minute episode with Jack Black, who plays one of his songs beautifully and stumbles over acid while traveling in the woods, does not at all save this film. Each actor in this film did the best things, except for the main girls, whom I could not recall of any movie where I had seen them before. I hate making films, but I also hate not finding something decent in movies. The film is sad, not very funny and has such potential with its amazing cast. If it was redone and rewritten, it would be great. If you want to see a fossil in a good movie, see “Grandma's Boy” or “Half Baked” or “Stunned and Lost”, but this film cannot be seen at all.
