This film is about a complex friendship, romance and deception between two men and two women during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> It was a lot of effort to make the “Edge of Love” look like it should. However, I find this effort too excessive, especially in terms of tone colors. Most of the first half of the film is processed to have a strong bluish tint. It is difficult to understand who is who in this tone. <br /> <br /> Another harmful moment is the unusual use of a split-lens image. There are many scenes in which there are three or four images of the same thing, for example, three smiling faces of Keira Knightley or four pairs of arms in an embrace. It just makes the film confusing and difficult to understand, not artistic. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it’s boring. The way the story unfolds is not at all attractive. The unstable nature of Sienna Miller is annoying. In fact, all the main characters are annoying and unlikely. Keira Knightley's accent is impossible to understand, which makes it another obstacle to understanding the plot. <br /> <br /> I strongly advise you to avoid “The Edge of Love”, unless you are watching a movie just to appreciate the magnificent costumes, beautiful scenery and lighting.
