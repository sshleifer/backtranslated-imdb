Frankie Muniz plays Jason, who is in high school. His biggest problem is that his life is built on little or big lies, which often gives him trouble. However, he cannot escape from his teacher, and he finishes his homework in creative writing shortly before his deadline. While he bikes fast to pass on his homework to a teacher, he bumps into a car. When he explains the situation to an angry man (Jamati) in the car, he drives him to school. But the problem is that Jason leaves his homework in the car, another way of saying that this is Marty Wolf (Giamatti), stealing him. <br /> <br /> A few months later, Jason goes to the movies and sees a trailer that takes him off guard. Because the story of the film is based on his homework. He tells his parents about this, but, of course, they do not believe him. Especially his father uses words that insult him. Jason decides to go to Los Angeles and find Wolf, to tell his father that Jason is not a liar. When the Wolf refuses it, Jason takes action and destroys his life. <br /> <br /> This is a story about the Big Fat Liar. Well, as a childâ€™s film, it may be frivolous, but there are some mistakes that may even ask if this is possible. For example, having such a small amount of money and going to Los Angeles with a friend to sort out the problem, having access to the secure home and office of this filmmaker, setting up a telecommunications system overnight. Does this seem believable? Is not. Well, this is a children's film, but children are not so gullible. <br /> <br /> Big fat liar delivers some pleasure to his target audience. Unfortunately, I'm not a big fat liar to say that this is a good movie. ** outside *****
