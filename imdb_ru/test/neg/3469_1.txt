I can't understand how this picture was allowed to do. It’s basically, if not completely, so inaccurate that the main character doesn’t even look like the story looked physically. This film made me go online and look through my books to make sure that I remember Nero’s personality correctly. For God's sake, I have a book in which Nero is named one of the most evil people in the world, and because of this film I felt bad from him. I must say that the character of Aggrafina seemed close to my understanding of it, both physically and psychologically. Although all the actors did a great job, the film was terrible, and I’m sure that I’ll not watch the others shot by this pathetic team.
