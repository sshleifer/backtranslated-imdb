Inexpensive version of Ashley Judd's Double Hazard. Sutherland is too professional to be bad, but what did Bridget Fonda think about?!? Penelope's Ann Miller's curse continues (Think about it - when was she ever in a good movie other than Aliens? And I don’t say she’s bad, but all her films somehow fail).
