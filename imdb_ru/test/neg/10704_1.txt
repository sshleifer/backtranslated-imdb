I do not think it can legally qualify as a “film.” The plot was so inconclusive, the dialogue was so superficial, and the lines so horrible that I could not believe that someone actually wrote down these lines, said: “Damn it! This is a masterpiece, ”and then conveyed to the director. For example, I am still stunned and will forever remember this film as a sign of the degeneration of intelligence in America - and, of course, “Crossroads”.
