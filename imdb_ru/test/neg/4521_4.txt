Here the thrill of a low-cost film noir. And there is frustration with wandering, uninteresting cheap movies. This one falls into the second category. <br /> <br /> The Spot is the name of a nightclub. A film about a policeman whose father was killed by gangsters. He goes to track them down. <br /> <br /> This may have been a bad print. Maybe it's me. But I felt that I had seen it a hundred times, in most cases better than here. <br /> <br /> He also has a promise: the policeman is fascinated by the woman who plays the records that she puts on the box's jook. Then they meet. Now, although it was done long before I was born, I saw such a box with a jukebox. And it is incredibly fascinating: when I was a teenager, I wandered into a bar where there was such a device. I always liked jukeboxes, in bars or snack bars. But this one was different. You spoke to this, and a sultry female voice spoke to you! It is considered here, but in general, uninteresting stew. <br /> <br /> There is one thing in the film: a very young Ann Jeffries is involved in a small role. What she was beautiful, and, undoubtedly, until now!
