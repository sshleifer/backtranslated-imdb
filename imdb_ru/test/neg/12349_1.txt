All professional comments about this film claim that the film is balanced. This is their main excuse to praise the film. But the film is not balanced when the main analyzed criminal is given the last world in each subject. The director herself admitted this at the first show of the film festival in San Francisco. She justified this by saying that she could not miss the chance to gain access to Fujimori. This might be true, but by demonstrating that Fujimori takes into account these problems, the film becomes pro-Fujimori clearly unbalanced. I will let any of the other commentators prove it wrong. Tips 1: The statement that Harvard professors, intellectuals, and Latin American diplomats agree with you will not help your argument (use logic). Tip 2: disagreeing with the director will not help your argument either (the director says that he thinks Fujimori is charismatic and patriotic, and that's why she portrayed him that way)
