This is the epitome of bad cinema of the 80s, if you are not a girl before puberty. Ride on such a loud name as Madonna, a storyline that physically attacks intellect and humor, which is best suited for kindergarten. If ever there was any doubt, I think this film clearly demonstrates the complete absence of Madonna’s acting talent and made me feel very embarrassed on her behalf. The only thing I can’t believe is that they again allowed the director to watch another movie again. Madonna spends most of the film, acting out like a children's rag doll, and talking like a child. It is terribly obvious that the only reason this film was ever shot was because Madonna was a celebrity in pop music at the time. DO NOT THINK TO SEE THIS HORRIBLE ATTEMPT TO CASH ON POP STARDOM. Stay away at all costs!
