-So the weak justification of history in the total waste of time associated with a guy who wants to be an animator, but can not make his career in place. His super hot wife is more successful, and she doesn’t seem to care that he is a loser, but the man is not satisfied with this and wants to get more out of his life. One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life. Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask, and as soon as he finds a masked man, he tries to bring him back, and this is the whole story. If this sounds exciting to you, then someone has to pour water on you to wake you up. <br /> <br /> - This is a terrible movie. I have no other way to say it, and I just cannot stretch it. The only good thing about all of this was the woman who played Jamie Kennedy's wife, who was hot, but there is nothing else in this film that is worth seeing. I know that it is intended for children, and therefore it is so idiotic, but what about adults who need to take their children to watch this garbage? Why do we have to suffer through this nasty gagging bag of terrible shit. The original mask was a very good film, which was a great combination of comedy and wonderful stories. This is an unsuccessful attempt by hacked filmmakers to make money on a franchise, and, judging by the ridiculous gross, I think there will be no more franchise. <br /> <br /> The cinematographer must be beaten severely because the sweet colors of the film will make you feel like vomiting. If there was music, I did not pay attention to it, because I had already pierced my eardrums so as not to hear a terrible dialogue. Then there is acting, or at least that which is suitable for acting today. You could watch a commercial and see a lot better than the one in this film, but I can't blame the actors, because it’s a director who deserves guilt for not apparently realizing that the actors needed play another king to take. If a new line hopes to start a franchise with this, then they need to improve their game, hiring authors who can really write, and stop thinking that the audience will be watching any shit that goes <br /> <br /> - Down if you are a sadomasochist and love to torture yourself, please check it by all means, because it hurts to watch, but if not, and you really like to watch good films, then avoid at all costs
