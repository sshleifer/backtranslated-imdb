No, he's sick. It does not hurt. It made me want to vomit because I spent 2 dollars on it. It's boring, backward and annoying. I have not seen the MST3K version, which sucks because I am sure that the MST3K version was funny. Sadly, people spend money on such films. I’m surprised that he’s not on the list of the 100 Worst Movies of All Time. <br /> <br /> TromaDude Rating - 0 points from *****
