In terms of quality films, this is not one of them. In fact, this is the first film of Chuck Norris, which I saw, and I was delighted. The fighting scenes are slow and do not have much variety. Norris just uses a lot of beats to turn all the bad guys behind him, which makes fights pretty boring. The film is also quite short, but for some reason the film does not even seem to end when it ends. This is a rather anti-climatic ending. However, I watched a lot of bad movies, and this is not one of the worst I've seen. Worth seeing, probably, specifically for Norris fans. There is nothing better than to see a group of rigs sweeping across the desert, which, in my opinion, was the highlight of the film.
