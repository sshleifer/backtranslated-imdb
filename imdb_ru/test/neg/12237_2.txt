Sometimes things just don't have to be done. And although the situation seemed good enough, it makes the viewers gasp in horror. But the problem is that this is not another film "Saw". It is unfortunate that you regret that you did not receive punishment from Jason Voorhees. <br /> <br /> I lost count of how many sports films and parodies were included in the movie. And in general, it failed in his attempts. True, telling their team that they have to fail every object in order to be real players, at first it was a little ridiculous, but it was tiring to look at it. This is a joke about "Radio" and "iPod". <br /> <br /> In general, I can not watch this movie again. Even Trantasia is worth more than that. "D-"
