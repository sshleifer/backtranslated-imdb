I read the Scarlett book and was expecting a good movie when I first saw it. I am afraid to say that I was disappointed. The film did not follow the book and made many changes that I did not like. <br /> <br /> One of the changes I didnâ€™t like, as depicted by Lord Fenton. There was no reason to consider him a bad person. The way things ended between Lord Fenton and Scarlett was completely different, and their relationship was too close. <br /> <br /> In the film between Scarlett and Rett, there was much less confrontation than was originally written in the book. The film sent them in two completely opposite ways, and they did not seem to intersect often enough to create the impression that there could still be love between them. A good film, but I believe that it certainly could be better than it would have been if it were more faithful to the book of Alexandra Rippley.
