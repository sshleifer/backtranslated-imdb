For the series, which was inspired by Kolchak, it is ironic that the first attempt at the X-Files in the episode with a vampire landed right on his ass. 3 always puzzled me and - at the risk of looking like the terrible Hans Keller - I often wondered if I missed the point. This story resembles a puzzle in which there are pieces that do not fit the box, and as a result you spend a cozy evening by the fire, trying to pick up the sky, which really is the sea. This incomplete feeling remains regardless of how many times you have re-visited the episode and how much attention you paid to it. I know that this review puts me in danger of being dragged into Whitby by teenage vampires who drink my blood while listening to Busted, but Iâ€™m willing to take that risk. I've always been a werewolf man.
