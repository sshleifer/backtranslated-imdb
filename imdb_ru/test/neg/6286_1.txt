Wow ... After reading these comments, I see a wonderful socio-cultural theme of the clash between the US and ... the Dutch! USA P.O.V. It seems like a pretty good little movie, Parker is a likeable hero, a story about the reckless performance of a glorified form of reality. <br /> <br /> All three Dutch reviewers see the world through a completely different pair of points. They categorically and surprisingly agree that the film is a disaster. <br /> <br /> I cannot take part in what seems to be a dispute between cultures, on this issue as broad as the ocean, which divides them geographically. However, based on actual observations - I saw the film with my own eyes - I suspect that the Dutch are not too far from the truth: <br /> <br /> Parker Kane is poorly made, completely boring and really not worth that celluloid which was undoubtedly wasted in its creation.
