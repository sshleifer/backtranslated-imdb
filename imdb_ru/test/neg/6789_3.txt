I never thought that I would be caught saying the following: But I think that Dog Hunter is more interesting than the drama of the police of the 90s. Walker is very melodramatic and in fact sets the standard for the genre of the High Octane show, for example, CSI, CSI: Miami, and so on. I'm not saying that all these shows are bad, but they are not very good. I like the action of karate, which Walker distributes to the enemies of justice, and the variety of characters, as well as the scientific technology of the CSI series. But there are some elements that I hate in a show like this. Stereotypes / Countertypes! That's right, stereotypes / counter-types! Unfortunately, this is a show for moderates in the Red State of America who refuse to part with the old prejudices of the past, especially when it comes to crime. For example, there was an episode in which a child with extrasensory abilities goes to Dallas, where he meets a group of children in Goth / Punk clothes, and they begin to stalk him. Now! This is exactly what goth / punk culture is perceived in Central America. I mean, come on, how often are people who dress like this robber and steal from people who just go about their business. Whenever there are blacks and Hispanics in the plot, it's always about gangs in some poor neighborhood. Good! Not everyone who is a minority is a desperate gang recruiter surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. Again, this is what Medium Red America sees these people. Finally, why is Trivette an awkward bosom friend, can't you make him a bosom player?
