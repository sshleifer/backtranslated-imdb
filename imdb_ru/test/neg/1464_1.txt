This film was shot with a digital camera, and it shows. There were enough annoying digital tricks used to repel the viewer, including using a terrible score. As if that wasn't enough, the action was also terrible. Now in the Hartley films, acting is always peculiar, but here it was just BAD, especially Satan (Thomas J. Ryan) and Harvey, who (thank God) cannot say much. After all these external problems, it is also very regrettable that the story itself is not so good. The jokes are predictable and incredibly simple, and the events just roar from one incident to another. The so-called book of life with Armageddon inside is no more than a pretext for actors to struggle to express their opinions. In general, this film is a waste of time, money and effort. Thumbs down.
