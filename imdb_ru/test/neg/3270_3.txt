Every time I watch this movie, blood flows from my eyes. Yes, you read that right: I have often observed this vile, dirty thing. <br /> <br /> Caddyshack 2 went wrong for many reasons: Harold Ramis picks up the script and refuses management responsibilities, Rodney Dangerfield (wisely) leaves the project because they won't let him mess with the script, Bill Murray demonstrates excellent judgment and does not participate in it, and the puppet is put forward as the main player of the cast, which deserves much better. <br /> <br /> I can't help but think about Diane Cannon and think about why she constantly laughs and smiles. The only conclusion I can make is that she really is the face of pure evil. Stay with me. She must have watched the film come together, and in inexpressible agony he felt that countless people would soon be very sorry for the viewers with whom this film would be imposed on them. Perhaps she was also extremely drunk. This is what I have to be right now in order to wash away the disgusting taste of this complete and total failure. If I'm lucky, he will be washed away forever. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie several times. I blame some of them in my childhood and for being a very dull and blunt boy who clearly had no aesthetic sensitivity. Perhaps dolls are just funnier when you're a kid. No, the Muppets are funnier now ... I think I was just boring. Caddyshack 2 is the rare kind of film that is so unusually disappointing on many levels, that after the final credits you are convinced that it could not be as bad as all that. It was. This is. Over time, this will only worsen. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, my reasons for going back to this film are getting smaller. Randy Quaid is limited in his attorney role to Jackie Mason. His initial scene is not bad and caused my only laugh. We see him a few more times, but he becomes as tired as the rest of the film, and descends with dismal speed from randomly amusing into empty wastelands. Randy Quaid has proven himself, and this film owes him a great time, because if there was a reason to watch this film as something other than the tactics of torture, he was it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is the trick of the film. He has enough potentially attractive qualities that people look at him, horrified by what they did to themselves, but later, because the fees were so thin, you can only remember what really amused them. Over the years, they unwittingly watch him again, and the cycle repeats. <br /> <br /> Jackie Mason assumes much of the blame for this film, but frankly, I'm not sure that he deserves it. He is really trying to be there, but itâ€™s impossible not to notice that he is conducting the entire film, playing the role of Rodney Dangerfield. For this, the film was written, but I'm not sure that even he could save him. Ultimately, this fails because of the terrible direction, poor editing (we assume errors in continuity?) And paraphrasing the same story without a single perverted humor or heart that made the first film charming. <br /> <br /> Dragged kicking and shouted up to three out of ten instead of two by definition Bulldog Randy Quaid. We must not even laugh badly. I definitely saw the worst, but believe my memory is a dog. If you have never seen it, you have made an excellent choice in life, and I applaud your excellent judgment.
