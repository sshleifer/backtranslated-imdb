Attractive husband and wife, writing team Robert Wagner (like Joel Gregory) and Kate Jackson (like Donna Gregory) arrive at the creepy mansion of actress Lorna Love (in fact, Harold Lloyd’s silent film star). Mr. Wagner and Miss Jackson signed a contract to write a silent film star biography. Wagner is personally interested in the project, as his father was once the lover of a famous star. Mysterious events unfold, and Jackson must fight to save her husband from the spirit of a beautiful blonde who is “perfectly preserved” in the crypt on the estate; Moreover, the evil woman seems to want to seize her husband and kill Jackson! <br /> <br /> This is largely a variation of the “Night of Dark Shadows”, in which the real graduates of the “Dark Shadows” Kate Jackson participate, who know and play their role well. Robert Wagner lacks the intensity of David Selby. Sylvia Sidney (as Mrs Josephs) bypasses Grayson Hall. Marianna Hill is not suitable for Lara Parker (or Diane Millay). Bill Macy (as Oscar Payne) is good at the role played by John Carlen (directed by Dan Curtis). <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell, John Carradine and Dorothy Lamour are smooth cameos. , Miss Lamour's delivery reminds Joan Bennett, in connection with which the question arises: why did producer Aaron Spelling not receive more of the original Dark Shadows regulars? <br /> <br /> Directed by E. W. Suokhamer was the husband of Bridget Hanley; He worked with Mrs Blondel on Here Come the Brides and Jackson on The Rookies. “Death in the House of Love” may have a tougher storyline than the film “Night of Dark Shadows”; he is different from the point of view of a movie star; and in its ending “Father of Eternal Flame”, it more closely resembles the plot of the series “Laura Phoenix”. <br /> <br /> **** Death in the House of Love (9/3/76) E. W. Suokhamer ~ Robert Wagner, Kate Jackson, Sylvia Sidney
