Well, this movie was not as awful as I thought. I expected to give him one star. I decided to give him three. What for? Well, for a raw horror / sci-fi movie, it's not that bad. Of course, the characters are tasteless (like their acting skills - including the young Leonardo DiCaprio), cheap effects and monsters ... well, let's just say that I saw more effective Halloween costumes for elementary school ... But there was something that made me see it to the end. I think humor helped a little. And if you ever wanted to see someone else's gas passing through, this film will allow you to realize your dream. 3/10
