Do not worry - there are no spoilers, they just say that the plot is very predictable. The couple decides to live in their father's love nest so they can write a book / article / newsletter about his journey with the famous tragic Hollywood star. This entire production resembled a high school troupe that made the episode “Murder It Wrote”. The only action I was sold on was the old horseradish interview with sources in history. Obviously, the directors thought that the film was getting too long, so by the end they stopped directing their camera to some kind of creepy star image and brought in plot amplifiers to wrap this thing. Do not waste your time - even the tried and true classic of horror / intrigue will fail in this film.
