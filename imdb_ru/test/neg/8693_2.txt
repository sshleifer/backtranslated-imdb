A good attempt to revive Shakespeare's language in a post-apocalyptic setting, but the end result is terrible. Futuristic Liverpool is far from convincing; the budget was obviously not very large, but the designer could come up with a slightly more creative approach to this issue. Alex Cox made some good films, for example Repo Man and Highway Patrol Man, but I really donâ€™t know what he was thinking here. Just an opinion.
