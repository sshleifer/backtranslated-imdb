As a person who loves baseball history, especially at the beginning of the 20th century, in which Cobb was the main figure, along with a bunch of colorful characters, I was looking forward to watching this baseball movie. Well, it was not a baseball movie that was disappointing. No, it was just a sports writer telling that he was with Cobb in recent years, when they played on a book together. Even so, this could be a more attractive film than they did. <br /> <br /> Of course, Cobb was not a good guy at all, an extremely talented player, but cruel in that he would do everything to beat you. ... and he was viscous, frightening and had many demons to fight. He was so hated that his own teammates tried to hinder his chances of winning a batting title for one year. However, this is an excessive image of a person. It turns it into something almost animated. <br /> <br /> Watching and listening to how an old, pompous, enthusiastic and secular for two hours is entertainment? No, it is not. Someday I would like to see a real biographical film about Cobb, showing him in his baseball days, and if they want to portray him as an evil guy, so be it, but the way they did it here, with just a bitter, sacrilegious old doing his ass in front of a reporter is not fun to watch.
