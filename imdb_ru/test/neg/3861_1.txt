I have seen a lot of films over the years, and I'm a big fan of comedies. <br /> <br /> But this so-called comedy almost brought me to tears. No doubt this is the worst movie I have ever seen, the worst. <br /> <br /> I remember hearing about this movie from a friend, and decided to watch it. If I could, I could turn back the clock, I would. I will regret how long I live and spend time watching this garbage. <br /> <br /> Storyline is so crazy; it just doesn't make any sense and leaves you confused. There is a Scottish crowd and a German bounty hunter who pursues Vargas Pestario "Pest" (John Leguizamo), the Scottish mafia after 50,000 dollars and the Germans after his head. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to escape from Pest, it takes the form of many disguises. But at the same time, we are witnessing some of the most annoying, worst, stunning actions, dialogue and sounds in the history of cinema. This film annoyed me so much; by the end i was full of aggression. I was so angry that I spent so much time watching a movie that would surely bring depressed people almost to suicide. I mean, how can there be hope when such a film can be given permission to create? <br /> <br /> I know that people have their own opinions, but the most shocking thing about The Pest is that people really like it. , What for? What is so funny about a person who is annoying from the first second to the last? A person who can not act? Who has an annoying voice and a vague face? <br /> <br /> I sat thinking that the film would be better, of course it would. This is not true. Usually you want a good guy to survive, but I wanted the Germans or the Scottish crowd to find and kill Pest, whatever, in order to save me from suffering. There is nothing funny, interesting or normal in this film, it is just annoying and confusing. The jokes are dead before they are told. I am sorry for the operators who can not say how the film is being shot, but in fact are forced to shoot this nonsense. I would not be surprised if they get a consultation. <br /> <br /> If you want to stay sane and be part of society, I advise you never to watch this movie. I would rather lock myself in my room for 5 weeks and be left without food or water than watch this movie again! <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t think I will ever hate anything more than that.
