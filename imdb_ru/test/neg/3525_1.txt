Let me see ... I saw every movie that Lou Ferrigno made. I have seen Batman and Robin ... twice. I remembered dancing in Breakin '2: Electric Boogaloo ... I watched unfinished student films about Blade Runner excerpts ... but this film is the most painful thing I've ever seen. <br /> This was the first film for "Right on the video market". So you can thank Blood Cult for all these mysterious Michael Dudikoff movies in your local blockbuster. You should know that this is not even high-quality video. This is consumer class. This is your father's video camera, which he never uses. This is what you should look at for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I wonâ€™t bore you with the plot details, as I fall asleep just thinking about it, but I will tell you that watching this movie is a form of torture. I only watch this movie when I'm angry with myself. Therefore, I recommend this film if you are prone to suicide or if you are preparing for a serious challenge. <br /> <br /> If you are lucky enough to rent this movie (have mercy), you will find out what awaits you from the first 10 minutes. This is when you were struck by the usual horror movie intro. You know what to do. Before any girl dies, a lot of suspense arises. Yes, you have seen it before, but not like this. This is the most boring entry I've ever seen. I sincerely believe that you could take a ten-dollar camera off ebay, take the ass that smells like gin and candy most of all, and tell him to shoot your mom preparing dinner, and that would be more interesting than this introduction . I'm bored to tears. I cried like a baby. <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes this film so incredibly painful is its actors. Yes, I saw a bad game. TRUST ME. I saw Oliver Twist's productions in 4th grade with a more realistic dialogue. The main actor makes me sick. "Supporting" actress - the collapse of man. <br /> <br /> I won't even comment on the guy. This horror. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if you can. You will never be overwhelmed by spending $ 3 on anything else.
