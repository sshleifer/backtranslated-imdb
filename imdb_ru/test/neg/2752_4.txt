Shemp learns that he will inherit a million dollars IF he is married for 24 hours. Given the way he looks disgusting and his personality, it is not surprising that he cannot get a taker - that is, until an article appears in the newspaper explaining his predicament - at this moment five crazy women appear who do not claim to demand their new hubby (plus, of course, money). <br /> <br /> Although I don’t hate Three Puppets and I don’t like to watch their shorts from time to time, they never, even on their best day, came close to Buster Keaton's brilliant comedy. That is why I did not like this film, since it was the robbery of the plot from Keaton's masterpiece “SEVEN CHANCE”. In Stooges for Columbia Pictures, old comedic plots were often stolen or simply old stooge shorts were reworked. So, from the very beginning this film is a pale imitation of the original. It is also obvious that in this film there is no charm and subtlety of the original, and the gags, as a rule, seem very forced (especially the scene in the telephone booth). Bit cousin Basil, however, was quite sweet and funny - although far from being refined! However, the worst aspect of the film was not a particularly funny conclusion. In Keaton’s version, hundreds of women seemed to marry him, and the action was very fast and furious — here everything remained in one small room without a comedy blow — ending in failure. <br /> <br /> In general, a blunt recovery. In addition, before you mark this review as “useless”, be sure to FIRST look at “SEVEN CHANCE” to see what I'm talking about - then you decide.
