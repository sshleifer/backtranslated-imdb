This is one sad, inert, important splinter. When the only thing that suddenly gives life to a film is to freeze, you know that the company has failed. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Truman Capote as an insect-like, self-complacent caricature with a cartoonish voice. Why it is thus never explained, and we get scant reference information. The script focuses on writing Capote "In Cold Blood" and his attachment to the injured brothers who killed a family of four. Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), the famous writer of Kill a Mockingbird, accompanies Capote in his initial investigations into the crime, and her presence immediately suggests a much more interesting subject for a biographical film. Unfortunately, Lee quickly walked away to Capote’s endless scenes mourning his painful existence. Looking at him is like watching Dr. Smith from Lost in Space complain of his “delicate back” to anyone who will listen for two hours. The difference, however, is that Smith was fun to watch, but Capote was not. The precious self-image of the film kills him, as does the reluctance of director Bennett Miller to add any hues. Like the dark piano score, the film is an amazing miracle, in which there is no contrast, emotional coloring and intimate drama. If Capote was really annoyed, why make a film about him and expect viewers to watch it? Despite the fact that the supporting roles are well-played (Chris Cooper is usually his persistent person), they serve such a small dramatic goal because, ultimately, it's all Capote (!), Director Bennett and screenwriter Dan Futterman cannot attract their target audience, because it is clearly struck by the cultural baggage of the "legend" Capote. Their product is a stillborn Oscar bait ... and this is more proof that in one great genre film there is more "truth" than a dozen heaps of such sincere crap like this one.
