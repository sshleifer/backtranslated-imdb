I was really looking forward to this movie. Commercials made it really cool and rich. And I heard that the character Claire Danes was arrested for the attack, so I thought that maybe she would kick a lot of asses, and that would be cool. BUT NOOOOOOOOOO !! Their actions were practically inactive, and the character was rather mild. The only saving grace was Omar Epps, and even he did not really help this film.
