Congo is based on Michael Crichton's bestseller, which I thought was devoid of the usual charisma, clever characters and Crichton's punch. Well, sorry, but the same applies to the film. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot: <br /> <br /> Greed is bad, this simple moral story warns. Megalomaniac C.E.O. (Joe Don Baker) sends his son to the dangerous African Congo in search of a source of diamonds large enough and clean enough to function as a powerful transmitter of laser communications (or is this a laser weapon?). When the connection with his son and team is lost, his sister-in-law (Laura Linney), a former CIA operative and computer fan, follow. In her search, she is accompanied by monstrous gadgets and several eccentric characters (including a mercenary (Ernie Hudson), a researcher with a talking gorilla (Dylan Walsh) and a Indiana-Jones-type psycho looking for King Solomonâ€™s mines). (Tim Curry). After a few narrow shoots from ground-to-air missiles and some African wild animals, they all discover that often what we most want is the source of our fall. <br /> <br /> The actors in this film were not talented. Dylan Walsh behaves like a miserable cry, especially at the end; Ernie Hudson is unconvincing (not surprising that he starred in television films?), And Laura Linney is nothing special. I think I can say with confidence that the only talented actors in this film had very small roles: Joe Don Baker and Tim Curry, always a pleasant actor (although he sometimes remained scarred for life when he was constantly reminded of his days "Rocky Horror"). There were also some other problems in this film, including the horrible style of directing, the cheese dialogue and just the boring plot, which was completely mixed up from Crichton's novel. <br /> <br /> Even the effects of the creation of Stan Winston could not save this film from disaster. I am deeply disappointed in this film; there was not even an indecent quality to redeem themselves. It was just awful, cheesy, boring and funny, and it turned out to be one of the worst performances of Crichton, dedicated to the book in the movie. <br /> <br /> 2/5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
