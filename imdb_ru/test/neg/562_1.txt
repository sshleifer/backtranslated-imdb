The man with the face of Bogart sets himself up to stir up nostalgia among the audience in the late 30s - late 40s. It fails miserably for several reasons. Firstly, Sacchi, although he looks reasonably like Bogart and even occasionally speaks like he uses his manners, does not possess any charisma or acting ability of Bogart at all. This is really obvious when Sacchi clearly does not imitate the scene from one of Bogart’s films. Secondly, there are no first-class characters in the film that Bogart could work with. This is not Peter Lorra, nor Sydney Greenstreet, guys. Of course, we treat the performances of Victor Bueeno, Olivia Hassi and George Raft among others, but they are simply not the same caliber (or they are not given enough time on the screen or they are mistaken). Thirdly, all attempts at "modern" humor have failed. All jokes with underwear when Marlowe almost * never * removes this damn hat and cloak (although Bogart should have done this), etc., are simply not funny and really make a film. Fourth, I never heard a silly song on this side of Mitchell. Finally, the film’s false homage to Bogart (and other classic actors) is really annoying. Bogart almost * never * played a direct hero, in those cases he was a hero. He played complex characters. This film makes Bogart a happy moralist. Although this may be true of some of the characters in the film, Bogart’s characters rarely correspond to this score. It is these films that make people who are not familiar with past cinema think that all this is deception, “a good guy defeats the bad guys and gets a girl” shit with poor performance.
