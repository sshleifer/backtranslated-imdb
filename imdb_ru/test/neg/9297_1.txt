Comedy? What is so funny about looking at an ugly mad alcoholic who attends 6 sessions (by the time I turned him off) of anonymous alcoholics? It stands out the sad scenario of grumbling, mumbling and drunken mud. Filed with a whip of Hollywood religious redemption chatter “God will save you” Grandma has more funny responses than Tee's character in this garbage. Tea with a more stony face and shows less emotion than Keanu - in fact, one wonders if it is not too attached to something - maybe Botox is so wooden? Save yourself from boredom from this movie.
