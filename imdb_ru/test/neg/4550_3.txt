If you like soap series, you might like this movie. I recommend this movie to fans of Dutch TV shows such as GTST, Westenwind, or even American stuff like The Bold & The Beautiful. If you do not like this material: stay away from this movie. He has the same visual style, the same quality of play, direction and writing. The film enjoyed great success in his native territory, but was not sold anywhere except in Holland and Belgium. Oddly enough for a commercial film like this one. <br /> <br /> Maybe this says something ....
