How to start with this proposal? I almost said the movie, but it will be too far. The only thing that is hellish in this film is that this is, of course, a marriage made in hell between nothing and nonsense, nonsense and a balder. These films should contain a physiological health warning, so as not to hurt their spirits to such an extent that one could believe that all good filmmakers left the planet and their resources were transferred to those who made this classic piece of banal garbage just like his sister Arms "League of Extraordinary Twelve". They are neither science fiction, nor fact, neither entertaining nor thought-provoking, humorous or weighty, but are in the twilight zone, devoid of any attributes that cause people to waste their precious time, sit in a dark room and, like usually be more enlightened, lively or happy at the end of it. If we could award Turkey scores for films like this, it would be a turnip, as we would go through a turkey, ham, potatoes, sprouts, sauce, and all the other decorations before reaching the bottom.
