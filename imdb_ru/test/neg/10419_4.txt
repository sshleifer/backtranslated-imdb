“Yesterday”, like a movie, is difficult to evaluate. Cinematography is excellent and deserves 9/10. The story is hard and real and does not compromise. But the transfer of the plot to the screen through the actors did not coincide with the camera work. <br /> <br /> As a person who was born and raised in Central Africa, I appreciated the authenticity of the film’s appearance and the honesty description of the daily life of the Zulus. But this and camera work is not enough to recommend to the average viewer to watch this movie. To understand the purpose and strength of "Yesterday", you need to appreciate the true cinema, and not just the love of cinema. <br /> <br /> Unlike the 1980 film Gods Must Be Crazy, which had a comic look at one African culture confronting modern technology, Yesterday is not going to attract any crossover audience. The film is simply not suitable for the general Western mind - and I doubt that it was intended for the Western mind. Scenes are long and slow, editing does not happen to the world of instant gratification over 60 miles per hour. The dialogue is neither clever nor witty, it is real. Films about health crises are not the best entertainment, and this film is not entertainment, but education. <br /> <br /> This film is best watched by those who know, appreciate and love the lifestyle and culture in Africa south of Sarah. If you lack a broad enough world view to understand other cultures, especially African ones, skip this film. Do not waste time on this. Instead, watch Talladegi Nights or Larry The Cable Guy for a look at different cultures. <br /> <br /> I give 4 points for the majority who want to watch a movie, but do not have an accurate understanding of African cultures. For viewers who appreciate films about human experience anywhere in the world, I would give 7 points.
