The German émigré and actor of the uber-hambone, Paul Mooney, who never saw the scene he didn’t want to chew, becomes a “black face” to play a modest Mexican immigrant living in Los Angeles and sneaking into the world. If this squeaky car reminds someone of the role of the minstrel Al Pacino as an uncivilized Cuban in the remake of SCARFACE, do not be surprised. The characters are very similar, and both look meticulously when the script requires it. Latin Americans everywhere should be greatly offended by Mooney’s excessive performance, as this frivolous Mexican living the American dream, the consequences will be cursed. I think the grandfather Benicio Deltoro was not available. The young, bleached blonde Bette Davis plays one of Muni's love interests; in the end, she goes mad because of Mr. Meh-hi-kan Muni’s love. An absolute cry, Davis is the only reason to watch this offensive rape. Toward the end, utter nonsense comes when Mooney asks the girl of her dream to marry him - a white maiden of reproduction with one of those untidy, stage accents of the 30s who Hollywood loved so much - and she calls him a savage and brute from "another tribe. " Muni immediately turns into Mr. Hyde and pursues her to an untimely death. In the final scene, the repentant Muni tells his priest with a sober face that he is returning to his people, to his family. The end of the film. Finis. That's all she wrote. It is said that Muni hired a Mexican as a chauffeur to study the speech characteristics and physical habits of this exotic creature. Yowza!
