I know that my resume sounds very harsh, but this film is very limited. An ordinary Joe would have a hard time sticking with this movie. The entire film consists of animated recorders performing their work and dancing on floating logs. All of this is done in very catchy and fanciful tones, and the film can be wonderful for showing to visitors in an art museum. However, if you really dislike this kind of art or are not a Canadian who loves films about your homeland, then it will probably be almost impossible to finish. I have a fairly high tolerance for these kinds of things, and even I had to force myself to look after a couple of minutes. I can respect the work that went into this, but this is simply not convincing.
