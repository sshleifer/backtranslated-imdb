Pathetic shitty NRI ..... I appeal to everyone who is not an Indian .... This is the WORLD of Indian cinema, created by the worst passage of NRI ..... The story is boring and mediocre (as NRIs and Westerners look at India) ..... Do this if you want to get bored to death. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the plight of widows in India before independence. Much of this is true now in remote rural areas, but not to the extent depicted (perhaps because it is a historical film) ..... <br /> <br /> There are many other Indian films made by extremely talented directors worth trying. ..This is one clear omission ... Instead, watch a documentary or watch information on the web if you are really interested in the plight of the oppressed in India. <br /> <br /> I wasted my time.
