What better way to describe this than crazy criminals on TV? And I do not mean in the COPS show; here they are actually presented as the main characters. <br /> <br /> I don’t see any curative value in this show if you don’t have a perverse tendency towards human tragedies. Whitney Houston is a tragic example of a fallen star; the star Bobby Brown helped pull out of the sky. Bobby Brown is nothing more than a criminal with a low standard of living. Why look at him? Why does Whitney support him, however disgusting he is? This couple must be locked up, and it is a disgusting shame that they earn money and achieve at least some fame by observing the septic tank, which is their life and the human waste that is their character.
