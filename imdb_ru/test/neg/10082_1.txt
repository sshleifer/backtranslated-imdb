How could someone who liked previous JP movies even stand this 1 hour of chatter? There are so many stupid things in this movie that it’s incredible !! I remember when I watched JP as a child, it was my favorite movie and franchise, acting, SFX, music, directing! everything is fantastic, JP2, in my opinion, was fine, almost the same, except for some really silly moments (for example, a gymnast kicks a predator ... please!), but on the whole watchable and reasonable cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> But the third one doesn't make sense !! This is supposed to be the continuation of JP2, which Carrie will continue, and, nevertheless, it magically includes completely new things from the franchise that you could not miss in the previous 2 films! for example: 1) “New” mega spinosaur - Seriously, what the hell !! This thing follows them everywhere, wherever they go, they cannot avoid his presence, and yet in the Lost World (on the same island) did you see it? can you hear it Did anyone even remember that? NOT! This is ridiculous !. The star character in the previous two films was and always will be T-Rex, so what should the ir director of d (urr) do "Joe Johnston" do? Kill it! As soon as you see the huge T-Rex in all its amazing roaring glory, they kill him, and you will never see him again - the new Dino in the city is an excuse ... where it came from !! ?? not a single explanation! and don't make me start with everything related to the satellite phone in my stomach! 2) Once you begin to understand how stupid Spinosaurus is, you see the Predators, besides their new "Punk" Haircuts, they seem pretty credible! * Ugh * they make this movie watchable, right? ... WRONG! Now they are talking to each other !! and an excuse for the fact that they appear in this film, and not in the First and Second, are waiting for this ... Evolution! - Yes, the process of millions of years in just a few months from the end of the second film is amazing! Awful, they should have resisted and created tools !! Well, I'm not going to talk about the plot anymore, because it raises my nose, so I'll close it: Jurassic Park is a classic, JP3 is a lousy blow for any of the original fans of the series, my favorite franchise was good and really dead after watching this monster (no pun intended) Avoid this movie like the plague
