I rented this film in the local library, without having prior knowledge of the book on which it is based, or of the film itself, solely on the assumption that this is one of those rare, unnoticed gems that can be opened from time to time and -to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not one of those films. I’m not sure if this is a movie driven by sentiment or, even worse, a deliberate agenda, but some of its elements made it impossible to dive. It is intended to depict a struggling community of immigrant workers that is trying to cope with the difficult realities of their lives. This is a wonderful premise, and it could create an exciting story, but the execution simply made me alternately annoyed and surprised at the absurdity of it. <br /> <br /> Here we have a community of simple agricultural workers. who migrated to the United States in search of work and who are constantly used and insulted by evil white people. And when I say evil, I mean evil. All white people in this film are sinful, racist, sadistic, abusive devils, whose only purpose in life is sexual depravity, intertwined with the exploitation of poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it were not so unintentionally grotesque and, therefore, fun. <br /> <br /> The image of immigrants is also a poster-worthy example of exaggeration, except that it goes in the opposite direction. Immigrants are holy, pure, and can serve as an ointment for Boo-Boo and other countries of the world. I could not help laughing when I saw that these “field workers” seemed to have been digging in the ditches all day with their notoriously clean clothes and fine-cut haircuts from a top-quality hairdressing salon. A little restraint and a more impartial hand at the helm could have made this film much better, evoking some supposed emotions, rather than sarcastic giggles.
