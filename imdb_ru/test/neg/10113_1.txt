I do not even understand what they were trying to achieve with this film, I mean really. You have this guy running from a group of cats, because he is dead, but to be truly dead, this girl should shoot them? And they leave the corpse, although normal people can not see them, because they are dead? The script already has a hole the size of Nebraska, then you have the main character played by Susan Paterno, who simply performs her lines in a monotonous, boring voice and with so little emotion on her face that she could also play a female robot terminator. It's absolutely terrible, and I don't even understand how I managed to see it until the very end of the film. The end will be as stupid as the whole movie, and with absolutely no reward for the viewer. With the same success, they could call this film “a small film that can be chu-chu-ka-chu”.
