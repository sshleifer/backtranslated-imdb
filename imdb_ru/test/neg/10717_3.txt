I was looking forward to watching this movie, unfortunately, I had to listen to my daughter's advice. This was supposed to be a hoax, but he took on realism, for which corporations had a lot to answer. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey, after all the work he has done, is still Jim Carrey, and his comedy did not get any better, his colleague could not support him. Their son in the film was invisible. <br /> <br /> Criminal life blinked, and it was the missing link in the film. The film showed 2 or 3 robberies, and they were richer than before, because there it lost to me. <br /> <br /> I did laugh in some parts, but overall not good enough, AlecBaldwin, I felt, should have added some weight to the film. His character was not strong enough. There were too many spaces to make this smart and stressful movie.
