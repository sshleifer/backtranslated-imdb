It's a damn dirty movie. Like many films about "women in chains", this film is full of lesbianism. However, unlike most previous films in which this was clearly indicated, “BLACK MOM” and “White Mom” show a terrible amount of skin, because an excited female jailer looks at women when they shower one of the prisoners. In the early 1970s, this is definitely a soft core pornographic film - sort of like GIRLS Nervously GOING IN PRISON! This is also a bad robbery of DEFIANTS, although in this case they are two hot women who hate each other, who are chained when they run away. While the original film is considered classic, this can only be considered a classic example of bad taste. This is because there is nothing tricky in this, and the film is just cheap - cheap thrills, cheap script and a very cheap acting game. <br /> <br /> Pam Greer - “black prisoner with a world outlook” - a lady who was set up and sent to prison on this hellish island. Margaret Markov is a revolutionary. When they run away, they both cannot tolerate each other and have opposite goals. However, since the movie is based on clichés, the way the movie ends is not surprising that they both become (silenced) friends.
