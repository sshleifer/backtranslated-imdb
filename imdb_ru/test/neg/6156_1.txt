The quote above roughly says it all for "Slipstream." I had to get out of this film after the first half hour, but decided that I should be honest and give it a chance. I will not watch it again, so if anyone who has such courage can come back to me with the number of lines of cliches in the film, I am sure that he will set a record. <br /> <br /> Some otherwise beautiful and talented actors mingled with this clanker; Mark Hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter, and Bill Paxton depicts his career. Paxton's character hijacked Hamill's captive, an android taking his name from the poet Byron (Bob Peck). Tasker (Hamill) shoots the Owens (Paxton) dart with a tracking device so that he and his companion Belitsky (Kitty Aldridge) can track the pair. The real question, however, is why he did not just shoot Byron, thereby cutting out the middleman. <br /> <br /> If you like the scene behind a scattered scene with tedious characterization and pretentious pretense, then I suppose you'll find something interesting here. But you cannot convince me that the film makes sense at any level. The scenes of the futuristic stone age give way to high society snobbery, but the pinnacle of bad taste is reached when Paxton’s character appears after a night of fun with hickeys all over his body. If someone thinks there is some hidden meaning here, you are really stretching. <br /> <br /> Patiently awaiting the appearance of a frame in which the “End” will be announced, alas, even this was denied. If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, it means understanding; this film had neither one nor the other. Yet there was one redemption feature when the issuance of final credits began - a stunning view from half a dozen balloons. Apparently the film kept them afloat.
