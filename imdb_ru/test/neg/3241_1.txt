No words can describe how awful this movie is. This is similar to how the director literally starred in the role of *** in the roll of the film and sent it to the audience. <br /> <br /> The scene from this movie is terrible, the plot is so stupid, and death - each character is ridiculously bad. Some silly scenes include Akshay Kumara, who pulls a pistol out of nowhere to kill a hologram (yes, a hologram), Akshaya Kumar, carrying a bazooka around the city, Rajat Bedi, beaten by a slightly animated skeleton, Rajat Bedi and Siddhart, twice penetrating into Monisha Corell (How did they think this is straight?). I would also like to point out that the animation is absolutely terrible. The scene that supports this statement is when Kapal has a motorcycle and he somehow gets points. Looks like shopping was done in Microsoft Paint. <br /> <br /> The best parts in this movie are with Sunny Deol. This man is so strong that even God is scary. In one scene, he literally cracks the prison door, kicking it. Chuck Norris Round House has nothing on it! He is so strong that he can fly from London to India in 10 minutes! In general, this film is probably the worst film ever made in the universe. If you want to watch it, take a look at it to have fun, which occurs everywhere (by the way, this film should be serious)
