Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became a hero of the Regional City, having found and wearing the Norse god of harm, the mask of Loki. The mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and achieved a very popular status due to its originality and pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell a party. A PARTY. What for? Because I have to! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new film Son of the Mask. Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you doing this? And he replies, "Because I have to!" Unfortunately, this answer does not apply to him, because, having seen the “Son of the Mask”, I still left the theater, thinking: “Lord, why?” Guterman and other people participating in the blasphemous film must understand that the answer to the question why you are shooting this film should not be as simple as answering the debate about whether to have parties or not. <br /> <br /> Son of the Mask begins with the fact that the dog Otis finds the infamous mask and returns it to its owner Tim Avery, a clear tribute to the legendary creator of Loony Toons Teut Avery. Tim, played by Jamie Kennedy, is a struggling animator who is stuck working as a guide for turtles in an animation company, to which he seeks a one-day run. On the night of the Halloween party, Tim puts on his mask and turns into the naughty, crazy character we all expect. After the party, Tim goes home, still wearing a mask, and conceives a child with his wife. Nine months later, chaos ensues, as the child born of the mask has amazing cartoon abilities. Otis dog, jealous of the attention of the child, puts on a mask and takes part in riots such as Tom and Jerry to expel the child. Meanwhile, Loki, played by Alan Cumming, is searching for his mask on the orders of his father Odin. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I don’t admit that I respect the fact that this film gives so much respect to classic cartoons, such as Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes, with their clever tricks like Wile E. Coyote and the infamous plot of a dancing frog type. However, this reverence cannot save the film and makes it less respectful and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is becoming increasingly stupid. Stupidity is not always a bad thing, but in this film stupidity comes to such an extent that it is just annoying. The characters are not fun to watch, and, even worse, they are not funny. The dullness of the characters can also be explained by the fact that so much computer graphics were used. One of the greatest features of the original is that, although computer animation was obviously used, so much was relied on by Jim Carrey and his wild style of just being. We were convinced that Jim Carrey was a real cartoon. Jamie Kennedy simply does not have this ability, and this fact is obvious when you observe how he wears a mask, and his facial features rarely change. The child and the dog were basically completely animated, which became more and more distracting throughout the entire film. The side story of how Loki was looking for a mask was becoming more and more overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Son of Mask sadly sad. I suggest you rent or buy the original Mask and thank the Scandinavian gods or anyone else for bringing it to us. And consider the continuation of my sacrifice, when I continue to ask the infamous question "WHY?" Mask's son gets one star, although this star should be divided between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey, who will always be a mask in my book.
