I didn't plan on watching the O12, because I didn't really like the O11. I thought O11 was a good, but a bit boring little film about bank robbers with a sensational arsenal of stars. Anyway, I was persuaded to watch the O12 one night, and I was very sorry for that. The plot is not only boring, but meaningless. I honestly do not even know what this is all about. I left the movie 3 blocks away and drank coffee with another girl who didnâ€™t like it. Much more fun I can tell you. But even those guys who remained until the end, later told me that the plot continued to be terrible and useless. My advice: do not look. Look at Team America (funny, by the way ;-)) and forget about Ocean's Twelve. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the most boring and meaningless world of shit for all the time to be on the screen.
