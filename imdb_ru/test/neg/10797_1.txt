It seems to me that Joe Esteves spends most of his time in the shadow of his rather successful brother and makes films on really bad films. Joe spends most of his time walking around, dressed in black and looking rather sullen. He receives orders from a fat-faced angel of death, whom you can recognize as a puffy-faced villain from Tango & Cash and a puffy-faced cyborg from Future War. Well, Joe and Puffy have a job, and it includes taking a shower of some children in a big car, driven by a dull gallop, asked by Ice Zeppelin. Well, the car falls, and the chase continues. The lucky ones who managed to escape from Joe are like Tonya Harding and Rick Springfield. They are persecuted throughout the city, they break things, and her mother scoffs at Tonya while she is undressing to take a bath. The action ends in a hospital, where we learn that heaven is an elevator ride away. In the end, some green lights flash, Joe screams, and Puffy disappears without a trace. I wish I could say the same for this movie. Watch this from the relative safety of MST.
