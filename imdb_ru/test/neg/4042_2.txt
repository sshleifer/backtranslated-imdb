Words cannot express how bad this film is. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, the acting is terrible, basically the whole movie is a joke. <br /> <br /> The duration of the performance is 97 minutes, it is approximately 96 minutes longer. <br /> <br /> It might be nice to have a short sketch of a comedy show, but the premise is too weak to work for so much time without getting bored. br /> <br /> Avoid this, rent a good movie instead!
