The state's garden should be rated among the most contrived and pretentious films of all time. The plot is simple, with the participation of a young man returning home after the death of his mother and discovering love. But in fact, the plot is not important. What is important for Zach Braff - a writer, a director and a star ?? in that he is able to hang out from the plot all the necessary equipment for the "indie" or "art" of the film. Therefore, endless cute and bizarre characters and scenes appear to us, which do not exist for reasons of plot or character development, but simply to impart artistic credibility to the film (a la Wes Anderson - or, as Braff hopes). Unfortunately and somewhat surprisingly, Braff not only fooled many on IMDb, but also some critics who really should have known better. <br /> <br /> Of course, Braff’s unwarranted use of just one quirkiness does not make Garden State a bad movie. What really makes Garden State a bitch is the Braff script. He simply does not have the writing skills to carry this film, and the dialogue and characteristics are terrible. Braff often has to resort to blunt designs and symbolism in order to achieve what he cannot achieve through writing. For example, the numbness of the character Braff is shown to us by his indifference to the impending plane crash (this cannot be included in the plot, and therefore must occur in a dream!), Later he is shown fighting off his circumstances, shouting into a bottomless abyss smart Mr. Braff). These two scenes should be considered as one of the most ridiculous and contrived, ever seen on the silver screen. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, acting is quite tolerable, despite the lack of material to work with the actors (because of what I mean the script), and I admire Natalie Portman for her efforts as a love interest - a character so poorly written and implausible that she is just a stupid doll that Braff sculpts in her fantasy woman. <br /> <br /> Apparently, it took Braff 3 years to write the script for Garden State (3 years to write the script so badly - it’s really inept!). I hope this is why some time will pass before he makes another film.
