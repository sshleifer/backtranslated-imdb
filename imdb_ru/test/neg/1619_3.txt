It might not be so terribly bad, as if not the absolutely terrible acting work done by Raymond Wallace! This guy is so bad that not even funny! His character was necessary in the film, but I don’t know why they chose this guy. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for high-quality Chinese films ..... can I suggest "Raise the Red Lantern" .... "The History of Kui Joo" .... "The Red Sorghum" ".... .. <br /> <br /> Everything except that! I was surprised at how many people really rated it highly! In fact ... this loser Wallace’s play is so bad that it overshadows the other good sides of this film. It was agreed upon by all six of us who watched this movie last night! <br /> <br /> Stay away from this piece of garbage ........
