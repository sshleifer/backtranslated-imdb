This oddity contains Bunuel touches, but does not support anyone's interests. A 10-year-old boy roams strange America in a stolen Mustang, while ordinary suspects in the cult film (Dick Miller, Mary Ravens, Susie Tyrell) commit malicious acts in the name of comedy. As his AFTER CLOCK and KISS WAMPI, the screenwriter takes pleasure in what makes you squirm. I remained untouched due to the widespread action. You know what suits you when Meat Loaf and Flea give the most attractive pleasures. (And what was the screen test of this child? It was unbearable.) Recommended to a dozen or so fans of SONNY BOY ('87).
