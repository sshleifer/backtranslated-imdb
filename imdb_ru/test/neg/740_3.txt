(This may be a spoiler) <br /> <br /> When I first started watching this movie, I thought that everything was in order. The music was good, and this strange sequence of dreams, which I was ready to forgive, but the lack of a look at the main character and all the other characters in this regard made me not interested in watching the rest of this film. (I know, completely in vain.) The music at the beginning was energetic and appropriate, I thought that it would mock the Gothic novel. But come on! Sax music for early 19th century movie? It does not fit at all. This film was completely boring, and if you want to watch a good historical film or Austin, don't rent Northang Abbey! I give it 30%. 30% = poor rating!
