I also waited a long time to watch this movie. As far as I know, he was never released in Australia, so in the end I found a copy online and ordered it there. A few weeks after my order confirmation, he finally came, and I was extremely excited that I was finally sitting in front of my TV, ready to watch a movie that sounds so interesting and controversial and filmed in that part of the world where there are so many good films. What a disappointment. During the first few minutes, I realized that I had ordered the B Grader, but I was still full of expectations. I convinced my son (18 years old) to watch it with me, as I like to share when I find a movie with valuable motifs and good storylines and / or storylines. About halfway through, he got up and said that he could no longer look at it, it was so predictable and amateur. I agreed, but watched to the end. The game was fierce even by the standards of B-Grade. Stereotypes are also predictable, and I feel for good people from Lake Arthur, Louisiana, who must have cringed to see a film depicting them in this way. No doubt some racial prejudices still exist in many parts of the world, not only in the States, but in fact, in our time, I doubt that they will get away with the whole ridiculous alibi presented in this. I had to double-check the date when the film was made, because their attempts to make useless filming of more horrible scenes were what I expected from the first attempt of a high school student to make the film “Indie”. I would like this film to fall into the hands of experienced screenwriters and filmmakers, this is an old story, but one that can still strike if it is done professionally. So disappointed after such a long wait and with such high expectations. The soundtrack was probably the only thing I liked.
