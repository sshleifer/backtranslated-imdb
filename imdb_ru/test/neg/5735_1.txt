sdiner82 has obviously not seen the movie for decades, and its memory is terrible. His attempts to paint Mark Lester's shaving scene as a suspect are completely erroneous, as well as his incorrect comments about a bad guy "sneaking into a child's body." Leicester is dressed for the entire time that the man is in the room, and the man barely looks at him. <br /> <br /> The scene is a rude attempt to show Lester’s innocent curiosity about the man’s body. <Br /> <br /> Like everything else in this film, it's badly done, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> Even the sdiner82 comments about the character of Savalas, who “accidentally sent a German family to death by pushing their trailer off the Cliff” is nonsense (it was a single woman, she was already dead, and she was in the car) . <br /> <br /> I believe that the sdiner82 review says much more about his own, far from liberal thinking, than in this useless film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I don’t even began to look for him, was out of curiosity to see whether it was made before or after Kodjak. <br /> <br /> This film is a useless piece of trash of the 70s, but The sdiner82 review is the worst slander. It wraps up its review with pseudo-intellectual “facts”, but the only fact is that he is completely wrong about almost every “actual” question he discusses. <br /> <br /> I can only to assume that sdiner82 saw exactly what he was looking for, what is bothering. Now he can return to the burning copies of "The Catcher in the Rye".
