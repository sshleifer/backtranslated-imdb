This film is terrible, I'm sorry. I bought it to get Star Worms, and actually expected it to be better after I was disappointed in Star Worms. Oh, kidding, it turns out, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Action is rubbish, not what it really is, but the main character is a big silly box that is attacked by such things or something like that. I can not tell. The special effects are so bad that you can't even see the warring dinosaurs, which, by the way, do not fight, but just stand and move their mouths, or whatever. The film is a headache. It is clear that the director is trying to create a universe. Hahahahahahahaha ... Indeed, this film is simply disgusting, even by the standards of Trom. The only good thing I can say about this is that he has the entry of Lloyd Kaufman, because he again makes us look at something that is not suitable for consumption.
