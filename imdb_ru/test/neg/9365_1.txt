I just can not understand how any fan Who, or just anyone can find this terrible, lazy, poorly written abomination even remotely funny. It is so embarrassing below par that it qualifies as a real tragedy. The potential for this was huge, it could be great. What a pity that all this acting talent, scenery, props, benevolence of all the people involved in it were so pitifully spent by the script that should have been burned. <br /> <br /> There is an obvious absence of any strict production. and quality control here. Like those Hollywood Hollywood films (“Crazy Mad Crazy World”, “Casino Royale”), where the stars just rob each other and “have a great time”, which basically means getting a check, doing nothing. <br /> <br /> I could write better who will come in a dream. In fact, while I do not sleep. I did this in 10th grade high school and performed it with a group of classmates. It was better, I look at it now, and the jokes are funnier. Stephen Moffat, YOU ARE NOT TALENT BOOM! What a waste, what a missed opportunity. Makes me want to cry ....
