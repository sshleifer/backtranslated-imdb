A college professor is working on creating a zombie, and, don't you know, everything is terribly wrong. The next thing you know, the entire campus is full. Thank God, there are a couple of Uber-commandos trained for this particular situation. It is a pity that they must be accompanied by a group of commando idiots headed by a rapper (he doesn’t even try to play a military guy, he just answers his superiors as if he were rappin 'wit' da amies in da hood). The culmination of this part of the film is the scene in the dressing room. Male and female moron commandos live in the same dressing room, and, apparently, in accordance with military regulations, all women should wear black bras and panties. Hey, if you can't make a good movie, at least you can have women in lingerie. Hats off to the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> So, after long discussions about how well these commando assholes are prepared for work (Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq), they are all rather quickly killed. Their biggest fall seems to be that it never occurs to them to turn on the light. A typical meeting - they enter the room and see someone at the far end. Man or zombie? I can not say. Turn on the light? No, the moron-commando protocol requires them to approach a person, trying to hold their weapon in such a way that it can be easily knocked out of his hand, and well, you know the drill. The death of Sergeant Major Sticky Fingaz is especially amusing - my favorite rapper scene in any movie I've ever seen. Fortunately (and again hats off to the filmmakers), the hottest babe from the moron commando manages to survive. She and the uber commando both remain in tight shirts until the end of the film. This is how a military operation should go! There are a lot of people running around that accentuate my humorous things, such as Über-commandos, unable to pass through a simple fan grille (obviously, this is a thin piece of aluminum through which you could easily make a fist). This requires a plan to destroy the zombie guts, and although we didn’t see anything in the film that would indicate that the zombies find their victim by smell, they are good enough to immediately begin sniffing the zombie’s guts and let our heroes go. . <br /> <br /> A few other funny moments - Paris Hilton's gag: “Can you hear me now?” The gag and the fact that, although the zombies immediately bite secondary characters, the main characters can break through dozens of them without being chewed up . Another chuckle is Mr. Fingaz, who does not seem to be able to utter the word “turnstile” (toe-no-kit?). <br /> <br /> In general, this is somewhat funny. Could use more interesting characters, but for the original Sci-Fi Channel I was slightly impressed.
