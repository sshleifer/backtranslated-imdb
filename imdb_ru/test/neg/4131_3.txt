What the hell is it? Kelly (Jennifer) seems to discard all moral behavior as soon as she arrives on the island. She finds this Juan P (Manuel) existing and exotic, although she witnessed when he hit his ex on the face, which he also justifies later in the film, right or wrong? These two guys were the first to find each other on the island. Kelly is completely lost in every sense, and the great Juan R can fish and build some kind of house. Mr. Handyman. They seem to be having a great time. Then Billy Zane (Jack, Kelly's husband of characters) appears and, of course, for two days, not knowing what his wife is doing with this magnificent Juan R, he is a little jealous. Billy W is a rich stereotype of a guy and perhaps not the best person in the world. He doesn’t like Juan R (because he hit his girlfriend on the pier, who can blame him? He’s also arrogant, but he paid a lot of money to rent this boat, and Juan R, who the waiter / everything cannot even bring him beer at 20 minutes. Don't you get upset? However, Billy is probably the guy you want to hit in the face if you meet him. But at the same time, he is not guilty, is suspicious of glasses for underwater, Manuel has. Kelly and Billy just lost some dear friends! How convenient that he just got them, no matter what!). However, for some strange reason, Kelly likes it when this girl hits Manuel and begins to hate Billy for jealousy. Okay, Billy overreacts, that’s for sure, but Kelly also doesn’t do much to convince him. She spends more time with Juan R and even wants him to sleep with them because he was so sweet (and even though Manuel shouted at her and called her things for asking him some intimate questions. But Kelly is SO simple ...). Yes, right. And then she starts having sex with this Juan P. It should be said that Kelly and Billy seem to have a working relationship before this incident on the island, at least they have intimate sex on the boat and talk like people when they like each Other. Now you may think that this scenario is possible. But is it really so? Do you cheat on your husband after two days on a coconut island just because he is jealous and behaves like a drunk in a bar? (I would not agree if there were really bad relations, but the director doesn’t give a lot of clues if this is so). For God's sake, Juan P really did not show himself to be a good person. Catch a fish and build a wooden house to get into someone's panties, is this a good side? In any case, not trying to make friends with her husband Kelly (which would be very simple if they were alone most of the time on the island, just respected him). He doesn't care about their relationship (and Kelly can't figure it out), he just wants to have sex with Kelly. The character Kelly is simply not trustworthy (if she is stuck with Billy and another attractive girl, isn't she upset or what?!). Or maybe she? Billy Zane is not a very nice person, and Juan P is actually not much better if you really think about it. And poor Kelly is so confused and believes that sex with Juan R will solve everything, because her husband is so strange and so aggressive towards poor Juan R? So ... for all of you who read this ... What do you think about this? If you were the character of Kelly, you would think to deceive your husband, knowing that one day you will return to real life, and suddenly Billis may not be such a terrible person at all. He's just too jealous. And if you, where is Billy, a character, what do you say, is he completely wrong in his behavior? And the character of Juan R, what do you guys really think about him. One thing is certain. Manuel exist! Ps ... Voodoo thing is completely wrong here! What the hell was that ?! Seriously! Anyone tell me?
