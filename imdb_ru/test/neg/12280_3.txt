Essentially a plotless action movie in which there are two good guys (Fong and Roundtree) versus two bad guys (Mitchell and Pierce). Phong is perhaps the most charismatic leader in the 80s, a small part of Roundtree is far from his “mining” days, and Cameron Mitchell adds another shameful role to his career - to sit next to a ridiculous turn in the “Killing Toolbar” (when then this man was a respected actor, now he began to wear flowers on his hair and complain about bleeding people on his carpet). Only Stack Pierce acts with some dignity. Regarding violence, do not worry: most of them are too poorly done to offend anyone. (* 1/2)
