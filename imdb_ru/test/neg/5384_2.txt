From an artistic point of view, a film cannot entertain or give moral permission. The plot is difficult to follow, if there is any. The game is tough for the stomach. The dialogue is cliche and clearly written by someone who does not know English. In this film, it was worth seeing only the cinematography, although you can still see the flaws in the picture. <br /> <br /> As an Asian-American woman, this film made me angry because he proved how limited people are. Politically speaking, putting Asian women in such shameful roles should be outlawed. Preserving stereotypes of Asian prostitutes is harmful not only for the self-esteem of Asian women, but also for the country as a whole. I feel like the lead actress who played Maya, and the exploitation she had to face playing such a role. <br /> <br /> Like Americans, please avoid this movie. Art should be used to develop our tolerance and respect for each other, and not to restrain it.
