The four policemen from Los Angeles in Fedora, driving around in a big black convertible, look slightly absurd and even more ridiculous when it turns out that Nick Nolte, the stupidest of them, is responsible for them. The writer never manages to create a camaraderie among the squad members, and the director fails to bring the articulation out of Mount Nolte. Foprget polls someone. The character Nolte lights a cigarette, gets angry and beats his companions to a pulp. His methods did not lead to anything, until at some point in the action he wanders from an abandoned residence to an abandoned residence with an open mouth and closed brain. He smashes the FBI squad and throws two soldiers from the plane in flight, having only a vague report of anger at headquarters and without any punishment. At the end of the film, he is as ruthless and muscular as at the very beginning. How he managed to make the beautiful whore fall in love with him remains a mystery, as well as the eternal devotion and tragic feeling of betrayal expressed by his unemployed wife. In the picture there are two interesting snapshots: one from an atomic explosion, the other - a giant crater, allegedly caused by a bomb. It is almost as broken and swollen as Nolte's face.
