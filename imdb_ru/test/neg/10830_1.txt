This film does not even have the saving grace of being so bad that it is good. This is really terrible. This is closer to a mocking parody than a movie about disasters, but, alas, they were serious. Made for television, but not even worth it. It contains all the clich√©s and plot points you can imagine. Oh, he will save the city from flooding? Does his wife admit that she still loves him? Will they run away before they sink them? I can not explain how bad it is. A terrible predictable story that makes you flinch, it's so stupid. Bad effects (although, to be honest, I have seen even more imposed boiling water). Bad script Grief from acting. Ugliness. So bad in fact, that you probably should get drunk and watch this.
