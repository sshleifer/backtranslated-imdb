I am ashamed to admit in public that I even once held the cover of this film! This is the absolute reason why you should study the film before watching it! The "creators" of this film called us all fools and gullible losers who have too much time. <br /> <br /> Based on the mythical Indian powerful cobras and reincarnation that change shape, history takes us for a painful ride. More than 40 actors study in college (and now the truth?) - the goal of their former girlfriend Manisha Coirala (who was a cobra in her past life, but now a ghost!) And her miserable, eternal, mighty boyfriend Cobra / fighter of Manisha machine. Kokhli (who, fortunately, has not been seen since). Now you need to know more? <br /> <br /> I vote for preparing for the upcoming test at school, not for this film! Give him a pass if you are sane. If not ... then you will probably like it.
