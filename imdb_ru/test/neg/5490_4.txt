This film steps on a very familiar ground - a mixture of art and reality in the life of actors. There is nothing particularly new or interesting about this subject, and in fact it’s pretty boring. In particular, the final scene is infinitely tiring. Seeing the audience crying from the “moving” game that they see on the screen, I asked the question: “Who do they think is joking?” <br /> <br /> However, there are some good performances and interesting scenes , especially from some of the minor characters. Ben Gazzar plays an old and slightly touched actor who receives a whole squad of policemen patting his performance when they come to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken plays the abstruse eccentric again. Remember his character "Continental" on Saturday evening Live; Does an aging European model have a satyr chasing a young woman for furniture and trying to put her to bed? He makes an identical turn in the film, chasing his young (male) booty at an antique table and covering him with champagne. <br /> <br /> In general, this film was both charming and annoying, but mostly annoying.
