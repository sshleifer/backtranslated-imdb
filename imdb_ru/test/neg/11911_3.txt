Jack Lemmon was one of the best actors who ever graced the screen. He could easily switch from dramatic roles to comedies, making most of his peers green with envy. Although his performance in “Save the Tiger” is worthy of an Oscar, I feel that it was given to him because he missed his other opportunities to get a reward because of the other, better roles that preceded this one. <Br /> <br /> This is also one of those pretentious films that mainly demonstrate the talent of actors or, in this case, one particular participant. It is a pity that the script does not coincide with the output of Lemmon. Do not waste your time on this.
