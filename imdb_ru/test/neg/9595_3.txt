I saw this movie yesterday on the state channel. They advertised it as a horrible film, and therefore I was drawn to watch it, and they did not let me down. <br /> <br /> A group of 18-19 years old is going to the excavation of an old viking a castle in Denmark to try to uncover the viking myth of berserkers. Strange things happen: something happens in the forest and people start to disappear. <br /> <br /> The main thing in this film that really bothers me is that the story should take place in Denmark, where I happen to live. There were so many places in the film where the Hollywood style overlapped the Danish reality. It really made acting and drama look ridiculous in my eyes. <br /> <br /> You will never see the characters interacting with the outside world. It looks like a mini-Hollywood in Denmark, and it takes away the credibility of the film. When at some point you hear someone say "old Danish", it sounds just like modern Swedish. Really bad research, given that the director is from Denmark. <br /> <br /> The film’s characters used GPS and maps, and it’s really fun because Denmark is the size of your backyard. No matter where you are, never more than 50 km to the sea and 500 meters to civilization. And if you are in the castle, there will be tourists everywhere. We see many forest reviews in the film, and sometimes we see what seems like North American vegetation (?). I didn’t quite like the story, maybe because the game was so bad. When characters first see swamp creatures, they are not even afraid. I believe that their acting skills were not enough to show realistic emotions. In the end, there is an unexpected turn, but it did not impress me, since I didn’t care. <br /> <br /> Marsh creatures are cheap, but they had the potential to be scary. Unfortunately, they fail, as we well see them standing in the forest when the characters arrive at the castle. In addition, there are no really scary scenes, as the marsh creatures basically just stand around. <br /> <br /> In any case, the conclusion is: in spite of the facts, the movie is your typical horror movie. I think that people from other countries can enjoy it more. As long as you do not know about reality, it does not matter. Just as I think of the USA as one big action movie, everyone else can think of Denmark as a forest with a castle ... and some living dead in a swamp ..
