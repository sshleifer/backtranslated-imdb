... so where is my bloody trophy? I seriously expected the banner and confetti to fall from my ceiling in the full 30 minutes of watching this shit. Recently, Comedy Central really sheds the ball, trying to fill the void left by Chappell, with several seasons of a retarded person posing as a retarded man. Daaaaaaaaaa !! If you pay attention to the show, you will notice that when Mencia does not stammer at the raisins and laugh at his own scenes, he only makes exaggerated observations that seem to lack sense of humor. Have you ever noticed how people in the Buick movement are really slowing down? It's like dah spirit nah! Even dwarfs and half-naked hot chicks cannot divert attention from Mencia’s apparent lack of talent. In addition, Mencia is not even a “rebel”, as he constantly and adamantly declares himself, which makes him a deceiver. <br /> <br /> If you can say something good about Mencia, then this is his effort. The man clearly does not have talent, but, like a wounded antelope in the mouth of a hungry alligator, God knows that he is trying.
