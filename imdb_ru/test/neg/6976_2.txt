I agree with one commentator who says that it’s really impossible to revise Glen or Glenda? objectively. If this were done, the film would have been appreciated as rather awful, given the cheerful, confusing dialogue, as a rule, mediocre towards the bad actions of the actors, as well as zero production values. However, such an assessment does not reflect the absolutely exciting experience of watching this film when it unfolds. Not the fact that the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle in the 1950s. This is not even a call for tolerance of people taking alternative life choices that fascinates, except as a historical relic. <br /> <br /> No, what does Glen or Glenda do? after 50 years is still a fascinating film that Ed Wood exposed his psyche in a way that so-called directors, such as Hitchcock or Godard, have never done, despite their extremely excellent talents. In Glen or Glend Wood, he is not afraid to reveal his deeply conflicting feelings about being a transvestite, despite a call for tolerance towards him throughout the film. Indeed, the conclusion of the film suggests that the character of Glen Ed Wood will be able to "kill" his female colleague Glenda, conveying the feelings of love and affection that Glen feels towards his female colleague to his future wife, Barbara. The psychiatrist even assures Glen and Barbara that when Glen makes this mental transfer, Glenda will disappear. So, although Wood could plead for tolerance of transvestites in general, he was not so sure of wanting it for himself. <br /> <br /> Moreover, Wood was not afraid to throw everything else that occurred to him. screen. He did this with any frames he could get. If that didn't work, so what? What the viewer saw in Glen or Glenda, especially it was the creative world of Ed Wood in all its fundamental weirdness. <br /> <br /> The only comment I would like to add to my comment above is that my two-star rating is based solely on the objective assessment criteria mentioned in the first paragraph. The strange memory effect that a film has, despite its technically disgusting qualities, I don’t think it can be appreciated.
