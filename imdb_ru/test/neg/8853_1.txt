Kairo, or Pulse, as is known among English-speaking viewers, is in Tokyo and starts his work when Sunny Plant Sales Officer Michi Kudo (Kumiko Aso) decides to visit his friend Taguchi (Kenji Mizuhasi) to find out about the computer disk works when she gets to his place, he gives her a disc, but then rather casually commits suicide before her. Meanwhile, a student named Ryosuke Kawashima (Haruhiko Kato) recently connected to the Internet and continues to receive eerie messages and images on her monitor, so he asks what happens to the computer Hariya Karasawa (Koyuki), she actually does not know, but it seems that the place where the spirit of the people goes when they die is filled, and they need to go somewhere else, and the Earth is as good as everything, right? These spirits do not like to share, so they kind of make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something like that, I really don't know, because the films are a little messy ... <br /> <br /> This The Japanese production was written and filmed by director Kiyoshi Kurosawa, and I’ll say right away that I hated Cairo, I hated everything about it, and it’s beyond any doubt that Asian cinema can create something as shit as any American cinematographer. too long a mess, the thing just has no Go with scenes that seem like they are from another movie, sequences that have no logical meaning or are not explained in any way, and Cairo is also the most boring movie I have sat this year. Two hours later, this is a real routine work, I really would like to rewind it forward, but I’m honest if nothing else, so I did it to the very end and, frankly, I would like it to be not. There are so many bad things in Cairo, I think the filmmakers were aiming for a surreal ambiguous and deliberately incoherent feeling, but these are the features that I despise in the film if they are not made properly. In addition, there is a whole Internet thing with which I simply could not have a relationship: I use the Internet all day, and this in no way frightens me. Then there is the fact that Cairo as a film provided me with zero entertainment value, maybe I'm a Neanderthal, but I like movies that I watch to entertain me, make some sense and not bore me to death. <Br /> <br /> As far as I know, Director Kurosawa completely cured insomnia, if you have problems falling asleep on this DVD and you sleep soundly for 10 minutes, I guarantee you. I did not think that Cairo was scary for the slightest reason, the whole thing on the Internet was ridiculous, and as for the scary, you should see some of the penis enlargement advertisements I get, now it's scary! I hate this movie, I hate this movie, sorry, I just need to repeat this basic thought again, twice. Forget about any action, tension or bleeding, because there are none. If you have a very nervous mood, then perhaps there are a couple of scenes that may intimidate you, otherwise this is all that is needed for a children's PG-rating. Urgh. <br /> <br /> The film looks so dull and boring that it is not true, the camera just sits there for very long frames, and when it moves, it moves very slowly, it has the whole style of Mexican soap opera. Since Kairo has a subtitle, it’s hard to judge the original speeches, so I won’t worry, it’s hard to care for someone when they don’t even speak the same language, and you don’t know what they say. <br /> <br /> Kairo is shit, I hated him, and everything is so simple and understandable. The fact that this is an Asian film does not automatically bring any benefit: a mess in the story, holes in the plot, the fact that it does not make sense, and this is an absolute dullness, means that Kairo would be torn apart by people if would it be American made. Worst movie I've ever seen at some distance this year. Cairo received a Hollywood remake as Pulse (2006).
