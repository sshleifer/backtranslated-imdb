SPOILER AHEAD! Mama (Lon Chaney, Jr.) is at large in New England College, looking for a college student (Ramsey Ames), who is the reincarnation of his beloved Princess Ananca. Dull, slow (even for 65 minutes - it moves more slowly than the mummy!), It acted indifferently, but the ending is worth the wait. Mom gets a girl (!!!!!), and she quickly grows old, as both slowly drown in the swamp. This is (I guess) the only time in the movie "Universal Monster", when the monster got a girl! In addition, it is a strictly amateur night. Probably the worst of the continuations of the mummy - and it says something!
