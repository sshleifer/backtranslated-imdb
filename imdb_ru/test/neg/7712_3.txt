Isn't it weird that crap movies always tend to be a little better when you start watching them with an attitude like, “boy, will it suck harder than few things have ever sucked before”? No one can shoot this movie with high ?? or even remotely positive expectations, since “House of the Dead 2” is a continuation of what is generally considered one of the worst horror disasters ever released. The original’s poor reputation actually turned out to be a big advantage for director Michael Hirst, as it was really easy to surpass the quality level of his predecessor. And how exactly should this be awkward for Uwe Boll, eh? Need I admit that the sequel to video without stellar power or advertising campaigns is MUCH better than its pretentious interpretation of video games? In case anyone still doubts: NO, “House of the Dead 2: Dead target” is not a good horror movie at all, but, YES: it is definitely better than the first one and even worth taking off if you are looking for an undemanding splash film many bloody slaughter, meanness and stupid humor. There is no real connection with the events in the first film (another advantage), and this second part opens like a typical rancid comedy on campus. The men's fraternity club plans to attack a sorority house inhabited by exceptionally blond students with huge breasts, but the party is interrupted when the mad professor (Sid Haig!) Drives his car over the girl and takes her to his lab to turn her into a zombie. This is the beginning of a rapidly spreading and deadly epidemic, but do not worry, as the government is ready and sends its best scientists and soldiers to campus to find survivors and return blood samples for the antidote. Tracking zombies seems to be the most common thing in the world for this squadron, they even called them Hyper Sapiens, but their ever-increasing number eventually endangers the lives of the most hardened soldiers. Director Hurst, fortunately, found his inspiration in more prominent classical genres, such as “Aliens” by James Cameron and ?? of course - the dead trilogy of George A. Romero, especially The Day of the Dead. Fortunately, he also did not make the same mistakes as Uwe Boll, who inserted frames with a real video game into his film (why?!?) And * slightly * exaggerated using the CGI-technician. HotD 2 contains heavy images of violence, such as cut female corpses and detailed amputations, but in fact it never becomes nauseous or shocking. Naturally, there is not the slightest reason for waiting, and there are all the horrible cliches of horrors. The film is very pleasant, while the narrator Mark Altman does not try to explain the origin of the zombie epidemics. They walk over corpses whose brains hang from skulls, so we really do not need to know what caused their death. Especially when the explanations are given by a blond whore from the female society, who clearly does not understand what all the medical terms mean. Just do not bite, dearie.
