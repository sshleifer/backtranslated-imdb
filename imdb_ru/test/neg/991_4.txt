Since their entire career was the pale personification of the Beatles, it is not surprising that shortly after the great Beatles debacle “The Magic Mysterious Journey” “Monkeys” would follow their own tasteless and creative talk about a film called “The Head.” there is so much true story with the plot (although MMT tried to define the plot), but also a jumble of parodies and passages interspersed with music, songs and outs. <br /> <br /> “Head” has no plot, except that "Try to escape from the" box "in which they are finding Xia (i.e., Monkey type casting and surrounding commercialism) and, nevertheless, always find yourself back in the box. Most scenes use breaks in the fourth wall and transition to other seemingly unrelated scenes. Filled with anti-Vietnamese military messages and attempts by the group to show their other talents, the film bounces randomly - it is also accused of numerous directors. <br /> <br /> The film, like “Magic Secret”, now some fans apologize for and misunderstood xy divine utterances. Phooey Like MMT, too many guys who have access to too much drugs, everyone is trying to think of something fancy and doing shit. <br /> <br /> Like MMT, “Head” has a few clever moments, and they offer some relatively unknown Monkees songs that are quite decent. It does develop a bit more charm than MMT, and is a little easier to endure, but it is not at all ironic that, like everything else that the Monkees did, it was just an imitation of what the Beatles did first ... even when it comes to about laying eggs
