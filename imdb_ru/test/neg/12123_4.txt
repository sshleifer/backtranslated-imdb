Think, Jumanji, but with the curse of death. A group of surfer guys picks up a game that takes the life of the one who plays it. Presumably it was made from the skin of a witch during the Spanish Inquisition and carries an unpleasant curse. <br /> <br /> Good, undemanding and just watchable tale - this is not something that you have not seen before. Honestly, he was there and made that story, which pushes all the right buttons to the extent that there are no real surprises. This is not the worst thing that SyFy launches, but, of course, this is not the best. There is a better choice, but if this is your only choice, you will not completely hate it.
