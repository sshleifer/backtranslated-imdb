I am surprised to read all the positive comments on this film. Even my 4 and 6 years were boring. The chipmunks are cute ... but the storyline is too obvious. Not recommended for young with the least sophisticated taste. <br /> <br /> We heard a few laughs from the audience when we were on it; but I was wondering why. <br /> <br /> I don’t admit that I’ve ever been a Chipmunk fan, but I expected to be entertained. As far as I can tell, it’s not even a film about a runaway. Just a hard look at "success that spoils too young." We have seen more than enough with Britney Spears et al., Aren't we? <br /> <br /> Don't worry.
