Wings Hauser and son Cole Hauser unite to make a film about neo-Nazi thugs aimed at a gay and terrorizing the city. Wings plays a hero, and his real son is a villain. A rather low-budget film, in which there are not so many redemption functions, and for some reason no one has seen it! Perhaps because it is quite a funny and funny movie, and the studio understood it! Perhaps Wings Hauser himself prevented the distribution of the Skins by seeing it himself! Maybe people just did not want to comment on such a bad movie! Well! I generally like the Wings and Cole as actors, but they both should have missed this film. Wings sent, wrote and was the lead actor in "Skins"! Very bad and stupid movie! 1/2 of *****!
