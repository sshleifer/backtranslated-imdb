For 28 years before September 11, there was another September 11 that represented a key date in the history of Chile, South America and the whole world. It was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in Chile overthrew Salvador Allende, the first Marxist president democratically elected anywhere in the world, and ended the Chilean experiment on the democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the military attacked the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is too biased and too nostalgic by the time of Allendeâ€™s reign to be an objective version of a man and his place in history. Times were alarmed and Allende was a controversial figure in the history of his country and the whole world. True, he was elected democratically, but his policies plunged Chile into an economic crisis. He was overthrown in a coup and right-wing dictatorship, followed by repression and flagrant violations of human rights, but he was also an ally of Castro, who saw in his policy another way to make a revolution. We will never know whether his attempt to build a socialist but democratic society will succeed. The filmmakers take a completely pro-Allende position, there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side, to answer questions, for example, why the middle class opposed it, or how its democratic views could be combined with support or support from Castro. The tone of comments is nostalgic and apologetic, almost propaganda. People who want to better understand this episode of the story should wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future.
