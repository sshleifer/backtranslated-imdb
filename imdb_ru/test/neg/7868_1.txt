The goal — the story of a special agent who, after following the order to kill Turkish “terrorists” (note that this is one of those American “films for guys who love pointless nationalistic super-patriotic crap films”), returns home and discovers that his former wife and two children become hostages. Charlie Snow has just a couple of hours to do what the terrorists tell him to get them back. <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst films I've ever seen. And if it were not for the one whom I actually know (and, possibly, by mistake), took him from the video store, I would never have watched this gigantic pile of garbage from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> The film plays like any ordinary action movie story I've ever seen. In fact, these are the things that they fake on various shows, that's how bad it is. I’ve half expected Live Clown in Live Color with Will Sasso of Mad TV to give the impression that Stephen Seagal would break off halfway to remind you that it was just an exaggerated action film, but now our heroes are fake how funny it really is. There was not even a good fighting or fighting. By the way everything turns around, you don’t even think that someone was kidnapped, some terrorists or something remotely interesting was happening. <br /> <br /> Not only is the story completely and completely uninteresting, the acting game is so terribly wooden. Just see where Stephen Baldwin, as a former Special Agent Charlie Snow, is on the phone with the kidnappers. They tell him that he has his wife, and they call her on the phone. She says: "Charlie, help!" Or something like that. And Baldwin calmly replies, “It's all right, dear,” you think that he was reading the script and trying to phonetically say the words. I believe that, despite the fact that it is a ridiculously bad film (one that goes into the bottom 100 on IMDb - a list that should be expanded to at least 250 films and should contain almost every Stephen Baldwin film), someone with some talent might have at least done everything possible not to overwrite it so much. Someone. Anybody I could not ignore the fact that everyone sounded as if they were reading the script. With the exception of this, the only person in the whole damn movie that has any talent (and therefore should not have been in this) is Deborah Wilson from Mad TV. <br /> <br /> It was a capital cheese festival. How really awkward.
