I do not understand how someone who actually read the mysteries of Didy Falco could mock them. Australian has no business in ancient Rome. There is nothing in this movie except the setting and characters, and they are wasted on a plot thin enough to read a silly script. Kevin Connor and Lee Zlotoff have a lot of nerves showing their names in the credits.
