Ruggiero Deodato is often credited with creating a cannibal subgenre with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST in 1975. But the director Umberto Lenzi, who was usually recognized as plagiarism by Deodato, filmed "A MAN FROM A DEEP RIVER" 3 years ago, in 1972. Is this a worthy beginning to the genre? Well .... not really ..... <br /> <br /> A photographer accidentally kills a person in self-defense and, retreating to the jungle of an Asian country, is captured by the indigenous tribe that keeps him prisoner, to make him slave labor, and ultimately accept it when he marries the chief's daughter. Throughout the film, I never felt like a horror movie. It was more like a drama, for example, “Horse by Name”, which I liked more. Ivan Rassimov is very good as a photographer, but I, Me Me Lai, as the leader's daughter, is memorable and wonderful. I have always been a fan of “Me Me Lai” since her exciting performance at JUNGLE HOLOCAUST, and she has never been commended for her acting skills because she almost never performs in her films. She is still very talented and charming. A lot of real injuries are the only thing in DEEP RIVER that can make it a horror movie, but even that doesn't work very well. <br /> <br /> HUMAN OF THE DEEP RIVER is nice to see for those who want to see how the cannibal subgenre began, but as a record in the genre, the records of Deodato and even later records of Lenzi are easily eclipsed. Recommended only for fans and lovers of Me Me Lai.
