I think the production value is fine ... probably deserves 4/10 or 5/10. It is traditionally filmed showing good-looking people with model quality and a small class. <br /> <br /> but the premise allowed me to be annoyed .. would a decent woman make such dirt? I mean, will she marry a man who will have sex with another woman? <br /> <br /> and, more seriously, she is also active in behavior ...... only in de Laclos's mind ... there are also many aspects in the film that make Eastern Europeans seem immoral <br /> <br /> In the end, it's just a movie, if he does not intend to humiliate women in general, I will give one more remark ... but obviously it makes <br /> <br /> a conclusion: an unpleasant piece of shit with a little by taste
