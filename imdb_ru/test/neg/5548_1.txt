Well, it broke my nerves, they got it right. I first rented this film back in the 80s, when my friend opened a video store, in which there were all the rare films that he could find. He also carried all the films about shock, horror and exploitation that he could dig up, and I watched almost all of them. I previously saw the Blood Feast, 2000 Maniacs and the Wizard of the Mountain. They were terrible (especially for a certain period of time), and the Wizard of Horus became rather nasty. However, Gore-Gore Girls was the one I remember as the most disgusting. <br /> <br /> I rented it on DVD some time ago because I wanted to hear a comment and thought that some cool dances and clothes. I forgot that this was done in the early 70s, so that fashion by that time was declining. I also realized that this is a movie that I did not need to watch more than once. It had fun parts, but gaaaaa! It was much more disgusting than I remembered. I am very exhausted with cinema blood, but a couple of times I was just too excited and had to look away. It was not the best choice of film to put on a DVD everything fresh and cleaned with the best sound and image quality. The comment is fun piecemeal and interesting (I think HG said the budget was $ 6,100.00). Perhaps H.G. Lewis didn’t feel good that day, but overall he looked tired and had the courage to be offended when an interviewer from Something Wild compared him, Ed Voodoo Jr. Sorry, mate, but you are not exactly Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> An extremely subtle story about a series of murders of topless go-go dancers in strip clubs. A handsome reporter and a really unattractive private investigator are joining together (as if he can't stand her) to try to solve the crimes. Henny Youngman owns a strip club. A bunch of really horrible murders are happening. <br /> <br /> I’m going to apologize in advance because I don’t want to sound as if I need to be illuminated, but this film was so misogynistic that n *** struck out more than The Company of People. Mainly because the main character and the director's dislike of women and the audience simply ooze out of each frame. This is not just killing. A very unattractive detective tries his best to treat a female journalist like dog dirt at every opportunity, for no apparent reason (as I said, he is not really a threat to George Clooney), and she still follows him like a puppy. She loses consciousness after seeing the horribly mutilated body, and he looks at her with disgust, then pours cold soda from the can onto her face to wake her up. Later he calls the police to report the crime: "No ... do not rush ... she seems to be just ... lost face." This guy is a hero. You can imagine how other characters relate to women. I could go on and on, but you get the idea. Please note that I am making this movie more politically correct (and much more funny) than it really is. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors are actors whom you pray that they never take off their clothes. not too easy for the eyes, so don't watch the movie just to see nudity, unless you're too picky. All the go-go dancers look as if they desperately want the scene to end so they can get their 10 dollars or any other rate H.G. paid them and get the medicine. Okay, this is not so bad, there was one dancer who looked as if she could be a professional, as well as another cool dancer with a huge afro who did not look as unhappy as the others, but still not too agitated . The only few interesting things were a couple moments of short unintended humor, for example, when the police officers responsible for the murder scene scream angrily: “Get out of here before I arrest all of you!” Not for a group of reporters, but for some other policeman, calmly doing their job (although they mumble and leave). Henny Youngman is quite funny, though, as Lewis says, he said his lines so quickly that they almost needed subtitles (I'm sure he tried to finish all day in a hurry so that he could pay and get the hell out of there, although he didn't It looks as if it objected to look at some naked chicks). <br /> <br /> It may be worth seeing just out of painful curiosity - for the era when the film was made, it was probably the most terrible thing that happened in the films of that time - or, if you really are a big fan of X G. Lewis and find it or low-budget filmmaking someone fascinating. Otherwise, if you saw it once, you saw it and can switch to other disgusting, but much more fascinating, low-budget films of the early 70s ... this film will not even say close to, say, "Pink Flamingos" when it comes to comes to the popcorn skip factor. If you have never seen the movie of H. G. Lewis, I recommend that you try the Blood Feast first, it will be much better. <br /> <br />
