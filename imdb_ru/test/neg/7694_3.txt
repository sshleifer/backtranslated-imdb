what a pity that our first film is so bad .............................. hello, what did you do in this film: (. .. it's terrible! and the director: (.. there is no history in this film. I slept when I watched this movie .. This is a disappointment, and most of the film crew are not from Saudi Arabia. It is supposed to be a comedy film, but it is not necessary of the elements. <br /> <br /> I know that this is the first cinema experience in Saudi Arabia, but I expect the best from Kaif Al Khal !! In the film there are some talented actors who donâ€™t help a lot of the text amb their talents. Finally, I would like to know your comments about this movie, guys ... this is bad or what?
