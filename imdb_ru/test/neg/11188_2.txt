The man (Gaston Modot) and the young girl (La Lys) go through the film, absorbed in passion for each other. They long to be together, but their moments together are constantly interrupted. The film is scattered along with the images and an hour later stops ......... do lovers find happiness ....? .. <br /> <br /> The film begins interestingly with the filming of scorpions, but you will soon realize that all this is a pretentious piece of bullshit. It is made in the form of a silent film with a random dialogue, and the sound track is constantly played in it, which at some point is so annoying that you turn off the sound and want to watch it as a silent film. Continuous drum rolls must have driven the audience crazy. There are some really funny moments, for example, when a Man kicks a dog and when he knocks down a blind man. Unfortunately, this humor is done in the name of art, so it's just a lie. The movie is crap.
