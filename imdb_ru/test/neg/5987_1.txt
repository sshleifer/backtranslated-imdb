This film entertained me with a lot of laughter over the actors who supported the film in a variety of crazy directions. If you like impressive sayings and sexy looking girls, they were all in the picture, girls and boys look exhausted before they graduated from high school. There is one scene where teens drive their car into a very artificial deer, and then start throwing it into a lake or ocean, which is repeated over and over. In this film, there is no horror, except the word “Awful” for the whole picture, and Arnold, who plays a plastic policeman, is really one sick character. Please do not waste your time watching this movie.
