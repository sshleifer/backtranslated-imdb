Even if I hadn’t read Ann Rice from The Vampire Chronicles, I’d probably think that this movie is just awful. <br /> <br /> It was tasteless, without plot, it makes absolutely no sense. I sat for a while, thinking about the plot, cut off from the book, and the longer I thought about it, the worse it was. To associate it in any way with the previous film “The Chronicles” is ridiculous, since it is absurdly incompatible with this film, not to mention the book. Few ideas taken from Rice's genius in The Vampire Chronicles have been exposed and ridiculed. <br /> <br /> This is an absolute insult to Anne Rice's fans everywhere, and there is such a pitiful excuse for the inheritance in Alia’s latest film, Truly, this is an insult to Aaliyah fans as well. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a single compliment can be made on sound effects, as well as on some graphic elements. No matter how good they are, it is still not enough to make me regret the time spent watching this film. In fact, I signed up for this membership for the sole reason of communicating with people who want to watch this film (7 years after its release), so as not to waste my time and not expect anything more than disappointment.
