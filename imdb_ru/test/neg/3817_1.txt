it's just me or all the horror films have become nothing more than boobs, slaps and excessive villain who can not be killed. there was no point in this movie. no matter what happens to the days of a man who is able to escape from a murderer, as in a dormitory. and at least make the killer a little more realistic. Victor Crowley was the worst killer I've ever seen. he reminded me of the appearance of a demon between a quasimodo and a leather face. it was excessive that when the winner lay there in the fire, no one thought to finish the work. and the finale was the biggest disappointment of all resembling a finale soprano. I had to agree with the guy behind me when he blurted out ... What the hell! if I could give the film a negative score, I would take care of that.
