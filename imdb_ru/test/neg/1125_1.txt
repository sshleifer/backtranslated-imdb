I can not believe that the actors agreed to make this "film". I could not even watch it for a very long time because of the fear of losing I.Q. points for every passing second. I assume that no one on the network that transmitted this dribble watched it before turning it on. IMDB ratings are only very low 1 for horrible, it's time to get some negative numbers there for such cases as these.
