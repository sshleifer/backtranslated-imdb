A remake of George Sluizer of his own - superb - film is a waste of time. Why was this even attempted? Kiefer Sutherland plays Jeff Harriman, whose girlfriend (Sandra Bullock, who has little time on the screen) is kidnapped at a service station Barney Cousins ​​(Jeff Bridges). Now Barney is portrayed as a type of guy whom no one would trust in the month of Sunday - he loses himself like a Frankenstein Monster, but without sympathy, and the actions of Bridges are absolutely terrible. Sutherland gets a little better when his character becomes a detective with the help of new love interest Rita Baker (Nancy Travis). <br /> <br /> The main problem with this version of “Vanishing” is the obvious need to satisfy for the Hollywood audience, avoiding the grim ending of the original film. Here the end is happy, which seems forced and unbelievable, and completely destroys the story. However, by this time the damage was done because Jeff Bridges turns the bad guy into a huge laugh.
