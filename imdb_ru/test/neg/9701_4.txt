Let me start by saying that I love the book and love the mini-series A & E. I was hoping to love this film, and I was absolutely ready to give it a moderate degree of artistic right in interpreting and shortening the real story. However, this film hardly resembles the original book. If only “the names were changed to protect the innocent,” I would probably enjoy the film as an entertaining, if inaccurate, historical storyline. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the name “Mr. Darcy” on a character who is emotional and weak, giving the name “Elizabeth Bennett” to a reckless, witty, often tearful man who does not care about the rules of society, and turning “Mr. Bingley "a fool with wide eyes, absolutely destroyed the idea that the director ever read the original story of Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> There are some truly stellar moments in this film - perhaps a total of 10 minutes are really excellent. Charlotte’s explanation of why she accepted Mr. Collins’s offer begins very well. She is 27 years old (in those days she was very close to a hopeless pimple), she becomes a burden for her family, and she is not a romantic. She wants only a "cozy home". However, the beautiful dialogue collapses when she grumbles: “Don't you dare judge me, Elizabeth. Do not dare to judge me! ”And runs away in tears. Later you will see Charlotte bow to Lady Catherine de Boer, which did not at all correspond to her character described in the book. <br /> <br /> Another good point is when Darcy catches Elizabeth in his house when she travels the area with her aunt and uncle. This was well done in the A & E series, but the Kira Knightley version of the film made the audience keenly aware of how humiliating for Elizabeth was this moment. Very nice. <br /> <br /> The ending also illustrated the level of love between Elizabeth and Darcy, which was not so clearly shown in the mini-series. I really appreciated this scene simply because I like to see a happy ending, and not just know that it happened. <br /> <br /> However, in general, this film eliminated the subtleties that were such an integral part of Austin’s pride and prejudice. The characters speak in a sharp combination of Austin's verbatim dialogue and contemporary phrases and colloquial expressions. Information referred to or suggested in the original work is clearly indicated in this version. Yes, time was a problem. This is just a short film, Yada Yada. But to turn a complex, beautiful book into a superficial love story is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some people said that they liked the moment when Darcy first saw Elizabeth, because this is obviously a case of “love at first sight”. Love at first sight? BUT? One of the best aspects of this book is that Elizabeth should not be a traditional beauty, and Darcy begins to love her for her wit and liveliness ... he literally "loves her for her mind." <br /> <br /> This version also had a moment (during the first sentence of Darcy) when both fiercely shouted at each other, leaning closer ... and closer ... and almost kissing ... but they suddenly move away to the side. Ugh! What a sad cliche. They are angry and disgusted with each other, but so attracted that it doesn’t matter that (at that time) they don’t even love each other? Funny! <br /> <br /> All characteristics were so far from those described in the book that it really looked like a different story. Mr. Bennet was harsh, Elizabeth used to act just as stupid as her younger sisters, Charlotte was emotional, somewhat unreasonable, and desperate for her own home - unlike a smart, slightly intriguing woman with an abundance of common sense, which is depicted by Roman. The relationship between Jane and Elizabeth is simply relevant, and not the deep-rooted love and admiration they have to feel for each other. <br /> <br /> I could take all this for just a poor interpretation of the novel, but I refused to accept all this in addition to many, many historical inaccuracies. Miss Bingley walked around barely dressed (her dress was similar to what others would wear as tight underwear). Elizabeth approached Netherfield with her hair loose and allowed her to fly. The family lounged around one morning, although the morning had to be reserved to summon acquaintances (or be called up in your own home). Elizabeth went out barefoot in her nightgown. And in a really horrible scene, Bingley entered Jane’s bedroom and talked to her (and sounded like an idiot) when she was sick. <br /> <br /> Most people feel that these are trifles, but I just wanted to either: a) a historically accurate film, or b) an accurate idea of ​​the heroes of the novel. <br /> <br /> Director / writer / one who sacrificed accuracy, refinement and a good story for a banal love story at first sight. I can agree that this film will be very easy for those who have not read the book or are not familiar with the social agreements of the time, and there is nothing wrong with that. I just could not overcome my desire to see a film in which there would be more than two beautiful faces.
