Charlie (George "Norm" Wendt) and Rhonda ("Just Say" by Julie Brown) are a pair of funny, murderous aliens who end up on Earth and stumble upon a tiny western city. They become deputy sheriffs and distribute the deadly form of justice to speedovers, murderers and others, while at the same time finding themselves on the bad side of some locals (led by Wayne Grace). In the meantime, their sexy alien daughter (Anastasia Sakelaris) arrives in poor / brilliant dress with her black husband (Christopher Brown) to find them, and television journalists and government agents appear to fill the time. <br /> <br /> From what I can say, this is a deliberate attempt to cover every possible genre (comedy, fantasy, horror, western ...) in one film, and what a stupid, unfunny mess, despite the energetic game from two stars. The script is absolutely brutal.
