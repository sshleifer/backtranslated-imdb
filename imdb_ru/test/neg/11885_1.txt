A terrible, stupidly stupid film about corruption in the Louisiana Purchase Lumber Company. <br /> <br /> Everyone in Louisiana seems corrupt and inept. A member of the college’s English department can only sign his name with an X. <br /> <br /> When it turns out that a straight-lined senator (Victor Moore) comes to the state to investigate, everyone there tries to blame the innocent but stupid character of Bob. Hope. <br /> <br /> Is it any wonder that Vera Zorina did not get the role of Maria in the 1943 film “For Whom the Bell Tolls?” <br /> <br /> Naturally, Corrupt Officials, together with Nadezhda, are trying to show Mori photos Zorina to destroy him politically. Moore marries the head of the restaurant, whom he insulted when he asked for a ham sandwich. He thought that the reason she was upset was that it was a kosher restaurant. That's all the humor is the absolute mess of the movie. <br /> <br /> When Hope tries to defend himself in Congress, he shoots James Stewart in the film “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” By that time, the film had already gone too far to give a good answer. <br /> <br /> Music and lyrics are absolutely terrible. This song, praising Louisiana, sung differently, is absolutely terrible. Is Irving Berlin somehow related to the music of this horrible movie?
