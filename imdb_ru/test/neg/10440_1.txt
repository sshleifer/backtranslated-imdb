This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is not the slightest historical accuracy, in fact, reality is changing to the opposite. Just one example: Morgan hunted several ethnic Chinese he encountered. Acting is beyond praise, the script is a poorly written lie. I have never seen the worst fake beards. <br /> <br /> Hopper arrived in Australia and reportedly made the film only if the script was completely rewritten so that he could become a hero. Since the script was written ten times on the fly, it can explain how bad it is and how scattered the film is. <br /> <br /> Any film about Ned Kelly is much better than this movie.
