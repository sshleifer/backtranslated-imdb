This is a piece of celluloid CRAP. You can say when you watch a movie about the mafia "want to be" ... and that is all. It did not make any sense at all, did not start at the beginning of his life, the characters were everywhere ... and the DEAD "DIVINE" did not even exist until PUZO wrote a book! ..... THEN, the real mafia, borrowed the PHRASE and made it its AFTER the film ... THIS piece of rubbish might have thought that the phrase (representing the mafia don) was used back in the 20s ... when these people were only called DON ".... outside of the original movie" The Godfather ", if you want to watch another decent movie about mobs, see" The Last Don (Part 1) "Puzo, Part 2, sucks.
