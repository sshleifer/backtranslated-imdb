As a recent convert to Curb Your Enthusiasm, which prompted me to watch all the episodes of the season, I expected more, much more from Jeff's efforts. <br /> <br /> When I watch a movie that offers a piece of the average "Joe." In life, I need reasons to be interested, take care, feel and believe. And with Jeff Garlin at the helm, I also expected many brilliant comedy moments. This film has let me down again and again. <br /> <br /> Jeff plays with his mother, a sad sad girl who is a social disaster. He has not had a relationship, real or even casual, for many years. It seems that he is mostly unemployed and, as noted, caresses his beloved mom. Can things get worse? Of course. Soon, he will be fired all around, including Silverman, Second City (his comedy workshop) and his agent. All reinforce his status "loser". Silverman's “fat” experiment was as cruel as it was absurd. His obsession with the role of "Marty", as a means of saving his career, also reached a big dead end. <br /> <br /> While the last moments of the film give an idea of ​​the best moments of the upcoming cinematic journey, ”although with occasional golden glimpses, unfortunately, not enough.
