Take a breath that the stupid government tried again to create an inexhaustible and indestructible soldier, and, of course, the experiments went terribly wrong, burdening us with a half-mutant who spit on us and tearing like a little girl when he was upset. Lance Henriksen plays the role of an honest scientist who immediately quit the experiment, learning that it was a military project, but he comes back (taking the whole family with him) when he learns that his favorite guinea pig has gone to kill. “Mind Ripper” is certainly a watchable horror movie, but it is very unoriginal and contains almost all the unsuccessful clichés you can come up with (including the story of a detached father / rebellious teenage son ... yawn). The characters are like wooden puppets, the most stupid things are said and done, and there is a completely meaningless sequence of dreams ... coming from a monster !!! There are some interesting bloody scenes that can be enjoyed, and some of the isolated desert places are actually creepy. Lance Henriksen is, as always, adequate, although this is another worst production he is shooting, and Giovanni Ribisi certainly deserves a better film to debut in it. For some reason, this anonymous 90s thriller is also known as “The Hills Have Eyes.” part 3. "Is it because it talks about terrorizing members of one family in the desert? Is it because this time Wes Craven became a producer again? Or maybe maybe because the monster is bald at the end, like freaky Michael Berryman Original 1977? Who knows ... who cares? Wes Craven probably financed this project because his son co-wrote the script, and he always seeks to discover that your offspring is as inept as you are. Not recommended !
