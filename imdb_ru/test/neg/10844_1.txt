This is a strong recommendation for those who are reading this review, who have never seen the movie “Full reality”, do not waste your time and money on renting this bad excuse for the film. Without peers, this is the only worst film I've ever seen in my life. I have had nightmares of this movie since I saw him. The acting was terrible, and any amateur filmmaker could make a more decent film. The film frankly tears away superb sci-fi films, such as TimeCop or Total Recall (whence the name seems to have been obtained). Sorry, but I just think that there is a big entertainment value in watching the cardboard box for two hours. If you’ve already seen this movie, I’m sorry that you’ve been through what I did.
