Well, firstly, I have not yet seen The Silence of the Lambs .... but I think I would have fallen ill if I had seen it before this work. Not from terrible violence, but from the lack of everything else. Anthony Hopkins was very good at the role of Hannibal, and I really believed that he was as psychotic as he had deceived himself, but according to the reaction of the audience around me, the film was filled with stamps from the movie “Silence”, as a result of which I lost points where others laughed at what was on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now I heard that the film will be very terrible, and if the director wants to distract ... he did it ... but, only in 2 sequences? I mean, if you want it to be terrible, and I mean, so terrible that you are going to play a movie with it ... you need more than two episodes ... I always see it, how the movie should become that cinematic gem that will eventually take you to another place and time or surpass it (which, in most cases, is done with a bad taste). But this film left me sitting on a chair and falling asleep from time to time. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore are movie stars, right? Well, with the exception of Hopkins, I did not feel that way. Who cared for the stupid Italian policeman? I definitely did not. So in fact, there’s a big hole in the movie about a guy who dies anyway. I mean, come on .. who cares? <br /> <br /> In short, the film is good if you want to see Lecturer and Starling again, but if you are going to get a really good thriller .. you will jump once and be detached, maybe twice. Depends on your level. <br /> <br /> Thinking about how much money this film will bring ... there will probably be another Hannibal, and this film will probably not be shown on video until autumn. If you have to see it ... wait and save from $ 3.50 to $ 4.00 and get it on video. Do not spend big money on this movie.
