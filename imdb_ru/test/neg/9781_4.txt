The Bone Snatcher about a group of miners who go in search of the missing team of miners in the Namib Desert. When they are found, they are nothing more than clean bones, and they could not be dead for more than six hours. The story keeps you interesting as to exactly what caused it. The characters are good enough, and the acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> After about an hour and ten minutes, when you find out what makes the bones brush, you sigh, “Oh, that’s really stupid.” , and it's a shame that he took such a bad turn. Therefore, I cannot recommend this film. I gave him 4/10.
