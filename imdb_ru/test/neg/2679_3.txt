Dude, the 90s really were a terrible decade for a movie. The films lack a good style, and often lack stories. <br /> <br /> This sixth entry in the long series on Halloween is definitely bad. You just never go down in history, because this is not a very well thought out and complex film. <br /> <br /> This is just a poorly made film that also suffers from the fact that he didnâ€™t portray and write convincing characters that are in it. Dr. Loomis seems to be in it just to be in it. It is a pity that this was the last role in the film by Donald Pleasant. It's nice, and also in some way, that his last role in the movie is about Halloween, but he definitely deserves to be in the best. <br /> <br /> The film never feels real danger and the character of Michael Myers just never seems threatening or frightening. Perhaps this is because it was too noticeable throughout the entire film, from the very beginning. He does his usual things again, but without special class or originality. In addition, attempts to uncover the past of Meier do not actually work, for the main reason that this is not very well explained. Obviously, the script has undergone various rewriting before, as well as very possible during the filming. Several scenes were even re-shot or added after the first episode was far from pleasant. <br /> <br /> The film most often looks and looks like a television. This is also due to the lack of really good blood. As in the horror film, in fact, there is not enough of almost everything to make it good or even original to watch. <br /> <br /> So far the worst of the series! <br /> <br /> 3/10
