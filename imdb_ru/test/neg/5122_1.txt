I give Flashdance the lowest rating of 1 out of 10, because it’s nothing more than a series of music videos with a short film surrounding the music videos, to watch as a full-length movie. Since when is considered a film? Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens, a beginning 18-year-old dancer who, for some reason, works as a welder at a steel mill in Pittsburgh. Not the direction of work in which most older women fall, and especially 18-year-olds who have just graduated from school. Meanwhile, at night, she works as an exotic dancer who never takes off her clothes in a fat spoon called Mawby's. However, looking at the well-set and well-honed dance routines that the girls do every night at Mawby's, you might think that they work in the best casino on the Las Vegas Strip. <br /> <br /> Alex has a predictable romance with his boss Nick Hurley (Michael Nuri), who is about twice her age. Resisting Nick's success, because going out with the boss is not a good idea, she doesn’t waste time going all the way with him after their first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship at work, which does not make sense, considering how it may look like for Alex's colleagues. <br /> <br /> When Beals is not doubled for the dance of many episodes in the film, her character spends most of his time throwing tantrums. Alex's dream is to get an invitation only to audition at the prestigious Pittsburgh Dance Conservatory. It is inexplicable that when her boss / boyfriend helps her get the audition she dreamed about, she throws one tantrum. She angrily tells Nick that she doesn’t audition because of his interference, and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just one scene that makes you wonder what the hell the creators thought when they did it. <br /> <br /> Of course, in the end, Alex is auditioned at the Conservatory. She puts the dance routine in front of the Conservatory Council, which is so ridiculous that you would think that it was in the film presented to the MTV generation. Oh yes, this is a dance routine in a film promoted by the MTV generation. <br /> <br /> I don’t think I can judge whether Beals can really act well based on what I saw in the movie “Flashdance.” This is because the character she is forced to play is so bad written, I don’t think it will be a litmus test of her acting abilities. <br /> <br /> You should pass it on to the creators of “Flashdance" though. This film is proof that the worst film production can be covered by a deft marketing campaign In this case, the best-selling and award-winning soundtrack and music The rock clips for the mentioned soundtrack are in a big rotation on MTV. If they had devoted more energy to writing the script, they could come up with a plot and story with the characters I cared about. Instead, we get characters with laughter that make funny scenes that one viewer with a functioning brain cannot be taken seriously. A truly forgotten “film.”
