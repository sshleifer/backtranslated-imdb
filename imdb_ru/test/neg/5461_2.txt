It looks like one of these Australian films shot by “talented” students and funded by the government. It is full of smart pictures of colors and shapes and verbal excursions in Freudian psychology, which both students and teachers will appreciate, but on the whole it is perceived as a silly mockery of good cinema, good storytelling and good taste in general. This is what happens, I suppose, when art students become so obsessed with condescension. "Pink flamingos" are far ahead of the same items. Some porn movies from the 70s are much more watchable and inspiring. The book of Revelation is not completely devoid of merit, but in general it is well below average.
