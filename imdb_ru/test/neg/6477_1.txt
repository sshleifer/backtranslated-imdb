I think there are two ways to make a film with children as a target audience. You can either say to yourself: a) “Let's make a film that children will love today!” Or b) “Let's make a film that I would love when I was a kid!” that attract a young audience. Notable examples are ET, Gunie or Indiana Jones. This damn cat is an example of the first approach. You see these flat, incredible characters who say things that should be funny, but they are not. The plot itself lasts ten minutes, but instead it goes on and on. And although I am not a child, I do not quite understand what should be fun for children in this film? Awkward policemen chased by a dog, an old lady with a twig, or Christine Ricci's sarcastic followers? One actor showed a spark of talent with his very acrobatic humor: Doug E. Doug plays an FBI agent.
