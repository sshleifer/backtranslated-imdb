One IMDb reviewer calls Eaten Alive a bearable film for the “cannibalist”. Are there any such people? I didn't know. But if you are one of them, hey, there is a ball. The rest of you may think that this joke is hard to swallow (pun intended), even if, like me, you consider yourself to be a connoisseur of horror films. I have been an avid fan of horror for 15 years, although until a few weeks ago I never got to the cannibal subgenre, and I think that, strangely enough, China owes China its complete disregard for copyright laws. You see, I bought a DVD collection of two discs of all Wesley Snipes films for 20 yuan (about $ 2.75), which included The Last World of Cannibal, Mount God Cannibal, Food Alive, Holocaust Cannibal , “Next,” with Nicolas Cage and something called Voodoo Lagoon, along with Blade 1-3, in Chinese. Nice. <br /> <br /> As a second sequel, I immediately had the feeling that the film begins with a street-eating cannibal, wandering around major American cities, shooting unsuspecting Americans with poisonous darts, and then crawling at full speed. It seems that due to lack of funds to save cannibals to the movies, they have now made their way to the mainland. Later you may be shocked to learn that this guy is on a “training exercise.” Lock up your daughters! <br /> <br /> Soon the film becomes an old disappeared sister's usual business, as a young blonde named Sheila begins her own investigation into her sister’s disappearance, which does not look like anything to her, but she is ready to spend most of the film naked, so I think it doesn't matter. It seems that after shooting one of his victims, the unfortunate ogre, whom we met at the beginning of the film, who was not accustomed to living in a big city, ran onto the road and was killed by a moving van. <br /> <br /> Brilliant policemen discovered a mysterious fragment of the film on it, which shows Sheila's sister, involved in some strange ritual behavior, but, besides the movie, this guy is a complete mystery. As the police chief complains, “we don’t know anything about him, except that he is dead!” The poor guy, he must have a headache from all this. I recommend taking a nap. Fortunately, Sheila is such a girl who can throw tens of thousands of dollars, as if she is not looking for anything in search of her sister. Ideal for hiring brave cartoons of the wilderness, because the police clearly will not help. <br /> <br /> Obviously, nothing new has been added to this subgenre. On the contrary, cannibalism almost seems to be the background of a completely different kind of bad film, about saving the missing from dangerous elements. Thickening the plot of this clothesline is not difficult, all you have to do is add the cartoon jungle cult of people who follow some guy who calls himself Jonas, who believes in using pain as a way of reuniting man with nature, the process they name "cleansing." Personally, I prefer to just urinate on the street from time to time. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of the film is when Sheila is caught by one of the cult members - an overweight guy who looks like he had a three-day weekend. from the office to appear in this film. When he gets his faithful first-aid kit to give her a shot, he warns her: "If you do not believe in Jonah and in cleansing (through pain), God will help you." Then he gives her a chance and when she shudders from a tiny pinch, he politely apologizes to her. I feel like a true believer in this guy! <br /> <br /> As regards blood, there are a lot of unpleasant sound effects on random shots of dead animals and more than enough disgusting videos when women are cut and eaten. alive, so I think that here the film lives up to its name. The game, as one would expect, is strikingly bad, and, which is quite interesting, the installation is also effectively flawed, but still strangely effective. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think that you should be able to communicate with people who believe in completely insane cults in order to communicate with anyone in the film. There are many strange religious ceremonies that make it harder to understand why Sheila’s sister decided to turn away from normal society. I'm all for individualism and doing my job, but come on. <br /> <br /> After a while, the film goes even further into the main film, Escape from the Mill, just before we witness the wildest inappropriate transmission of Glory, Glory of Alleluia in cinema history. BLIMEY. <br /> <br /> Note: In this film, a woman is raped by a severed snake. If you need an extra reason to never watch it, seek professional help. Avoid this mess at all costs.
