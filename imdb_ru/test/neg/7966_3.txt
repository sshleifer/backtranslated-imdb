There is no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was a seriously talented director. Many of his films are an undisputed classic that has stood the test of time and is very watchable to this day. This list may include "39 steps", "Rear Window", "North to North-West", "Dial M" for killing, dizziness, "Birds", "Shadow of Doubt" and several other films. <br /> <br /> However, “Suspicion” is not aging at all and in fact so unattractive that it seems to me that it was probably a bad film even by the standards of 1941. A list of scenes that work well may be listed in a matchbox with a pencil. The script is mostly free and ridiculous, but the action seems so forced, wooden and bordering on amateur looks that it is almost unbelievable. Joan Fontaine is trying to strengthen the position, but she is on a slippery slope, and Cary Grant does not provide much help. His acting is sometimes so bad that I have seen the best performances in school performances or in theater lessons in a college where a chemical engineer plays for the first time without formal training. <br /> <br /> After about 30 minutes of watching this movie, you may find that in the dark you reach the cover of the DVD to see if you accidentally selected some special version of the publication that was combined without any editing. . <br /> <br /> The theme is serious, however, the film has a stupid and banal feeling, which seems to be just inappropriate, you are numb with bewilderment. <br /> <br /> “Suspicion” is basically impossible to track down, and another very, very overvalued bad film.
