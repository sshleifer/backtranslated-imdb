I almost cannot describe in words how terrible this Irish vanity project (funded by Canadian taxpayers - both federal and Alberta). <br /> <br /> A cute Canadian woman (Katie Ranheim) unexpectedly appears there, Real life was a star athlete in Alberta, for no other reason to provide Canadian content. Credits also indicate that some pubs in Calgary have helped. <br /> <br /> Here everything is badly filmed and, at least, from third parties (pieces of poorly digested Trainspotting, Lock Stock, Snatch and Reservoir Dogs are the most obvious thefts). Avoid the plague unless you realize one of those hiking “so bad, almost funny” nights in front of your TV channel.
