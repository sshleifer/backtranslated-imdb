I am usually a fan of “art” and “foreign” films, but when I saw this film, my reaction was “it should be called experimental, because it does not make sense”. “Action” is static, and at the same time it bounces from one place to another. There are not enough names to understand who is who and what their relationship is. Obviously, the main thing was to show that in the face of murder, adultery, and generally strange and dissolute behavior, the medicine proposed by the authorities is to expel a completely innocent black person.
