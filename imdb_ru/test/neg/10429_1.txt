Any film school student could make a movie 1000 times better than a piece of trash. As someone who read the book, I expected that even a direct retelling of the book would make this film fair. There was a chance that a talented director could go beyond Woodward’s story and make a great film. <br /> <br /> Well, the director really went beyond Woodward’s narration. He added a fashionable Latin American angel named Velasquez, who was not in the book. He ordered Bob Woodward to interview the dead Belushi during an exchange in the morgue. In the film, the thought was that someone was stoned on a PCP and looking at his navel. <br /> <br /> If this is a spoiler for you, thank me for it, because this is absolutely the worst movie ever made.
