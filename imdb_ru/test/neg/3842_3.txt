At times, when I watch this film, I start thinking that the people who made this film were on drugs. What is wrong with this film, I will tell you the "Conspiracy", "Bad Joke". Bad actors and just heroes - everything is just bad. br /> <br /> The film tells about Pest Vargas, a two-digit cheater who, for $ 50,000, is given a chance to survive for 24 hours by a German hunter who kills people for a living. Therefore, now Pest must think about how to think about this hunter before they kill him. <br /> <br /> I know what you are thinking, "What the hell is this?" one more imitator Ace Ventura, who is trying to get money, in fact, this plot is just dull and confused, sometimes it changes the plot of the plot, and you get lost during the film. <br /> <br /> As for the funny scenes, in this film I had a deadpan look, oh yes, I smiled a couple of times, but did not laugh out loud. In addition, jokes are commonplace and visible before watching how Ace Ventura meets Dumb and Dumb, but ill. <br /> <br /> Regarding character development, dry and flat. You will learn little about the main character Pest. All you know is that he is an annoying crook, but that is all, that he doesn’t change his image or looks a bit clever, it’s just corny. that he is crazy and wants to return to Germany. In fact, you start to wonder why this guy lives on the island, if he has the money to go to Germany. Hunter's son Himmel lives better, but not by much. He is a coward and a snake ... obsessed for reasons of the end, he confronts his father and takes the side of Pest. <br /> <br /> As for the action, no. Only there were some memorable performances, but only at the top. For example, John Legizomo is so superior in performance and not suited to his role that he is irrelevant, like Jeffrey Jones, who plays the same hunter, but gives a stereotypical idea. and. as otherwise, either simply underused or simply excessive. <br /> <br /> A total bad comedy you'll find for $ 2.00 at K-Mart.
