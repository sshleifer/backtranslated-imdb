This film is definitely the worst film I've ever seen in my life. The EX woman is pretending to be several people in order to gain access to her ex-husband. Killing people for no reason in the baths to achieve its goal. Women I don’t think of ever went to an acting college. She just spends the whole movie on stupid expressions and looks as if she is trying her best not to look at the camera. Failure in most cases. She made friends with the wife and son of her ex-husband, she does it to use them against her husband. First, when you watch this film, you think that the “Former” wants to kill her ex-husband, perhaps because he treated her badly. But in reality, a woman is obsessed with a man and wants to return him. The two of them enjoyed rough entertainment (of course, using whips). My advice to the general public: don't buy this film, don't rent this film and don't watch it like me (at 1.15 on FOX)
