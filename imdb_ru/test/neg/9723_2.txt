Most of the criticisms of this film were pretty damn accurate. This is an hour and a half waste of time after a handful of very good schoolchildren whined and cried about life. There are about twenty minutes of magic, and absolutely no scary or exciting moments. Our actress is treated like donkeys, and it seems they are completely satisfied with their position. The main characters, these sons of Ipsmith, are boys with posters for any clothing store for pop culture. You can't communicate with them, damn you, you can barely understand them. The story unfolds on its own, and when it finally falls into the final battle, it is nothing more than a volleyball match that does not last long enough to make up for this devastating scenario raped by O.K.
