Burt Reynolds plays Gator McClusky, a handsome ex-convict, just released from prison, who helps the feds recruit a corrupt sheriff from a small town. Critics often blamed the laid-back Reynolds for simply calling the “good old man” performances; true, he is on autopilot. But at one time Reynolds knew how to make a restrained effort work well for himself. Phantom and beautiful, Reynolds is approaching to wink at the audience as much as he can without parting; He seems to know these thickets, like any movie star, while director Joseph Sargent provides an easy pace and sweaty atmosphere that enlivens the South. Unfortunately, the story is small, and the support actors Ned Beatty and Bo Hopkins outplay (as usual). Diane Ladd is good in a small part, and the real daughter Laura Dern can be seen in the background. Reynolds returned to this character in 1976 in Gatore. * 1/2 of ****
