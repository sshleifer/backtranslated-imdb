Bad film About a bad film. Is it original or what? If so, this is the only good thing about it. Beautiful Ally Chidy could not prevent this bomb to destroy cinemas and video recorders everywhere. It should also be noted that she and the other actors hired by Danny Aiello were billed for both themselves and the characters that they played in his film with a rating D. this will lead to delusions of grandeur.
