After their star runner dies after the race, members of the athletics team are pursued and killed by a mysterious masked killer, eager to avenge the death of the girl. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning of this film it was quite obvious that it would not be very good (at least as far as the true quality goes). The “dramatic” race on the track at the end of the opening scene was one of the least believable sporting events I have ever seen in the film. It would seem that the winner of the race has never run before in his life. Not just a treadmill. but run at all. Ever From there we get terribly unrealistic female navy, which violated numerous rules of appearance with the help of her jewelery and makeup, not to mention the fact that her hair hung loosely on her uniform collar. Ridiculously awkward camera angles, pitiful bloody effects and actions ranging from frighteningly incredible to boring unfinished (all in one actor, mind you), all help make this movie one of the most unintentionally hilarious horror films ever created, On the other hand, writing it was not so terrible, and the story was really fine. But the direction was terrible, aggravated by offensive bad cinematography. The action ranged from acceptable to just awful. However, despite all the awkwardly bad elements, there is something here, be it cheese or something else that I cannot understand, which makes the film extremely pleasant and very worthy to watch. Maybe it was just Bath White. <br /> <br /> Mandatory elements of the Slasher: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: the death scenes were quite funny, but the blood was just awful: blood spurted from the impossible corners no real wounds from knives, etc. But in this film, for the first time, there was a “Death by Football” scene that I had ever seen. <br /> <br /> Sex / nudity: there was a bit of nudity (I mean, Linnea Quigley in it, after all), and some over-excited high school students, but nothing superfluous. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): If you think leather gloves, stopwatches, track suits and fencing masks - this is cool, this is for you. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Pausing: not at all. In the dressing room for girls, one moment happens which I was preparing to fear. but it just led to some typical stupidity and was destroyed for me. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: A little, but if you can't figure out the identity of the killer about 20 minutes after the film starts, then I'm not very confident in your deduction. <br /> <br /> - An awkward dance scene: there is an excellent improvised jam session ("Graduation Day Blues") with a guitar and harmonica, which leads to amazing performances of the 80s. Soon this is followed by some strange mix of a 70s disco and 80s breakdance, which may have been the scariest part of the film. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 4/10. Do not take it seriously, and you may like it (like everything else that Troma touches). <br /> <br /> -AP3-
