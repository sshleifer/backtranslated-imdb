I read a lot of comments here about how this movie sticks to the book ... I don't think any of them really read it. Edgar Rice wrote about the dangerous African jungle, and the monkeys were killers and hunters. Now we know differently, and this film depicts monkeys in a more modern form. I have never seen a Tarzan film that even comes close to Edgar's vision. Perhaps, once in Hollywood, talented and respected authors will be entrusted to tell a story. So if you have never read a book and enjoyed a good story about feelings and a fluffy rabbit look at wild animals, perhaps a good cry, watch the movie I hope John Carter from Mars will get more respect than Tarzan. We miss you, Edgar!
