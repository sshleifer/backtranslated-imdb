This film is so unreal. Such French films are just a waste of time. Why watch this movie? Even I did not know .. why. What kind? A well-known sex scene of half brothers and sisters? Although the sex scene is so real and frank, the story on which it is based is so unreal. What is the use of it, then? Can you easily find in life half a sibling involved in such things? <br /> <br /> What did I learn from this movie? Yes: some people just love to spend time creating such films, such stories, such meaningless ones. But for those who love nihilism, nothing in life or just life without hope, then here is for you ... you should watch this movie. <br /> <br /> However, it is worth adoring only one thing: KATRIN DENEV, She is such an amazingly beautiful woman.
