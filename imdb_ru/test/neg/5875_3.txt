Talking about how lush Michael I was, Michael Vincent, led me to the point of stupidly revisiting this DTV recording of the mid-90s. The child was injured when he saw that a man from “Ice Cream” was shot dead in the 1950s, and he grew up crazy from “Ice Cream” (Clint Howard). Something happens, and people disappear and find themselves in ice cream. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> Director Norman Apstein (deducted as Paul Norman) made a career of doing porn before that and went back to him later. This is what you get for the fact that all the killings take place behind the scenes. And because he threw a thin baby fat and made him wear a fat suit. Just drop the fat kid! In addition, there is a scene in which Vincent stoically responds to a group of runaway psychos surrounding him. He was either completely drunk and scared for his life, or the directors captured him “Am I really sank so low?” A complete shame. Despite the fact that it was a budget trash, it built a few good names, including David Noton, Olivia Hussey, David Warner and Doug Llevelin from THE PEOPLE COURT. How can you make a boring slasher with this composition, I can not do it.
