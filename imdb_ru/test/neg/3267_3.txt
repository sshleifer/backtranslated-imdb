When I first watched this movie, I did not know its name. I realized that it had a Chevy Chase with the same name as in Caddyshack, so I thought it was Caddyshack 2. At the end of the movie, when I found out that it was Caddyshack 2, I was disappointed. They could do better. Dan Aroyd, I thought it was bad. The whole story was bad. Call this movie a different name, but don't call it Caddyshack 2. You give this great film a bad name. Jackie Mason's daughter, when I first saw her, was like his wife. How old is this girl? Geez. How about making this movie a bit believable. I thought Chevy Chase was good.
