This film was so terrible that I could not get through all this without turning it off, it was so bad! When I watched it, I continued to think that it looked like some really cheap movie, shot in the 60s, or something like that, with terrible effects, but then I realized that it was done only in year <br /> <br /> the dialogue and acting was really very terrible, and the plot was practically absent. I didn't think anyone would come back to making films that look so cheap and old, I'm not sure that they did it on purpose or they really had no budget for this film at all. It looks like it was filmed on someone else's video camera at a local resident's house or something like that. Maybe they thought they were retro or something like that, but it just looks silly. <br /> <br /> I really don't know how anyone could really like it. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 5 * x.
