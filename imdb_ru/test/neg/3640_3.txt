This show makes me (and many others) hate their lives. Let's face it, Zoe is perfect; she is pretty, gets good grades, everyone goes to her for advice, she is popular, she goes to an amazing school with amazing rooms. The reasons for which I gave this show 3: 1. The game is terrible. Sometimes I just want to offend people who shoot these mediocre actresses (especially Victoria Justice) on television. 2. Characters are incredible and inappropriate. You have a typical popular girl. Cheerful, shallow, stupid, stereotypical girl, who portrays a terrible actress. Then you have a typical joker guy who is somewhat normal and actually pleasant. Then a smart girl with a stereotype that is abnormal and clearly does not fit into her ideal popular friends. Then stuck rich handsome boy who would be happier to look in the mirror all day. Then I want to be an actress played by another stinking actress. And the last guy is a normal nerd. 3. The plot is boring and slop. 4. I hate how spoiled these characters are. Can't they just be normal! 5. Everything ends perfectly for them, and we are all reminded of how much our life stinks.
