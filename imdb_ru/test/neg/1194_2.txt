I watched this movie in the theater in Edinburgh with three other Americans and our friend from Manchester, and we all thought it was a waste of time. We'd rather spend an extra hour watching the empty Star Wars III dialogues playing in the hall than all this. <br /> <br /> Starting out with one of the worst jokes I've ever seen on celluloid on the big screen, he didn’t take off with a bang. throughout the film we had the feeling that the jokes were just trying too hard, the writers thought so much about this production that it was possible to see that the joke should have taken place 2 minutes before the start, and then when it came, it was so dull that you couldn't even smile; As a vivid example, I quote a ending giraffe. <br /> <br /> The plot itself gives me some interesting thoughts that entertain me much more than what is happening on the screen. I think that from this point of view much more could be done (two different worlds, the experience of heroes in fish out of water, confusion and surprise when people try to comprehend and distinguish characters and writers from each other.) But too much time is spent on to bring this painful story to the end with as many “bizarre” and “stupid” as is possible from a human point of view. <br /> <br /> And to say that the characters of the 16th century demonstrate any additional talent for writers, it is an insult to clever writers and editors who could possibly make this film a worthy 40-minute memory; but no, this is a feature film of torture about injustice. <br /> <br /> When we left the theater, in which there was VERY little laughter, I heard a British couple of young hip-electro collisions behind me say, “It was pretty good, wasn't it? what will happen next ". And the girl replies:" Yes, quite surprising. " two lovers at the end, this film was a success, but I believe more in British life than this one. <br /> <br /> I haven’t been laughing so hard at the comedy film since American Pie II.
