I made this film, expecting it to suck, and he did not disappoint me. I rented it with some friends as a joke. But what we got turned out to be worse than anyone could have imagined. <br /> <br /> It all starts with what you suck before you pull it out of the box. It looks like Blade's rip-off, and the guy on the cover is nowhere in the film. This is called "Vampire Killer", but isn't the killer the one who kills for hire? Well, this guy kills at will, so it doesn't make him a killer. <br /> <br /> Then, when you actually insert a disc into it, it gets worse. First, the menu animation is lame. But when you really start a film, everything, from set design to lighting (or lack thereof), is terrible. You know that a movie is bad when loans even suck. The game is ridiculous. Children's action. The letter is elementary. And the worst direction is>
