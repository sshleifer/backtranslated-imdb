I found myself less and less worried about Disney’s sequels to the movies. Yes, I understand that the budget for direct films is not the same, but these films are not even tried. Some examples are Hunchback II, Tarzan and Jane. If someone saw a preview for Stitch-The Movie, you will understand my point. But I was distracted, this film confirms my point of view. The animation is sloppy, the storylines resemble Saturday morning cartoons, and not all original voices are present there. I was very disappointed that I did not hear the voice of Michael J. Fox. It was so obvious that the man who pronounced Milo’s voice tried to sound like Fox, but did not come close to success. <br /> <br /> If it says something, my children aged 10 and 6 did not even watch the whole movie.
