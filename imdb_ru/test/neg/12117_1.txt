Any evening with Jonathan Ross now means his wit to me: first get annoyed and upset with carefully chosen words of a 78-year-old man on the phone, and then offer him and Russell Brand to break him and masturbate him while he sleeps to apologize for obscene phone calls his. Curly! And illegal. For a really big laugh, maybe next time he should try it on someone he knows well, for example, on his boss? Or a follower of Abu Hamza? Would he be surprised if someone does this to one of his daughters? <br /> <br /> In all the years, I may have seen less than 30 minutes of the BBC Star Man Ross chat, because I find him so disgusting, some of all the guests I saw, everything was in order - probably most of those who have ever appeared, were fine, as far as I know. As chat shows it is pretty bad though ?? What was so talkative about asking Tory leader David Cameron on this show if he ever masturbated photos of Margaret Thatcher? He chatted with Gwyneth Paltrow just by asking her if she wanted to kill him. However, the Jobs Ross mentality was finally fully revealed by the aforementioned revelations, and I thought I would take the opportunity to warn several decent people around the world who might not know how disgusting this person is, and stay away from him and him - if you do not think that all comedy should be “sharp”, that is, indecent / senseless. Here we are not all the same, although the BBC and Channel 4 disclaim all standards. <br /> <br /> In October 2008, Ross and his colleague with Russell Brand made a series of Andrew Sachs deliberately sexually obscene phone calls. answering the call (Manuel from Fawlty Towers), broadcast it on the BBC national radio against Sachs request, and then tried to force Sachs granddaughter to burn the evidence in the event of their prosecution. A significant number of people here (probably most of them are not payers of the BBC licensing fees) found it funny and / or that the national scandal was overblown, but many, apparently, still knew that this was wrong, and 42 851 eventually complained to the BBC about the incident. Many unrighteous media fools and others laughed at the 42 851 who had never heard the radio program (and never wanted to) - using their argument, they also seem to consider an event, such as the Holocaust, justified because at that emya relatively few people complained about the media, and none of us here today should not be terrified, because we were not there. Two BBC producers, who initially participated in the broadcast, thought it was a “very funny and brilliant” comedy, and only 2 people complained about Brand’s radio program at the time, which, I fear, only indicated a moral level, which lowered it to 400,000 listeners per week. using the expertise of the BBC. A highly motivated BBC tried and failed to use it in mitigation in a subsequent OFCOM investigation. Turn over Aristotle, tell Lord Rat the news! Agent Sachs complained about the BBC, but was ignored by them until the Tori national newspaper took possession of this story. The punishment of any ordinary pervert doing this is usually dismissal and prosecution, perhaps even a prison, but while Brand and the head of BBC Radio 2 both eventually received orders to resign, multi-millionaire Ross received a 12-week leave from his boss The BBC (I believe that he first asked Ross for permission, although if he could drop Ross’s £ 1,500,000 salary so that he would not sue) to return to this program again in 2009 before he ends the contract. All this time, he was thinking that his 4,000,000 viewers could admire even more dirty and / or even more insulting nonsense - but at least he could still continue his way to the bank, as usual, so as not to lose spirit. Some people think that his position will be untenable, and he will not be able to continue. I think that his skin is so thick, because the stakes are so high that he will return without a bow and get excited with the accumulated vitriol. (Update 01/23/09: I just saw the first 5 minutes of his new series - “the greatest deception” - using his reference phrase - continue to allow this giggling unrepentant offender to take public money like this.) But who knows: maybe in the future, after the mucous British film and television industries console him for his moral position, occupied by the 4251 851 and showered him with awards, he will become a sir for his services to perverts perverts in the Government. At least, I hope that this pair of fierce deviants will subscribe to other perverted commercial television and radio stations and stay there, so I will not pay for the fact that they are violating the law and are posting illegal material in the future. In 2009, OFCOM fined British license payers £ 150,000 for this “pitiful” case - thanks to Ross for the offer to pay! Not. <br /> <br /> Apologists: get a life / sense of humor / sense of proportion! This is not the end of the world with a couple of untalented perverts as your heroes, and there are much more important things in this world, such as the price of real cheese! Summing up, we can say that the family man Dross: a comedy genius, apparently, to millions of people (especially himself), is just a disgusting obscene telephone subscriber receiving an obscene salary package from an obscene multimedia company to others. So much for our society of political correctness and respect! As it should have been guessed, this does not apply to the rich and famous and never will, but only to the poor. To summarize, BBC: stumbling blindly from Huttongate, Campbellgate, Dykegate, Springergate, Crowngate, Phonegate, now Rossgate. I hope that his next crisis will be Abolitiongate. I also hope that anyone who thinks comedy should always challenge and push the boundaries, that is, insult, is not disputed and not insulted by my opinion about this particular lawbreaker, his perverted programs and his current perverted employers.
