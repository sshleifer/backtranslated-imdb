First of all, I am a big Tolkien fan, and as a basis I will base most of my criticism on his books. <br /> <br /> The film is a standard adventure film, well made with graceful special effects, pleasant sound. Track and great game. Now, if this film were called somehow differently than The Lord of the Rings, the reviews would not be half as good as they are here. <br /> <br /> The problem of the film is that it takes the storyline from the Tolkien book, but then everything goes and “Hollywood” everything that they can, numerous scenes from the book are almost absent or have changed a lot, the characters also changed from books that, in my opinion, should be punishable! What is missing in the film is a deep understanding of his characters, I know that it’s almost impossible to make a good film from a good book, and it didn’t work that long, mostly the motivation of the characters remains vague in the best way. <br /> <br /> As an adventure film, he would rate 7+ / 10. As an adaptation of Tolkien, he estimates 2/10 <br /> <br /> I mean, honestly, what did Arwen actually do Rivendell Ford? As for the comments that this film is “the best in history”, I can only say that you are very young or have not seen good films ... <br /> <br /> Peter Jackson should have called this film Adventure A film based on the Lord of the Rings.
