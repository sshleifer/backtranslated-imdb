This is an example from a tutorial on how Hollywood does not trust (does) trust moviegoers and indulges its celebrities. Christian's character is completely rewritten, the anti-Semitism that Noah encounters in his military unit is almost eliminated, Michael's story has changed significantly, and eventually the power and terrible beauty of the book is destroyed. I almost wish I had even seen it because of the ability of films (sounds and images) to resonate so strongly in your brain; I would rather just leave the impression of the book. The book could have been written today, it is so honest and courageous. The film either. My advice: skip the movie; To read a book.
