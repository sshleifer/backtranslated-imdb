Speaking in simple words or, rather, in a word, PATHETIC !!!!!! The film begins with a small interest in the story, but, nevertheless, in a few minutes the audience becomes restless for latrines and snacks, or to get some fresh air outside the closed dark room .... <br /> <br /> It looks like to watch a 1960s film in which the colors were boring, filmed by a debutant and in which high school students participated! The film tells about an American actress with high heads, who is trying to return to the cinema, starring in one of the not very good Indian films. Her acting is very sad, and she was praised by bad dialogues. <br /> <br /> OverAll: I would not recommend it to anyone to watch this movie. I also want to see: try to watch it at home, when some TV channel broadcasts it, believe me, it would be fun, since there would not be a single advertisement or sponsors in this film. <br /> <br /> And better take aspirin, you may need it if you cannot find the remote control to change the channel! PS I have no idea if other reviewers watched the movie? I made and wasted my $ 10 on a ticket!
