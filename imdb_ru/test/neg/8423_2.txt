So what to do if you are a porn star with fading looks? I know, become a pop star! This documentary - and I use the term loosely - follows the trials and tribulations of Colton, as he tries to turn from a gay porn star into a singer of electronic (read: dance) music. I just wish Mr. Ford’s voice was as muscular as his arms ... sorry to say that his voice is painfully thin. There are not so many interesting things here, but Mr. Ford and his friends are very fond of. <br /> <br /> See how he records a song that sounds exactly like any other meaningless dance melody. See how he goes to New York to make "connections." See how he returns to LA with little success. Look at yourself, look in the mirror and ask: “Why do I spend time watching this mess?”
