Before I start tearing this film apart, mark you - I love the barrel-organ. This story is one of the best romantic adventures in history. The film with the participation of Jane Gray is very good, and the musical on Broadway is the hottest. So, I thought when I heard that this film was coming out, that it would be great, because it was a BBC movie. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, it was a weak, absolutely stupid story that NAURG could not capture the Great Tale. <br /> <br /> There were no exciting shoots with bold masks. There was no deep love that made your heart quiver when Percy left the room, and Margarita sighed when her husband left her again. <br /> <br /> All she had was a tangled plot and a lot of things - blue sex and violence. <br /> <br /> Immerse me! What a horrible movie! <br /> <br />
