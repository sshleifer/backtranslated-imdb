I can only think of one reason why this film was released. To benefit from the coming glory of Guy Pierce. This film has no virtues, and it in vain spoils the memory of Errol Flynn. The homosexual encounter was pure speculation. Flynn's contempt in this film is palpable. A simple way to slander the actor who died many years ago. Awful and embarrassing. Very disappointing. Do not waste your time on this complete trash. Follow my evil ways if you want to know about this wonderful actor or read his autobiography. This film is NOT so.
