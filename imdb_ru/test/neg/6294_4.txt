I'm sure other people said that this guy is not a worthwhile subject. Of course, our society suffers from a painful love of death, and it is funny to hear him talking about how much he smokes and how much coffee he drinks, but he tries to himself an unworthy mystic. in any case, the bottom line is that he is a racist moron, using weak methods to try to disprove the mountain of Holocaust evidence, and therefore he must be forgotten by time. but Morris is in love with any oddities for which I would not blame him.
