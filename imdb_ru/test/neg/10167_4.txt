For a long time, my wife and I have not seen such a boring thriller. This is definitely NOT an exciting story, and it goes so slowly that we almost fall asleep. This can be a very low-budget television series. There are some ridiculous scenes, for example, the one where the mafia boss Pirano wants to see a woman jury in red clothes or another mafia, can't stop thinking about her and so on. Well, maybe it should have been a romantic thriller, but trust me, you really won't miss anything. We gave 4/10.
