This is a very interesting acquaintance! "Two-Handed Stories" contain three silly and childish episodes - the genre is not really a horror or an action, rather, something in between. Where is the suspension? Where is the fun? Where is common sense? Definitely not here, but unless you expect to receive it, you will not necessarily miss it. <br /> <br /> The first segment is called “Showdown”. This is a cruel, absurd western. I could not understand the whole idea of ​​this. "King of the Road" - a stupid story with Brad Pitt in the title role. At the time of the "Two-Handed Stories", he was just a pretty person who really did not know how to act. Fortunately, he learned this skill later, and now he is a fantastic, talented actor - one of the greatest in the young generation. The story is almost fine in all its stupidity. The final episode "Yellow" is the only segment that is almost completely successful. This is silly, but ridiculous. We have to thank Kirk Douglas for that. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth seeing when you sit in a chair and eat popcorn. (I need to know, this is what I did). If you loved “Tales from the Crypt”, you will also love “Tales of two fists”, because basically everything is the same. I understand that these three episodes are in fact an extremely rare “work of art,” and it is very difficult to find them anywhere. I have an entire package on VHS, but I don't think this is a big privilege. You have to be a fanatical Brad Pitt fan to find him. Otherwise, do not worry, it is not worth the effort. Stupid crap.
