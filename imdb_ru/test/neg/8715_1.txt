It's amazing that some people consider it an art. We saw him as a poorly filmed (shaky hand-held camera and all that), a (generally) poorly acting, unwritten mess that more resembled a high school cinematography project with children experimenting in creating black and white films. Injection of mounds of poetry instead of history does not make a feature film. When we watched it in the theater, people began to experience bouts of laughter (including us) at the endless stupidity of this self-confident, erratic confusion. And believe me, it seems endless. If we had finished our candy and popcorn, we would have also left the theater with two other dozens of people who had gathered and left to look for something more interesting!
