I recently went to the cinema to see a new (2007) version of the Bridge in Teribitia. After that, I went to the library to rent the old version, to see it again without paying again. I must say that I was extremely disappointed! I found that the old version has a terrible game, as well as banal features, including Jesse, saying: “I know my dad, but it hurts me inside” after Leslie died. It was pretty terribly done, and the casting was not much better, in my opinion. I watched in amazement, saying all the time that it was not surprising that they redid it. The story is wonderful, but believe me, spend money and see the new version, if you just see the old version, you may never feel the true magic of Teribitiya.
