I ask you not to watch this film ... It begins with a promise, and over time you crave the film to end ... Predictable, not at all fascinating, wasted film ... Save your time and watch the best thrillers. ... Synopsis sounds good, and that's why I watched the movie ... But it was too predictable, and nothing helped you get started ... No fuss ... there is no great direction ... There is nothing phenomenal in acting. ... shy away from this ... low rating ... Do not write anything about this film, so I fill in the remaining lines of text so you can imagine how much time this film has spent ... really annoyed at how good the premise is and how bad the script was written from this ...
