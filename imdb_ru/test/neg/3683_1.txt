The gates of hell opened and spat out this film, and then closed again. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie makes me appreciate other films that I have seen, like all other films. Nothing makes sense in this film. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's too long to mention all the plot problems. In fact, aside from the warning, itâ€™s really not worth spending some of the almost endless space available on the Internet to write about this film. <br /> <br /> Now I will check IMDb before watching any movie. <br /> <br /> Damn it, IMDb makes me write more about this movie. I think I should warn you about Edison Force while I'm on it. But if you had to choose between them, choose Edison Force.
