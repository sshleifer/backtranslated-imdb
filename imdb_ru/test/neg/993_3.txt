The "head" of monkeys is one of those specific phenomena that I have noticed — when something does not make sense, people will try to read things into it and give it a tremendous deep meaning that its creator never intended. This is the case here. <br /> <br /> The film is a play “Stream of Consciousness”, in which “Monkeys” swim in various sketches, blackouts, scenery, etc., Like those that are shown in their television shows. But while the TV show was played for a laugh, it doesn’t seem to be for everything except some deep, thrips, pseudo-intellectual state that imposes this brand of psychedelia. In general, “Monkeys” do the same, but now this is “raising awareness” because the track of laughter has been removed. There is no humor, no meaning; he is just buzzing with colored lights. <br /> <br /> The music in “Head” must prove to anyone, without a shadow of a doubt, that the Monkees didn’t have the slightest ability to write songs. Ringtones are mostly garbage; the only thing you can even listen to is the "Porpoise Song", which opens and closes the movie. But the fact is that it was the song of Gerry Goffin-Carole King, and although it is above average for the Monkees, it is below average by the standards of Goffin and King. It's like hearing one of the old songs of Peter and Gordon that Paul McCartney wrote for them: you might think that this is a pretty good song, but then you find out who composed it and you understand that it is a one-time thing. Mike Nesmith's song can be bearable, the rest is worth nothing. Davey Jones, I think, has what the filmmakers presented as a “big number” in the picture, since this is the only song presented as “Show Biz” and not cut into video editing or an episode from dreams, but it also fails, simply because that the song is not very good. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have always liked Monkees, so the film is a real disappointment. Of course, they were stupid, but they were so hilarious about it. <br /> <br /> They knew that they were stupid, and they were cool with it. But then they became ambitious. In Head, they actually joke about being a pop product, but in reality they wanted something more. They wanted to be great musicians and were taken seriously as artists. Maybe not like the Beatles, but something is approaching this. "Head" proves that they failed on all counts. 1 * of 4
