I like to think of myself as a connoisseur of bad cinema. I like to think that most people consider films the worst of all, which I can easily endure. <br /> <br /> But ... there are exceptions. I can only recall three films that I was lucky to see that I repeatedly used the fast forward button for large fragments of history. These films are “The Mighty Gorga”, “The Night of the Gulls”, and this little shit, “Deep Blood”. <br /> <br /> In the world of looting the Jaws, this goes beyond scale. Deep Blood has no realistic storyline of the original Crocodile, nor the incredible effects of the Sea Serpent, nor the comments of Tintorera. No, instead, we are approached by several teenagers from any random disastrous comedy series of the 1980s, battling hooligans and a local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Shark sharks are accomplished by quickly cutting back on documentary videos with actors taking water, sometimes with a small amount of something like orange paint being thrown into the water. There is not a minute of original shark shooting on this celluloid dump. <br /> <br /> Usually, I or someone like me read a dark review like this, and they said, “Cool, I have to find a copy of this!” This is the same thought as mine when I read a review by another viewer on this very site. How wrong I was. <br /> <br /> So ... from one bad movie fan to another ... let it collect dust on a shelf ... instead, take it from the bottom or the Great Alligator to satisfy your need something evil is hiding in the water.
