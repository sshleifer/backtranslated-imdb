The box is why I originally took this film, and the back is why I rented it. But I soon learned that I was deceived. I thought this movie would be something like Road Trip / Eurotrip / American Pie. But I was wrong. This film is one of the most stupid that I have seen in a long time. An unappreciated version teases you to view, but completely disappoint you. The game was terrible, and the sound effects were just tasteless. It looks like the budget was very low, since everything was happening in the same building. Get off and get Eurotrip or Road Trip instead. I can't believe that National Lampoon called it by its name. DO NOT BUY, DO NOT RENT. Do not spend 2 hours of your life on this.
