Until now, Malcolm McLaren tells someone so stupid as to believe him that the Sex Pistols were his idea, and that the members of the group were his puppets, with which he earned money. There is a good reason for this, namely that he is a liar. <br /> <br /> Here are some real facts. <br /> <br /> * The group really turned to McLaren with a request to become a manager. , and not vice versa. <br /> <br /> * Pistols is a real, organic group, not created by McLaren or anyone else. Jones and Cook were childhood friends. Rotten and Vicious, too, have come a long way. This is what has led to the unjust criticism of the Pistols over the years, since they have been compared to groups of boys produced. <br /> <br /> * The band and no one else wrote songs, recorded them, played live, created ads and gave an interview. <br /> <br /> * McLaren did not provoke the incident with Bill Grandi. Pistols appeared in the program only because Queen pulled out. According to the group, McLaren squeezed in the back in case there are arrests. <br /> <br /> * Johnny Rotten left the band. He was not fired. <br /> <br /> * John Lydon (Rotten) didn’t outsmart the Sex Pistols, but in the 1980s he successfully sued him for control and a considerable amount of money. Some of the evidence used by Lydon's lawyers was from McLaren boasting in "The Great Rock and Roll Fraud." This suggests that McLaren is not too bright, despite its affects. <br /> <br /> * The dismissals and subsequent payments of A & M and EMI, again, were not designed, it was just the way everything worked out. <br /> <br /> * McLaren boasts the money he earned on the group. If he were competent, he could have done much more. Looks like he didn't even organize the concerts properly. <br /> <br /> * McLaren’s statement at the beginning of the film that he invented punk rock can be refuted in about ten seconds. The Pistols were not the first punk band, but the most outstanding. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie. The only parts that are worth seeing are the real shots of the group, which were subsequently much better used in Mud and Rage.
