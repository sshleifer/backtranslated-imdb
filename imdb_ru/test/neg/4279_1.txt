Here is another low-quality film from the Disney Company. No more Disney spirit. The story is boring. All emotions are fake. This is neither cute nor touching. The Disney company at the time was a kind of magic company that gave dreams to children. Now it's all about making money. Shame on people who use the name Disney for personal gain. This is the fall of the empire. And by the way, Pixar is NOT Disney!
