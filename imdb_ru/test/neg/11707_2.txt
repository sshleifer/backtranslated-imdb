Another of the Boleyn family is not to be confused with the book for which it claims. This film is not even close to correct adaptation. I could understand how they change or clarify some things. The book is not perfect, but it was well written and became very popular. I could understand if the BBC wanted to make it a little more true to what actually happened, who Ann Bolein really was - but this is even close to historical accuracy. It's just fluff. Senseless, fictional fluff. This shame. <br /> <br /> At first, the screenwriter and director seemed to think that it would be nice to set up the plot as if it were a reality show. Seriously. They have Boleans sitting in front of the camera, recognizing that they REALLY feel about what is happening in their lives. Ann Boleyn sits in a denomination (not in the church, but in the real world) and chooses what she wants to say and what she wants to just sit and smile. She looks stupid if you use such a modern cinematic device on the set of the 1500s. This is "The Real World: Tudor England!" <br /> <br /> Jodie Mae is a very good actress, and after “Aristocrats” and “Turn of the Screw” I became her fan. But she should never have been played in the role of Anna. Actually, I think she would be the best Mary. Natasha Makelon was a bad choice. Of course, she is a good actress, but she has very modern features and she does not look convincing in a historical costume. (Honestly, I spent the first half of the film trying to find out if she was the “that girl” from the Truman Show. She was.) She is also too old to play teenage Mary, so for some unknown reason Mary is the eldest of the sisters. It does not make sense, I know. As if the BBC seemed to forget that these people really lived. They turn the story around and create things left and right. I feel ridiculous, correcting the BBC for historical inaccuracies, but REALLY! <br /> <br /> In addition to the two sisters, the rest of the cast was very well chosen. Stephen McIntosh seemed to me a brilliant choice for George, and it was his casting that was the real reason I decided to look for this film. Big mistake. Of course, he does an excellent job, but hardly in this. How can anyone pretend that they are adapting the “Other Boleyn” and hardly mention George Boleyn? This is simply absurd. Philip Glenister was another very good casting solution, but, again, was hardly in the finished product. <br /> <br /> The real problem with this is the script. There just can not do. This is bad. This is really very bad. It is too melodramatic and not attractive. Ann is depicted as an airhead, Mary is the leader, and George is a follower. Maria’s first husband is barely mentioned, her relationship with the king is never explained - they just don’t tell the story Philip Gregory wrote. It all seems like a huge waste. I have no desire to see this thing a second time. I guess I just have to read the book again and hope that the version of Natalie Portman, due out next year, will be much better. <br /> <br /> * Note. At the time of this writing, the only way to get this version of the Mini-Series in the United States is on the latest CD of the Six Wives of Henry VIII. This is a great mini-series, but it can cost between $ 50 and $ 60, and it’s very expensive if you're just looking for this piece of trash.
