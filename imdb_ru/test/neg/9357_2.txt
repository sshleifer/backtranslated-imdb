I was very disappointed in this movie. Twice I was forced to leave, because the episodes of the film were so demoralizing and depressing. The film contains elements that hint at all the seamy things in life (pornography, murder, suicide, fornication, hatred, gang warfare). The graphic nature of the violence in this film was particularly disturbing. <br /> <br /> Richard Dutcher does a very disservice to the LDS Church, depicting missionary views, dedication, spirituality and obedience as unfocused and inadequate. <Br /> <br /> My biggest objection to this film, however, was that it was the exact opposite of a film about well-being. <br /> <br /> Dutcher's “Army of God” was fine. His Brigham City was pretty good. This film, in terms of casting, acting and drama, was his best. But in terms of inspiring or cheering up, it was as bad as possible. In fact, this film so demoralized me that I wish I had gone. I lost interest in ever again supporting Dutcher in an LDS movie with ticketing.
