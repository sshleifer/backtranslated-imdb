I watched this movie mainly to see Charlie Ruggles and Una Merkel, two of my favorites. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of turns in the plot - it's not bad, like a direct puzzle on the train. <Br /> <br /> But why throw in a circus train wreck and a runaway gorilla? I can mention this without being a "spoiler" because the circus train wreck and the gorilla have nothing to do with the confused mysterious plot. <br /> <br /> A bad man trying to kill good people has many tricks on his sleeve, but the crash of a circus train was purely accidental. This allows you to create a single scene with a formidable gorilla, but then it returns to the secret of murder!
