I was only fourteen years old when I first saw films about aliens, and I immediately liked that. Original, terrifying and classic. Sigourney Weaver was the perfect choice for a female hero, and she would deserve a statuette for her act. In 1979, something eternal was born than the continuation of an immortal series with a film no less legendary than the first. Alien3 had a different point of view, but I think this part was the most intense and unique of all, it was my favorite. Unfortunately, the latter was a failure in many ways. It was tense, illogical, with total senseless killing. I didn't like it at all, but I never thought that the worst would be in the future. Well, as it turned out in 2004, I was wrong. “Alien vs. Predator” was an unsuccessful breakthrough, and he should have been sent to a more talented director, or he shouldn’t be made at all. But when I saw Alien vs Predator Requiem, I was completely shocked, and even devastated. When I sat down and decided to watch it with complete doubt, I did not even think that such a bad film could be made. Without a script, without a director and without actors, I don’t understand how to make a film. Because this film misses these three conditions. What you get is a good slaughter without history, but with a lot of annoying and boring dialogues. A waste of money and a waste of time. This film is more arrogance than the honor of fans of both sides (Alien / Predator). A shame!
