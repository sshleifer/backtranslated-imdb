This film had great production values, good lighting, costumes, scenery, cinematography and acting skills. But someone somewhere took the script and replaced the entire dialogue with a barely initial literate letter. I felt that my IQ was dropping points every time any character spoke. <br /> <br /> Did they do it on purpose? Was it just an accident of the leaders at Brain Dead Studio? At the moment we do not know. <br /> <br /> All I know is that this film was one big mistake from beginning to end. We do not even see how “The Squad” became a cop, so instead of any character development, we get what appears to be a bad television film from the 60s. Or anytime. <br /> <br /> Find screenwriters, beat them with a toe full of quarters. All the rest, good work, but next time read your scripts. <br /> <br /> 3/10
