After viewing PURE BELTER, I went to this site to view it, but not only because I also had to check out the resume of scriptwriter / director Mark Herman. As soon as his name appeared on the opening credits, I realized that I had seen his name somewhere before, and after checking I found out that he had written and made the film “LITTLE VOICE”, one of the most underrated British films of the 1990s. > <br /> PURELY BELTER is a completely different bowler with fish. This is a dark stereotypical view of Jordi’s life and very funny. Each of them is either a wife-beating, a single mother, or a salesman, drunk or drug addict. Since there are many scenes at school, the physical education teacher is a sadistic bully, and this is the closest film to reality. Yes, and all very disgusting, which adds a gloomy unattractive atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I didn’t really like CLEAN BELTER while I was watching, and now that I know who Mark Herman is, I like him even less. With LITTLE VOICE, Herman proved that you can make a funny inspirational comedy with the participation of northern souls, but I had to ask, where did his undoubted talent go in this film?
