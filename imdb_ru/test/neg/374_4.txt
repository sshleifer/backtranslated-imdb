Although the story is good and portrays what I expected from Sam Elliot, my DVD copy contained almost unbearable timing problems. The dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the lip movement throughout the film. <br /> <br /> So I will be very careful when buying any DVD movie without checking the problem. <br /> <br /> I would also follow the recommended censor classifications, especially regarding language and drug use. <br /> <br /> This film could be a classic police silence film, and with the above warnings in mind, I can recommend it to future viewers.
