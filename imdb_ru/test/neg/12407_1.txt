Disclaimer: During my work in foreign cinema, I fell in love with a wide range of films covering various genres, including horror, action, drama, comedy and melodrama, and many others. So I enjoyed the thoughtful, serious tone of the dramas, as well as the senseless, popcorn fun of the militants. There are a lot of Chinese, Japanese and Korean films under my belt, and I am confident in my ability to recognize bright spots in films in order to appreciate and complement them. Unfortunately, Ashes of Time has nothing to recognize. This is one of the worst Chinese films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> For a start, this overpriced epic film about swords demonstrates the infamous slide show sequence, which is nothing short of ultra-cheap and pitiful. form of action choreography. You just need to show a series of close-up images with grimacing faces, swords, legs and / or hands, and then a dead body. Bravissimo! Now you have a sequence of actions for Ashes of Time. The problem lies not only in its low quality, but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and scattered that the viewer has no idea what is happening. <br /> <br /> The dramatic element of this film is absent, as it relies on what the characters tell the viewer that they love or hate someone, instead of actually developing and showing such elements on the screen. that makes all characters common and colorless, leaving the viewer completely indifferent to their actions. In fact, the storyline itself is an absolute disaster, too many characters are introduced too quickly with too many plot devices. The complexity of the plot in the films can be used very favorably (for example, The Tale of Two Sisters), but Ashes of Time becomes exploitative garbage when he does nothing but an elaborate, very simple plot for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> In fact, this whole film acts like a series of smoke screens to hide its flaws. The horrific choreography of the militants lies behind the slideshow tricks and the chaotic camera movements. Non-existent character development is hidden behind the characters, openly saying how they feel. And the frivolous storyline is hidden by the confusion of the viewer with convolution. <br /> <br /> As if it wasnâ€™t bad enough, this film was very boring, it looked more like 150 minutes instead of real 95. /> <br /> Rating = rarely given 0/5 Stars.
