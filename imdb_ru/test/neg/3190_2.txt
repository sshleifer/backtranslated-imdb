I give this piece of Hollywood junk 1 out of 10! Seriously! I mean, I love comedy just like the next guy. I can also take just a stupid comedy and even sit back and laugh at her. But with this film there was nothing to laugh at. <br /> <br /> I like almost all the actors in this movie. Thus, I thought I would overlook what many people told me about it (my fault that I did not listen). I was just grieved at how stupid this script was! Just funny and not even funny. The only funny scenes were in the previews that everyone saw in the theater when they watched other movies or on TV. I was very disappointed, and I really wanted to know why these relatively good actors read this script and then still signed up to be in it! A bad decision from their side ... <br /> <br /> ********************* KEY SPOILER *********** ************* <br /> <br /> Okay, here is my biggest question about this movie ....... If the characters look back at this story about Jewel (Liv Tyler) after the fact ... while Paul Reiser can go to the therapist, remembering the past!?!?!?!? He dies in the last scene, being crushed by a dumpster !!!! Can anybody answer me what?!?!?!?!? Big folly on the part of the filmmakers ..... No one noticed this?!?!?!?!?!?!
