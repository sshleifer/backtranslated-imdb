This is by far the worst British comedy ever, as she went through the first episode, not to mention the pilot, outside of me. The acting is weak from the main character, played by Ben Miller, to Sarah Alexander (from a fantastic connection) right through the cast. The plot / storylines were unfunny and very, very predictable using many worn out ideas. Very painful series, which must be endured, but, unfortunately, inserted into the gap between two excellent shows. the fact that Britain’s answer to “Meet the Parents” is a disservice to “meet the parents” is as fresh as an old shoe that runs with a domestic dog. Britain should have learned that looting from other countries will never work if you look at America’s sad attempts to do so.
