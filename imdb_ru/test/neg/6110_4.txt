The summary of one line is actually the highlight of a very old joke, which begins “what is Jewish porn film?” <br /> <br /> While this film has its interesting moments, it was too slow to move and not enough to explain to those of us who are not familiar with the orthodox Jewish custom, what exactly happened and why? How many people who came across this film would know that the bath in which the female characters washed was actually called “Mikve”, that is, the ritual bath used for cleansing from spiritual uncleanness? The same question can be asked about why the bride went around the bridegroom a dizzying number of times, while her face was covered shortly before the marriage vows were fulfilled. These two examples are just two of a large number of such moments that have remained completely unexplained for an uninitiated audience. <br /> <br /> This film has its own touching moments, as well as expressions of great love and emotions. The characters are presented very authentically, down to the number of items of clothing that the ultra-orthodox Jewish man must wear, as well as the religious rituals he must enter upon waking in the morning to begin his day. The attitude of Orthodox Judaism to women in general and to wives in particular is intriguing and at times dements. This is another reason why more explanation is needed if this story is to be understood in context. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to people who are familiar with the Orthodox Jewish tradition and ritual, as well as to those who might be interested. briefly look at what life is like for people practicing such a lifestyle. <br /> <br /> The story itself of two sisters, who in their own way revolt against the “system”, causes a moderate interest in the Best.
