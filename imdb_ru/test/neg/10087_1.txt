This is by far the most stupid, idiotic, insanely stupid show that has ever been on the air, and it comes from someone who remembers San Pedro Beach Bams. <br /> <br /> My wife likes to watch reality shows - and there was one episode of this nonsense, when imitators were supposed to develop a “walk”. The end result was straight from Monty Python’s sketch "The Ministry of Stupid Walks". I could not laugh hard enough. <br /> <br /> And there is the omnipresent Miss Banks (as if from laughing to the very ...). She must be the most annoying self-sufficient woman on television since Rosie O'Donnell left The View. As if modeling did great things for humanity. You are welcome. I have never found her attractive, and now I do not find her clever, because she has the courage to open her mouth. <br /> <br /> Someone has to tell these people clothes hangers to stick to a healthy diet and actually look like real women.
