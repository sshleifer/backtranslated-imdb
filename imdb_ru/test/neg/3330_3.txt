A group of 7 gold diggers is sent to a mine that was recently discovered after an earthquake. Of course, they do not pay attention to the local legend that something is down there and killing people. This low budget horror film ($ 25,000) has a small footprint, and I’m not quite sure why (if only because it’s so unclear). I admit that the last half hour is quite interesting, but the hour when I get there is pure torture. A lot of walks and conversations, and our title weirdness appears only after 45 minutes. Even in additions, co-author Chris Huntley admits that he commits the unpardonable sin of boringness. I would forgive them if they were strict amateurs, but this group graduated from USC, so I hope they know that the exploitation film must be exploitative. In any case, as I said, the last half hour is cool, since the three survivors are fighting the monster in a stop motion, and John Carpenter has a cool rating. I wanted to see more of the monster, but it literally shows up on the screen for 45 seconds. <br /> <br /> Even if the film is not the best, the Code Red DVD has paid much attention to this. You have interviews and audio commentary from director Melanie Ann Phillips, producer / actor Mark Savitsky, and co-author of the script Huntley. The stories about how the film was made are quite fascinating and inspiring (for example, in a cave built in the backyard). Even more interesting are Sawicki and Huntley USC student shorts, which are actually better than art products. Huntley was a fairly talented artist, and it is a shame that he didn’t do anything else. Savitsky worked steadily in Hollywood as a guy with visual effects and an operator. The VHS movie is legendary because it was dark and I'm sure it is much better. However, you still get scenes where the only images are the five lights of the helmet that are reflected in the dark. It’s safe to say that the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still a “horror movie at mine”.
