I will say it this way: I did not stop watching, and this is not a corporate party, this is cool. But my internal critic cut him into pieces - I suppose I see too many films. A wooden script, slang just clanges from the mouth without any flow. The editing mentioned earlier is a hit and a slip; sometimes it causes a good ghetto feeling, but it is mostly annoying - jerky, bizarre corners and very boring lingering faces. The actors were marginal, although Letishi had his own moments. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why the audience had to take care of Curtis, he’s a total failure, and the actor is completely passionless and not particularly funny or cute. Directing does not even help you love or hate him; I just wanted him to shut up and be shot. I did not care for his impotent revenge when it happened. A completely predictable ending is completely unreliable. I'm not sure why we have to believe that some of the former successful dealers that he places are so stupid that they get into his petty scam. “Oh, you just got out of jail and are on probation? Here is a thousand dollars worth of cocaine, go and drive it around the corner. Now don't steal from me, etc. ”<br /> <br /> A good sex scene at first gave me hope, but in the end it was disappointed. The treatment of the rape scene was slightly eyebrow, albeit slightly interesting. There are the best films in this genre, which do not offend your intellect, trying to achieve some kind of genuine ghetto-realism, more like the offer of film schools. 4/10, F.
