When The Legends Die is a powerful, touching story about an orphaned Indian from the state of Utah, who later becomes Tom Black Black Bull, champion of bronze races. Raised in old ways, Tom got the name of a white man and should adopt the language and ways of a white man to live in this world. Bitter about the role he was forced to, Tom finds fulfillment, doing one thing, breaking horses, rolling them to death in a rodeo. In the film, Richard Widmark plays the role of Red, a man who befriends Tom and acts as his manager. Red is a drunk who eventually dies in the story where the movie ends. The real story is completely ignored, the dark side of Tom Black Bull, who develops the reputation of the killer of horses in the rodeo arenas. Oh, well, you should read a book, this film does not come close to the story.
