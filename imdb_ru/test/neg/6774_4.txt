Fortunately, a short mystery about a telephone operator, who is discovered as the kidnapped daughter of a railway magnate. This discovery led to an attempt on her life, which was thwarted by Charlie Ruggle as a "defender of crime." Things are replaced by dangerous, when everyone is in the name of the place and another attempt is made in the lives of girls. Your pleasure from this film will depend on your tolerance for Ruggles and his stupidity. I usually like Ruggles, but there was something in that role that rubbed me wrong. Actually, I think it did not help, that the secret was not very good, so apart from the characters there was nothing that could hold you. Yes, the final in the train was exciting, but it did not compensate for everything that was before. You should not look, but if you stumble upon it, try.
