Bad movie! Bad! Stay in the stand. Carrot top should really stick to low-lit comedy clubs. It is these films that make old Jerry Lewis films look like Shakespeare, and John Agar like John Barrymore. Kutney Thorn-Smith (a great talent) is absolutely useless. Her goal seems to be mainly to look beautiful and forgetful. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the film is to see Raquel Welch play the role of Alexis Carrington, and Estelle Harris the haridan of the hostess. The only way I can imagine that someone thinks that it would be nice to make this (aside from sofomoric) film is if the fourth-grade producers were allowed to choose the script for the child. Well, maybe his third grade. What this film really needs is a rub in its creators' nose.
