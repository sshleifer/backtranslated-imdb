Some minor actors try hard. And the camera shots in the desert are pretty cute. Otherwise, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> William Shatner's character, Harvey, is an amateur screenwriter. He is also a psychopath, a person who literally runs away from a mental hospital. The point of this film is that amateur scriptwriters are psychopaths? Harvey will do everything to make his script read and turned into a film, even if it means taking hostages by the film crew. Are there any amateur scriptwriters ... being humiliated? Maybe they do. <br /> <br /> Movie setup is too long. We will not get to the bottom of the story until we get to the second half. The first half of the darts and flutters among different characters. <br /> <br /> “Shoot or be shot” is advertised as a comedy, but I found it not funny at all. The dialogue contains no subtext. None of the characters is as believable as real people. All of them are figures that perform “action” in a way that resembles cartoon characters. In fact, the film is basically a cartoon for adults: stupid, stupid, crazy. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some actors are involved in this film. They need money or exposure. But what do insiders Shatner and Harry Hamlin do here? Perhaps Shatner wants more comedic roles. Is that the best he can do? Is Hamlin desperate for money? He used to be a respected actor. What happened? <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the plot should be a satire, it is more reminiscent of amateur scriptwriters. Maybe this was not the goal. But this, of course, is how the film can be interpreted. Thus, the script was written very, very bad.
