This is the only unfortunate thing I've ever watched. Sadly, he tries so hard to come up with a good joke, and all he does is curse and think that his disgusting vulgarity is ridiculous. He is the bitterest man I've ever seen. He tries to show his whole act how indifferent he is and thus shows how angry he is at critics and people with any taste and sense of humor who would prefer to go through enormous torture than go see his "show." There are good comedians, there are bad and there are terrible. But this guy is in his own league. I feel sorry for him and all the more people who find him ridiculous.
