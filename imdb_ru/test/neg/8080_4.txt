** BASIC SPOILERS ** You can only watch the sequences of actions, and not the plot or the Nature Unleashed: Fire acting in it has one of the longest and most painful endings in modern cinema history. We have a fearless Ranger Jake, Brian Jeness, leading this trio of hysterical bikers to the rescue in all steps from the explosive smoke raising the mine! This is during a raging forest fire! It seems that Ranger Jake, despite all his knowledge of nature, did not realize that the mine, in which dangerous and explosive methane gas flows, is the last place where all the forests around it are burning! <br /> <*** It all started some time ago when Ranger Jake, trying to save not the fact that the miner, Tini, Chris Harz, aka Sherd, missed his fingers and fell to death at the bottom of the mine, or he did! Despite the fact that we could not understand who kindled the forest fires in the first half of the film, this was not at all a surprise. Blame was Baby! As one would expect in such films, Baby seemed to be made of hardened steel, because nothing that had ever happened to him, explosions and blows, could not stop a crazy miner. <br /> <br /> Prior to Tiny, or the resurrection, Ranger Jake was involved in the rescue of bikers Chris Mel Sharon and Marcus, Josh Cohen, Melanie Lewis, Anastasia Griffith and Ross McCall, who were trapped in and around the forest fires broke out. As usual, Marcus - things don't go as smoothly among bikers as Ranger Jake wanted. Marcus not only makes Chris's meek eggs to do something stupid, jumps on his bicycle through a 10-foot pile of logs, but also makes the guy break his leg. This makes it almost impossible for Ranger Jake to lift Chris up to the air before the fires consume him and his supporting bikers! <br /> <br /> In the remainder of the film Ranger Jake, who led himself, he misses over in an attempt to save himself and the bikers trapped in the forest! It all ends with Jake's brilliant idea of ​​hiding in a dangerous and abandoned mine, when the rescue team is a few yards from their rescue, if they remain in place and where the rescue team can find them! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that he was supposed to be a party to a party or a movie, Tini, despite all his efforts to become another unbreakable supervillain, turned out to be a man who spent too much time in the sun. Working with make-up on Tiny was so outrageous that it looked as if he threw a jar of spaghetti sauce over his head instead of burning it to a crisp. <br /> <br /> Ranger Jake seemed to me rather naive or backward in that he was so captured by the dangerous Little One, who always tried to save a rampaging psycho who never hid his feelings about what he meant by Forest Ranger rules. In fact, Ranger Jake actually called Tini to play both him and the bikers, showing him how incompetent he was in trying to save them. The fact that Ranger Jake was successful was not because he was so clever, but because Tini, despite his invulnerability, was so brainless!
