I have seen the MST3K version of this film, and this is a bad film, but it is not as bad as its low IMDB rating (currently 1.8 out of 10). At the very least, the film has several production characteristics, and it seems to have had a competent editor (unlike films, which are really terrible). The main problem of this film is that there are no attractive characters in it. The main character, Marv, is so sadly sullen that he practically asks about everything that is happening to him. And he is also not very smart, otherwise he would decide to stay away from the treacherous girl Betty. And even more pitiful than Marv, his father, who is just a drunken loser. The highlight of the film is the robbery sequence at the end, but even this is so poorly performed, any excitement it may have added to the film is completely absent. At least this movie was made for a very funny episode of MST3K, since Mike and Bots do a great job making fun of him.
