I like police films Umberto Lenzi - my favorite film “ROME, armed with teeth”, and his “Desert Team” largely legitimized the phenomenon of the Italian Euro-war, having managed to really become a pretty good movie. Give him weapons, machine guns, some guys, so that they run, talking harshly, and it’s hard not to notice. <br /> <br /> How embarrassing to meet him is the LIVE and CANNING FEROX. They could be anyone, in fact, and everyone looks at them with a feeling that he is on contract, he is told what films to shoot, is assigned to a film crew and film crew, and they also give a budget, a timeline and a script. Then Lenzi went out and sang his films in the same way that a McDonald's guy mends a batch of french fries. Of the two, EATEN ALIVE is more original, which is surprising, given that it contains extensive footage from three other cannibal films - and it is easier to enjoy than CANNIBAL FEROX, although not so much. <br /> <br /> I will let others describe the plot: what fascinated me in the film is how it all looks, and, nevertheless, what a notorious reputation of this film is a kind of attack on good taste. This is not the case, although the film is an exercise in bad taste, supplemented by a scene for the title, where two pretty supportive ladies are literally cut and eaten alive by cannibals, which is the culmination of the film. The problem is that Lenzi allows us to look at the cannibal feast scene well and for a long time, and it has a convincing ring of the STAR TREK episode of season 3, complete with fake jungles set for really awful close-up shots. And I don’t know about anyone else, but if someone had sliced ​​my face and eaten them, I wouldn’t lie there and look upset. <br /> <br /> My problem with the film could be that I really respect Lenzie as a director, and, again, anyone could direct this. All your agreements on cannibalistic films are affected, but you never get the impression that they are shot with some real conviction, except for trying to lure Ruggero Deodato from the sandbox. Both directors, undoubtedly, should have known each other, and they had some kind of youthful rivalry or real dislike for each other’s work and a conscious need to push them into the background. Lenzi invented the cannibal genre with the MAN OF THE DEEP RIVER, Deodato ripped it off with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST, Lenzi shot with EATEN ALIVE, Deodato demolished it (and everyone else) with the excellent CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, and Lenzi released the last goodbye sal of the c. , as well as the Krazy Glu commercial, where the guy sticks his helmet to the beam and hangs in the air. <br /> <br /> This film is less desperate and a little more indecisive to push viewers into the abyss with all saints than FEROX, which remains a kind of mistaken attempt to push back the Cannibal Holocaust. It’s rather mixing with an interesting adventure in the jungle with Jim Jones looking like a cult of suicide — it seems that cannibals were added as an afterthought, not as a reason for making a film. I think that fans of the genre will have a better impression of the film than fans of Lenzi films who are looking for something new from a formidable director. This is not as exciting as the SLAVE OF CANNIBAL GOD, adventurous, as his own MAN FROM THE DEEP RIVER, and, of course, he lacks the sound of Cannibal Holocaust. Combine these considerations with reworked shots, scenes with animal violence, misogynistic scenes of sexual violence and entertainment, a wooden filmmaking methodology and what you will end up with - the thriller “OK in the jungle” with two or three outstanding scenes, and Umberto Lenzi was capable of much more. <br /> <br /> 4/10; However, the freaks of Horus will go mad.
