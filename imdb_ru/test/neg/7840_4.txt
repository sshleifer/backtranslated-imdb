“Maximum risk” is a step away from Van Damme and even more boring action films from B-films that we used to expect from films with the participation of Belgian martial arts masters. The film has gaping holes in the plots, an abundance of nonsense, a dirty conglomerated plot and the magnificent Henstridge, who spends most of his time, as if waiting for a signal. The “maximum risk” is in no way different from the others and is likely to not be particularly attractive beyond the usual youthful audience. (WITH)
