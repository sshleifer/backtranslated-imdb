“The James Dean Story” is introduced as “Another kind of movie”, explaining: “The presence of the main character in this film was made possible by using the existing film material, tape recording of his voice and new technology means — a dynamic study of a still photo." the recording of his voice "is one short recording that Mr. Dean makes while visiting his family in Indiana; he wanted to record any family memories of his great-grandfather Cal Dean, zain He played with the same name “Cal” in “East of Paradise.” Dean asks if Cal Dean was interested in art and finds out that a relative was an auctioneer. James Dean was interested in art and had a warm relationship with his family, Obviously. This is the only 100% accurate revelation in this documentary. James Dean was fond of art and had a warm relationship with his family. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, an amazing “screen test” / “exit” from “To the East from paradise. " This is a black and white scene between Dean (like Cal Trask) and colleague Richard Davalos (like Aron Trask). Dean at his best. If this scene only appeared here, and the film “East of Paradise” was not finished, this documentary would be an important, highly regarded film. But the scene, the ideal “10” in isolation, should be considered as “East of Eden”. Also worth seeing is the “Road Safety Film” by Dean. <br /> <br /> Waiting for interviews with family and friends. My favorite was the guy (Lew Bracker), looking through the box of things that Dean had left with him, and the Dean family. Aunt Orthens was not enough, and the letter from Dean to his little cousin was very sweet. More reading Dean's letters would be welcome. The unidentified friend of the writer Dean seemed to have the best thesis for the film; filmmakers could consider its development as a mainstream. <br /> <br /> The direction of Robert Altman about how Martin Gabel reads the script by Stuart Stern is terrible. What were they thinking about? Perhaps the filmmakers can be forgiven because of the proximity of Dean's death. Don't expect the "James Dean Story" at all. This film is more about Dean's influence on people (both fans and directors), not on the person. This is very clear the early part of the myth-making "legend" James Dean. Tommy Sands sings "Let me be loved." The narrative refers to Dina as “He” with a godlike appearance. Images from the Dean family, who seem to "know" the moment when he dies, are really terrible. <br /> <br /> ** The Story of James Dean (08.13.157) Robert Altman ~ James Dean, Martin Gabel, Richard Davalos
