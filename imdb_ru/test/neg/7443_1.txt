The violent continuation of RoboCop was directed by Irwin Kershner (“Never Say Again, The Empire Strikes Back”) will never be as good as the original, because it is almost without humor and extremely mean, and should have received an NC-17 rating, Because of the scenes in which babies participate in shootouts, people threaten to brutally kill very young children with REAL automatic weapons, and even scenes with a 12-year-old child use a lot of obvious profanity, hand out drugs to many random people, shoot and afiches shoot and kill police and special forces, firing at police when there are many small and small children, and a whole group of children using profanity and beating up the store owner (who is a very old person) of the electronics store and stealing and destroying many items there . This film gives a new meaning to the term “terribly mean”, but the effects and sequence of actions are incredibly incredible. Overall a good movie.
