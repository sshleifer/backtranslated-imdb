Mildly entertaining and self-consciously cheeky - but what else could it be? Cushing in one of his poorest roles, and he often sounds dubbed. McClure is too Chizi to believe in him, but who can accuse him of the wasteland of this film, the story of which is about the ancient birds of dinosaurs ruling people, has the “charm of the period” of the 19th century, but this is not enough, and, unfortunately, the script racist connotations of the literary genre in the movies. Good effort from the actors, but poorly thought-out production.
