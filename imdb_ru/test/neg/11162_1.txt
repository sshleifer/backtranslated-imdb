I love TPB, but it was a bad episode. There was no feeling that a series or movie has. It looked as if everything was in a hurry. I did not like it at all. The so-called acting was terrible. The actors looked like they knew that this was an episode that allowed them to quickly enter the market. I hope that we will not have a special Easter holiday, because it will be for me. Writing this episode was definitely the worst Mike Clattenburg in the history of this show. The direction left much to be desired, and I almost felt bad for the actors and the team because of this weak attempt at Christmas special offer. As I said, I love TPB, but this one goes to the trash.
