What the hell is this!? This was my first reaction to this film (in fact, my first reaction contained more expletives). This is not Star Wars! Star Wars are space battles, they are not in this film. Star Wars is Strength, in this film only a mentally retarded witch with a magic ring. Star Wars - the battle of lightsabers, this film does not deserve mention. Star Wars is humor, but film is not. Star Wars is a galaxy far far away, there are HORSES in this movie !!! Besides all this, how did Lucas get the crazy idea of ​​letting a five-year-old child take the lead !? A big, big disappointment. Do you like Star Wars? Do not watch it! 1 out of 10
