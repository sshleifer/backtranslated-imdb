A woman in love with her husband (he is suicidal) decides to have a child in order to save his life. She was in the infertility treatment clinic — as was the lover she was taking — so both know how artificial insemination works; but instead of using the method that thousands of people use every year around the world (a $ 5 turkey buster), they have intercourse. We must also believe that although an immigrant is in love with his bride, he does not offer an obvious alternative to sex life. In addition, although it is a business agreement, the first time she is with a sperm donor, she takes off all her clothes as if it were seduction. In addition, her husband does not notice when $ 30,000 is lost from their bank accounts. Does all this seem to require a more voluntary cessation of unbelief than even most Hollywood tariffs? Far caught on all counts.
