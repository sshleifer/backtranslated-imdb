Bone Eater is located in a small deserted town in Alabama, where property developer Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is financing the construction of a huge resort. Late one night, three of his workers, Riley (Timothy Starks), Hansen (Adrian Alvarado) and Miller (Paul Rey), were digging the foundations in the desert when they dig up what looks like a tomahawk ax, unfortunately for them an ancient Indian demon called a bone eater comes and kills them. Local sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) soon makes Krantz breathe his neck as the construction of his resort stops, sheriff Evans also has to deal with a bone-eating demon as he kills anyone he encounters ... <br /> < br /> You know, I consider myself a rather big fan of the horror and science fiction genre, I certainly don’t think my opinion is worth more than anyone else (unlike many here on IMDb ...), but please believe me when I say that Bone Eater is the worst science fiction eskaya feature channel Sci-Fi, which I have ever seen, and it is opposed by some damn strong competition. As a fan of horror and science fiction, there are two names that, when I participate in the film, make me shudder in anticipation of how bad it will turn out, these names are Jesus “I have no talent” Franco, who has nothing to do with Bone Eater and Jim Wynorsky, who led an absolute disaster - a bone eater. In fact, Bone Eater is so bad that Vinorsky hid under the pseudonym Bob Robertson, when such a bad director as Vinorsky hides under a pseudonym, you know, the film must be bad. Where can I start? “Bone Eater” is just the worst film I’ve seen this year, and it’s so bad that it’s not true, the story is horrible, the script is sloppy (at some point sheriff Evans tells Kia to meet him at the hospital, but when they meet there later, he acts in surprise and says “what are you doing here?”, at some point sheriff Evans triumphantly declares that we are in the twentieth century and that the ancient demons of Native Americans are nonsense, although in reality we are in twenty first century there is a part when w A woman in memories tells the story of how three men awakened the Bone-Eater, and he killed them, but since he killed all three, how did anyone else know about it to pass it on to the legend?) and sometimes he gets more, than a little awkwardly Characters - awful cliches, a small town Sheriff who saves the day, his daughter becomes involved, which adds personal motivation, and Native Americans have an old wise man, a young hot head who hates a “white man” and a young woman who is in the voice of reason Between the two who have names like Storm Cloud and Black Hawk. The film is boring to hell, nothing happens, the story is terrible, it is full of holes in the plots and failures in any logic, the scenery is terrible, they have no horror, no smell, no obscurity, no riddle, and Bone Eater is just a film that makes you lose the will to live. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater has some of the worst CGI computer effects I've ever seen, from the most stupid looking hard moving bone-eater being, which is just a collection of bones magically held together for a motorcycle jumping a big gap, to a terrible CGI truck crashing over the edge of a cliff, to a wagon thrown to one side by a bone eater. Whenever a bone eater needs to be speeded up, he makes a large horse form from sand and dust and rolls on it! In principle, this is actually a good idea, but it looks awful, and on the scenes even stupid cowboy music sounds on the soundtrack! In the end, there is one meaningless scene when Sheriff Evans cut his arm (why?), And she bleeds, but other than that there isn’t a drop of blood in her when a bone eater kills someone in which they usually just disappear. . a cloud of dust, dull. You have to believe that the funny, idiotic climate conflict between Sheriff Evans and the bone eater must believe that Sheriff Evans rides a horse along with the tribal fighting paint on his face, while the bone eater also rides his dusty horse, and they have their own sort of contest is a contest that is just bad to describe properly. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of $ 700,000, Bone Eater is removed very gently, easily and naturally, there is no sense of style at all. Most of the film takes place in bright sunlight, and if you watch it on a decent telly, then the desert scenery is pretty good. There are several veterans of “famous” actors who really rave here, Boxleitner plays the exact same role as in the similar, but much better “Creature Feature” Snakehead Terror (2004), William Katt will obviously call his name any crap while he gets paid, while the former Star Trek man Walter Koenig must have really desperately tried to agree to appear in it. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater is a really awful "feature of creatures", in fact, you can say a little more about it. except to stay away from that. Worst movie ever shown on a science fiction channel, and that says something, doesn't it?
