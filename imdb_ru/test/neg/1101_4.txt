Having spent all her money on caring for an incurably sick spouse, the recently widowed Karen Tunni (Lori Heiring) moves with her two daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) to the buried family home of her late husband in the countryside. Pennsylvania, where local legends talk about zombies who roam at night in the woods. <br /> <br /> It is enough to simply see the names of the authors and directors of this film in the opening credits to make me shiver in my back: Boaz Davidson is the “genius” responsible for writing scripts for STV titles like Octopus 1 & 2 , Spiders and Crocodile, while JS Cardon gave us a monstrous "nasty video" "The Murderer" and a boring film about the "Forsaken" with vampires. With such a dubious responsible talent, I did not expect much from Evil Little Things. <br /> <br /> And having just finished the movie, I'm glad my expectations were low. <br /> <br /> Although the film sometimes looks good, with the excellent use of the eerie forest locale, and the actors give reasonable ideas, given the clichés they work with, the plot is so difficult, poorly written, and derivative that it is impossible to be enthusiastic about . Most importantly, it is possible that the killers of the film, the undead children, who rise every night from the mine in which they died, are not at all scary, the makeup stain, the black contacts and some pranks from the stupid jokes shop add little in the sense of threat. Scout Taylor-Compton and the company are doing everything possible to be afraid of tiny horrors, to shout convincingly with every confrontation, but their wonderful attempts to instill a sense of fear of the audience are useless: little fans simply do not need what it takes to cool the blood. <br /> <br /> There are a few dull scenes with zombies in a useless attempt to beat the greyhounds and the final murder in which the victim’s blood is doused with Compton and Hoering, this is tasteless, but overall, Wicked Little Things (AKA Zombies in the UK) is instantly forgotten trash is just another nuisance in the Cardon and Davidson films.
