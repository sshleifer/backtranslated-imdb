Chaplin was a great silent comedian, but many dumb stars of the era fell when the public heard their voices in the first conversations. In my opinion, Chaplin’s voice simply didn’t match his silent characters, which made him rich and famous. His career never recovered when sound appeared. Contrary to most of the reviews I read, Chaplin’s lifestyle and politics didn’t help his popularity with the average viewer who expected the comic Chaplin to entertain him and not spend his entertaining dollar on Chaplin’s political commentary. <br /> <br /> Despite Chaplin’s rewards and chivalry, I would object to his “contribution” to humanity. The great dictator was made at the same time when Stalin's brutal dictatorship conducted demonstrative tests, and both dictators signed an agreement that led to the invasion of both dictators in Poland. World War II began in an attempt to save Poland. The Nazis were defeated after 6 years, but Poland disappeared as a sovereign country. This happened at a time when this film was shot and investigations were conducted in Hollywood by the federal government. If Chaplin had included Joe Stalin in this satire, in addition to the Italian dictator, perhaps politicians would have less criticism about his policies. The cruel treatment of Jews and dissidents in the Soviet Union exceeded the time and number of Nazis. <br /> <br /> Judging just like a movie, many of the gags were too relevant to be understood by young viewers who did not know who Goebbels Goering or Mussolini was. A classic work of art must stand the test of time. Classical Greek tragedy, the 9th Mona Lisa and Beethoven still enjoy centuries after their creation, because they are timeless. Films that rely on current political commentary or currently popular social attitudes usually do not survive the generation in which they are made. But those who solve problems that are common to all generations are likely to live forever and will be praised by me. <br /> <br /> Chaplin, as a writer, director and lead actor, must take the blame for what I consider an outdated and tedious film. <br /> <br /> Apologists for Chaplin justify his decision to leave the country, which made him rich and famous. If Chaplin found the United States so offensive, why did he not return to his homeland. The great Briton battled the Nazis with blood and money. What did Switzerland contribute to the fight against European dictators? Switzerland is like a country club that chooses and selects its members according to race and class and cares little for people who cannot join the club.
