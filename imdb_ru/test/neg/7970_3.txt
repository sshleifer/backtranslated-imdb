I have not read either the book on which the film is based, nor the letters between Vita and Violet. If I came to this film with any expectations, it would probably be the Bloomsbury band (including, among other things, Virginia Woolf, which included Nicholson). It was not, however, that was not a problem for me. What interests me is how the people who created this film managed to make it, in my opinion, so uninteresting and repetitive, and most of the characters - flat, despite the excellent material and some very good actors. The script is just not good enough. I agree with the criticism of my Finnish neighbor - too many senseless sex scenes (but only between women, although there is nothing obvious in Harold's many love relationships), too many meaningless scenes in general, too little information about the origin of the characters performances - at first glance, this is a truly ambitious work, but the script is, of course, the most significant, and it is here that this film fails. <br /> <br /> Vita's relationship with Harold seemed unconvincing to me, although they both work very well, especially she. The way they continued to declare their unconditional love for each other in a rather sad way, I thought, well, just unconvincing. It makes much more sense that this should have happened with letters, as tmmvds notes. I would also like to know where the pseudonyms came from - the Russians *, and also Mar - why did someone named Vita get the nickname Mar? ? This may be a trifle, but it is important in order to contribute to the big picture. <br /> <br /> * I watched a movie with English subtitles, and where Mitya should have been written instead of Medea. This could to some extent explain my disappointment about the nicknames - I could not understand why Vita should be buckwheat, and Violet - Russian!
