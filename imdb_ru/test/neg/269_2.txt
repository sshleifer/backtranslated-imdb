Comparing the Twelve Oceans with the Eleven Oceans of 2001, has anyone else noticed all the things that have remained the same? <br /> <br /> - All the stars returned for the Twelve, and Zeta-Jones was added; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same director; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same producers; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same designer; <br /> <br /> - The Twelve was the same music director; <br /> <br /> “The Twelve” had the same movie editor. <br /> <br /> Has anyone noticed what has changed since the creation of the Oceans franchise? <br /> <br /> - The budget of the Twelve was $ 25 million (30%) more; <br /> <br /> - “Eleven” received excellent reviews, but “Twelve” were largely depressed; <br /> <br /> - “Eleven” earned 450 million, but Twelve fell to $ 362 million; <br /> <br /> - The internal box office for the Twelve fell by 32%; <br /> <br /> - Soderberg teamed up with another screenwriter. <br /> <br /> Films of the directorial environment, of course. I almost forgot.
