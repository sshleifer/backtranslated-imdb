***** Spoiler or two is not so important ****** <br /> <br /> Two things stand out in this movie. First, it is called "Bruno" and "Dress Code", and if you watched this movie, you will understand the irony in this. <br /> <br /> Secondly, he completely solves problems. The adventures of a crossdresser in elementary school are not what the urgent need was for the film, and not a topic that I think will be of interest to most people. Shirley MacLaine manages to circumvent gender issues by linking Bruno’s desire to wear a dress for religion, which probably opens up even more thorny cans of worms - what did she think? <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a bit of humor, and this is not directly offensive, but the feeling of anxiety in the beginning just continues to grow. It does nothing but repeat the liberal mantra, that “different” people should be accepted (or perhaps excluded?), In spite of everything. <br /> <br /> This is normal ---- but in order for people to live in society, everyone needs to live a little. Bruno does not just want to wear a dress, he wants to appear in a miniature costume of Gladys Knight on the night of awards, and his latest costume makes him look like a cowgirl doll of cabbage spots. Yet all other children dress and behave, well, like ordinary children. So what gives? If it all came down to this, we could all declare ourselves to be special or different and behave as we would like, and the result would be complete chaos. <br /> <br /> The acceptance of “different” people is also rather narrowly defined, I doubt that we will ever see a film about how a child finds himself and wants to wear a jumpsuit, hunt geese and walk in a tractor pulls, and requires all the rest just to accept it for what it is. Bruno is one stupid movie and a waste of time.
