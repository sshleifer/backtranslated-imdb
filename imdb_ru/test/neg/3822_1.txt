Any horror film shot by Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger!), Then kills him in the first 5 minutes before the opening credits are launched, must be immediately watched with one suspicion. <br /> <br /> Tony Todd (Candyman!) as a swamp guide (his voice impression of James Earl Jones, by the way, is hysterical, I don't know and don't worry if he tried to be funny, but I laughed at it). Unfortunately, his role lasted only 5 minutes. More reason for suspicion, and rightly so. <br /> <br /> Mercedes McNab (AKA Harmony by Buffy & Angel, I had to look at her to find out where I remembered her, but she was half-naked!), Marcus is a black guy (Not Another Teen Movie) playing a comedic role which is not really required in a horror movie, unless it is intended to cheat. <br /> <br /> Joel Murray (Bill Murray's brother and Pete from Dharma) & Greg) plays Shapiro, the guy who shot the gonzo video with two pretty girls. During the “Spooky Swap Ghost Tour”, 2 leading male characters meet other people, stranded on rocks and forced to leave the boat. So now they are all isolated in a swamp at night in the rain. <br /> <br /> As soon as the true story of Victor Crowley was told (his make-up looked like a sloth from Guni), we determined that he was dead (well, you aren’t coming back because of an ax hit on the skull!) When an old man is attacked, despite the fact that he pulled out a pistol and made a very clear shot, Maryribet needs more than 30 seconds to actually start shooting at the guy. who hacks an old man with an ax. Is she stupid? It's 29 seconds too long! As for the plot, it really is not (I do not classify the undead psychopath as a plot, sorry), and the pace is also very bad. You have a kill, some run away, some relief, and then a slow dialogue before starting the cycle again. <br /> <br /> After a very long scene exploring a wobbly shrub with a raccoon in it, Victor reappears (with some kind of tool) and kills a dark-haired porn girl, does he also manage to cut the guide in half with a shovel? As soon as Misty was alone to look after Ben, I felt that it was quite obvious that she would die next (I was right, but you would not see it). <br /> <br /> Filmmakers? The rain won't quench the burning gasoline, okay? Idiots! Obviously, after two blunders at the cemetery, Markus was near, and Ben was injured in the leg with a thorn, but they managed to find the boat after he had pinned Victor on the thorn. <br /> <br /> She was sucked into the water from something invisible, he was trying to save her, then she suddenly dragged herself into the boat by Victor and screamed, and the movie ended abruptly. <br /> <br /> Yes, exactly. I have no idea if Ben died (he seems to lack hands), and have no idea that Marybeth will survive and what happened to Victor. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible end, and no doubt my verbal attack on the directors deleted the last review. So much for free speech, huh?
