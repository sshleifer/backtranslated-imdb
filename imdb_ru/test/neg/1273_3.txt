Yes, I was not lucky to watch this film when I was younger at a friend's house, because his mother was a teacher, and she wanted to watch a movie and see if there were any inappropriate scenes that a parent might object to. Well, besides unfunny jokes, I think that this was in its purest form, well, unfunny jokes and a strange scene where like Ernest beats a girl. So yes, Ernest goes to jail because of the likeness and continues to try to escape, and there is something else, for example, he magnetizes at one point, shoots electricity and very painfully watch the final flight. There are a couple of jokes, but nothing much to mention, except for a pistol cut from soap ... I think this is the only scene I or the mother of my friend laughed out loud about. This and the Camp are the only two Ernest films I've ever seen, and from what I've seen in them, I'm not going to track down other films. Ernest was good in small doses, but the film is too much, even if it is as short as this one. I believe that films made money, mainly because all you need is Varney, a place, a theme, and you have a film.
