****************** SPOILER ******************** SPOILER ********** ********** This movie is smelly. Just let me say now that I fully agree with what Carissafillips said about this. What was Sam thinking? She was with a guy who told her that he loved her (only 3 times), was EXTREMELY HOT and stuck with her, despite her difficult times (Josh Hartnett). But she decided to part with him, no, I change him with a snob, an ugly, spoiled, loser from a rich guy who never said he loved her in the whole film (oh wait, did he write it on the wall, what to count?) left her in time of need, because he was scared (Chris Loser Klein). Who would you like to be with? The only reason I watched the whole movie was because Josh Hartnett was in it, and he hoped that maybe she would die at the end. I wanted Jasper to find another girl who was truly worthy of him. This whole “your mom” was funny. I enjoyed it. I hate it when people here say it, but I think Kelly deserves it. Jasper had to say it and Sam, she needed a good punch. How the novel began is a mystery to me. In any case, they never said anything to each other, so I don’t understand how they got together. "I was thinking about the cheese sandwich that you gave me ... it had mustard, mayonnaise or ...". Supposedly the romantic lines were so stupid. Plus he sucks ugly! I have to admit, I cried in this movie. For a long time really hard. Not because she died, but because she broke Jasper's heart. He cried many times in this film ... he tried to smile at her, but he could not stop the tears. He cried when 1) He told her that he loved her 2) She got sick 3) Chris Klein came back and saw how happy she was with him 4) She died. I cried when he cried, because he loved her all his life, and told her, and yet she was stupid enough not to care for and love the guy who left her in a difficult moment, and who did not cry at the funeral. 1 1/2 stars just because I love Josh Hartnett! Oh, by the way, Chris Klein, your mom! Sister wiley
