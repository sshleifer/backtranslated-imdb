With this film, everything is fine, rather stupid, and it should be treated easily. But what I hate is the many heroes and ILLEGAL SENTIMENTAL comment of this boy at the end: â€œLook, they all look the same. Doesn't this pass by the standards of good taste? I thought it was disgusting, like the heroic, unselfish acts of some people in this film. I'm not saying that this will not happen, but the increase in all courage causes my stomach to shrink.
