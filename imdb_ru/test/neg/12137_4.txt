Bored like hell and something like a chick. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a neurotic woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a business agreement, romantic nature for one night, and the uncertainty of the trap of true love. <br /> <br /> Many of the motifs of this story resemble other recent KST films (for example, The English Patient), but are much less attractive. <br /> <br /> After the first half â€” I started checking my watch, wondering if I could get home in time to catch Leno on TV. <br /> <br /> I missed the "Gladiator" to see it!?!
