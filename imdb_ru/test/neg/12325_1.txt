If you liked the film "Grinch" ... look at it again, because it was not the best translation into Russian. Mike Myers' cat is probably the most annoying character who has "decorated" the screen lately. He has a terrible voice / accent, and he laughs at his jokes with a terrible degrading sound, which is the only laugh I heard in the theater. Even the children did not like it, and the children now laugh at anything. Save your money and go watch Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you are really looking for a fun family movie.
