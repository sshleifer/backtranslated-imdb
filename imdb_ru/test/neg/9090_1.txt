I read in Stuff Magazine about some of the bloodiest, bloodiest films Asia could offer, and I immediately jumped on Netflix to quench my thirst. Boy, what a mistake I made. This film is one of the worst films I've ever seen. First of all, without the plot, what I expected was the plot (see “Revenge”), turned into a series of events, just occurring in an attempt to spend the budget for special effects at $ 14.89 and spend studio time. They had to keep their money and not lose either their own or your time. <br /> <br /> When a serious plot twist occurs, Tetsuo II: Body Hammer gets a new personality, but I don’t buy it. There is a memory that should answer our questions, but it seemed to me that I turned on Showtime at 3:47 and dropped ACID. The film continues and gets out of control with cheese graphics and special (Olympic) effects. <br /> <br /> I think I'm bitter because of this movie? Yes. Did I see Iron Man? Was the plot? Not. It was so symbolic that I did not understand? NO. Was there a hammer body? Beats me to hell So take my advice and stay away !!!!!! <br /> <br /> (I must admit, although I had so much fun to write it and laugh at this film, that if you want to laugh, watch this !!!)
