This is one of those films where the action, given location, direction and effects were so bad that you need to rent a copy, get 5 or 6 friends, a barrel of beer, sit down and watch. If you borrow from the late Douglas Adams, "watching this film would be like breaking a brain with a slice of lemon ... winding a big golden brick around." <br /> <br /> What's wrong? Everything. The British actors, posing as Americans, were many who could handle it, like Bob Hoskins, but he is not. There was not even a need to choose North America as a place, why not say that it happened in England or something like that? The director seemed to be more fond of shooting the girls' boobs and asses than inventing character motifs. So at this moment you, drunken friends, will say: “ALL RIGHTS! Another T & A shot! ” There are not many dialogues there, so feel free to skip to the kitchen and make these sandwiches. What did I like about this movie? After my friends lost consciousness, I managed to collect $ 185 from them and say that they spent them on a strip bar after we finished watching a terrible movie.
