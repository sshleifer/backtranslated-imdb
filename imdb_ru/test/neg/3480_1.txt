Being a fan of bad movies, I was very happy to find today at Best Buy 3 horror packages cr @ ppy. Shooting was cheap and included a horrible film called Darkness, which I really remember when I saw it in the theater. <br /> <br /> The remaining 2 were equally bad. "Creatures from the Abyss" are probably the worst of them all. Since they were all bad, this says little. But his stupidity, bad game, terrible effects and a backward plot actually made this film very interesting. I rolled on the floor with each new plot development. Detection of the abandoned ship, the missing crew, the realization that there was something terribly wrong !!! That was great!!! Of course, everyone's favorite scene seems to be a sex scene. OH MY GOD!! I almost lost it !!! By the way, this is the “monster chamber”, I must say that I really liked this film. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of bad movies, so I liked it, but to be honest, I had to Film 1. It was awful ... But if rubbish is your bag, at least rent this one ... (YES BAD pun was intentional)
