Here is a summary of a typical Rachel Ray show: <br /> <br /> 1. A terrible themed song starts to sound, and Rachel goes down in her Snapcrotch outfit in this fancy freight elevator. 2. She begins to run, shouting and / or insulting the public, then shouts at them, sit down. 3. Awkward monologue. <br /> <br /> (The following are in any order) 4. Rachel's own horn segment (i.e. “I lost 500 pounds with Rache's recipe,“ Rachel Ray saved my life ”) Rachael's Fashion Tips. ") 5. Completely useless advice for DIY (for example, how to engrave words on casseroles, how to use a washing machine as a salad spinner, how to create a backlit lipstick tube) the first bites are never shown.) 7. A guest from celebrities with an awkward interview followed by some clearly asked questions from the audience 8. A person who gets help from one of Rachel's Friends (that is, I say yes to all women i don't have either besides his lady overalls, and I can't take the time to get dressed up as a housewife.) What would they do without you, Rachel? * Sigh * <br /> <br /> The reasons why this show should be avoided like the plague: 1. Fake: Rachel Ray claims that the entire series is unrecorded. Many people. Those who attended the recordings of the show claimed that the entire show was written according to the script. -code. <br /> <br /> 2. Her show is jumping too much: while Oprah, who is the leading talk show host with the highest rating, has a certain theme for her show, Rachel jumps around like a child with ADHD gas. Her show averages about 10 short useless segments. In a second, you'll receive fashion tips from Kojo, and the next Rachel will make coarse stuffed Spanish peppers with Manchego cheese, and the next will be a giant anaconda on the stage, and then, well, you will get the picture. <br /> <br /> 3. Rachel is a bad boss with bad ideas: besides her annoying personality, hosting Rachel is horrible at best. Her questions to her famous guests are bad, and often they are not even related to the job interview, and her segments are unattractive and offer little educational or humorous meaning. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you don’t need to waste your time with this devil. In any case, it will soon be canceled.
