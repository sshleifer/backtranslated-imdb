After several months of searching for this Bruceploitation, and then accidentally buying it cheap, it was disappointing. I heard about this on the DVD-R website, and it sounded insane. <br /> <br /> But no, I got a pretty bad martial arts movie. Kung Fuin was not so bad, but the rest of the film was pretty awful, and made the film seem very, very long, much longer than 85 minutes. <br /> <br /> Notice well, the monkey was funny for a couple of seconds (especially when I think they took the only large part of his face from another movie), and the black guy who appears halfway through was funny because of one line, which he said: that alone made all blacks look like complete simpletons. <br /> <br /> But this was not enough, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> 4/10
