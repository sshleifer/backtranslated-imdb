Oldboy is in Korea and starts as a drunken De-Su O (Min-Sik-Choi), which his friend rescued from the police station, only to kidnap. Da-Su wakes up and finds himself in a small room in which he will be in prison for the next fifteen years. Tae-su is fed and watched by his unknown abductors, but he is never released from the room. Tae-su begins to train to avenge himself after he goes out, what he is going to do, tearing the cement from the brickwork with a chopstick. However, before De-su finishes, he is poisoned with gas and he loses consciousness when he wakes up, De-su turns out to be free on the roof of a tall building, dressed and everything earned. Tae-su instantly tries to find out who imprisoned him, after meeting the pretty Mido (He-jong Kan) that both fall in love with, and with her help, Te-su finally finds what he is looking for, but the truth comes to the price ... <br /> <br /> This South Korean production was written in collaboration with the director of Chan-Wook Park and received many vivid reviews (such as distributors can choose quotes and stick them on the video box) and even won the top jury prize in Cannes, while he was also nominated for the Golden Palm, so Is Oldboy a real classic? Well, not for me it is not so, because I cannot understand why it is so pleasant, and I would go so far as to say that I largely hated it except for one or two isolated moments. For a start, I couldn’t understand history at all, I just didn’t like it, because I thought it was slow and boring, and although many there make you believe that Oldboy has the best shocking turn I have ever thought. quite simple and not very well executed. The end where De-su goes to the New Zealand Alps to be hypnotized feels just as if the creators wanted some kind of happy ending. After almost two hours I almost fell asleep, I was so bored, the violence was manual, and I think that most people have problems, and not something that they actually show. In fact, Oldboy has a very low amount of body - about seven and one scene of soft sex, in fact it is not so clear or memorable. I didn’t belong to any of the characters, and although I admit that Oldboy has a good concept and premise that he cannot deliver, and this is one film that I will never understand why so many people love. <br /> <br /> Based on a Japanese manga with the same name Oldboy, the film looks good, there are one or two nice visual moments here, although, despite the fact that everyone is in awe of the fight in the hallway that happens in one continuous frame, I was not quite impressed and thought that the choreography of the fight was pretty boring, the actual blood pressure on the screen is very small, Da-su eats a live octopus, which, apparently, is quite normal in Korea, there are scenes of fighting, cut off arm, someone teeth pull out, and the blood a little end. <br /> <br /> The budget was estimated at about $ 4,000,000, which is actually not bad, shot in South Korea and New Zealand. The acting game looks good, but it's hard to say when the actors speak another language. <br /> <br /> “Oldboy” is a film in which I found an absolute routine work, I do not object to films with subtitles or foreign films or to pay attention to the plot, when I perfectly followed the thing, but I just didn’t like all this, and everything is so simple and clear. Apparently, the second one in the trilogy of revenge is directed by Choi-wook, which also includes "Empathy for Mr. Vengeance" (2002) and "Lady of Vengeance" (2005).
