I was invited to watch this film at a show in a small art museum. I had no idea what to expect. At first, I was optimistic about the opening titles to see Judd Nelson, Bill Paxton, Wayne Newton, James Cann, Rob Low and Lara Flynn-Boyle's list. However, after some very disturbing shy scenes (which did not add much to the progress of the story), this film quickly became a weapon of torture. The rudimentary trick of a growing hand has never been truly developed. I waited patiently for this film to work. In the end, it was a small return, but the need to invest in endless coarse, coarse, sexually perverted, screaming in your faces, unfunny blood covers cost me too much (even for free viewing). What did these real actors do in this horrible movie? The artistic direction was very convincing and creepy. At a minimum, it should be only a 75-minute film. This is a movie that Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld would have embraced.
