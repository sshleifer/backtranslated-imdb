How do you take a group of experienced, famous actors and make such a stupid film? Nimrod Antel has the answer: armored. Six employees in the armored car business decide to steal a large amount of money themselves. But, as soon as they get to first base with their plans, everything quickly falls apart. With such a plot, you might think that this is not so bad, at least for an action movie. However, in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie, we see what 6 normal, everyday guys look like. They joke, laugh, drink together, etc. Then we suddenly find out that they are planning to rob their own business. Hero Ty, (Columbus Short), is drawn into the scheme because of the cold, cruel world, even though he is an elegant veteran, a good guy and a reliable worker. Oh my god oh my god! Then, in the last 40 minutes of the movie, these former ordinary guys almost all turn into insane psychos, ready to butcher each other for cash. In the last scenes, Mike (Matt Dillon) commits suicide for no reason other than to kill his former friend. Before this ending, the viewer does not have the slightest hint that these people are so ruthless and bloodthirsty. This is completely unbelievable, and the “B” film is almost too kind for this type of stupid plot. I would say, do not waste your time - it is very unfortunate that no one gave Lawrence Fishburn, Jean Reno or Fred Ward the same advice before making this picture.
