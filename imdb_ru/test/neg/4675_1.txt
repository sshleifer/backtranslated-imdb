As a Scotsman, I find that the idea of ​​Macbeth has shifted in time and space to America completely stupidly. I’m sure that this doesn’t apply to a wide range of IMDb users, but why so many Americans cannot relate to ANY concept of a film that isn’t installed in their own country? This attitude is of no benefit to Americans in the Big wide world. <br /> <br /> It was bad enough that the “Wicker Man” was redone and installed in the USA, completely devoid of the cultural context and Politics. Proper sex change for the lead character. <br /> <br /> I wonder what's next, Robert Bruce as a New York policeman? Mary is the Scottish queen in the role of juggling "football mom", children, career and relationships? <br /> <br /> Come to Hollywood, discover all the other cultures on the planet!
