I am not from America, I usually watch this show on the AXN channel, I don’t know why this respected channel broadcasts such a suction program in prime time. Creating a Hollywood Money Bank Jerry Bruckheimer, this time he spends a lot of money on a small screen. In each episode, a group of people with two team members travels from one country to another for a huge amount of money; where film crews are filming their travels. I don't know who the hell gave this stupid idea for the show. He has nothing to look at, in all the episodes we see people running around, like beggars, sometimes screaming, crying, making beeps, shaking, cameras are working ... it is harmful for eyes and ears. The most disgusting part of the race - the audience finally knows that every member of the team cannot enjoy their race / journey. In spite of the fact that, in order to put the ratings down, the producers put forward the idea of ​​including gays in one show, sucking on an American reality show. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to watch for this, it is better to switch to other channels. > <br /> The Amazing Race = Disgusting Show.
