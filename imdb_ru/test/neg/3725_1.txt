I want 99 minutes of my life to be wasted because of this pathetic excuse for a movie. The game was terrible! I used to be a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio. I will never look at them again and again. Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd were not unexpected. Everyone knows that they could never act. Fortunately, only Dan tried to focus. His focus was a disaster, as expected. I think he was either embarrassed by the location of the film, or never spoke to anyone from Minnesota. I hope that this review will help everyone who does not know what to do with their precious time. The only reason I was able to watch the whole movie was because I was stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read.
