I can not believe that I have experienced this complete waste of time. I was too fascinated by how terribly bad it was that I could not move. It reminded me of that feeling when it’s impossible to look away from a terrible car accident or a rotting cow. You can not look, but then you feel sick and sick. <br /> <br /> Let me clarify: “Plan 9 from space,” for example, a good movie. Even "Star Wars: Special Vacation Offer" is not a bad movie. They both look awful, of course, but they both have SOME qualities and, at least, they leave you the strength to reach the "off" button. <br /> <br /> This “remake” (only in the title)) of science fiction classics made me cry on the couch, desperately trying to understand why such scenarios are being shot, why someone will spoil the memory of the original classics, and if I can I resume my normal life without mine suddenly found a thirst for silence and peace of death. <br /> <br /> Although death, as I understood it, would not give rest to horrible memories of this pile of shit, since poor souls in hell are probably forced to watch it again and again for eternity ...
