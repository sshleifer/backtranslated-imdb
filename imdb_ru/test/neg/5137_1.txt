Hmmm, it started well, like a hybrid of the X-Files and First Wave, unfortunately, if the concept of Da Vinci’s lost time machine is just ridiculous, then the last “battle” between one person with a gun and 4 16th-century monks to the teeth, an automatic weapon will seem utterly ridiculous, comparable only to a bad game, a bad script and a script, or, in other words, a ridiculous captain of factor 5.
