This film was a waste of celluloid on which it was printed. This is a terrible scene, very much like a terrible train wreck. <br /> <br /> Watching this is like trying to explain the meaning of life. The main point of the story is that the character played by Steve Guttenberg is a party-goer who does not have to gamble because it will break his password. Children, with whom he is friends, for some time refuse to play with him as a coach, because he plays. BUT ... a few minutes later, after they won the championship, a large amount of money saves their shelter. And where did they get the money? GAMING !!! Add this to the creepy scenes in the funeral home (why are there any bedrooms in the funeral home?) And a useless peripheral character
