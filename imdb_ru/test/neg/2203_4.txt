Created and released at the time when the Internet was just getting huge, Hitchcock would have liked this storyline. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Hitchcock was not there to do this, and we sometimes have time to time. an alarming, but mostly stupid thriller, which (barely) is held by Bullock's intellect. <br /> <br /> It was released in 1995, but was already out of date, and you need to allow the number of errors and inaccuracies in computers to be noticed and you donâ€™t even need to be a dot.com user to notice them!
