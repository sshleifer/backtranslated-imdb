Homecoming; what a huge disappointment !! After reading the plot (the dead are back to vote - AGAINST George W. Bush !!!!!) I could not wait to see it. It all started interesting and immediately caught my attention. Unfortunately, however, he gradually turned into a boring political satire that I didnâ€™t need to see (I can just watch some kind of good old Australian comedy!). There were only one or two horror scenes, and they weren't even that scary. I could not believe that it came from Joe Dante, who could easily handle it with an equal balance of thrills and satire. <br /> <br /> The worst episode to date. <br /> <br /> 2/5.
