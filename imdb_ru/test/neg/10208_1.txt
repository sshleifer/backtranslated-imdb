I worked on this atrocity ten years ago. Fortunately for me, no one knows this, because I have not made the final version. And when I saw the movie in cinemas, I was glad! My agents drove the directors (apparently for the first time), rewritten the script daily and just as often changed their agreements with the agencies. Later they told me that, returning to California (we filmed in Atlanta), these “professionals” had 4 and a half hours! Even edited to 90 minutes, it is at least twice as long as necessary. I found Hulk Hogan amazingly charming, but otherwise - what a waste of the film!
