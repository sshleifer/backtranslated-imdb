When I watched this movie, I flew a British Airways flight from London to New York. I wish I could fall asleep. The storyline was very thin, and the film crew made every effort to stretch it while they were doing it. <br /> <br /> Gary, who was played by Andy Garcia, was such an unsightly character that it was hard for me to be supporting him. Andy's acting abilities are good, but not good enough to make up for poor movie writing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Andy MacDowell did an excellent job with the image of Linda, Gary's romantic interest. I can't say anything bad about Andy, I always like her game. The problem here is that the romance between Andy and Andy is so far-fetched and unbelievable. These two don't make a good pair on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie was almost as disappointing as the movie itself. A nod from the Pope, and all is forgiven, come on. The event that allows this film to have some kind of happy ending and that the authors expect us to accept it is pathetic. Gary does not change, and only after the death of a dear friend his position improves. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of great movies worth watching before. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br />
