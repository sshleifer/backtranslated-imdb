The Army Forces Delta division, which is tasked with finding the party of the Green Beret's lost idlers, who are not known to be missing, will fight for survival against a skeletal man in a raincoat, the alleged spirit of an ancient Indian warrior who was revived when archeologists disturbed his grave . The skeleton rides horses and has the ability to move back and forth using a typical portal, and seems to be unaffected by bullets and explosives. The Skeleton Horse leaves no hoof prints, and it can silently ride back and around its prey. The point of view of the film through the eyes of the Skeleton looks at its victim in a different color. In other words, he doesn’t look like a man, so how can Captain Leary (Michael Rooker, as gray and strong as ever) and his gang of potential commandos stop this threat? For some reason, a human skeleton kills employees at a nearby chemical plant. What are the skeleton motives for killing endless people? And why did the blind Hindu, who lives in the forest where our commandos live, spared, if Skeleton, like a man, killed a whole tribe to prove himself? <br /> <br /> How silly that sounds. Just incredibly awful. This is a kind of film that can destroy brain cells. Casper Van Dien gets a second account in credits only for Rooker, but he is burdened with a ridiculously signed character who comes out of the movie quite early. Rucker deserves better than this. If I were an actor, I would not want this film in my resume. The Skeleton Man - the rejected Knight Templer from the movie de Ossorio. He has a spear that can simply knock some people off their feet when a woman’s head explodes on impact. An arrow shot from Skeleton’s bow actually destroys the propeller of a helicopter. Nearly 99% of the movie bullets shoot at Skeleton, and he may enter and exit this portal creature, but in the end he suddenly becomes vulnerable to attack. Oh, and the horses also change when the Skeletonian moves freely through the forest from this portal. The film is written and edited by clowns. Attack scenes are poorly constructed, and characters who need to be experienced professionals make really bad decisions throughout the film. Mind amazes with this movie. Good for some laughter, and some bloody scenes make this piece of pure shit available to be seen as a trash movie.
