I think there is a reason why this film never approached cinemas. Probably my neighbors were filming this film on their mother’s video camera. The game is very amateur. This film is definitely not what you would like to see if you weren't very bored. The actors seem to even act as directors and crew members, without any “professionalism”. If the director (s) and / or actors decide to continue their efforts to create films, I would definitely advise them to brush up on their skills and perhaps go through a few (well, many) film production and acting classes.
