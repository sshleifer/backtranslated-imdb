Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce to you the worst of all the remakes of Disney. Although the title of this movie is “That Damn Cat”, it was supposed to be “That Damned Teen” or “FBI Agent”. The cat didn't have really good scenes, Ricci's character was rather annoying than funny, Doug E. Doug did not get good lines, even the cameo role of Dean Jones could not save this film! The only really good characters were only two auto mechanics of the city, but their scenes were only brief. In general, I would say that if you plan to watch this movie, find something more clever, for example, Barney's video.
