So, you have several models on the island, and one after another they shoot in the style of Agatha Christie. We lost someone at sea, pushed away from a cliff, poisoned with a solvent, drove off a cliff, blown up, etc. Nothing terrible happens. <br /> <br /> Before something starts, for one unknown woman, for unknown reasons, dream of a killer in a strange human mask. <br /> <br /> The owner of the magazine is a scumbag who has an affair and someone has photographed her before she reached her majority. <br /> In the end, it's all about business or something like that, <br /> <br /> A photo session in the style of the 80s, surprisingly, most swimsuits are solid. The pair is quite transparent. There are camera clicks during editing, where the frame of the camera is displayed as a white square or a rectangle inside the image. The photographer is quite poorly versed in frames!
