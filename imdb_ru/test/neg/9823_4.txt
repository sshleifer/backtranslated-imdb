Hellboy revolves around classic comic / action / superhero storylines. In fact, Hellboy is a kind of demon who has found his way on earth. He was raised from a child by a priest and in government society and decided to protect the people of the earth from the supernatural, and not to be a threat (the normal career path for a demon). <br /> <br /> The plot is based on the creative use of history, a combination of Nazi experiments with the occult. This is ridiculous, but so is the idea of ​​a demon wandering the streets. I find explanations of the characters, who they are and how to cope with them. The sequences are to the point and very interesting. In fact, the discovery is the best part of the film, this is the problem. <br /> <br /> Essentially, Del Toro, who writes and directs this play, is bottling it. In the film there is no tension or any serious conflict. Hellboy is essentially considered invincible in the first act, and so the rest of the film consists of scenes in which any conflict automatically becomes rather rude, because we know that Hellboy will be fine and the bad guy will die. I hear you crying that this applies to any action movie / movie about heroes. Yes, it is, but as soon as we are drawn into a well-made action movie, we cannot but feel that the hero may die. Die Hard works because John MacLaine seems to die in all parts. He avoids death because of the smallest fields. Rates are raised, since his wife is also in danger, etc. ?? Terminator and Terminator two work, because in both cases the villain is far superior to the hero. The threat and tension are constant. <br /> <br /> Some of the other major flaws: Del Toro is also guilty of using deus ex machina. Characters tend to disappear and reappear, as their skills are necessary in history. The villain is shown in three scenes. He has no motive. It turns out unexpectedly and inexplicably. In one scene, Hellboy seems to confront a real threat (groups of monsters) when a character reveals his abilities - the screen turns white, and for inexplicable reasons the monsters are dead, but everyone else lives. A minor character set in an annoying and undeveloped love story becomes the key to the conclusion of the film. Her character is so subtle, relations so undeveloped. It is clear that she is nothing more than a prop to promote the plot and make it all make sense. I do not want to spoil the end of the film, but in fact the dead character miraculously and incredibly returns to life ??. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from bad dialogue and airliners alone. not smart or funny. After some time, it all starts to please. <br /> <br /> Moreover, Del Toro is amazing with scenes with some boring visual effects. And the one who made the creative decision to turn the main weapon of the Hellboy into a weapon, and not into a hand, should be fired. In essence, the use of a pistol weakens the concept of the film, reducing the fights to a one-sided fight. <br /> <br /> Among the few positive points are: Cinematography is very good. At all times, a sense of mood is created by dark lighting and a dark color palette. As well as the use of interesting locations. However, perhaps this is also a bit like. <br /> <br /> The use of cgi and fx is well done. We will never get overload. When effects are used, they are used well, and a sense of realism is preserved. Rather, it seems like Nolan used FX in Batman. I very much prefer this method to the effects of the overtop, which we often see. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a pretty bad movie. The real shame is that (despite the fact that I did not read the comics) I discovered that the film had lost a lot of potential. Hellboy, as a character, has many instantly appealing fascinating dimensions that are completely unexplored. The film has the ability to watch, in the sense that if it appears on television and nothing else will be, it is worth watching. But in any other situation, I would not worry about it.
