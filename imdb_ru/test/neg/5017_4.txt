Bobcat Goldthwait deserves praise for trying to do something else with this amazingly heartfelt movie warning of the traps of honesty in everything. Melinda Hamilton starred as Amy, a girl who in the past had oral sex with dogs on a lark. She struggles to tell her fiance, John. Of course, the truth raises his shaggy ugly head. The film tells about the consequences of this escapade. The movie was played well by everyone, with the possible exception of Jack Plotnik as Dougie, who never felt as if he were well-versed with the picture. And the film, although quite solid, seems to miss the mark several times. Each person in the film is struggling with mass hypocrisy and with all those with whom it is difficult for us to communicate. Bobcat deserves praise for having done something different, as I said before, but different ones are not always equally good, and this turns a little pale before the debut of director Goldtvates, criminally misunderstood "Shakes the Clown" <br /> <br / > My rating: C-
