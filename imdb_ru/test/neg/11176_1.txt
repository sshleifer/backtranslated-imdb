I confess that I was taken by Charlotte Lewis provocative footage from this film, as well as a comment on the IMDb bulletin board dedicated to her, calling this picture "a great underrated film." And so, with great difficulty, I received my own "Help on recruiting". <br /> <br /> What a waste. <br /> <br /> Nothing but a cheap film about blood and blood with a ridiculous background, which I am not even going to repeat, with several wired episodes (for example, when we see Lewis feeding his fish with love, we immediately what will happen to them later). Even Lewis with her beautiful crows hair, big shiny brown eyes, plump and full lips and a stunning figure cannot save this film. Fans of Lewis would be better off with "Bare Essentials", "Sketch Artist" or even "Golden Child".
