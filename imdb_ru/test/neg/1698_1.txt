The most annoying thing in the “Dies d'agost” (August days) is not just that nothing happens in this film, but that director Mark Recha has the courage to pretend that this film is a kind of tribute to left-wing Catalan journalist Ramon Barnils. If mentioning Barnils’s name several times is not a “tribute”, this pretense is a complete deception. In this film, you’ll learn almost nothing about Barnil, the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), or the special role of Catalonia in this war. You also will not learn about the collective punishment inflicted on the heroic Catalan people over the years by the victorious and vengeful Franco. <br /> <br /> Of course, the shots of the Catalan village are very beautiful, but “Agost dies” does not have an extensive and sufficiently diverse collection of such scenes to be considered a journey. The large number of photographs shown - for example, not very vivid images of the forest floor - are vivid evidence of a lack of ideas here. The aimless drift of the brothers Mark and David during their campaign does not create a convincing movie. On the contrary, the film made by and for the middle-aged hippie produces the strongest impression. Do not waste your time. Instead, read a good book on the Spanish Civil War. (I recommend the terrible anti-Stalinist “Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Spain” by Felix Morrow, which contains a fascinating tale of the uprising in Barcelona in 1937. <br /> <br /> Barry Fried
