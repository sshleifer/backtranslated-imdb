Unbelievably, but Vampire Slayer is significantly worse than such atrocities as Tequila Body Shots and Zombie Nation — and these films are terrible. Writer / director / star Ron Hall is deprived of both charisma and acting ability, and is clearly incapable of the most basic directorial concepts. Perhaps the worst cinematography, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music, and combat choreography I've ever seen in a movie. Rarely do two shots together, and you cannot see much in dim lighting. A terrible dialogue is extremely slow mediocre actor, stretching the film to almost fatal 87 minutes. This is really a funny embarrassment for all participants. Obviously, fans of terrible filmmaking will want to see it, but it is very difficult to survive, no matter how experienced you are in a bad movie. The fact that Ron Hall thought it was actually a release is amazing. If you are a film director, and you actually think that it is normal for the opening credits of your film to include several frames of the word SLUG before the title appears, after the coarse editing - and you obviously cannot muster the energy to edit these frames - then your standards are obviously so low that they can be offensive. I am amazed that Lions Gate / Maple agreed to release this film on DVD. Despite the very short cameo of Rudy Ray Moore, this film is a work of supreme dedication from Ron Hall - he clearly considers himself a formidable actor and must also believe that he has excellent writing and directing skills - but the film is so incredibly inept that it’s hard to believe he really wants people to see it out of fear of being cruelly banished, as I do now. Awesome, insanely awful movie. I am not kidding.
