The original Australian Kath & Kim is gorgeous. Why do American producers need to remake and spoil another classic show? Remember the original version of "Office" with Ricky Gervais. It was an absolute masterpiece, and there was no need to redo it. The producers said that the British humor from "The Office" and the Australian humor from "Kath & Kim" will not be transferred to the American audience ......... WHAT ??? So basically they say that Americans are too stupid and stupid to take jokes, so they need to redo the show with overly childish gags so that Americans can understand humor. The original Australian version of Kath & Kim is fantastic and very funny. Avoid the American version like the plague!
