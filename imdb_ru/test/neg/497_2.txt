The idea that nine stupid prisoners can escape and go on a journey sounds pretty good to the film. Especially since it must be funny, and I guess that is heartbreaking in some strange way. The problem is that the film was very rarely funny and often seemed pointless and overly rude. It was as if jokes or interesting scenes were created again and again, but no one bothered to finish any of them - there was simply no win. In addition, the film was just brainless, and the scammers wandered all over Japan, even though they left so many victims of crime alive that it is impossible to believe that they were not caught almost immediately - especially since they continued to use the same stolen tourist all day. As for rudeness, I just didnâ€™t need to see the scene behind the scene when the guys wrote along the road. Plus, believe it or not, there is a scene where four guys are strolling sheep! <br /> <br /> In general, I really hated this movie. And it's a shame, since I almost always love Japanese films - just not badly made and uninteresting, like this one.
