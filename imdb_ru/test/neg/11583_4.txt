Nothing can beat KOMODO with cute Jill Hennessy as a psychotherapist (!), But KvC is not as bad as I expected for the fast broadcast of the SYFY channel. Just make sure you watch him drunk or drunk or trying to sleep. The title with an unimaginable title basically speaks for itself: a group of mostly unknown actors converges on an island where a government experiment on growing giant vegetables failed. Giant creatures that came into contact with vegetables captured the island and ate everyone. So now the government is preparing to blow up the island, regardless of who is there. The game is incredibly cruel, especially the mustache general straight from the TV series “INCREDIBLE HOOL”, but this is typical of this kind of nuts on the cables. CGI creatures have the quality of a television level, which means that you know that you are watching cartoon monsters. However, the two girls in the group are very cute, and it’s worth seeing how they run around here and there in their tight little costumes. You just want to eat them!
