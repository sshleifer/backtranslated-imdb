So, I am a Singaporean, and I would like to say that itâ€™s time to stop stereotyping Singaporeans and making such films. Some of the actors / actresses do have talent, but unfortunately it did not show much in this film. I fussed in my place, when I watched it, being quite young at the time, my parents dragged me to see it. Honestly, I could say that I was going to fall asleep. And there was this arrogant pro-western boy who just got on my nerves. In general, a boring movie and a total waste of talent of actors. I have seen better Singapore movies than this one. The war with chicken and rice was good. However, I can not believe that this film will be considered the best Singapore film. Sorry, I would not recommend it.
