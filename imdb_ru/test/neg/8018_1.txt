Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite authors. From his novels, several truly remarkable films were shot (“Far from the Mad Crowd”, “Tess D'Urbervilles”, “Mayor of Casterbridge”), and I had high hopes for this. The hallmark of the Hall of Fame "Return of the Native" completely destroyed it. The cast was awesome, the picture was great, but the script was grim and the direction was positively destructive. People approached people, spoke lines, left. Low excitement arose when Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta-Jones (very young, very beautiful) exchanged some greedy flesh, but even Clive, an excellent actor, could not save him. He was filled with the usual Hallmark “romantic” string background music and pretended that the bumps offered plot exposure, and what could be dynamite turned out to be terrible. The wealth of the above three films was completely absent.
