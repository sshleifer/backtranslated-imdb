No wonder Hollywood likes to pump trashy movies. Sometimes some good movies come out of them, while most just suck a big ass. No wonder that these bad films are repetitions of old TV shows. ” Occasionally there is a surprise with “The Fugitive” (who saw the “Best Film” coming?), But for each “Fugitive” there is a fleet of McHale or some other completely non-original film devoid of any plot or interest. The fashion squad, in my opinion, is in the top ten of my truly lousy films, in which Hollywood should get its miserable ass for creating what could be a good movie. We are shifted right in the middle of a story that seems to make no sense, it wastes talent and dialogue is just bad. We really don't know who the hell these characters are, and we could tell what they are. Instead, you should automatically know who they are and what they are going to do. There is one particularly bad riff about the “I'm too old for this damn” line, it's just silly. Something that my friend verbally noticed when we demanded that the film just end. It's just an insult to a Hollywood movie. Rating: F-
