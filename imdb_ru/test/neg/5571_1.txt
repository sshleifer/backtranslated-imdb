Wow. So my boyfriend and I went to the cinema to make a movie. I like stupid horror movies, so I watched a lot of horrible movies that they could offer while he went in search of Michael Scene's “Sicko”. And then I found the worst of them (as soon as I find out). On the cover, everything looked good, and the description on the back looked pretty decent. The fact that the review was a quote from IMDb was proof that it would be bad in a good way. So the next night we put it in a DVD player, and from the first five minutes we were incredibly embarrassed. <br /> <br /> The film is completely incoherent, with badly placed time leaps from the past to the future, that leave you asking the big "WTF?" The plot does not have any coherent story - except for a vague hint of the local myth of murder, but in fact it appears in the film only in the last twenty minutes. So during the first hour you get it: random, tangled jumps of time; incoherent plot; parents who do not age; bad behavior; bad dialogue; a boy who magically changes hair color; and a lot of disgusting characters to make you bored! <br /> <br /> The film is moving so slowly that it’s really worth sitting and watching. Honestly, I'd rather clean the toilets. Do not worry about that.
