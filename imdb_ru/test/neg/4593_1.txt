Speck, apparently, was supposed to be a biopic about a serial killer Richard Speke. However, there are not so many murders in this film, and none of them are clearly shown. Perhaps the most disturbing scene in the entire film is when Speck tramples one of the eight unfortunate nurses in his own bath, but even this is simply implied and not shown, with the exception of a few inconclusive downward jerks of Mr. Speck's legs. The most interesting part of this film is most likely the voice over, which should testify to the boring nature of this film. Every aspect of this movie is terrible. If you do not like boredom, do not worry. This movie is only after 72 minutes, but it seems like an eternity.
