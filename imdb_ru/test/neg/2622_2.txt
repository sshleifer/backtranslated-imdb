Some time ago I watched the first few episodes and felt that I could not bear it anymore. Bad looking battle scenes are the worst scenes in my life. About a third of each episode is dedicated to Flash Gordon and his “powerful” combat moves. I know that the battle choreography of that era does not quite correspond to modern standards, but this is ridiculous. They do not even try to make it realistic. Flash Gordon, who almost does not look like a fighter, uses his drunken slow movements and a bare fist to knock out four or five guys with knives, weapons and other weapons. Give me a break! There is also a scene where he performs a similar act while in the water. Basically, in every episode there are scenes like this. As for the rest of the episode, I remember a little more. I mostly looked at it out of curiosity about what science fiction looked like 70 years ago.
