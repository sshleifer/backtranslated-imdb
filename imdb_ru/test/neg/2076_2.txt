When I saw this in the movie, I remember how I started from a bad game after about a minute or two in the first scene, and then immediately said to myself: "No, this should get better." This is not true. The performances are pretty uniform, and no, in this film there is NO sexual chemistry, only awkward poses of a rather pretty, discreet actress who seems to be born to embellish the cover of "Interviú", and nothing more, If the scriptwriter thought that Merime was transformed into the character is an amazingly original creative trick, he may need to get more. And Aranda, if he had thought about this for a bit, would have understood that the story of Carmen is simply shouting thoughtful, iconoclastic, parody deconstruction, and not this “leave the brains on the turnstile” passion of ersatz and comics. This is modern Spanish cinema at its worst. <br /> <br />
