This is a film about people receiving a love letter. No one knows who sent, and no one knows for whom it is. Good cast, led by Kate Capshaw, Tom Sellek and Ellen DeGeneres. This, however, is a stupid conspiracy. For example, the character Capshaw, one of the leading inhabitants of a small town in New England, meets with an immature college student who works in her summer bookstore. She chooses him instead of Tom Selleck, a city firefighter who is crazy about her. If this is not the embodiment of stupidity, I do not know what it is. Just an example of how fool this movie is. Watching Kate Capshaw running is very nice, but you immediately realize that she has never jogged in her life. Another obviously stupefied part of a stupefied film.
