First, let me mention the fact that, despite the name (“Stories” in the plural), there is only ONE Kitchen Story. Regarding whether Isak died at the end or not, I am not sure, since in one of the most recent scenes HIS PIPE lies on the table next to two cups. On the cover of the DVD there is a link to Tati. It states that the film “très drôle: rappelle Tati!” (“Very funny: reminds of Tati!”. The great Jacques Tati relied mainly on pantomime and silent equanimity to achieve his comic effects and offer his critically satirical views on his the French “modern” society of the 1950s. Of course, the “Kitchen” does occur in the 1950s, and it offers (rather weak) satirical references to the absurdities of the bureaucracy, and there are some long moments when words are not pronounced - but they are not really funny. Do all these small details go in to make “Kitchen” the movie “Tatiesque?” At the same time, I must admit that “Kitchen” deals with the sometimes false objectivity of scientific research in comparison with the “truth” human subjective emotions. Generally speaking, the film was painfully slow, and nothing much happened — almost without a “dramatic impulse”: the parts involved were created in the first 15 minutes or so, as well as in the last few hours. An hour or so. Indeed, the last segment was - FINALLY !!! - interesting and touching. It may seem that it was a short item, less than an hour, unnecessarily stretched to about 90 minutes. Now about setting up (“scientific” observation of the behavior of single men in their kitchen): at first it seemed very promising — when scheduling the arrivals and departures of bachelors in their kitchen as a means to determine which new inventions would be most useful. But very quickly this premise turned out to be just a prologue, a “justification” for the introduction of a real subject, which was fully developed only by the end and which was about solitude and invaluable friendship. Sorry! I honestly wanted this movie to be liked. Yes, it looked promising when I heard about some of his unusual little “anecdotes” - which really were there and which I liked - such as burning a man’s nose (instead of using scissors to cut it off), “attachment »A huge number of" valuable "black pepper, folded in the barn, changing roles (the observer becomes observable), the human mouth makes sounds from a radio program. And there is also a sick horse, becoming a catalyst for half-hidden human despair, the relative importance of right-hand or left-hand driving in Sweden and Norway (reflecting the importance for each of these very close neighboring countries to confirm their individuality?). Am I the only person who does not fully enjoy this film? Does this necessarily mean I'm wrong? Perhaps it almost always praised that the “subtleties” were, in fact, “too thin” for me? Perhaps ... Could my personal views on this film ironically reflect the very essence of the film itself - what would be vitally necessary in order to have the right to be different, to assert their individuality and not to blindly follow the trends and opinions of society? Each of us has the right to have different personal views and not be a slave to the demands of our “dictatorial” requirements that bring bread: we often have other alternatives that would allow each of us to be useful to our society, respecting our internal principles. In short, being honest with yourself is how in this film Folke (“scientific observer” Isak) gives up his work, preferring to remain in the house of his new friend Isak and help him with the tasks of his farm. ... And so, "Vive la différence", as the French say!
