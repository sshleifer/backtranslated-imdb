Honestly, it is NOT impressive to me, it’s not a bad movie, but not a good one either. There is a story that needs to be told, but it is very inconsistently told in it, because of what it loses its meaning and ability to intrigue. This film could have been made differently with an outstanding result, the story is so interesting, but for some reason I am not intrigued when I watch it. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not an amateur film, rather the opposite, and some scenes are really emotional. Actors and actresses do a good job with the work, just like the director, but there’s something in this film that is so unfinished that I cannot understand what I can do. Perhaps if you had learned more about the characters, all the “unrest” of the film could have been better clarified and added more “actions”, because, as it may, from time to time it became too slow.
