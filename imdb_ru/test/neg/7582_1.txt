That this film was attached to the wall of the chapel is evidence that God is truly dead. Am I the only one who really saw (rather slept) through this "film"? This is the only film I've ever seen in the theater, which I regret for not having come out and demanding the return of my money - it was just boring. And I even saw “Highlander 2: Acceleration” at a local cinema. From start to finish, Gibson and Downey have absolutely no chemistry as the two unlikely, collected by circumstance, which ultimately work together like best friends. The action (which is not enough there) is stupid and boring, like a skull writer. Thank you for the deity coming down on us, watching our "cinema", that Air America 2 has no chance.
