Well, of course, this film will never win an Oscar. Civil reed, this film is not ... BUT, why should every film be studied? when was the last time you watched a funny movie, not because he was good, but because he was stupid? Doesn't anyone remember Roger Korman, the king of exploitation? <br /> <br /> Well, I had fun. I liked the cheese. just go, not expecting to think, and get ready to throw popcorn on the screen.
