The most useless film of the decade. Responsible parties should never be allowed to shoot again. I have no words to describe the lack of entertainment this film provides. You can't pay me to watch this movie again. Honestly, I think it would be better if I had not seen it. If I called it offensive, I would fall into the category of emotionally fragile extremists. I would say that this film goes so far as to hurt the industry. There are films that I refuse to watch, now that I feel that they can be so tasteless. I feel like an idiot that I did not have the common sense to get out of the car in any of the MANY moments that I had to do. Yes, I saw the end and I am ashamed of him, like everyone else, including the writer. I am delighted ...
