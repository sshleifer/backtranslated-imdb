“Imperium Nero” is the second film from a series of six productions called “Imperium”. I have already adversely commented on the first one: “The Empire of Augustus”. This second television film, produced and transmitted over the weekend by the Italian state network, has the same drawbacks. In addition, it contains a significant amount of historical errors. Some examples: Nero is a child, and Agrippina calls him: "Nero, Nero." At that time this name was Claudius. He was named Nero after his adoption. Nero did not meet Act when he was young, as in the film, but after his marriage to Octavia and his appointment to the Emperor. When he becomes the Emperor, his sons are not adults: Britannic is one month old, and Octavia is one year old. And many many others. If you are fond of ancient Roman history, you can find other examples. The series "Imperium" will continue with four more films: "Titus", "Marcus Aurelius", "Costantin" and "The Fall of the Roman Empire". Finally!
