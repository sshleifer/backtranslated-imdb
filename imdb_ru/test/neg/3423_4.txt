Macbeth is one of the most frequently told stories in the cinema, and it has been translated many times in numerous cinemas and celluloids. Originally written by William Shakespeare in the early 1600s, Macbeth tells the story of the treachery of royal power and the desire of one person for power. Directed by Jeffrey Wright (Romper Stomper) tries his hand at updating Macbeth, setting it in the modern underground world of Melbourne. The film, in which the characters replace swords with weapons (ala Bazo Luhrmann, Romeo and Juliet) and royal vassals for gangsters, Macbeth is a rough, cruel, but critically erroneous film. <br /> <br /> Macbeth (Sam Worthington) works for King Duncan (Gary Sweet). After the King has risen to Tan Glamis (as predicted to Macbeth by the three witches), Macbeth begins to look at the throne. One night, the king comes to Macbeth's house, and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) persuades him to kill the King in order to take power. Macbeth kills his master, and then takes his crown. But success has a downside, as soon as Macbeth finds out, when he has to go to disgusting measures to protect his deadly secret. <br /> <br /> OK, first things first. The main mistake of the film is Sam Worthington. In short, his image of Macbeth ... is boring. Honestly, I didn't care about Macbeth while watching a movie. I had more sympathy for Lady Macbeth of Victoria Hill because she tried to act at least. Worthington sits gloomily and with a tree throughout the entire film. I felt that he made the best impression on George Youngâ€™s Johnny Dip from Blow ... but without charisma. I had never seen Worthington in a film before, so I'm not sure that it was his or the director's mistake, but in any case the glue that was supposed to tie everything together into one coherent link is weak. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good, but when compared to the Australian gangster motif, Jeffrey Wright seems a bit out of place. Crazy action sequences, mixed with long Shakespear reflections, create a conflict within the film. I understand that this is Macbeth, and the director wanted to use the original dialogue without any changes. But tough, fast fighters after a three-minute monologue are irritating, if not pretentious. <br /> <br /> Camera work is very stylized, and for the most part it works well. One thing that annoyed me was that the camera pushed back and forth slowly, almost constantly. I do not mind such shots that it just overdone. It goes beyond being cool and stylish and instead becomes annoying. Besides this, the artistic direction and cinematography are pretty well made. <br /> <br /> Macbeth possesses for all good qualities; stylish leadership, Shakespeare's dialogue, a strong soundtrack, supernatural naked witches (strange sisters) and good portions of brutal, bloody violence. All of these strengths are forgotten when you consider Sam Worthington's Macbeth boring image. The role of Macbeth was necessary in order to tie everything together, and in this respect Jeffrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed, turning Macbeth into an unforgettable foray into Shakespeare.
