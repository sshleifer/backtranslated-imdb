I have never seen the first Killjoy movie, and I also never heard any good words talking about it. So I see Killjoy 2 in local blockbusters, pick it up and look behind. Starring Trent Haag and Debbie Rochon. Now, being a big fan of Troma, I'm not going to rent this film for anything, how can it be bad with these two in it? Oh, how I was wrong. Even Trent and Debbie cannot save this filmâ€™s excuse from being as bad as it really is. Trent, frankly, stinks like Killjoy, although perhaps this is more the authors' fault who gave him some of the worst odnostrochnikov in the history of cinema. Debbie demonstrates good performance, but this is not enough. The killings are terrible, as are the effects of blood. For example, check out when a guy supposedly stabbed to something or the other. And to top it all off, the finale is one of the worst I've ever seen in film history. The film does not even work so badly, this is a good level. Avoid like cotton. <br /> <br /> 2/10
