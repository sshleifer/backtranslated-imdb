I have read many books in my short life, but this is the BEST !!! I just finished reading this useless piece of trash, and when I finished, I threw it across the room! I hated it and let me state the reasons! 1. The soldier dies. Why did the author make the soldier die ?! Why couldn't she keep him alive, like a good love story writer ?! I deeply applaud Patty for trying to snatch the eyes of this FBI agent. <br /> <br /> 2. Proper dismissal dismissed. Ruth (black housekeeper) is fired for no apparent reason! She tried to console Patty, and then Patty's dad fired her without a good reason! Ruth, Anton and Patty were the only bright spots in the book. Oh, and grandparents too! 3. Perm. Yes. Permian. Now you people can think why Perm upset you? Well, that's why. Mom Patty asks the girl if she wants to do her hair. Patty says no, but Mom calls Mrs. Reeves (a terrible hairdresser) and tells her to give Patty a curl. Why did she do it on the green land of God ?! Why does the mother ask her daughter if she wants her to get a permanent anyway! Mom always pretends that Patty has the right to vote when she has no right to vote at all !!! She needs to be given the award "The Worst Mother of the Year" for giving Patty. Thank God, Ruth chopped off her string! 4. Discrimination, racism and prejudice. I hate discrimination in this book. They too often use the word * beep *. Yes. I know that in those days blacks were free, but they had no rights, but come on! Why teach today's children the word! He simply teaches them how to distinguish between people. Not only were blacks discriminated, but so were the Chinese. In the book, people call Mr. Lee (Chinese) "Beep". This is really mean, and last but not least ... Jews and Nazis. I hate a city that spits on a little girl. wrong she likes Anton. SHE IS A 12 YEAR-OLD GIRL !!! It was just insane. How a 12-year-old can really love a 22-year-old. Come on! This is not "Lolita". And "Lolita" This is a good book, not a piece of dirt! I am surprised that this film is not considered "dirty" as "Lolita". <br /> <br /> 5. Patty goes to prison. Patty should not be transferred to this correctional facility. Overproduction is intended for thieves and murders, and not for innocent 12-year-olds. The teacher, or whatever her name was Patty, is an ungrateful, spoiled child. something about her! Patty should get community service or something. She did nothing wrong. She just helped a friend. <br /> <br /> 6. Favoritism. Parents played favoritism with their kids. Patty, their firstborn daughter, is clearly the least loved, while Sharon, a five-year-old girl, is their favorite daughter. Dad says he wanted to take Sharon to Hollywood, but he clearly forgot his other daughter. <br /> <br /> 7. Dad I hated him! He was so cruel that Patty could have had Hitler himself and her father. Her father beats her for no apparent reason, and the way he eventually talks to her will make you so angry that you will think that "Patty will receive the best treatment at a concentration camp." <br /> <br /> Well, you have people there. 7 reasons why I hate this book. Instead of reading this book, read the Anne Frank Diaries or something else, because I warn you, it is very depressing and makes you really go crazy! The only reason he gets 4 stars is Anton, Patty, Ruth, and grandparents!
