God, when I heard that this film was NATIONAL LAMPUNES, I thought it would be awesome, but I really said that it was quite a disappointment. I have seen most of the films they made, from the Christmas holidays to Van Wilder, and this film is the worst film in their title, really bad actors and a very intense film. This film will probably look good if you watch it with a crowd of people with difficulty and ability to laugh at it, but if you like a good comedy like me, I do not recommend this film, I would love to see Van Wilder in the second or the third time than watching this movie ... you were warned.
