This is supposed to be Charlie's masterpiece, but I will argue that this is actually one of his weaker films. First of all, it is not funny. Not one thing in this movie made me laugh. Well, there is a quick leap into the box that was giggling, but that was one of desperation. The first and only one is the Vagabond Tramp where he speaks (he sings in an earlier film), but his flat dialogue shows us why he was so happy to watch Modern Times and Gold Rush - two films ten times better than this movie. In this film, there is only one good scene, where Hitler plays with the globe, like an inflatable ball. That's all. <br /> <br /> Good, so we get high marks for being the first war movie, even long before we entered the war. Nope Not true. Just not true, so you can slightly reject the praise. “Three Puppets” did it on January 19, 1940 with “You Natzy Spy” - ten months earlier than the October release of Chaplin’s film - and this film was really fun! If you want to watch Chaplin's best movie, see it for reference only. And then pop in “Modern Times,” “Gold Rush,” “City Lights,” “Limelight,” “The Kid,” or even “Punctured Romance Tilly.”
