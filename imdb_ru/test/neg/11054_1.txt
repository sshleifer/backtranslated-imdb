Jeff Leroy wanted to laugh at Scientology, so he created a horror film that was like a cult. The bottom line is that instead of the frail old L. Ron Hubbard as the leader of a cult, there is a centuries-old space monster who turns his followers into vampires. Our hero is a dirty occult student. His master is an attractive blonde who tries to get him to purify his life with a cult. It will not take him long to realize that she wants only one thing: his blood. “Screaming” was shot very cheaply on video, and I'm just terrible. The space monster (looking like a giant winged cat that constantly looks insane and has no skin) is alternately a clay miniature and a large animatronic doll, both look terrible. Acting and writing are terrible, and the director doesn't even try to hide the fact that this film was made for nothing. Avoid this terrible, pathetic excuse.
