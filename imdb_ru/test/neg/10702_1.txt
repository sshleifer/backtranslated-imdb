All I ever heard during parenting was gender equality, and here we have a film that not only illustrates the imbalance, but also continues the concept that one sex is better. While watching, I hoped that this redemptive quality would make the viewer feel that there is hope for the future, but there is none. I admit that I didn’t finish the film, I had to turn it off in the part where the old whore told the genetic man Adam that it’s okay to be a whore and get, and I quote: “More tail than any man in the past time. “I know that not completing this is a bad review of myself, but the author and the team are responsible for developing a story that will interest the viewer, and they failed. This film betrays all the true feminine natural qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance. Instead this illustrates what America would be like, ruled by lesbian Nazis, and I am not against lesbians. Thank you, Mr. Director! Somebody, please, give me the quality of redemption ... wait, I have! There is no continuation !
