the movie is precious, and Cage is the baby. <br /> <br /> but does anyone agree with me, saying that the punk reporting in this movie is terrible?!?! <br /> <br /> where is the conflict? ramones ?? Losers? Social distortion? seizures ?? sex guns ?! Anyone?!?!?!?! The music of this film is incredibly disappointing! at least they play medicine. <br /> <br /> In addition, Randy's feathered hair and pleated khaki ... <br /> <br /> this is definitely similar to the punk film, as a bunch of film industry people see punks. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this is a film of the 90s, SLC punk paints a much more accurate picture of the punk-rock scene of the early 1980s. just saying.
