I saw Wicked Little Things as part of the horror film "8 Films To Die For" and it was the only film that disappointed me. For example, a mother, her little girl, and a teenage daughter settled in an abandoned house in the mountains of Pennsylvania. However, every night the vengeful spirits of the children killed in the coal mine run and kill everyone they find. <br /> <br /> I believe that the director hoped that his viewers would be rejected, that the children would be capable of killing with a pickaxe and eating human flesh (from which there are generous close-ups, as good respect for George Romero), that the film is just not scary otherwise. Simply put, too many shots of evil children running to the place of their next murder. If someone gets him in the barn, there will be a shot from the children arriving in the barn (about the unknown), and then approaching the murder. <br /> <br /> If you think about why children suddenly walk so slowly when they drive their prey? And it's not that I had any experience with this, but I think that a shotgun shot will throw the child MUCH MORE than this film suggests ...? It also doesn't help that mom is one of the worst parents I have ever seen in any movie. "Lock on the front door broke"? You have EIGHT SUMMER GATES IN THE FORESTS WITH BEARS AND MOUNTAIN LIVES! FIX, MORON !!! In addition, the mother and her eldest daughter look too close to each other in age - even for teenage pregnancies, and there is a rather unbelievable death, which involves sneaking up on someone trying to pull the car out of the mud with the butts. <br /> <br /> I give it 3 because he tried. Like splashing the film is not bad. But for good fear, go to another place.
