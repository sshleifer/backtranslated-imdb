Like another reviewer, I really wanted this movie. I went with my father, who was the greatest lover and lover of classical music, but none of us could stand this film. I wouldn't even call it a movie. The best description may be the recording of several chamber concert plays. As I recall, the camera did not even move. Most likely, I just sat on a tripod for every detail. The only attempts to get a dramatic effect were at the very end of each fragment, when the film would cut off trees fluttering in the wind, or small wavelets splashing on the beach. Iâ€™m sure that the director would prefer to use some really big falling waves, but the best he could find was a few inches high at some nearby lake, and again with a fixed camera. Really pathetic. I can not imagine how someone can justify the rating of this film above five. When we left, my father and I were completely puzzled by how such a bad film could be made. I do not know any good film about Bach. The world really needs it, but only because it does not exist, it is not a reason to see it. Someone will make one someday. Until then, just keep reviewing _Amadeus_.
