This film, everywhere and beyond any shadow of doubt, is the worst and most despicable film in the history of the universe. <br /> <br /> He is really * so * bad. <br /> <Personally, I always enjoyed the horrible movie and made it, thinking that it would be one of them. To my great disappointment, it is not. <br /> <br /> The script sounds like they read lines from posters, the story makes absolutely no sense, and the movie itself looks like it was filmed on a home video camera. I couldn't even finish watching it. This is even worse than the "Witch Academy", and this is a feat in itself. <br /> <br /> I can't even understand how the director could make this film, and then I still have the feeling that it was decent enough to release. <br /> <br /> It hurts, terrible, terrible.
