This game was terrible. I think they worked too hard on visual effects and did little with the gameplay, which is the most important part. I mean, the visual effects look incredible, but is the game really “fun”? NOT! I mean, it's like "hey, let's jump from buildings," and all I do is hold and A / X The gameplay is simply missing, and I do not agree with what Ubisoft did, because they have there was this hot girl (the producer of the game, Jade Raymond), and they said: “OK, we have this hot girl” let's show her ”and if you go to the gaming sites, you will not see the game material Assassin's Creed, you will see her face with a microphone and it will be like we interviewed Jade Raymond about her favorite cookies! "It's like a man, shut up F * @ K UP, Who cares?! Apparently ... many people do it because they bought the game, and I like it ... I mean, compare this game with Super Mario Galaxy The Wii game, which doesn't actually use the Wii Remote, but STILL is very innovative and provides the most important part, GAMEPLAY! With Mario Galaxy, they were able to do anything, the graphics were still amazing, the music in the game was organized and sounded amazing And THIS is a game that deserves the game of the year. NOT Assassin's Creed, man, he doesn’t even deserve to be a NOMINAT in the Game of the Year. the mindset around this game, where it was said: "Oh, this is a new generation of games" .... is it true? I think not! So let me understand it right here because I think that people who love this game like it just because they're Jade fans, so I'll tell you guys Jade won't deal with you or anything if you like or protect this GAME! If you want a REAL PS3 game, get Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, if you want a REAL Xbox 360 game, get Call of Duty 4 (and many other games too), and if you want a REAL game, just in all systems? GET SUPER MARIO GALAXY! I know that this comment will be hated by many, but seriously, pressing the two buttons to do all these cool things, is this a REALLY fun game? The only reason other games make it more difficult is that after that it will become more innovative and exciting. And this game is just not the case. <br /> <br /> 1.3 / 10 LIVE HELL!
