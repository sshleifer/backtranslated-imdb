Despite a completely misleading advertising campaign, this film turns out to be an annoyingly clichéd, flimsy haunted movie with an absolutely implausible ending. Tip # 1 is for anyone looking at seeing this turkey: Sam Raimi didn’t manage it. Although commercials for the film enhance his participation, in truth, he is one of four producers. It is a pity that such a talented person as Raimi, allowed to use his name in combination with such a bad film. I don't think he would ever direct something like that; This task was left to the Pang brothers. <br /> <br /> The screenplay of this movie seems to be laid out from many other horror films, so you will find absolutely zero original content in The Messengers. “What we get is an episodic scene from Pulse, a pair of Birds, one or two of Others, etc. Almost every scene, almost every line of dialogue, is one that was raised from any number of other films. All this makes for such a predictable film that almost everyone will be able to figure out the “unexpected ending” long before it comes. <br /> <br /> Now and now it's time to point out that the campaign based campaign on the idea that only children can see ghosts, has nothing to do with this film. In fact, everyone can see the ghosts. The teenage daughter and the mother-heroes will surely see them even at the very beginning of the film. I’m sure that whoever is in charge of marketing, he invented this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal , which is otherwise completely missing. Now you know, so do not be fooled! Perhaps most of all in this film lacks anything like chemistry between actors. It's just not there. All interactions seem awkward. Combined with a hackneyed story and ridiculous gaps in the plot (at least, that the guy who killed his entire family is still hiding in the small town where the murder occurred? To an extremely unsatisfactory ghostly cast that manages to surprise someone over ten years of cheap shots: loud noises, visual flashes and anything other than the figure in the sheet jumping out of the closet and screaming “Boo! This time all we can afford is another bad movie about spirits trying to warn people from to ma. If there is a message that "Messengers" delivers, this is "Do not waste your time on this film."
