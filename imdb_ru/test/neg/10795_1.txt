I saw both the MST3K version and the uncut version. I rather enjoyed it. In any case, it was not so bad in the film. Of course, sometimes he moved a little slowly. I like it. <br /> <br /> As for MST3K, they only made films for which they could get rights. Not all the films they broke, where the bad ones were, were just so easy to laugh at them. Take, for example, SoulTaker. <br /> <br /> The characters of Joe Esteves and Robert Z'Dar were so inanimate and boring that I could not help laughing. I could not take them seriously. It really created a unique feeling. <br /> <br /> Vivian Schilling handled the script perfectly. The world is better than 95% of cinema debris today. Her role was played well. Not too flashy to not masculine, but just right. The camera really loves her in this movie. I would shoot her for this role after I prepared the script. <br /> <br /> In any case, this film deserves a little more respect than is given. Please see the uncut version if you see MST3K. It deserves it.
