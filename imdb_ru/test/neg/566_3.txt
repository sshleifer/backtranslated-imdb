I liked the first 15 minutes, and I liked some of the dialogues at the tribunal, which turned out to be the best demonstration for the director's technique of acting, but this film ultimately disappoints. Even if it is viewed as a metaphor of oppression / oppression that was and is prevalent in the relationship between the US government and its more â€œdisobedient" citizens, it still lacks punch and believability, and ultimately I look at my watch in the hope of an obvious end may happen already. <br /> <br /> And for the record: despite the loud rumors about the opposite, this film was never banned in the US (I can not comment on rumors of censorship in the UK, but I am suspicious) Hollywood refused to distribute it after his first show at a film festival, and I am more than willing to believe that the Nixon government had any influence on this decision; However, the fact that he never appeared on American television is simply a reflection of the rather cautious and advertising-driven fashion of this business tool. As for the present, you can get your own copy of the DVD, which will be delivered to you through Amazon in a few days.
