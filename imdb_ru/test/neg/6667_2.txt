This film tells about the suffering that the family is experiencing in connection with the death of the child, and about the healing that can finally come to them. <br /> <br /> A family finds out about the death of their son on Christmas Eve 1991, ruining the Christmas season for them. They do not celebrate it again for many years. There is an interesting comment from her daughter, which will remind the audience about the need for children to survive in this situation. <br /> <br /> Matthew's character refers to Jesus, but I suspect that the other comments he makes come from non-Christian sources. I wonder if these comments will be recognized by other viewers? If so, this would be an interesting addition to the data of this film.
