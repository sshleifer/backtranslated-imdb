Well, imagine that in every state of the United States, no, in every country there are identical trees and growing foliage. Imagine also that the monkey catcher's camp, so far from the beaten path that you had to make in the first half of the approach to the river, has a beautifully asphalted, perfectly straight road leading to it. Imagine a world in which you need to put on a full biohazard suit to assemble a floppy disk, and then just throw it into a zipper bag and transfer it into your pocket without any precautions when you return to the office. A world in which two nine-year-old girls happily donate blood without complaints. This is the world in which this film unfolds. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is one of the most damaged pieces of excrement that I have witnessed over the years. <br /> <I liked it. :)
