Worst movie ever seen. Worst game too. I can't imagine a movie worse than this. I see nothing. Do not play at all. Hey (actors) have to look for another job. I can not understand who was stupid enough to invest in this film. <br /> <br /> I apologize for Eric Roberts. It must be hard ... I can't imagine how HUGE his mortgage should be to justify accepting a job! <br /> <br /> Ladies in the film ... maybe they should stick to XXX. <br /> <br /> As for the leader ... what a leadership! He better be on a leash and stay there! I see that he is more successful in barking than in action. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: NO NEED TO RENT ... DO NOT BUY!
