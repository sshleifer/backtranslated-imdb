What a waste of great acting talent. It's a shame, because with Catherine Deneuve, Mathieu Amalric, Emmanuel Devos, Chiara Mastroianni and Melvius Popo (not to mention others less well-known in America) is a great acting talent. This film by Arnaud Desplesch was a terrible disappointment. After I liked his Kings and Queens, and this film left me completely bored and disappointed to such an extent that I actually left before the end of the film. The film wandered through its main storyline (including Catherine Deneuve's disease), distracting from each secondary storyline and secondary character appearing on the screen. The film also gave us too little character development to understand why different characters did not like each other so much (it was a story of family dysfunction), so the lack of a coherent story became even more critical. Finally, the soundtrack (which ranged from hip-hop to Bach and Mendelssohnâ€™s Midsummer Night's Dream) contradicted the emotional temperature of the film and further hid any emotions that the viewer should have felt at that time. Photography (the director often started scenes with a mostly dark screen, where our only vision is through a small hole, creating the feeling that we are looking through an eye that then expands) was also pretentious and incomprehensible.
