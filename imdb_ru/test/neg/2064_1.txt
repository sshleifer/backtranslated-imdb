Saw it on french tv today and was very disappointed! The film begins well enough, but nothing is clear, and at the end we are no further than the beginning. As for meeting with her husband for the murder of his wife, this is simply implausible. You need material evidence to convict someone and a minimum of evidence. In this case, they are not at all, so it is simply not believable. Remember the old adage, "innocent until proven guilty." The fact that the woman disappeared without a trace is not proof that her husband killed her. So I really don't know what this film was trying to say. The result is completely illogical and incomprehensible, no incriminating evidence is given to the viewer. So, frankly, viewing it is a waste of time. In the end, the film should be interesting ... this is completely untrue in this case, and I suggest that it be irrevocably sent to the dustbin where it is located!
