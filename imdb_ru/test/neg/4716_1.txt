I swear, I've never seen such a bad movie like Half Caste. Not only because it simply does not make sense, it is a huge piece of egolatia and self-confidence that makes me sick. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Apocade (in Spanish, the Apocado has the similar pronunciation of "apocado", which means "out of life and happiness") makes a military film here from one person, thinking that he is Sam Raymi or the guys who directed The Blair Witch project. This is a Blair Kitty project, with an expensive small budget. <br /> <br /> The story of a couple of American filmmakers who go to Africa to make a documentary about Polukat is simply pointless. Shooting, inserting high-speed Slow Motion Pictures, Just Excite your belly is bigger than stupid lines (what the hell is this dialogue about atrocities?) Or unconvincing performances. By the way, I donâ€™t believe that this cast (or caste?) is American, they all look European to me. <br / > <br /> To finish this, just say that the filmmakers made a sensible move to sell the movie .cinema.They put fake awards (like most original films) and a beautiful cover (there was a negative image of Half-blooded on Spain in the cover), so I I feel miserable because I cannot demand their 14 euros back.
