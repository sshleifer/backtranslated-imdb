I can think of nothing, I repeat, NOTHING positive in this "Film"! The entire film lasting 1 hour and 45 minutes can be compressed into a short 5-minute film! In most scenes, absolutely nothing happens, and it seems that the camera was left to record only in order to increase the time of the movie! All that you see is someone in the background, strolling or watching television without any particular topic or even talking about something! I just feel like I wasted 105 minutes of my own, my family and my friends on empty days! If the film is badly made or the script is not great, that’s a completely different story, at least it leaves you to discuss something, but about DISTANT, I just have to call it “Film” because it was movies recorded by the camera. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen it yet, imagine a 105-minute film based on two or three storylines! What will you finish? 5% content and 95% fillers! That is how “Far” was at least for us! Actors coped well with acting roles, in which there was nothing special, they almost did not speak and did not show any special emotions! I took this film in the comedy department of the store, based on what I read on the back cover. I'm still wondering what’s funny in it, except for our face after watching the movie.
