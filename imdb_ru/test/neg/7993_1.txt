I stumbled upon this movie late on TV. My brother and I could not stop laughing at how terrible this film is. Cheesy sound effects whenever White Ninja or Black Ninja beats, kicks, or uses weapons is ridiculous. This film is almost the same level as the series “Evil Dead”, but you can watch this movie only once because of naughty nonsense. I'm not sure that the director wanted him to be so stupid because he knew that idiots like me would buy him.
