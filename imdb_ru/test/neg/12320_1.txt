Irrelevant. The PG rating that this movie receives is another huge MPAA error. Keith Rider gets PG-13, but does this movie get PG? You are welcome. Parents should not be fooled; taking a child from primary school to this film is a huge mistake. Many times I felt uncomfortable, not only because humor was inappropriate for children, but also because it was completely unexpected and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> But all this aside, the Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie. Casting and the general appearance of the movie are the only saving graces. Beautiful Kelly Preston and always cute (or hateful in this case) Alec Baldwin are both good at their roles, although Preston is almost too handsome for such a role. Children are conditioned actors, and this is evident, especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the film that made me watch, not throw something on the screen. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there was an oversized talking cat in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely pitiable. I did not like him as the voice of Shrek, and I sincerely believe that now Myers should no longer be allowed into the field of children's films. His image of "Cats" is a slightly softened version of "Fat Bastard" and "Austin Powers." <br /> <br /> In the end, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, even if just for one day he spoiled 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and strife. <br /> <br /> “The Cat in the Hat” may be the worst children's film ever.
