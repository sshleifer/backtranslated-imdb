Number 1 was really great summer popcorn. These were modern jaws. <br /> <br /> Number 2 is best summarized by Jeff Goldblum in the film that he is the dumbest idea in the history of dumb ideas (or something like that). <br /> <br /> Number 3 is the obituary notice ... JP has achieved everything that ever will be. <br /> <br /> As soon as they realized that they had no fresh ideas, they should just let the sleeping dinosaurs lie. <br /> <br /> However. The film is all right, if you don't mind knowing that you have already seen it. <br /> <br />
