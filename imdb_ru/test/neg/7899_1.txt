my friend made me watch this horrible movie .. ugh .. he was so stupid ... <br /> <br /> about some dark-skinned guy who starts an aircraft manufacturing company and turns it into a stupid thing <br /> < br /> with a guide dog acting as a pilot, because God knows why .. this film crushed white people, and there are a lot of racist stereotypical events that make fun of <br /> <br /> white people and try to make the movie looks like all black people are cool pimps, and all white people are losers ... and blacks get all the girls, blah blah blah and t to continue. <br /> <br /> I despise my friend for making me watch this movie .. I kept saying "GOD DISABLE IT !!" and he said: "NO, SOMETHING, ANYTHING, TO HAPPY, TO HAPPEN", in the end we finally turned it off halfway ... thank God ... <br /> <br /> I I recommend this movie to people with very, very poor taste in humor ..
