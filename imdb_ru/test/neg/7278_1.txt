Slogan: the lucky ones died ... before you saw it. <br /> <br /> I have never watched a Bulgarian film of the 1920s, so I cannot say that this is the worst film ever made, but certainly the worst film I have ever watched. I almost can not remember. <br /> <br /> All I can remember is a family of stupid people who do nothing right. Their car has one of the four wheels stuck in the sand, so they decide what to do and prepare to live the rest of their lives there. Then there is an elderly man who knows about the existence of a group of cannibals at the location, but never thought about reporting this fact to the police. <br /> <br /> And speaking of the police ... if these freaks lived there for years, feeding on people, many people must have disappeared ... why didn't the sheriff suspect anything? <br /> <br /> But I stopped asking questions after the first five minutes or so. The rest is boring. Hallucination of an incredible bore. <br /> <br /> I will be merciful and will not talk about dialogue. And acting. And effects. <br /> <br /> I will only mention the final scene where the monstrous girl removes the snake (snake! Do they come out at the end, what the hell do they have to do with the story?) with an accurate sniper throw of stone, showing Mr. Cravenâ€™s complete disregard for things that happen on planet earth as a whole. <br /> <br /> I believe that when the film was first released in 1977. <br /> <br /> Even the fact that he was eaten by a cannibal will not be a fair punishment for the director for this intelligence attack.
