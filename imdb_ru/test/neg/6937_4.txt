In a sense, I liked this film because of the "crazy" positive atmosphere that it conveys. I had a problem with the aspect of the plot, but more on that later. First, the characters were a bit silly and one-dimensional. The "good people" had similar physical and characteristic features, while the "bad people" had similar physical and characteristic features ... hmmm. The storyline was fine (fairly simple and standard) - nothing special or undesirable. The main attraction was, of course, miniature dinosaurs - a kind of pleasant element of fantasy. However, their presence in the film was minimal. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was fast-paced and was nowhere too stuck. I liked it in the movie. <br /> <br /> The problem I had with the plot was connected with the idea of ​​“theft”. I think this film may not have been well thought out - something is wrong, especially if it is a children's film. I'll leave the following sentence abstract, so as not to be a spoiler (skip it if you are worried). The “good guys” commit some theft, and they don’t have the same information as the audience - so this is just a theft, which is bad for a children's film. <br /> <br /> In general, if you have children, because of the dubious plot, I would think about passing by. However, this entire film is rather restrained, so it may not matter. Go through this if you have other interesting options.
