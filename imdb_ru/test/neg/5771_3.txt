Of course, I expected more after viewing the list of actors, but WOW! <br /> <br /> I think that the first time a director could cope better with this project, and the fact that an experienced veteran like John Büchler did this, puzzles me without end. Somehow, the budget allowed them to provide a group of D-List actors, whom they embarrassed for an hour and a half. Unknown actors were just awful, with the exception of Steve Westella, who copes well with the role of Axl. The story is so bad that it really does not need to be mentioned. The overall production value seems standard, with some above-average camera operations, if you can do this through horrible "slow" scenes and painful man-on-fire episodes. I knew it would be stupid, I just had no idea how stupid it was, and unfortunately, the time spent could never be returned to me. I suppose if you like really bad B films, it might work for you, but if you value a story at all, it’s just awful ... A complete waste of time.
