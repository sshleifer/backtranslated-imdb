Like most people, I was impatient to see the continuation of this “Ocean”, but I must say, it really stinks. It stinks because there is simply no good script, it was just cheap. I hope that the producers will donate all the money that this film has made (or will make) to the victims of the tsunami in Asia, so this film will have at least one good reason for existence. It's so bad that I can't even write a decent comment about this, but .... I still advise the creators of this thing to do "Ocean's 13". Ocean 13 will be about the same thieves who are trying to steal the script, well hidden somewhere in Hollywood. The 13th participant will be a foreign (maybe Russian) screenwriter who knows all the tricks to write a copy of this well-hidden scenario so that they can replace the original, which they will have to steal. Or they need to find at least 13 people to write a decent screenplay for the film, in which not only Julia Roberts will play, but also all the other celebrity participants in Ocean's films. 13 people, because this is a lucky number of character Andy Garcia.
