Well, Killshot is not terrible, but he comes close. Production values ​​are decent, and the main actors are doing quite well (with the exception of Rosario Dawson as wasted), but the story is just pathetic. I don’t know if there were such stupid characters in Elmore Leonard’s book as I didn’t read it, but I guess the book should have been at least a little funny. The film has no detectable humor. After the first twenty minutes, you will scream on the screen: “Oh, come on! In short, without any spoilers, everyone behaves as is convenient for the plot, which in any case does not make sense. A very disappointing and unrealistic film that could explain that he was on the shelf for so long.
