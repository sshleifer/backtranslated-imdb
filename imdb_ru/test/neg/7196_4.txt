At its core, this is a fairly typical revenge for Westerners, the hardest for spaghetti, and if you follow it as such, the main character will successfully defeat the main villain. However, there are so many things that have nothing to do with this story, so you have to wonder what the filmmakers thought about. I mean things like the way Miss Rosie’s singing number just comes out of nowhere and a boxing match in the city center. Well, they have a weak connection with the influence of the villain Mesh Flanagan, but why does he suddenly appear with a pseudonym — Mr. Donovan. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I thought it was quite innovative, like a camera showing the wounded Wallach’s trail, could have been taken by someone with a real bullet in the shoulder. And wasn't it great that Donovan's girlfriend uses the old headache procedure when it gets a little frisky? Don't let me forget about the awesome stunt production of the bad guys from the gravel pit, as Wallach shoots them as part of the final. <br /> <br /> However, there was one thing that could not be found, and I kept waiting for the entire movie for it. What happened to that trio of hoods that Flanagan / Donovan hires at the beginning of the picture? You know, the guy Martel, whom the funeral home wanted to hire for his weaponry, the devil's henchman Mitchell with a rifle and the knife thrower Lincoln Tate. Everyone had a reward of five thousand dollars on their heads, and they had to protect Donovan from the guy who survived the massacre at the opening of the stage. They have never been heard again! I like to think that maybe Donovan just killed them and left 15K for himself.
