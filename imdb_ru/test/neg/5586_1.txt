I rented this film for $ 5 and regretted that I did it ... I would not give 5c for it if I knew. This is the worst film ever. None of the film sets has been in the former Yugoslavia, the map is starting with the fact that English actors try to speak Serbian, for example. pretending to be Serbs, and they did it terribly bad. My native language is Serbian, and I could not understand what they were mumbling about. They were driving a big jeep in a country where 3 sides (Croats, Serbs and Muslims) are fighting, and they wrote on it the world 4 Sarajevo ??? Haha, how stupid it was ... I donâ€™t know why the British make stupid war films like this ... or even if they do, why they blame the Serbs for everything When there were two sides to the war. And we all know that they also killed, and not just sat and pretended to be innocent, so they should at least show the whole truth. This film is also Harrison's Flowers, Behind the Lines of Enemies, The Hunt Party, and some others were complete nonsense, and this has been proven. For example, the hunting party was the biggest loser in 2007/08, spending 20 million on it 4, and they earned 800.000 hectares, hectares, what the hell ... The truth will come sooner or later. be a serb !!!
