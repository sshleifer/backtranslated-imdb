This film was really bad, simple and clear. The way such a film gets widespread surprises me. <br /> <br /> This is a worthy idea, but it simply did not reveal itself. Edward Burns is a decent actor. I liked his small role in Rescuing Private Ryan. <br /> <br /> Let's get to the big problem here. <br /> <br /> The visual effects were so incredibly bad that it seemed to me that I was watching an old movie. ‚Äù Dinosaurs In the 3D point and click CD-ROM demo adventure in Windows 3.1 I mean, I saw cut scenes in console games until 2000, in which dinosaurs look better than this. Damn it ... the original T-Rex from Tomb Raider looked better than this. <br /> <br /> Lizard monkeys were ridiculous. I thought it was some kind of prank from Killing Instinct. I have already seen the best puppets wearing a puppet, now that I think about it. <br /> <br /> You know, there is a ton for TV movies that are better than that. How does a gem like Scifi Channels "The Shining" get such a small audience, but this load of "CGI, easy to make 4 Kidz" is on display? I don't care if this is Ray Bradbury's story. Lameeeee
