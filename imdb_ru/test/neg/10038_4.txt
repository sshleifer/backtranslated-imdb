I wanted this movie to be liked. I really, really did. I was so excited when I saw the preview, which scared the hell out of me. But when I saw the film itself, I was disappointed. Acting on stilts, and comedy attempts are completely irrelevant and forced. And I'm sorry, but the boy who is being stalked by a poo in a frying pan is not funny or scary, he's just stupid. I grew up on the legend of the sorcerer, so I know a little about it. A lot of the facts are in the movie right on the spot, but this movie should have been much better For example, the whole scene of a birthday party lasts about fifteen minutes, adds nothing to the plot or story, and it should have been left on the floor in the cutting room. A heavier editor might have pulled a decent movie out of this mess. <br /> <br /> Please understand, I am in no way affiliated with the other Bell-Witches movie and I am not trying to “attack” this IMDb list. I just say it the way it is.
