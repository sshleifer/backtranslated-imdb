This film as the 1st KSA film should be active for their people and show them the good. Otherwise, we see this as the actors of Rotan want to show religious people in Saudi Arabia as terrorist and stupid, in fact, they are not very peaceful and intelligent. About the director is no less good. The grandfather in the movie is much younger than his father, everyone is celebrating this. And the girls, who, by the way, are not Saudis, show our girls as pitches, looking for a man to meet their needs. Hashem was just another piece of furniture, and he didn’t do anything to imagine only when he told his lover: “I love you, and shout to your friend, don’t talk to strange girls” /> <br /> Father didn’t move , only put his own, and he watches this film not as an cast, but as the only word that he said “A5zo Al Shai6an”. The strange thing about this film is when the girls were sitting in a restaurant in a family setting, the young man spoke to his friends in a voice, “kiss me” many times. Grow well, and the Muslim is not a bitch and an adulterer. Not a single Saudi who has a patriot in his heart will not allow to watch this stupid film.
