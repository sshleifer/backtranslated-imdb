It was a very good show. I enjoyed the construction in real time and the memories, seeing the meeting of old Diggers again and recalling the horrors of their captivity in the Changi POW camp. The main problem in how the show was written is that the scenes of life in Changi are more like a camp for rest than what this place should be. I am old enough to remember the footage of the film about the release of men from Changi and other camps of Japanese prisoners of war. No actor could lose weight enough to resemble the state of these people. They made the Belsen Jews look like sumo wrestlers. I have met several veterans from Changi over the years. Many will never ride a Japanese car, not to mention their own. The physical and psychological torture to which these men were too terrible for them to even talk about them. What percentage survived? John Doyle could well write a comedy for Roy and HG (I hate that too), but this is a serious sugar covering of history that should never be tolerated. I am glad that the satirists write The Life of Brian and laugh at Crucifixion, because this is clearly a comedy, even if some people think that it is a bad taste. “Changi” is written as an image of a real event and, as such, can be considered by young people as a real record. Great performances with great cast cannot buy this easy script.
