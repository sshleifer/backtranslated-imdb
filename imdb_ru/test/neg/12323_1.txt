From the point of view of acting, directing, writing scripts and artistic leadership, this film is simply not well thought out, and money is better spent on shoes for landmine victims. When we became so sad that they had to fill the children's film with sexual hints to keep the attention of parents. <br /> <br /> Dr. Suess is now rolling in the grave, what a “dirty ho” is - SHIT and fake erection scenes, etc., etc., etc. It is shameful how they trade for Suessa's name, to force parents to bring their children, to add profanity to try for teenagers and several sad parents who won't watch a movie with their child, if not T & A. Greed is greed and more greed. <br /> /> Compare this with classic children's films, and we can get an alarming look at the world turning into. These guys should hold . Atsya MTV-Video How the hell did this movie was> 400 votes, and the ideal 10 - is beyond me (unless it is a family of directors).
