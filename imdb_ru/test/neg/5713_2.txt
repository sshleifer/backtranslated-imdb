What happened to this movie? Does Mr. Lyne and his authors really think that a sadomasochistic shot between two spoiled yuppies can carry a full-length film? Perhaps, if there were any comedic elements in it (which are not present, at least intentionally), or there were some additional dramatic elements (which are not), or maybe it was hardcore. No, it's just a case story; chronology of a group of R-rating dates. Ho-hum, who cares? "Nine and a half weeks" deserves every nomination in the Rizeze. This is a loser. <br /> <br /> And by the way, what happened to Roger Ebert and his enthusiastic response? Where was his head back in 1986?
