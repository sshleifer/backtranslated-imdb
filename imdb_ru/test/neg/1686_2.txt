I never started watching a show until it was canceled and re-displayed. I really enjoyed it from season one to season three. Once I saw the fourth and fifth, I began to get angry. The first problem was that they made this inappropriate scenario of repeating the story (the youngest had a child, like his parents). The second was to be the one where everyone was paired with someone (for example, Katie and Franklin). The third was when they made the younger one even more idiotic than before, which began to be tedious and annoying to such an extent that I wanted to go to TV and beat the crap out of him until he lost consciousness. The fourth was supposed to be that zealous jerk that Clary called the guy. The fifth was to be Katie, she was starting to be too good for herself and treated her “boyfriend” Franklin as the weakness he was. Last but not least, Noah Gray-Kabee! Franklin, Franklin was just scary. It was like watching the terrible combination of Urkle and TJ Henderson, only more annoying !!! They seriously jumped from the shark when he came to the show. There was practically no realism in his character, and the way he laughed was a sign of an obvious force, showing that Noah could not act. Eveytime I saw that the kid just made me want to slap him, he is stupid. However, B.F. (frankly) this show was fun and very entertaining.
