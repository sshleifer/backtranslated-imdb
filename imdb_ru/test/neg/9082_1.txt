It is hard to believe that there are people in the world who truly believe that this is a worthy car of Charles Bronson. <br /> <br /> Bronson is a good actor who can do more than just take a gun and shoot down the bad guys. He quietly moved to the TV movie "Yes, Virginia, eat Santa Claus" and showed a lot of class and style in Shawn Penn's Indian Runner. <br /> <br /> In “Evil” “People do”, however, Bronson plays the character again, who sees injustice and corrects it with the help of fists, knives and, of course, weapons. There is nothing here that you would not have seen in the last five clicks of "Death Wish." <br /> <br /> Wait, I'll take it back. It must be the most sadistic and repressively cruel film that Bronson has ever been misinformed. Not just a repellent in torture scenes or torture descriptions, but in the fact that these scenes were put into a movie just sell tickets. And José Ferrer! What did he do here in the blue rays? !! I mean, he won an Oscar for a loud cry !!! <br /> <br /> Okay, sorry for this explosion. Let me just say that “The Evil That Men Do” must be one of the worst films I've ever seen, based on the book. Yes it is. I wonder if it was written with the thought of Bronson? <br /> <br /> Without stars. Instead, see “The Desire for Death”. At least this was true.
