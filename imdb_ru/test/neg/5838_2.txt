This soft, soft / sci-fi B-film is what you would have if you shot the early film about Fred Deer Ray and were addicted to fun. Or, on the contrary, it is like the “film” of Uwe Boll, but without such ineptitude. A young criminal prisoner from among criminals (KS Costigan) agrees to impersonate the space marshal to stop the plans of stupid Kim Dawson ... apparently, that everyone has sex with everyone else (this vile villain). Anyone who entered this film in search of serious science fiction is good that you got what you deserved for not doing your homework on the film at all. First of all, when Kim Dawson ever starred in something other than the crappy level Skinamax. In this regard, take a look at the summary for Costigan and the director, before you begin to hiss, saying that you are expecting something else. Do not misunderstand me, for the film “Cosmos / thriller / soft-core / sensation” this film is still not very good, but if you were expecting something in the spirit of “Contact”, I don’t feel sorry for you. <br /> <br /> My rating is: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz-on-demand (Available until December 8, 2005)
