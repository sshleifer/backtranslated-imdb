I would put Death Wish 3 in the same box as Cobra Stallone and Commando. A box I would sell for $ 2 in a garage sale with all the videos inside. The story of the main character, returning from the success of previous films, to destroy it all with the help of this garbage. Why do the producers want to destroy the reputation of the last two films with the help of this cheap junk. The story is so lame that it should have been an outrageous sequel. I mentioned Cobra earlier because she has the same mood that one person can kill 20 or 30 gang members without a scratch. Both this film and Cobra were aimed at showing how the hero shoots a gun at his hips, and the enemy falls in large numbers. The police spend hours on the shooting range, so why were they shot by gang members shooting aimlessly from the hips? This film was so bad that I thought for a moment that it was Death Wish 4.
