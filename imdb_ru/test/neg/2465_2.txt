too predictable for spoilers, but I will not be lower, so don’t read it unless you care. <br /> <br /> A few boring screenwriters are together for half a day, and even then they run out of ideas, so let's start with a criminal who is wanted by the whole of France ... it doesn't matter what he did, we will think about it later (they do not). a few seconds of waiting, but not too much and nothing unexpected, because it requires art. half an hour required to complete the film; I understood: let them rob a jeweler and spend a lot of time to avoid anxiety, etc .; everybody is robbing jewelers in films, just like that, it definitely works (it’s not). no humor, no character (well, Yves Montand, oh well, idiot, or even so), and let everyone speak in a quiet, calm voice that is supposed to make you think about noir, but just makes the actors seem depressed. if they are silent, it will make them seem darker - but it will also save us from writing their lines. we'd rather add something for women who will watch these things, so let's find something that will make them sympathize with the hubby (we forgot to add women to the film). Understood: son on marijuana (gasping) - oh, and let him try to commit suicide for no particular reason (shame? His father is the mafia boss for shouting loudly, but the public will feel his fatherly care, and if not , then bold them). ). oh, a crooked cop was a classmate of the guy who got him in the end; painfully, huh? let's die at the end, or we'll never finish it. is it in the bank? Well, that's over with, thank God. who will we take as director?
