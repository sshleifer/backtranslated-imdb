Justin cannot find the perfect mate to make her perfect for the first time. Together with her friend in tow, she enters a virtual machine to improve her appearance. When she sees the opportunity to create her ideal man, an explosion occurs, and the results remain on your imagination. The problem is, how many obvious sexual jokes are left? How predictable are films of this type? A few funny moments here and there, but nothing special or different from the jokes in other films or even normal life. If you like strange science or jokes about “fish out of water” in combination with the “crisis of gender identity”, then you can definitely enjoy these 90 min.
