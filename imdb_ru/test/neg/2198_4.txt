Computational Could anything be more boring? Sitting in front of the computer all day, typing on the keys every day, touch and tap. This is a big problem with this movie, the heroine is sitting in front of a computer display, pressing the keys, no matter how many worried looks she gives, or how many disturbing notes the composer hits or how many extreme close-ups the director uses. not really worried about the fact that there are several things less exciting than watching someone at a computer. <br /> <br /> There are several other problems, too many factual errors concerning the operation of computers. Is it possible to hack a computer that is turned off and not connected to the Internet? I assume that when NET was created 10 years ago, very few people could understand how computers work, so script writers could work long hours at BS, but now we live in a global village, where almost every household in the Western world has its own Computer the audience is certainly very knowledgeable about the actual mistakes of this film. And, of course, there are too many cases when someone behaves stupidly or not in the spirit of character at critical moments to advance the plot, which makes NET a very mediocre film.
