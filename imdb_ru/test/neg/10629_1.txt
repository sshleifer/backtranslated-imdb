I rented this film because it supposedly takes place at a jazz club - you know, these trendy, cool places that you might stumble upon late on Saturday. Well, in this ridiculous film there is not a single gram of "cool." The score is stupid, the original songs are awful, the singing of both leading actors is constantly inappropriate (to be kind) and unprofessional at best, the plot is no more complicated than “the boy meets the girl”, the acting is funny, the only worthy cinematic moments are scenes from video clips. The scenes of the jazz club present sofomoric dialogues, strangled by excessively busy organ music. This Joey de Francesco must keep his day job (unless his day job helps with many films). Can I not only return my four dollars, but also pay for therapy sessions? This film, which is interesting, is so bad that you can watch it. It seems like driving a car accident - you just need to look at least once. Just cook the earplugs!
