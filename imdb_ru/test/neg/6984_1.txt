At the opposite end of the spectrum from “RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK” is David Hemmings' extremely low adventure about saving the aircraft of the Second World War with a valuable cargo. The assets include wonderful New Zealand settings, energetic music by Brian May, several fashionable helicopters and jet boat chases. The bad, however, far outweighs the good. Donald Pleasant Hams like never before; half of his dialogue is almost illegible. George Peppard attempts an Australian (I think) accent, then throws him halfway through. Lesley Ann Warren annoys her the most. Ken Wal, well, Ken Wal. The dialogue is painful to hear, and the direction of Hemmings is basically inappropriate. The script is not only obvious, but terrible. The jokes were not crowned with success, the scenes have no meaning, and there is almost no continuity. According to the latest data, during the shooting of the film, two men died while piloting jet boats. What a waste.
