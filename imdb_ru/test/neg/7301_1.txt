I knew that I was not going to watch a quality film when this title was included in the "B-class video night" in the place of friends. Despite the warnings, I was still surprised at how bad this film was. Fortunately, we had a lot to share the pain with each other ... The film tries to tell a story about a grim future in which Hawke (the character with Mad Max) goes to rescue a lady in trouble. In fact, the plot is a disguised excuse for producers to promote their own philosophy about life (look at the final credits and disclaimer “these people are not real” at the end for real laughter). The film often lacks direction, and it does not develop its characters to any degree. Worse yet, editing this movie. The film repeats scenes (often from 10 to 20 seconds) to 4 or 5 times in a row. I think it was an attempt to imitate such things as the fighting of Jean-Claude Van Damme, but if so, it fails. The film would probably be about 1/3 of its length if we weren't forced to watch the main character turn his head half a dozen times before the setting sun (yes, that's all that happens in this repeating scene). I award this film an award for "the worst film I've ever seen." I doubt that this will be headed soon.
