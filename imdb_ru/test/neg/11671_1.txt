Like the previous two Mad Max films, Mad Max Outside of Thunder is no exception due to violence and a strange conspiracy. Mad Max is in a post-war society, where he must destroy the master blaster and take the children to the “country of tomorrow”. As a rule, this is a distorted film with links to Peter Pan, Tina Turner, methane pigs and strange characters. It became very boring for me to watch all this, and it offered nothing to me. I felt no inspiration after watching this movie; the only decent thing in this film was the extremely strange characters that were shot in different ways in the film. This is too strange for me, and it was too boring.
