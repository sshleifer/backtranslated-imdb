For several reasons, this movie is just awful. Other authors have listed some of the historical mistakes of this film. Well, I have knowledge of the history of Rome, and even I found the inaccuracies gross. I usually forgive mistakes in historical films, because I understand that the goal is to entertain, not educate. And the reduction of a long saga to a two-hour function requires some, say, a historical license. But this film goes far beyond simple rounding. <br /> <br /> There is worse. To tell a story from a distant period, the film uses memories that simply make the story more confusing. If viewers do not have any prior knowledge of the period, they will be quickly lost. In addition, the film was obviously filmed simultaneously in Italian and English, and various actors were dubbed later. At times, the actors look as if they were filmed in completely different films, which were then filmed together. In fact, this is not so bad. Obviously, the actors were pasted on a stupid computer, created in ancient Rome. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this boring mess to any stars is that I always find Peter O'Toole interesting. But this is no reason to rent it. If you are interested in learning about the history of Rome, there are much better films.
