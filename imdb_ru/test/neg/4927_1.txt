Spending 1 hour and 45 minutes is a nasty little movie to avoid, it looks like a cheap, poorly planned mix between a saw and several other recent kidnapping films, why the writer wrote it was obvious. some money. Turns were obvious when those who were in danger could have escaped, they did the obvious, and did not, etc. Too many good films to watch, not this that will make you unhappy and think less about the world. Spend your time more wisely, watch good movies, exercise, cook tasty food ... everything, but waste your time on trash like this
