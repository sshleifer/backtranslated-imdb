Well, the Sci-Fi channel continues to release these turkeys ... and they seem to be getting worse each time. When usually good actors, such as John Rhys-Davies and Giancarlo Esposito, act as amateurs, you can imagine how terrible the REST of the cast is in this waste of time. The only decent thing halfway is the creature's rubber clothing (which is visible in such quick flashes that you don't have time to see how fake it really is). The dialogue ... the plot ... if this “film” (and I freely use this term) were food, then Jack-In-The-Box would be an exquisite food compared to this. Watch the “The Munsters” rerun for the 372nd preview - your time will be better spent (and much worse)!
