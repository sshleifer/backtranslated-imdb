I was outside the city visiting an old friend. After lunch, after talking, he expressed some doubts about the friends of his daughter. She is 15 years old, she is beautiful, smart, athletic, and the young man is also from a beautiful family, good, also sporty (if not so smart). I told him that he might just feel normal paternal problems; however, a few minutes later a young man appeared with his DVD with this film, which he apparently wanted to share with the others for some time. <br /> <br /> These guys have a bona fide home cinema with a screen size of more than 4 feet, and two young men preceded it, while young Swain almost extolled his virtues. frame by frame <br /> <br /> I saw enough for a few moments (and with some admiration for his terribleness) to support all the most critical comments I have seen, looking at some of them here. <br /> <br /> I told my friend that I would not go so far as to disqualify the young plaintiff solely on the basis of his sympathies for this opus, but, of course, this justifies his close observation. <br /> <br /> Some films are so bad, they are good: the classic Plan 9 from Space; and, in my opinion, the amazingly terrible Bruce Jenner / Village People works "I can not stop the music." <br /> <br /> However, this film remains just in a terrible category. <br /> <Second / third / fourth “bananas” - even the best of them (for example, Tim Conway, Don Notts, all with Seinfeld) have great difficulty in transferring later main roles (or, as here, the film). And these were excellent secondary characters in their original situations. <br /> <br /> The character "Eddy" is really at the level of 5 or 6 bananas in previous Griswald films, and never added to them a lot, in my opinion. Randy Quaid is a capable actor who has achieved good results. His contribution to the previous picture "Vacation" was at best average. Both he and the other cast members, many of whom have done a good job in the past, have done nothing for their efforts here except to get paid for a few years or some IRA contributions. <br /> <br /> This is the whole presentation --- history, speeches (from leader to support) could not be worse.
