I made this film because I'm a big fan of Dudikoff. I figured it couldn't be so bad. Boy I was wrong! At the 15th minute, I asked the others to let me rip the DVD and throw it back to the rental store, but they refused. They swore they should be better. <br /> <br /> They were wrong! This film lacked everything. The actors put on their roles with the same amount of emotion as comatose rock! The plot was ridiculous, and I was offended by the fact that Hollywood believed that people were stupid enough to enjoy it. None of the characters interacted well with each other. Ice-T gives one of his worst performances here. <br /> <br /> After watching the videos of the wrong plane, the bad guys standing to get shot, and the clips that were empty and missing everything, I wanted to scream and beat my head on the concrete. The film reached its plateau of ignorance when people on the space station used the elevator to travel. Space suits are not needed, and there is gravity in space, regardless of what real cosmonauts can say. <br /> <br /> I didnâ€™t finish this movie and I hated it. I don't want to end this movie. This is a slow suicide. I felt that my cerebral cortex was planning to avenge the torture I was subjected to.
