There is nothing mean or evil in this film. It's just awfully boring. Sad picture - the film seems old, faded and blurred. Maybe even 16 mm blasted to 35 mm, I do not know. A boring script that is boring and is called "Jules Pfeiffer". That is some cool cocktail party of the boss-nova of the 1960s. How our beat grandparents could say if they tried to look very straight. The “little piece of life” characters were mostly annoying. True, they were real for life, but, hey, if I wanted to see really ordinary people doing really worldly and ordinary things, I would just watch myself. I would not reach the cinema itself and not lose five pounds, and in the evening I watched someone else do it. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a funny, bright romcom. What I got was more like what two smart and moderately talented 19–20 year olds could do on the first day with their new video camera. <br /> <br /> I gave it 4 out of 10 because it seems that someone was trying, at least.
