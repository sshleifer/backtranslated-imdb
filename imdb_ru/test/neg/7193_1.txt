Well, do not worry. This film looks so tired, acting is so old-fashioned, and the plot and characters are so gray that you need to study it and not watch it. This is really a terrible waste of the film; Stereotypes, clich√©s, nonsense and amateur movies. I looked at it in incredible fear with my mouth wide open. How could such a film be made, and what is even more interesting, how could it be found ridiculous or watchable? Old, tired, sloppy ... at best, a parody of the highest level. There is nothing watchable except to study a very ancient film. Not a good movie, just ancient. This is not Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy. This is nonsense. The acting is so bad that it may be worth it to look only at laughter. Some films are so bad that they are good. But this one goes around the corner and returns to the bad again.
