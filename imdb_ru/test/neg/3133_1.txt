Fine. Another foreign film that thinks this is Fellini. In addition, we need to promote more killings of people with disabilities. <br /> <br /> I see no reason why we should be overwhelmed by these disguised commercials about euthanasia. <br /> <br /> I did not find anything redemptive in this film. What can be redeemed in a man without courage, despite some adversity. You do not need courage to commit suicide. This is the action of a coward. Sharing this “desire” with his woman just causes her the same disease as his. If it was a film about the courage of a man, despite his problems, similar to the story of Jill Quinmont, it would make him a great movie. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in Seeing true courage, watch movies about Jill Quinmont, a former skier who became disabled after a severe ski accident.
