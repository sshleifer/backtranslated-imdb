Forgotten (AKA: Do not look in the basement) is a very cheap and very old horror movie. <br /> <br /> History is very slow and never reaches the point of worrying. /> <br /> Patients at the shelter are embarrassingly ridiculous, especially Sam and the old woman, who always quotes the old saying to everyone. (Carefully, when she gets close to the camera, tell me that you can watch without laughing!). <br /> <br /> Now the blood looks very bad, the blood in many scenes looks pink, so it really does not deserve its place in the list of video filth! <br /> <br /> In general, if you are not looking for a fantastic horror movie and you have some free time, then itâ€™s worth a look.
