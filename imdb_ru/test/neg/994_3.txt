This is a bad excuse for a movie. The film noir, shot by Busby Berkeley? You are welcome! First, let's forget about the plot, a truly ingenious version of a cynical tough guy, whom the love of a pretty blonde turned into a saint. Yechh. So what makes her despise him and love? Together with a group of other guys, he helps keep the child from drowning, as they all float in the water tower and try to survive as the water is pumped out, interlacing them. This is not entirely heroic, but she is suddenly amazed. It really hurts to watch Claude Raines trying to portray a stubborn, tough-talking police noir. The grimace curve is his main and rather pretentious acting instrument, along with a growl of voice. It seems that most of his energy goes to hiding the mind, which shines in all its other roles. As he was persuaded to take this job, I will never understand. Enjoy, if you can, the details of vintage cars and gas pumps, but do not expect a decent movie impression. It was spent 1-1 / 12 hours of my life.
