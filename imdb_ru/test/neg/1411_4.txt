I found this Robin Williams car a bit funny at best. I think you would call it a kind of political satire. It's about a political talk show host / comedian who decides to run for president and unexpectedly wins. and Robin Williams is much more restrained and balanced than usual. I would say that the film is more a drama than a comedy, with a bit of mystery and expectation. I think the drama parts worked better than comedies and mysterious ones. and the stressful aspect (although this is a small part of the film) worked best. However, I would not rate this film very highly. For me it was a waste of two hours, but nothing special. My best advice would be to catch it on TV / cable or rent it cheap before making a purchase decision. My vote for Man of the Year - 4/10
