This movie starts on the wrong foot and never starts. The first scene shows the landing of the Flight Flight helicopter, and outside the window you can clearly see the mountains in the background. For those of you who may have never been to Houston, there is no change in height. The city is located just above sea level, and a slope of 5 feet is considered a big hill. To agree with this landscape, any shots outside the hospital immediately inform the viewer that they are not in Houston. There are no leaves or pines in the trees, which Houston does not have much of. Even the hospital outside is incredible. The Hermann Memorial Hospital is one of the best hospitals in the United States and is located in the heart of the Medical District, just a few miles from the center of Houston, but with every shot from the hospital it seems that the hospital is in the suburbs or even the countryside. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the one who was responsible for the real tropical storm of the film, saved, because the numerous shots from the radar do not correspond to reality. The first radar image in the film is Hurricane Hugo, hitting South Carolina. Later we see Chris Kristofferson leaving his job, and one of his assistants tells him that Alison is heading back south through Houston, but in the radar picture he shows, Alison is clearly heading north from the Gulf of Mexico to Houston ... probably the initial landfall. Alison <br /> <br /> As for acting, it's not so bad. Jobbet Williams, Chris Kristofferson and Rick Schroeder all do a decent job, considering that this is a direct film. The plot of this story is decent, and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it a bit more interesting. My only problem with acting is the image of Houstonians with strong southern accents ... all the actors sound like they are from Birmingham, Alabama, and not from Houston, Texas. <br /> <br /> The film is reflected and for a wide audience it does exactly what it is intended for: to entertain. If you are looking for a factual account of what happened to the city of Houston in June 2001, you will be disappointed. Before watching this film, one should keep in mind that it is based solely on the evacuation from the Hermann Memorial Hospital, and not on the Alison tropical storm and the impact on the Houston metro itself. If you are looking for a factual report on the impact of Tropical Storm Alison on the subway in Houston, I could advise you to watch the Storm Stories by the Weather Channel for Tropical Storm Alison. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of *****
