Personally, I watched it because of the appearance of Leah Thompson, and I did not expect to get pleasure from the film as such, but surprisingly, I continued to watch it until the end. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - this is just one of the saga-like stories and not particularly original or entertaining, but it’s strange that it just keeps you watching TV. My opinion of their own will would be much better if there was not one point that I simply did not understand. <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful and very touching scene in which the character Lee Thompson runs the street holding a child in her arms, snow falls, she is cold, scared, and she has nowhere to stop, she does not know what to do next. And then, after about 10-12 years, when things are better for her, she just leaves the same child without warning to begin the career she dreamed of. <br /> <br /> I just don’t understand - I don’t understand how it is possible that she will do such things, it was an action opposite to all that she has done so far in her life, when all that she did was aimed at the survival of this child. After this cast of the character, I simply could not enjoy the rest of the film.
