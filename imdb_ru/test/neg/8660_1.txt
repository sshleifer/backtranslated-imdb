What a crappy movie! The main character of this film was supposed to be born and brought up in Canada, but he had a stronger Indian accent than his parents! Is it just me or Uday looking gay in this movie? Besides, all the chicks in Canada dress like whores? At least, so in this film. All women are dressed like strippers. Do not waste your time with this! The only good thing about this movie is the setting in beautiful Vancouver. I wonder why Bollywood is experiencing a recession? This is because of such films. I miss the good old days when Hindi movies were really interesting! I could not even finish this film because it was very bad. I think that Bollywood should stop trying to repeat the style of Hollywood, because it just does not work. They need to stick to their roots, because that is what makes Indian films interesting.
