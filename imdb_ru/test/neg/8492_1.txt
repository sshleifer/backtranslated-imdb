My wife received tickets for our family to attend the premiere of this film for free. I only regret the price of popcorn and two hours of my life spent on this trash movie. <br /> <br /> I have a DVD with the original Mask, and I really liked it. I expected that the remake did not come close to the original in production values ​​or writing ... but I was not ready for this vulgar pile of garbage. A weak game, a bad story, a bad CGI child, passing gas and urinating in a hyper “mask.” The woman turned into a giant nose, spewing slime. Funny, yes? My eight year old son loves films such as Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Star Wars. After that I asked him what he was thinking. His exact words; “I hated it. It's like a Scooby Doo movie. They take something good and are forced to invest all these rude things. ” My 12-year-old daughter and wife also hated it. Later, my wife told me that my son asked her twice if we could leave. He has never done this before. I'm proud of him. If you had not thought that I was some kind of Puritan, because of the groans and lack of laughter that I heard in the theater, I think that most of the patrons agreed with me. <br /> <br /> This film reflects all the bad things in children's entertainment today, and any positive feedback MUST be from people financially connected with the film.
