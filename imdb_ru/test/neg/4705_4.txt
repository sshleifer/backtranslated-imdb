There is no doubt that this film is a silly and unfunny joke, but, to tell the truth, it is quite interesting (if you are a spectator for the first time and try not to analyze anything). The whole movie has very good ideas, but poorly written. <br /> <br /> The story of two losers waking up to find out that they cannot remember what happened to them the day before. Only to find out later that they are followed by evil twin friends, aliens, a transsexual, a stripper, aliens and some gang members. <br /> <br /> Doesn't this look like the personality of Born? Yes, yes, I know - how can I compare two films, but what the hell? They both have no memories; the people were behind them and so on. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is stupid and is intended only for viewers who like a dumb movie. <br /> <br /> Reason for watching: · Many young talented actors · Very stupid · If you like to analyze, then forget about it, · Talented young actors become bad, · Good move is bad, <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 (Rating: E ​​+) <br /> <br /> ------------ ------------ ---------- ---------- ------ --- --------- ---- <br /> <br /> “Dude, where's my car” - wait for what you expect from the Ashton Kutcher movie. I think almost every person got the same answer for this guy - “A really stupid movie.” In addition to the "Show 70s" this guy really has nothing to offer the fan. (He should thank the series for his reputation). "Dude, where's my car," is one of his trademarks - "stupidity." Somehow his film is even worse than the films of Adam Sandler (you can imagine). The film is really meaningless, without a storyline and without anything. Mara Sokoloff, Jennifer Garner, Alison Sweeney and S. Scout were not supposed to spend their talent on this trash. They even came up with "Seriously, dude, where's my car." This shows how film companies want to make money, not quality. <br /> <br /> Max: 4/10 <br /> <br /> Recommendation: borrow them from your friends or just forget about it
