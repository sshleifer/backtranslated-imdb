If I had never seen the episode of the original Avengers with Blackman, Rigg or Thorson, I would rate this series more. While the actors did their best to support the action and interest of the scenarios, I was just keen on comparing the episodes with the original series. Steed was expected to be more involved in the fighting scenes, and it seemed that the writers were struggling to keep up with the actors. Honestly, I can't blame them for trying to resurrect fans from the original series, but that just didn't work, as evidenced by the fact that it lasted one season. Observation of the work of Steed in this series reminded me of General MacArthur when he said: "The old soldiers never die, they just disappear!"
