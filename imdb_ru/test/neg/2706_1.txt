When I first watched this movie, I was ten years old. Then I thought it was bad, and at that age I didnâ€™t have any cinematic taste. I watched this movie on Cinemax about 3 days ago, and I was reminded why I hated the movie at all. The character of Madonna, Nikki, annoying and disgusted. There is no way for the protagonist to ever fall in love with her. The jokes were commonplace, and the dialogue was worse than the TV. TV series!! I am glad that I did not see this film in the theater or rented it. I feel bad because of my parents, who had to endure, watching it with me! Madonna is not necessarily a bad actress, but in this role she is depicted as a complete idiot.
