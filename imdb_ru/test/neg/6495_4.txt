This film suffers from the fact that for many years, Hollywood had no idea how to pack Jackie Chan for the masses. All of his low-budget Hong Kong films were dynamic kinetic thrillers, highlighting his amazing gymnastic skills and talent for light comedy. His early Hollywood films were stuck in the same films that were packaged for Stallone or Chuck Norris. In this film, there is nothing about Chan's character that would require the character to be Asian, except that he was a star. In his Hong Kong films, Chan is never boring: movies are one sequence of quick martial arts after another, but Defender is lifeless in everything. Danny Aiello also does little, and the lack of chemistry between them is probably the result of the script and direction, rather than how the two actors got along. Both were better in the worst films. The best thing about the film is the settings of Hong Kong. Worst of all, Jackie Chan looks so colorless and gray. Only in Canadaâ€™s Rumble in the Bronx, made in Canada, does the West finally learn how to make a good film about Jackie Chan.
