I thought this movie would be good. This is absolutely not the case, despite the main actors Oscar award. Perhaps I once laughed, and I never heard anyone else in the theater laugh. Pancake makeup Renee Zellweger was very unsuccessful. It seems that everyone tries so hard in this film, they run around in imitation of farce, but they donâ€™t take it away. I think that maybe the film sounds good during the development process, but something is lost in translation. Were the roaring 20s really like that? I think no. Everything seems a bit artificial. Randy Newman's score was annoying. The film is in sepia, like any other film that occurs in the 20-30s. There is not much originality.
