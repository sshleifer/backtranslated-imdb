Or did someone else notice the fact that the first episodes of the episodes are too inspired by the films of the 90s? <br /> <br /> I mean seriously a wife who is trying to get someone else to kill his rich husband so that she can claim his property. Medical students who temporarily stop their hearts to find lost memories; Komatozniki. A bunch of student bodies gathered again to remember in the old days, but not very comfortable, because they did something in the past, Very bad things? Groundhog Day is one of my favorite films. Unfortunately, the writing staff behind his shit is a bunch of lazy bastards who can't come up with their original scripts. <br /> <br /> Noble idea absolutely does not fit into its execution.
