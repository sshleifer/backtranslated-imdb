Act 10, Scenario 1. “Hurlyburly” comes from that unfortunate postmodern theatrical school, which declared that everything that resembles a story or plot is prohibited. While people can get away with it on stage, on a film it becomes deadly - or at least deadly boring. We still have a lot of great actors exposing the dialogue, which, although brilliantly written, does not lead to anything. Worse, each character speaks with the same voice, despite its origin. The only attempt to make a difference is to force teenage teenager Anna Paquin to use the word "no." <br /> <br /> Never mind that the characters are unsympathetic losers to the extreme, camera work is rather careless and (for the residents of Los Angeles) attention to geography is ridiculous. (Hint: The view from the front window of Sean Penn is about eight miles from the view from his rear window, and you can't go south through Hollywood and end up in Glendale pretending to be Burbank.) OK, suspension of disbelief and all that - and usually I I would not pay attention to such trifles, because they are just the whims of production. But the fact that they stood out so much, despite the pianistics on the screen, says a lot about the weakest element of this enterprise - the scenario. <br /> <br /> In short, skip it, even in the video, Rab chose the wrong quote from the Scottish play for his title; Hurlyburly would have been better called “A story told by an idiot, full of sound and rage, meaningless”. Perhaps a little long for the tent - but at least it will be a fair advertisement.
