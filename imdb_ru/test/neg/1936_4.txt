My opinion: even a great underwater photo can save a familiar script and thin paper characters. <br /> <br /> FLIPPER can offer decent rentals to those who still lack FREE FREE WILLY photos. Others (strongly) are encouraged to stay away. Although FLIPPER is a harmless activity, it is unlikely to show anything for an adult audience (unless you are seeing a dolphin for the first time). <br /> <br /> A remake of a 1960s television show and film, FLIPPER may sound like a good idea then: the dolphin enchants the life of a boy and a girl, they help save the environment by first getting rid of the toxic waste that is thrown into the sparkling waters of Florida Kisa, and at the same time fighting a shark and a salty sea villain, who, as it turned out, is responsible for dumping toxic substances, and also hates dolphins. But even in the 90s, especially if such an eerily similar movie as FREE WILLY, was a recent hit, FLIPPER is just another harmless, but sometimes empty film about the summer splash for children. Although animals (this, just in case, the main dolphin, clumsy pelican and realistic looking hammerhead shark, the villain type) and untouched underwater cinematography steal the show, there is still nothing to steal in FLIPPER. <br /> The story is completely predictable, which may seem obvious even now, when even a 6-year-old child. Cast (Human), led by the Lord of the Rings, Elijah Wood and the idle Paul Hogan, rarely can anything be done except to stand and look beautiful. Their acting skills, whatever they may be in this film, are rarely revealed on the screen, if you do not take into account the “acting” talents of a cheerful bottlenose dolphin. I think that not trying to recommend FLIPPER, since senseless family entertainment will not be fair, but anyone over 10 (no, better than 8) is better off renting or buying something else. In addition, the film takes about 95 minutes. This may give you enough time to not worry about your children. This alone can cost rent. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
