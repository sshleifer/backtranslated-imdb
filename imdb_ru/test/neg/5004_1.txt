This film was full of cheese. It smelled. The only thing that was good about this was acting. Other than that, nothing remarkable. <br /> <br /> Big spoilers are on sale now! Do not read more if you have not seen it yet! <br /> <br /> This film tells about a family whose happy and wonderful life was destroyed because of their younger son and later when they recognized the eldest son. were molested by their day care providers. Although in court they are called liars, and the lawyer is a real shot, jurors find them guilty and condemn them. <br /> <br /> In the end, all I can say to the director is, “The next time you want to make such a film, do it differently.”
