I really liked The Wrecking Crew (1999), which was the last of the three films in this series (the first of which is Urban Danger (1999), which I have not yet seen). I know that it was baaaaad, but these three leaders did a pretty decent job, all things considered. <br /> <br /> This, however, was really terrible. Ice-T was terrible, and he is a producer! I can’t say that I’ve ever heard of “Silk Shock” (which, apparently, never learned to write), but his performance was one of the worst I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Miss Jones succeeded in her small role, although she later continued to do some violent, racist “jokes” on her radio show after the Asian tsunami in Southeast Asia (plus, unfortunately, in other cases ). Go, girl ... <br /> <br /> No one else comes out with a loan. It is strange that TJ Storm and Ernie Hudson (both of which are pretty bad here) are much better in The Wrecking Crew, which was made with Urban Menace, at the same time as Corrupt. How it works, I do not know. <br /> <br /> I’m going to try Ice-T’s comment now to see if he is apologizing for the film, or trying to make us think that this is a great filmmaking thing.
