I can not forget that incredible scene in "Alien", when an alien escaped from the chest of one of the men. Or even in the Predator, when an invisible monster sneaked up to the confused soldiers and cut them into pieces. Both of these films expressed exciting ideas about the mediocre creature. Go back to the era of raw B-movies and watch big people in fake costumes marching, killing people in small towns. Now admit that the two films above have revolutionized this genre. The cave does nothing to improve it. He does not try anything new, and, worst of all, the Cave does not even have good blood. Shame on them, shame on them all. <br /> <br /> One-dimensional characters of The Cave parade in a sexy spandex. All this does not seem to care when they witness the death of their colleagues. They just walk without the knowledge of an evil creature hiding in darkness. The plot is very simple to understand. So you have two brothers, a black guy and a sexy woman scientist. The rest (by the rest I mean all those who meet horrible demise) are even more uninteresting than others. We have a Korean assistant, a dangerous girl in the open air, a Russian scientist and two divers who have no feelings of emotion, and they are so stupid that they wander by themselves. This film is superior to being extremely clichéd, since all but the black guy, one of the brothers, and the woman scientist, meet the end. It also seems that only Americans can survive the terror, as the Russians and Koreans are dying. Do not be offended if I give the details. In any case, there is nothing surprising. <br /> <br /> To be ahead, they find this cave. They go to the cave. They are stuck in a cave. They begin to die in the cave. One of them becomes infected in a cave. More die in the cave. They exit the cave; only to discover that one of them has a parasite that will turn them into a terrible monster that doesn't seem to bother them. This is the simplicity of the dim plot. He does not even try to be original. He even has a part where they decide that their leader is not capable and has collapsed. We have just seen it many times before. <br /> <br /> I know that in such a film, people do not care about the performances, but it is worth mentioning how bad they are. Everything is just so sad. Cole Hauser was especially unsophisticated and did not turn me on to Eddie Sibrian, who is often much better. Morris Chestnut presents the best thing in the film. Its performance is actually decent. He portrays a guy who calms everyone. All other actors are, at best, average. In this series, it's not so bad. <br /> <br /> Now for the genre of the film; action, of course. Well, to my regret, the action was boring. All death scenes are boring, damn it, the whole movie was. There is almost no blood. Either they disappear and show up later, or they attack and die without bruises. Seeing the death of a Korean was the only thrilling action I could find. <br /> <br /> This is pretty amazing. Bad things overshadow most good things. A good example is to say that the special effects were well done, as they were. The only wrong thing is that since everything happens in a cave, it will be dark. It was very difficult for me to distinguish the walls of the cave and the monsters. So it was quite difficult to even see the creatures. Although I liked the special effects, there was nothing original about the monsters. They were all alike and were not at all frightening. <br /> <br /> The Cave is Bruce Hunt's directorial debut. I do not understand what he was trying to achieve by shooting this film. He clearly made a huge mistake. Almost everything in this film smelled like a smelly bomb. The smelly bomb is probably even nicer than watching this mess again. Only the most forgiving moviegoer will find this forgivable. I lost all hope in the middle of the film when I heard the phrase “what the hell was that” for the third time.
