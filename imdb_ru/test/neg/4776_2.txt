The film began approx. A couple of tourists, vacationers in Mexico, who have a good time, decide to go hiking. They reveal some hidden trails and, ultimately, this huge temple, like a fortress. Enraged villagers appear and try to keep them from climbing, but because of the language barrier, people shoot, and tourists end up clinging to stupidity. It turns out that the plants are evil bloodthirsty things that the villagers will not approach, so they guard the temple so that tourists cannot get out. In this film, there is a couple of panic, but in fact nothing makes sense. I mean, they are PLANTS! Do not worry about buying or renting d.v.d. Wait until it comes to cable.
