Mini-series "Dune" opens with "instant" installation of sequences of actions. Awareness quickly comes to the conclusion that these are * the best * scenes of 265 minutes, and they are not very good. Not good at all. Oh my God. <br /> <br /> But let's not judge the book by its cover (although this is exactly what we are offered). Let's give Dune a chance to redeem themselves. <br /> <br /> Well, here is the expected watery discovery on Caladan. But who is this irritable, strangely ugly person? Paul Atreides? * Is it * Paul Atreides? Is it a universal plastic doll? And why does he look so old? What it is? Is the actor only 25? Well, he doesn't * look * it, and it's still too old. <br /> <br /> But at least he has charisma, right? Wrong. Alec Newman - a stumbling block, mumble. I can imagine how he was found sitting in the dark in acting classes, because no one loved him enough to say that the lesson was over, and he was just too stupid to understand it. When your Paul Atreides on the screen has all the scornful toasts and a range of actions from “irritable” to “empty”, your production of “Dune” is doomed from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> Other actors regret poor Alec, however, and give evenly tasteless and incomprehensible ideas so that he does not look too bad in comparison. At least, I guess that is what they are doing. You see, because I'm a charity. <br /> <br /> To be fair, they are clearly not given any direction. Random gestures, empty or inconsistent deliveries, missing tracks - all this is here. It is like a master class on how not to do this. <br /> <br /> And, of course, in this mini-series there are more elements of the book than in the 1984 film, but not twice as many. because of everything. Pause. Fill. Time. <br /> <br /> But we can forgive all this because of the small budget of $ 20 million, or only $ 5 million per hour. No one can rely on high-quality science fiction with this kind of budget. <br /> <br /> With the possible exception of the SG-1 Stargate, which costs $ 1.4 million for a 50-minute episode, or Farscape at $ 2 million. And, frankly, I would prefer to watch four episodes of any of them, while they are beaten on the kidneys, than to sit at the parody, which again resembles the mini-series “Dune”.
