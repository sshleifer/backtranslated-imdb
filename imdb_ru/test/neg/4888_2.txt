There is no shortage of female flesh, but still not interesting! At the very least, Lenzi is capable of more, probably reaching a maximum in Spasmo and starting with Kiss Me Kill Me <br /> <br /> The DVD release of Hard Gore R2 can be shot at 86 minutes, but this film contains one act of cannibalism one sacrifice is a scene with a local girl who is brutally and gutted by a tribe of cannibals, about which we are warned, and who later set fire to some of the huts. Holocaust Pyro? Firestarter Fernox anyone? <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not a cannibal, but was there a decent movie? Avoid.
