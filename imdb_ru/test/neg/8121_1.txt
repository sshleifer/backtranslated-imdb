Seriously ... I'm amazed by all the good reviews about this show here. All that we have in this show are two stupid children who continue to scoff at laughter, and they do RANDOM funny things only in the form of ... 2 shows, while most of the others suck ... as then they comment music videos that I can not stand myself personally, as long as they either love or love. <br /> <br /> In most episodes, you only hear reptiles: "Let's go get pregnant with a few tiptoes," or "I'll hit you in the ass." ", or even better, and the quote is“ usually was cool, ”and, above all, their annoying laugh. <br /> <br /> If you want a good animated show, try The Simpsons, Ren and Stimpy, South Park ". This show is simply not worth the time or energy to truly watch this terrible MTV series.
