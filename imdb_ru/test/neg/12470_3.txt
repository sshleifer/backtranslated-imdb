The beginning of the film was confusing, and everything else was predictable. It was just one of those films that I encountered in my netflix instant line-up, and I thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfro and Bijou Phillips come together again from the time of Bully. Unfortunately, the "interesting" has never been in this film. Swain plays an invisible girl in a private school whose best friend is rich and does whatever she wants at any time (Phillips). But Swain loves one of the boys (Renfro) from "in the crowd" and eventually begins to hang with them. And, of course, as in all other films, everything is good (or so you think, because the film never hints that everything is good), and then everything becomes not so good if you communicate with rich children. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that there are absolutely no peaks and valleys. It's just a dead, lifeless movie, and after watching it, you feel you could have done something better. Some scenes (scenes with Renfro's parents) do not even make sense to be in the film, because the director and screenwriter did not follow him at all. <br /> <br /> All the interesting things that COULD play out were just completely ignored, and it's almost like watching an episode before they became stars (Mischa Barton and Rachel Bison from OC). <br /> <br /> The only bright light in this film, and the reason why he does not receive ONE rating from me, is Phillips. They need more scenes with her in this. Renfro looks like he brought some of his character from Bully. And, for Pete's sake, the name is BS, change the name.
