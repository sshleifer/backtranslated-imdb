The pitiful and unnecessary continuation of a bona fide classic. The American werewolf in London is definitely the jewel of the film: humorous, insane, only with a touch of romance and very, very British I wanted to get up and sing keep the Queen every time the movie ended. Then this abomination came. You know that you really are in trouble when the leads are so unlikely that you are happy when they are clogged, and in fact you start to root for lycanthropes. I'll tell you the truth, guys, I went through half of this CGIed parody before I lost the will to live and turned it off. Absolutely pathetic and putrid waste of someone's time.
