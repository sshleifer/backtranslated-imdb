In 1967, I saw an outstanding musical in Wintergarden in New York, where Angela Lansbury is on stage at Mama. But Hollywood gave her leadership ???? No, Lucille Ball is great because Lucy was given the role. She killed the movie. What mistake. There was no chemistry, because on the stage Be Arthur and Angela were a couple when they sang. It is a pity that the producer does not combine these two things even today
