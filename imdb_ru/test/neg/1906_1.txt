Have you ever watched a really bad movie and got angry at it? Even a movie you didn't expect? Well, I just made the movie "Dead Line". This is the title of a video from the United States for Interference. Now I have seen a lot of bad movies and watched a lot of “B” titles, but this is already in another league. It was released on the label "The Asylum", and anyone who rents a lot of direct horror film knows this label. When you rent one of them, you know what you get. Many marginal acts with low budget are terrifying, but as a rule, still pretty good. Not this one. The action of the three leads was beyond bad. Even the shipment could not help. The tag on the front of the box reads: “... in the tradition of DePalma’s“ Double Body ”. Courage to compare it with this classic film. The only correct comment is “The screams you hear are real.” Yes, you will be the one that screams if you rent it.
