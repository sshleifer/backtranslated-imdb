I love the so-called films "Blaxploitation" and saw dozens. Some, such as COTTON COMES TO HARLEM, SHAFT and HAMMER, have excellent performance and are very interesting, while many others are very cheap and stupid, but still interesting, such as BROTHERHOOD OF DEATH or COFFEY. However, DOLEMITE controls something rare for the genre - it's just cheap and stupid and not at all entertaining! It's like blissful exploitation, created for very, very stupid people. <br /> <br /> A few years ago I saw the movie “Dolemites” on Mad TV, and, unfortunately, the real DOLEMITE is no better. Like a parody, acting is terrible. Rudy Ray Moore has all the charm and charm of a piece of corkwood. He can barely read his lines, and his "karate" is a joke - his punches obviously miss the target again and again. As for the rest of the cast, many may be worse. My favorite was a guy from the FBI who couldn’t even remember his lines and really tried his best to pull them out - but they didn’t even bother to re-shoot these scenes! In fact, a lot of this was inappropriate, and it was hard for me to understand if the film was thought of as a joke. <br /> <br /> If you think that, despite the terrible actions and actions, there is something worth seeing this film, you are wrong. Even for perverts who hope to see some kind of skin will be disappointed. Naked women in the film really look like prostitutes who are not lucky, and in their sagging bodies there is nothing sexually sexy. I think that looking at elderly people naked - darkly old naked people - is no worse than looking at these "ladies." And as for Rudy Ray, he has “male boobs”. No black superhero or antihero should look so bad naked !! For God's sake, put on your clothes and create a script that does not look like it was written by winos !!! <br /> <br /> For your information - apparently, there really is a continuation of this film! ! I can't imagine viewing them, so you just need to find someone else to view them. I watched PLAN 9 FROM OUTSIDE SPACE, TEENAGERS FROM OUTSIDE SPACE and ROBOT MONSTER, but I just don’t think I can bring myself to see another Dolemite movie - they are so bad!
