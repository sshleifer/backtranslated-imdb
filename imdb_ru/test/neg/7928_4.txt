For the film, which was the most popular in South Korea for most of 2004, this was a huge disappointment. Shows that Hollywood is not the only place where people can make superemotional, melodramatic films. The film lasted more than 130 minutes, but in fact not much happened, and everything that happened was largely what could have been expected, the plot was so transparent. Of course, if you yourself were a Korean, you could have done this more, but for me it did nothing. Suffice it to say that, as in the case of Korean cinema, the plot revolves around the relationship between the northern and southern parts of the peninsula. South Korea decides to recruit and train an elite squad of murderers from prisoners sentenced to death to kill Kim Il Sung. <br /> <br /> The tedious plot doesn't bother me if the characters are good, but unfortunately this is not the case this time either. They are stereotypes, and most actions are mediocre and too often just over the top, as is the case in Korean cinema. Too much time is spent on numerous installations, and the characters remain distant, one-dimensional cardboard cuts. They had to spend more time setting characters and less showing us how tough and brutal the training and the soldiers are. <br /> <br /> One thing she recalls is that the lesser of the two errors still remains wrong.
