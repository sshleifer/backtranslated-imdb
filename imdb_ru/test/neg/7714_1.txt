When one of the stars of the movie is called Sticky Fingaz, you should know enough to stay away. Stay away. HOUSE 2 is almost the same, this time the zombies flooded the campus (man, how it should have saved money). As usual, “zombies” give no direction about which to talk like that, and they give very little makeup or costumes. They look like zombies in one of those endless cheap Italian zombies that were many years ago. In other words, they are not like the zombies we know and love from the films of George Romero and Dan O'Bannon. People fighting zombies are all nonactors who shoot weapons and do little. Some who have written here feel that the sequel is a bit more focused than the original. All I have to say, I'm glad the director of the sequel did away with 360-degree panning, which helped destroy the first film. HOUSE 2 is still the same thing, which means that nothing happens for 80 or 90 minutes. There is one production part in which soldiers are fighting with a zombie football team, which at least would be fun. Is not.
