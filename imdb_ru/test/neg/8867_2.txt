It is painfully obvious that the people who shot this “film” have never seen such striking parodies as the “Naked Gun” and “Hot Shots”. This film is terrible, as are the actors. They would not know how to play, even if they hit them in the face, as I felt, by doing this, watching this pile of rubbish. <br /> <br /> The film is stupid and there is no humor in it. I am sure that I could make a better movie with my friends. For me, it's amazing that a movie can fail so much. No clever or funny lines. No trace of intelligence behind this. This is a pitiful movie, and I would like to meet a man who really loves this movie. Ugh!
