Now, before I tell you the summary, this is not a spoiler review. Bone Eater impresses with its reputation as the worst film of the year. I do not know how these films get on DVD. If I saw it in cinemas, I would be very upset. Bone Eater about these people who dig up an ancient burial ground and find several bones. This is the Bone Eater, and the more bones he eats, the more powerful he becomes. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I thought well that the DVD cover looks creepy and sounds creepy. When I rented it and looked at the DVD label, it looked scary. But then, when I played it, I could agree with one thing - the name “Bone Eater” is better than the movie itself. Tell me stupid? A bone eater who just attacks, throwing a bone, ate you, and you disappeared? Do not worry, this is not a spoiler that you see in the first 5 minutes. Or is it more stupid that the Bone Eater has a horse? Do you know what I consider the most stupid? Whole movie <br /> <br /> CGI is terrible. Yes, I thought the Bone Eater idea was creepy, but as soon as you see the real thing, you think it's some kind of action movie or just a cruel, mean joke. The film sounded longer than Titanic, and it was half an hour. When a film really has moments of waiting, it just stops. I admit that acting was not the best, but really decent, and that the violence was not excessive, but everything else is an abomination. <br /> <br /> In general, Bone Eater is a movie you can skip. If you like interesting movies with gorgeous creatures, a great CGI and an unknown movie, Bone Eater is a movie you can skip. If you like bad movies, no matter how stupid they are, Bone Eater will satisfy you.
