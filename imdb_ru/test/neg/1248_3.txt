20 people rated it 10! This urn was packed better than a Christmas turkey! Speaking of turkey, this is a traditional story in which we hope to squeeze into a real hobby for poker - without success. Said completely in a linear memory, and when I say “said,” I mean “SPEAKING DEATH”, this film never gives enough picture when words can be used to spell out. <br /> <br /> Stuart Unger's passion for childhood cards and associations with hooligans may sound like interesting film material, but the director manages to suck the life out of them. In no case did I have the slightest sympathy for Unger, a genius in card games, who threw it all at other forms of gambling, in which he was not so experienced. Of course, this leads when we go through THREE musical edits, to the inevitable downward spiral of drugs, the loss of a family and, finally, to its redemption (a kind of). Big yawn!
