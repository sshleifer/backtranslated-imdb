As the flagship show, Attack Show (AOTS) is endemic to the larger fall of G4 TV; it is a show (and station) that has gone so far as to flaunt sex, trying to hide its crying flaws. Its predecessor, “Screensavers”, was a platform for troubleshooting technical problems and searching for the latest technologies. It was a pleasant show with pleasant staff, and it was fun to see some of the modding and other experiments that the team could do together. <br /> <br /> The acquisition of TechTV G4 worried some long-time fans of the station. but the early returns were really promising. The emphasis on games was a good addition, and I really enjoyed the coverage of E3 and other major entertainment events. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, AOTS is now just a shell of its former self. Those who are watching the channel have shifted the focus of the channel from technology and games to anything that can cause saliva in young people. The result is that AOTS spends the same amount of time on Olivia Mann parades or on film industry advertising for adults as it does on games. This is so bad that it is almost impossible to track. <br /> <br /> While some may get childish joy from this kind of things, those who are genuinely interested in games may be wondering what good lighting has led to. It is no less disturbing that young gamers who can tune in to G4, thinking that they are getting the game — this active game group aged 10–15 years — instead receive food targeted at a more mature audience. On a channel like HBO or Cinemax, such things are expected. On the G4 it is tragic. <br /> <br /> At least SpikeTV, another male-oriented channel, has good programs like CSI. AOTS and G4 have very little good left. <br /> <br /> Very bad, really.
