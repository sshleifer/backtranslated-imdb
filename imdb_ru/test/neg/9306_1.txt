It hurts me to talk about this in an Australian film, but Mr. Crash is one of the worst of the worst films I've ever seen. What is even more tragic is that it does not fit into the category “this is so bad, this is good.” What annoys me most about this film is the pretty big money spent on a meaningless, unfunny, underdeveloped, inept script. Dull performances (what do Harry MacDonald and Elizabeth Gore, otherwise, Elle McFeast, in this trash can?) Ha! Do yourself a favor and stay away!
