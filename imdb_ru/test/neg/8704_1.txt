As a Christian, I am outraged at seeing only the first half of this picture. It’s written on the film’s website that they explored the film before writing, but I believe that they forgot to turn to the original source of the BIBLE. I sat with two different versions of the Bible and could not find half of what happened or was said in this picture. As if they came up with something that was not in the Bible, and changed what was in the Bible, to what they thought the contemporary audience would want to see instead of the truth. Personally, I am too young to remember the Ten Commandments of the 1950s, but it could not be worse than that. I wrote to the network and can only hope that they publicly apologize for this parody.
