Without a doubt, one of the worst films ever made. Sluggish and without structure, tension or history, the film stands on the subtle premise of "making up a show." Conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their occurrence, and the dialogue is random and random. Everything is collected in a chaotic manner, and often “Exit” looks more like a movie with deleted scenes than in a real movie. The film seems to exist simply as a showcase for Lisa's tasteless and completely random musical numbers. Shelly Winters can be seen in the far superior octo-epic Tentacle, and REAL Lisa can be found in the Showtime release of Queer Duck: The Movie.
