An interesting slasher film with several suspects. <br /> <br /> Includes a sparkling bosom girl (Denise Cheshire) when she changes into a swimsuit, a creepy suspect - any one of them can do the act, expecting her breasts to be bare to get a passing score (Linnea Quigley) an unusual forward, more bare breasts, athletics competitions that will NOT be at the Summer Olympics, and a disgusting secret. <br /> <br /> It all comes to the end of the crash. No, that's not all. Will this guy die? I bet Ann (Patch MacKenzie) does not plan to visit houses anymore in the near future. <br /> <br /> If you like movies with bastards, can you be a pervert, even if all actresses are over 18?
