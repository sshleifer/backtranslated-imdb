So, this was done back in 1993. Directed by Robert Iskov and John John Meagles wrote that it should be based on a true story. It is hard to believe that someone can be so stupid and blind to the truth. Of course, from the very beginning it was obvious that this lady was after all that she could get. <br /> <br /> Tim Matheson, looking a little older than I remember him, was playing an empty-headed man who was seeking romance in his kind of boring and empty life. Well, it came to him in the spirit of Tracy Pollan, a somewhat vacant looking girl with perverted sex as a means to conquer her guys. <br /> <br /> C'mon, phone sex, even in the 90s was an old hat, I can not believe that someone will fall in love with this old line. But Mr. Matheson seems to have bought it. And it cost him a lot. <br /> <br /> The most difficult thing was when he finally threw the lady out of his apartment, put all her rubbish in the corridor (IN THE FRONT APARTMENT), and then had the folly not to change the locks. That's when I had enough of this banal film. It made me want to wish the lady to try it on me so that I could tell her with satisfaction that she would go hiking. <br /> <br /> I give this chestnut 1 out of 100. That's how bad I thought it was. I think you can't blame the actors. But they were terrible. Did they really try to play it with a cool face?
