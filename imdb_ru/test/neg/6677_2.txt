After eating “Human pork chop” and its proper digestion, I felt the need and the duty to inform potential viewers that chewing this product was NOT FUN and its content was of LOW nutritional value. <br /> <br /> According to the boring nature of this film, the next one will be WARNING, not REVIEW. This is the first time I wanted IMDB to have the “I don't care to rate this movie” button, because the only reaction to this boring part of TRASH is stagnation and indifference. Any possible rating would be unfair to all the other items listed here, in any case “10” is beyond doubt, “1” can convince some readers that this is one of those cases when “it’s so bad that in fact REALLY bad and it's a kyul! ", and" 5 "is also unsatisfactory, people might think that this is normal and normal, if you want to have fun, but this is not ... Honestly, God, this is also" 10 ", zero, no 5, this is nothing, black hole, FUTURE WORK PRESENTED BY EMBRYON. I bought a Region 3 DVD that was cheap (7 bucks !!!) at least with good image quality, I bought it mainly because of the positive and promising reviews posted below my own recording. Oh, boy, I must be disappointed. This film is neither shocking, nor disgusting, nor is it not ... he is not even ridiculous, he is not too serious to laugh at him, but still serious enough not to be comical. Truly impassive, amateur effort. The only sequence I discovered for MILDLY DISTURBING is when two giggling bandits put an ugly dog ​​in their bag and beat it against a brick wall ... but even such a cruel premise only leads to a bad execution. The further mentioned TOILET SCENE is unrealistic and filmed without any meaning for anxiety, suffering or humiliation - fecal They look like painted swamp ripeness !!! At the end of the more than 85-minute scene there is a slaughter where three men wearing plastic raincoats (a setup that can also be found on the cover of a DVD) begin to get rid of the female body. He reminded me of “American Psyche” and “The Small Grave”, now these films deserve to be watched and true masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Let's be REALISTIC this time, and not in a hurry to create myths from every Asian imitator, a horror film, as it seems to be happening recently ... <br /> <br /> If you looking for some oriental horror, try Danny Lee's masterpiece with the same (English) name "Ba Xian fan dian zhi ren rou" Human Pork Cho (Cha Shao Bao) since 1992 and - not without reason, I would add - compared to “Henry: a portrait of a serial killer.” There is also a similar film telling the same story by another film crew, “Ren tou dou fu shang” (“There is a secret in my soup”) from the same year It’s a competitive production. It is available in DVD format for Region 3 and, by most accounts, is superior to “Peng Shi Ji Sang Jin Tian Liang.” I could add a few more words about special effects ... what special effects?! ... there are several severed limbs, they look terrible - in the wrong sense - probably “Made in Hong Kong.” <Br /> <br /> This is all the information I can share on this subject, I hope it will be useful ... ENJOY YOUR FOOD!
