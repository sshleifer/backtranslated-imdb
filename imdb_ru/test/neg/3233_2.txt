Cory Heim will never be known as one of the great actors of his time, but at least in films like “Licensed To Drive”, he was more in his element ... low humor. <br /> <br /> The Observers book by Dina Kunz was one of his early works, and is still probably the best one to date. Unfortunately, this magnificent story of a brilliant dog, an abnormal mutant and a genetic experiment went wrong. The game is so lifeless that you might think that watching a movie about zombies. Only a dog gives a respectable performance, and if you want to watch a decent movie about a dog, you'd better watch “Incredible Journey”, “Cujo” or even “CHOMPS” ... well, maybe not “CHOMPS" <br /> <br /> If you read the book, avoid this film at all costs. If you have not read the book, read it and avoid this film. Thank you later. <br /> <br /> Somewhat better translation of the book by Dean Kunz is a capable thriller " Ghosts.
