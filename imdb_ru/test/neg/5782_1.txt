This film is absolutely horrible ... Definitely a stupid story and an even worse acting game. It is unfortunate that Charlie Sheen is involved in something like this, because he is a decent actor and made a couple of really good films. <br /> <br /> Special effects - standard 'A-team' for classic cars. fired, and then flipped over with a small fireball under the hood. <br /> <br /> Of course, enemies are portrayed as complete idiots and die as fast as they can say, “Die to evil Americans.” <br /> <br /> If you do not play movies about tramps, do not waste 113 minutes of your life on this garbage. Instead, take "Platoon" or "Apocalypse Now."
