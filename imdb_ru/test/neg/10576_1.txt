I took my 14 year old to watch this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely horrible! This film should be rated at least R. I am not so strict with films, but it was too much. It was a waste of money. I thought there would be some kind of comedy in it, and I knew that the comedy would probably be rough, but it was WAY to go raw. I sat there, watched and read (some of the subtitles at the beginning of the film were what really hit me), and I could not believe how rough it was sexually. I could not believe that it would be normal for a 13-year-old to read and see this content. I do not understand how the rating system works.
