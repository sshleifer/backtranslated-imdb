Bare Wench is another erotic parody of the Blair Witch project (I think there are about two dozen such things). He has 5 very attractive women (including Nikki Fritz, Julie Smith and Julie Strein) and one stupid boy whose sole purpose is to provide comic relief. <br /> <br /> Well, I thought: â€œCool. Great looking women who have erotic lesbian sex with each other for about 10 minutes or so. That should be very good. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the producers spoiled it. There is nothing in this video that could qualify as a sex scene. There are a couple of false starts, but most of the activities are only women posing for the camera. I think that once the producers have spent their money on women and spent more money to remove their clothes, they have no money left to forcing them to do something, and I believe that they also used all their allotted time for nudity too early, because by the end of the video there are a huge number of meaningless dialogues that are obviously used for no other reason than to calculate the runtime. "You're a liar! No, you! You go to the cave! No, you go! I think we should go home! Well, don't!" This goes on and on forever. <br /> <br /> There are better things than these.
