I love Lucy, but this film is so terribly bad that in the first ten minutes I was embarrassed by the embarrassment of all the parties involved. and it only got worse from there. The “singing” of Lucille Ball was completely painful, and the attempts to make her look younger with a soft focus made me reach for reading glasses. Such bombs give the bombs a bad name.
