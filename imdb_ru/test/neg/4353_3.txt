“The Big Knife”, a film about the dark side of a Hollywood film industry, ironically resembles a shot much more than the film itself. In addition to several very brief plot scenes, all the action takes place in the living room of the hero of the film, played by Jack Palance. He is a film actor who wants to withdraw from his contract with his studio due to the lack of redeeming qualities in the films they release. His wife again (again and again and again) (Ida Lupino) is also fed up with the studio, not to mention the fact that her husband loosened up. Unfortunately for both of them, the studio director (Rod Steiger) is a real bastard. He has blackmail to make the actor, who is increasingly tormented, sign a new contract. But it is only a matter of time when he will push a person too far. <br /> <br /> This film, I repeat, is NOT a film noir. Rather, it is exclusively theatrical melodrama in the living room. The plot develops at the speed of a snail and is so confused and confused that it is in cruel disharmony with a static setting and carefully thought-out blocking of real scenes. Acting is overly overwhelmed and fluctuates sharply between the histrionic and soft, but no less soft, monologues, which are obviously meant for sharpness, but look like pretentious chatter, especially in the hands of the sadly disguised Palance. Aldrich obviously tried his best for a stylized “something” here, but I doubt that even he knew what it was, and, of course, the public never knows. <br /> <br /> I think the main lesson here is that films and performances are very different environments. What could have worked in the play did not even seem remotely natural or believable in the film. Result? A big waste of time. Here is not enough to enjoy
