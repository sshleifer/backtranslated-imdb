I have been reading IMDb comments for a long time. The average 8.3 for this film just gets on my nerves. I don't want to pull out one of those bits "I just registered an account so that I could publish in this movie" ... but I just did. The only topic you’d come out of this film is that incest doesn’t deserve ridicule. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that many “hooliganism” films like this film; However, this is crap. What REALLY gets to me is that the director expects you to show sympathy for the "villain" in the film. If you have sex with a sister, you probably should be an outcast of society. Just my personal feelings, I think. Nevertheless, I spent 2 hours of this * curse *, waiting for some very deep discussion about the conclusion of Da-Su. <br /> <br /> I like many foreign films, but this is my first encounter with a Korean click, and this put them last in my book. Oh ... I feel better after a little ventilation.
