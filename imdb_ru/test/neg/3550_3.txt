It starts really interesting - the story unfolds around the protagonist, who runs the "cleaning business" specializing in cleaning crime scenes. Being a former policeman, he is faced with a strange situation, when one job suddenly “officially disappears”. In addition, he discovers some connection with the investigation of police corruption. His “Colombo sentiment” is justified, the deeper he sinks into the background of the story. Good actors (Jackson, Ed Harris, Eva Mendez) play a tense story with some twists and turns - but only until the last 25 minutes. (up here are 7 out of 10 stars). SPOILER :::: Suddenly, the film loses touch, and finally a completely unnecessary exchange of fire takes place, involving a 14-year-old daughter, betrayal of friendship and unjustified righteousness due to character development ... why not forcing Cutler to abandon the investigation for the sake of friendship? or when the daughter learns some facts? or ... many possible, much better endings of the story you can imagine ... a truly lost ending!
