This version of David Copperfield is terrible from beginning to end. I knew that we were waiting for the evening viewing in vain, when it was rather silly to such an embarrassment that Attenborough and Olivier considered him two villains. After that, everything was downhill. Aunt Betsy was adequate, but did not have any eccentric talent to which she was noticed. The worst of the worst was the choice of producer for Uriah. It was a version of this character in a music hall that Roland Young had previously and excellently played. And what was that all this fear immersed in yourself from David? Dickens must have rolled over in his grave to see his beloved child turn into a wimp who was crying in his beer. <br /> <br /> This was once Hollywood knew more than gay old England.
