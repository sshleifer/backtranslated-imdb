Fortunately, I watched this movie alone, which allowed me to quickly move to the worst scenes (in fact, this is a big part of the movie). Well, some of them are not all bad, with a partially good photograph (even some of the underwater scenes) and sometimes not too bad directing. But it still does not save the incredibly bad scenario and the worst game. In addition, when I do not find the "beauty" in the film, all this, even the scenes of sexual love that I want to drive, become boring. Really boring! And for drama: You know that this is always a bad sign when you don’t like all the characters so much that you really don’t care who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> If you still haven't gotten tired of the reality show Survivor, you might like something in this movie. If not, then be healthy!
