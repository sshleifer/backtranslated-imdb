You expect it to be underage, but at least you expect a full and coherent film. What a waste. I am extremely disappointed not only by watching a bad movie, but also by the fact that such a wonderful concept was spoiled by a regular movie that we all saw before. If this dirt earns 1 dollar beyond its budget, it will be advisable for the studio to declare victory, collect all the available copies, store them deep in the nuclear waste storage facility at Yucco Mountain, and then never make another film like this. Most of this movie will make you think: “This is not what I wanted to see.” This film appeals to unwise and possibly teenagers. This is a real shame, because most films are made for this demography. I had much higher hopes for this film.
