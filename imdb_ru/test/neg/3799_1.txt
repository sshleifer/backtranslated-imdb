An awkward catastrophe suggests that a scavenger team stumbled upon an inverted SS. Poseidon in the hope of plundering him before he disappears forever. The continuation of Irwin Allen to his blockbuster of 1972 "The Adventure of Poseidon" appeared in theaters after seven years! Never mind that no one cared anymore, why give us such a stupid play, filled with vague characters and actors who donâ€™t light events, only to destroy the memory of your biggest hit? In the end, one could apologize for Michael Kane, Sally Field, Peter Boyle, Jack Warden, Carl Malden and Shirley Jones, if not for their expressions of lostness at sea (good for a few random laughs). There is a moment when Saint Johns is tempted to take some treasures only for herself, and she timidly begins to fill her pockets, which is an unintended cry. The film was a career for all stakeholders, especially for Allen, who never recovered from this. * from ****
