I don't know why they even saved the name. How they could have called the series "Scarlet Pure Porn" after they had so strongly moved away from the novels, I have no idea. The names of the characters are the only thing they have saved, and even then they changed some of them, mixed them and changed Percyâ€™s relationship with them. Admittedly, I watched for a maximum of two hours, but that was enough for me to realize that the series was not at all like the way Baroness Orsi portrayed her characters and probably skated in her grave when airing was also filmed. Poor Lady I hope that when the next person wants to make a film / series of a book, he will not destroy it as much as this series.
