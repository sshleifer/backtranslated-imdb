Cameron Crowe's very strange script (following on the heels of “Fast Times at Ridgemont High”) is little inspiring and shrugs off silly jokes. At least, the Fast Times had a significant share of satire and sensitivity behind its farce (courtesy of good director Amy Heckerling and Crow's undeniable tendency to capture the perfect speech of a teenager); here Chris Penn (brother of Shona, of course) is a dumbass who turns life into hell for Eric Stolz's straight arrow, and the filmmakers seem to find it fun. Jenny Wright has a few good points as a mall worker, but Illan Mitchell-Smith got lost in a dizzying story about a teenager who seems to be carried away by a shocked former soldier. Sickening, embarrassed nonsense with a brilliant brilliance and soundtrack, full of pop-rock tunes, but characters that could have been avoided. Supporting players Leah Thompson, Rick Moranis, Lee Win and Sherilyn Fenn get lost in silly roles. * from ****
