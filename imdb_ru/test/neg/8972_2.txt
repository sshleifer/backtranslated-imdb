The pop star Grace Hayes plays in this obscure little movie. After several years of being on stage, she is going to visit a small college town to see how her son is raised by his grandfather. The child does not know who his mother is, and when she sees him at the local malt store, he is a jerk. Part of the problem is that he is a college clown, and the other is that he is really spoiled. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that it turns out that mom is really very rich and not only finances the life of her son, but also a hefty contributor to college. So she has an idea to make a young man grow up. She is talking to a man who educates Peter and completely deprived of his benefits - hoping that he will justify it. It also turns out that she puts the nuts on the school because she thinks that all these children need to stop playing and be more responsible. <br /> <br /> Now that's where it gets pretty dumb. To show that they know the price of hard work, she hires a group of them to sing and dance at the malt store she just bought. Talk about contrived! What happens next seems like a long and not particularly good talent show, or perhaps a version of Judy Garland / Mickey Rooney's musical for a poor man! I would advise the children to try to do something else to make money ... or maybe sing and dance until people pay them to stop! I know that I would pay them. <br /> <br /> Given that talent is far from talented, Peter is a bad actor, and his transition from boorish to responsible adult happens almost instantly, all this is quite difficult to accept. Not a very good movie by any normal standards, it’s an obscure film that should have been unclear! <br /> <br /> By the way, it’s interesting that the son of Mrs. Hayes in the film, Peter, is actually her real son. The only problem is that Peter Lind Hayes is a really terrible actor. He is not handsome enough to be a leading man, and he looks like boring and uninteresting or just nasty. In particular, all his stupid impressions are really bad, and he has the charisma of gelatin, which you scrape off from spam. Despite this terrible performance, he continued to have a fairly successful acting career. Who would have believed it if you saw him in ZIS BOOM BAH - because here he is as desirable as the Bubonic Plague!
