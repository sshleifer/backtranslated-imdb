I think that “category 6: the day of destruction” was very unreal. Digital effects, where, as a children's cartoon. <br /> <br /> Actors did not act realistically, for example, when a girl was shot, she acted as if they had thrown tomato sauce on her. <br /> <br /> The movie was boring, but I watched it because it was on. <br /> <br /> The only interesting character was Tommy Tornado, he was funny! <br /> <br /> Please keep the special effects real. <br /> <br /> I liked the comment: we made to piss off Mother Nature? "<br /> <br /> I don’t know what else to write to fill in 10 lines. What else can I say that the film is so boring, I think my comment will be just as boring.
