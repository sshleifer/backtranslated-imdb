In this terrible, scenic, boring festival-nap, there are no saving graces that reminds of “Ransom Of Red Chief”! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that there are several big stars in this film, acting is almost terribly awful. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, usually a laid-back guy, solves this problem with forced emotions. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed is so excited that it may seem funny. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nilsson is terribly wrong and terrible. <br /> <br /> Son of such a disgusting little child, I caught myself being sick for the kidnappers. <br /> <br /> The only decent performance in this mess is the relatively small role of the butler. <br /> <br /> Maybe I’m too cruel to the actors, after all, all they did was read the lines given to them in the script. Ah, the script, this dim piece of an invented tree, which I would like to stretch your heart strings, but just turn your belly.
