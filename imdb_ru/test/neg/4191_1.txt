Only by adding to the chorus people who consider it “non-repayable,” I state the following, without repeating the obvious FAULTS, clearly stated by some other commentators: “The film” was filmed (I don’t know what type of camera ”), but the operator all the time included him in the AUTOFOCUS mode (!), so any small movement forces him to enter and exit the focus. In many scenes, the actors themselves go beyond their scenes. That in itself is screaming "Amateur." <br /> <br /> I also noticed that in the "middle of the corn field" you can hear the sound of a gasoline generator that feeds the light ... loudly. /> <br /> Besides that with this one source of lighting that follows (and “leads” actors a lot of times) when they walk around. It looks like a speaker with that "on light" that follows others like a searchlight. There was no “credit” for lighting design / DP, and I know why. The “filmmakers” did not see the need for someone who really knew what they were doing to illuminate this picture (note that I did not say “film”). So get ready for ONE bright spotlights as the only source of “cinematic lighting” for most of the film. Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Usually it is so bad that you can laugh at it. It is so bad that you cannot see it. Plan the ninth from space "Citizen Kane" compared to this name.
