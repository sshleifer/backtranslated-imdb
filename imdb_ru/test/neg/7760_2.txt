Yes, I could not stop yawning, like my partner. Incredibly boring - 90 minutes seemed to stretch out at least until 3 o'clock - and I'm not even a fan of action films, but he just falls asleep on his feet - unless you're a fan of a 70's polo sweater! <br /> <br /> ** SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING ** If you expected ANYTHING to happen, do not hold your breath - this does not happen! <br /> <br /> But seriously, it does not convince at all or does not attract an observer. It seems like a long, boring and rather fragmented dream. Frederick swims through it, can leave work when he wants, and with attractive secretaries constantly bringing tea and messages. Obviously not real life! And an office with almost no paper or files is just a giant calendar so that you know that it actually takes 6 months to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> Frederick never seems to touch real emotions, like his wife and children behave like rag dolls - unlike in real life. Even Chloe, despite her strong looks, never gives the impression that she really feels something. The only 3 seconds of any real feelings arise between the couple, observed in the cafe, and have no relation to the plot. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe there are some moral considerations, but if this is entertainment, or even the good cinematography you are looking for, I think this film is incredibly overrated by most other viewers.
