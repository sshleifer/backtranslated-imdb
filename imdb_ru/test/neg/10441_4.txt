The recent release of Mad Dog Morgan on DVD with Troma is disappointing. It seems that it is a censorship imprint to watch on television. Some of the more violent scenes were edited, and parts of the colorful language were deleted. Anyone who watched an uncircumcised movie would be fucking angry at this toxic DVD version. "Mad Dog Morgan" deserves release on DVD in the original theatrical design. Nevertheless, even though the film was released on DVD, it is still one of the best images of the life of Bushrangers in 19th-century Australia. After a tour of the Old Melbourne Prison, where death masks of convicts are displayed, the Mad Dog Morgan comes to mind.
