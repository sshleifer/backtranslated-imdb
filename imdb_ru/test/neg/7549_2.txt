Being a HUGE fan of the bottom of the series, I was really looking forward to the release of this film. I was looking forward to laughing in a minute ride on a roller coaster ...... alas. <br /> <br /> Where to start with this mess? I think this is a good start to say that on our screens it can hardly be seen as Ridi and Eddy, because not one of the jokes and liners that they usually deliver so well is funny. after a good 20 minutes of watching. Many aspects of the story were pitiful, and it looked like the film was full of those bad moments that they rehearsed and decided to leave the final version. <br /> <br /> In general, the scenery and the atmosphere surrounding the film are dark and gloomy, which I think is good if they want to portray a “terrible” guest house where 2 jesters try to escape, but for me it’s just adds even more silencer to the sad state of filming, should never have been created. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the act of acting is pathetic. Fenella Fielding is wasted as crazy Mrs. F. Oxfur and I have seen that Simon Pegg is much better. <br /> <br /> I would recommend Guest House Paradiso to everyone who is blindly drunk, because they can appreciate horrible puns much more. I have not seen this film and is waiting for the true action of Richie and Eddie, about which you were warned
