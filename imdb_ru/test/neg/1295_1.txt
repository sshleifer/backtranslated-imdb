Avoid this movie. If you are expecting "The Adventures of Poseidon" (1972), you can experience only the case of "bends." This film offers no more than two extremely long and protracted hours of complete boredom. <br /> <br /> The cast members act as if they are outraged by the annoyance of the bath overflowing the bed. minor petunias. The script is absolutely unrealistic, and the film does not even look like a film about a catastrophe. In fact, everything in this film is bad, with the exception of Tom Courtney. Unfortunately, such a wonderful actor was swept away by the flow of distortion to appear in such a washout. When this film was shot, Poseidon must have turned over in his water grave in a sea of ​​shame. And Shelley Winters will rise from the dead again (straight from Poseidon) to chase anyone who dares to watch this pathetic movie. I rate this movie as 1 out of 10, but it really deserves zero. This film makes you want to avoid or completely turn away from the water. And it will leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth. It may even make you want to see Jaws (1975) and make friends with excellent white.
