This is probably the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen over 300 films in my entire life. It seems that the acting atrocities are the only bright spot that judges the anatomical mastery of female actors. After watching this film, it is suggested that the viewer does not drive heavy machinery or drive a car for at least 24 hours. A bottle of Valium is also recommended so that you do not feel so bad for 100 lost minutes of your life. The plot is nothing original, the dialogue is painful, and even the weapon seems to be of poor quality. Do yourself a favor, go to your local blockbuster and burn all copies of this terrible movie.
