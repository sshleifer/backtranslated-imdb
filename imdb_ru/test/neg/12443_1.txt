My mom brought me this DVD movie. The guy at the box office recommended it. But in fact, it could be the worst movie I've ever seen. You know, I did not expect much from this film, but he didn’t have a good story, it wasn’t even funny, and it was pointless. I was looking forward to meeting Kristina Lakin in this film, because I loved Step by Step. Even she was a huge disappointment. The story was completely unreal. One of the party people is dead (in fact, he was not dead, he woke up later), the house looks like a bomb exploded there, and there are 2 guys who have 3 hours to cope with everything. But then the homosexual comes, the policeman ... There is a complete mess to the end, and the guys managed to put everything in order in 15 minutes ??? Come on, just be realistic, at least. Waste of money. Indeed...
