Synopsis: the continuation of the famous book The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal is a budgetary production that is completely unable to deliver; Not only is he not as smart as his predecessor, it’s not even a spray, not a wait or a horror movie, it’s just a boring waste of time. Do not be fooled by advertising hype, especially stories about people who are thrown into the movies and who are psychologically traumatized to the end of their lives because of the brain-eating scene: in a movie, it just looks ridiculously bad SFX. Why do so many people on this forum declare that “not everything is bad” and “it’s worth watching on the big screen”, etc., I cannot do it; and it's not “so bad, it's good,” it's just boring. I usually respect the opinions of other people, but in this case I must say that they clearly cannot distinguish **** from Shine - Ola. They may have been the victim of a stir in the media, perhaps they had never seen Ridley Scott before and were impressed with his excessive use of lights, smoke and omnipresent AC fans. H is completely devoid of uncertainty; instead, we get endless scenes about Lecter wading through English-speaking Firenze, an absolutely unconvincing and clumsy plot with more holes than the fishing net (seeing H, I actually lay awake half the night trying to find all the holes in the plot and when I wrote them down I quickly filled out 6 pages in small print before forcing myself to stop). Instead of spending your time and money on watching it on the big screen, I would advise you to wait until it appears on television in a couple of years; and then go to bed early. <br /> <br /> 1/10. <br /> <br /> Below are a couple of extra bones that I have to choose with Hannibal: <br /> <br /> - H _is_ continued SOTL, despite that some people claim on this forum. And although SOTL was a very difficult act to follow, there are sequels that _are_ en along with their predecessors (SOTL itself was a continuation of Michael Mann’s “Manhunter” based on Thomas Harris’s “Red Dragon” and the first Episode was a very pleasant film, SOTL was even better, another example would be the series “Aliens”, initiated by director N. Ridley Scott - so much for the theory of decreasing sequels). In any case, the continuation of the film does not relieve from the fact that the film is complete nonsense. <br /> <br /> - There is a famous director in this film, it is based on the novel of the same author as SOTL, the cast is strictly List, excellent cinematography, big budget, first-class scriptwriters, yadda, yadda, yadda, and the final The result - just fart in the church. So what went wrong? I think most of the blame lies with the producer of the film, Dino De Laurentis. Here is my interpretation: DDL released Manhunter, which, despite all its qualities, was a commercial failure. Disappointed, he gave the rights to the character of Hannibal Lecter Orion - for free, allowing Jonathan Demme to do SOTL, and the rest is the history of the movie. Then DDL had to wait another ten years (now he is 81 years old) until Thomas Harris finally came up with the continuation of the novel. I think that at that moment DDL lost all interest in making a good movie and desperately tried to finally get his piece of cake before he tried his cork. <br /> <br /> - Another aspect that annoys me is this click - that it gets so much undeserved excitement in the media; I mean, this is boring, but still one of the highest-grossing production in the history, so there is no need to give him free advertising. And while most reviewers talk about how Dantesque's scenes in Firenze and why Jodie Foster did not participate, the simple fact that this film is a full, full, UTTER failure is not mentioned. But there is one more thing: Hannibal not only unwinds through the roof, but is also used as a media for many “documentaries” (usually remnants of similar productions after SOTL) about serial killers. Cannibalism and profiling. However, moreover, that H does not even claim to be realistic; Lecter also ceased to be a serial killer (he now kills only by necessity or to help Clarice Starling), profiling is not even mentioned (because we already know HL, so there is no need to create a profile), and there is also no cannibalism: Lecter is feeding the addict Paul Krendler with his own brain, so he does not know about the natural conditions - auto-cannibalism. Try making a documentary out of it. <br /> <br /> A lot has been said about acting: basically, can Julian Moore replace Jodie Foster, and Anthony Hopkins (who plays the lead role of Hannibal Lecter) usually give a lot of praise. I think all these discussions are controversial. There are several of my favorite actors in this film (namely Liotta, Oldman and Moore), but the script just doesn’t give them anything to do. The same goes for Hopkins: there is no development in his character, and he is in no way disputed. And, by the way, he plays almost identical characters in all his films, only in “H” he has to commit strange murders, and he is paid 11 million dollars for it.
