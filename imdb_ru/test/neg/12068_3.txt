Apparently, the author and director of this film-director right on DVD is a fan of Friday the thirteenth and other summer camps. This film has it all - a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend with fun, alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called "Blood Camp", an old man who warns them not to go there; and, of course, a crazy killer with a machete who for no reason continues to chop and chop teenagers ... Everything could have worked if it had been shot on a 35 mm film with acceptable special effects. But instead, the special effects are badly done. The killer walks as if he is walking on a Sunday afternoon, and the only good thing about this film is the actress of the talented main actress and the sex scene at the beginning. In addition to this - boring and forgettable. Jasper P. Morgan
