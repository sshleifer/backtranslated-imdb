I still remember when Frog Baseball first aired on MTV. In some strange, surreal way, the cartoon captured the silly deeds in which, I think, every boy growing up in America is involved. Now I'm cringing, thinking about how I burned a crippling grasshopper with a magnifying glass, but at the time it was interesting. for some reason. Growing up in the 1980s, we all knew the "stoners." These were the children who wore Iron Maiden T-shirts to school, grew their hair, had an immature mustache and were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they filled up a class or two. We laughed at them because they were so stupid even when they were not stoned. Therefore, it was easy to understand Beavis & Co, because we already knew them, some of us were even them. To the extent that such GenX as I would have rejected the excess of the 1980s and accepted the grunge movement of the 90s, Beavis & Co was for us a kind of strange postmodern anthem. Strange, because, like Beavis & Co, we didnâ€™t care if we had a hymn. It was just an internal joke, which we all immediately understood, even if it was terrible.
