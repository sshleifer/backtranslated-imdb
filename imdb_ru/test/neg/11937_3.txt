I had high hopes for this film when I saw the list and decided to watch it on TV without interrupting the commercial breaks. I liked Lee Van Cleef in many films, but I’m afraid that when other characters call him Chris, he doesn’t even turn into a reasonable facsimile of Chris Yul Brenner. <br /> <br /> I found this film was a complete disappointment - the musical soundtrack tried to convey the splendor displayed in the original, but it also could not bring the film to the level of the original. The rich textures of the characters in the original were largely absent from this movie. I think if you had not seen the original, it would be good. Too many cliches and too little depth for the characters. I missed humanity and compassion and three-dimensional characters of the original.
