I can't understand how lazy the director is in this film. Instead of creating scenes creatively, he relies on boring old zombie clich√©s. <br /> <br /> When two unarmed heroes have to go down the steps of the college into a van, he is surrounded by their zombies, but none of them leads. bitten He cannot be bothered to manage a decent fight scene, so we see the movers pushing down the steps. <br /> <br /> Sometimes zombies are lame, and in others they run like the wind. This is really convenient for the director, because he can create everything he likes without worrying about the continuity in the behavior of zombies. <br /> <br /> With careful planning and great inspiration, this film could be much better
