I watched this film about thirty years ago, and I still remember it. When I stumbled upon this on a DVD, I did not hesitate too long, even more, because I have a tendency to Belmondo's early clicks. But what an unpleasant surprise! Some films should be allowed to give up the public show, save a certain memory and not shock the audience. <br /> <br /> Widely welcomed as one of the rare cynical works of Chabrol, the only indelible impression I received from watching this ... boredom. Some films really do not age in style. But what about films in which there was no sense of style at all? <br /> <br /> Scenario flaws, not inspiring acting - presumably due to lack of direction - a kind of production design that doesn’t deserve its name, less than a mediocre photo and, equally important, the worst editing which I have seen in recent years makes this work really difficult. <br /> <br /> I got the impression that there was a group of people who had too much money and equipment, but obviously they didn’t have any ideas or skills. It is truly amazing that this one has not finished Chabrol’s career. Do not blame him in the general bad taste of the 70s, this shit itself is a worthy contender for the most useless celluloid losses.
