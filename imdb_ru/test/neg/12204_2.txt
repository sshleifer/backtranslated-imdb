Did someone find the plot somewhere in the movie? Perhaps this is missed in this pretentious cinema-movie exercise. It is quite surprising that Gordon says that “a film without a plot is nothing” ... It is possible that characters can say more than Wim Wenders. Was this phrase in the original plot or did the actor decide to send a hint to the director?
