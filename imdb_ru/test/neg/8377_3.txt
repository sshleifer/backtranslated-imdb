This film looked funny on the cover, and I honestly thought: “How can this be bad?” Little did I know. The dialogue was outside the gate. It was invented, unreal and not even interesting. Dialogue on syndicated UPN television shows sounds more natural. The story was implausible and at the end was almost zero playoffs. The end with the snake is almost confusing and seemed staged. The only remotely interesting character is Rose McGowan, who is mute, which does not allow her to be spoiled by dialogue garbage (well, at least to the end, even when she should speak). The only thing that even gives it 3 over 1 or 2 is the naked scene of Rose McGowan. Really terrible. Rid yourself of unnecessary trouble and rent something more interesting, such as Barney's video.
