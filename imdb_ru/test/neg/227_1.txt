I only saw it because my 10-year-old was bored. He and his friend hated it, but of course they loved being in the movies. This is the first time I have categorically disagreed with Ebert over many years. There is not one thing to recommend this film. Willis is good, as always. But the story stinks, it's unbelievable, there is no real story, no action, no interesting cinematic episodes, no surprises, and, worst of all, the children's star is a completely repulsive slug that has guaranteed to turn off any parent who does not have two fat slut for a child. By all means, stay away and spare your child - unless you want to punish him or her. There is no excuse for this lousy director or composition, and one can hope that these directors will suffer accordingly.
