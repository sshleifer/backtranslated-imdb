Although I rarely flew on an airplane myself, I am very interested in aviation ... and this film added a priceless ridicule in aviation cinema. <br /> <br /> 1. Why does the captain conduct ground checks? Why does he even measure the oil level in engines? Considering that the time taken to complete an order in commercial aviation is only 15 minutes, this is not a typical pre-flight check. <br /> <br /> 2. WHY is the captain hitting the plane's tire? Strange kind of pressure check. Or anger management :-) <br /> <br /> 3. In the cockpit 3 people. All large Western twin-engine aircraft built since the 1980s have a crew of 2 people. Now try to guess how old the movie's scenario is. <br /> <br /> 4. The helicopter has time to fly next to the crippled airliner. It must be quick ... and the words of the captain, in order to explain to the passengers a "maneuver", are really funny! <br /> <br /> 5. When the elevators are arrested, you can always lower the nose of the aircraft. This happens, for example, when any aircraft moves slower than the stall speed. <br /> <br /> 6. The rudder of the elevator has hydraulic actuators. After a collision with a business plane, he would most likely tear off the hydraulic lines and thus make them useless for control, but would NOT install them in a certain position. <br /> <br /> 7. Fire in the feed galley is a stupid idea. Was it designed to show that only gentlemen ask for a fire extinguisher and fight fire, regardless of who was actually trained to do it ?? stewardess. <br /> <br /> 8. At the time of the collision the elevators of the aircraft would be in a neutral position. The film could end here ... <br /> <br /> 9. The flight engineer (the third person in the cabin) has three stripes on the form. In fact, flight engineers have two. <br /> <br /> 10. Why does the captain chop the cabin body with an ax to examine the damage behind? I thought it would be the responsibility of the flight engineer, since he should already perform technical checks before and after the flight. <br /> <br /> 11. There is no unused space in any aircraft. At the very least, commercial aircraft cannot afford the luxury of a coupe that can be filled with tons of water. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on ... but, finally, I laughed hysterically at how the screenwriters present plane crashes! Woooohooo! Most aviation accidents occur in such a short amount of time that you simply cannot make 90 minutes of them. But you can always fill 90 minutes with stunning and insane crap, regardless of the genre.
