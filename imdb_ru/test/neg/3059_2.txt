By the time this film was released in 1996, director Mark Lester had been making small and poignant little action films for over 20 years. He was in charge of the great "female stoppers" from the 70s and several other small pearls; unfortunately, he is also responsible for this dirt. It's a shame to see the talented - and still hot - Teresa Russell, who again lost her gift, but she is still the best actor in this film. Eric Roberts appears for a while, does his work by Eric Roberts, and then leaves, which is a very undesirable phenomenon in the picture with Eric Roberts in it. Frank Stallone is actually quite good, which should give you an idea of ​​how truly pathetic this picture is. As mentioned by other reviewers, action scenes - this is the reason why such a picture is first of all - almost completely illogical and unrealistic, and also somewhat irrelevant. Except for some kind of vintage clothing and a few old cars, in the 1930s, in the era when this film begins, there is no feeling. A script with numbers with annoying errors in logic and little historical accuracy is certainly not a documentary, but the filmmakers might have at least TRIED for a little authenticity - and performances that range from class B to Elementary school send this cheap little joke on Sunday at 4:00 on the HBO channel, where I saw him.
