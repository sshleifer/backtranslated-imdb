I have very little to add to the fact that all other reviewers have already made more than clear! This movie is terrible! In addition to the terrible ... In fact, so unbearable that they have yet to come up with a term describing the terrible "Skeleton". If you expect your films to contain a minimum of logic and plot, you should stay away from it as far as humanly possible. Of course, a lot of people die from this skeleton-puppet in a ridiculous cape, but no one ever bothers to correctly explain who he is, where he is from or why he is so angry with the world. He is similar to the intersection of the Skeleton from the “Masters of the Universe” and the rider from the “Sleepy Hollow” and is frantic in some desert forgotten by God. The Skeleton parameter is another aspect with a full delay! For almost half an hour, I assumed that the film took place on a small isolated island, but it just plays on the mainland, where bizarre highways pass through the forest, and at the end of the forest there are power stations! BUT? Why does everyone pretend to be trapped when there is a million escape routes? In any case, after a pair of completely random murders, a special commando squad, led by poor, washed Michael Rucker, arrives to come and hunt a monster that they know nothing about. It's really fun, as each member of this team presents himself as an expert in a certain field (we have a sniper specialist, a genius investigator, an instructor for training ...), but they ALL die before any of them can demonstrate their alleged mastery skills! The gods of horror must really hate Casper Van Dien, as he is present again, portraying a heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason, falls on the highway, but somehow catapults back into the middle of the forest to die there. That's right, it makes sense ... In addition, the characters are stealing steep one-liners from the Predator, the stupid horse constantly changes color, helicopters are knocked down with a bow and arrows, regular bullets cause tree explosions and completely senseless memories of Vietnam are pursuing Michael Rucker that we all join forces and vote for this pitiful click in the bottom 100 best IMDb as soon as possible!
