It is a shame for the name of the whole saga of the beloved and the laughter of the Nibblers. Why do writers feel the need to make the film unbearable to view on all quality standards. Critters, as always, are sweet and adorable, but the deadly behavior turned into a murderous child. They are not so terrible, terrible, some of which scare the spine and are ridiculous, as they were portrayed in the movie before. I used to love their porcupine shots, but now it is hidden, as if it was considered repetitive and boring. And what about the murder, and not with food. I thought this movie would be cool, but everything was so wrong. Why should Ug be angry and killed by what is known as Charlie. This movie makes me sick. A shame! A shame! DISGRAAAAAAACE !!!!
