I have to admit, I was against this film from the very beginning, but I tried my best to be impartial, I really did it, but the very idea of ​​remaking the complex, witty, interesting, bizarre British classics, full of character, must be dubious of Initially. <br /> <br /> People in my house watched this, so I swallowed my pride and told myself to be professional with films (after all, I studied them at Uni). <br /> <br /> As expected for an American film of this kind, the film began with a chase, which was not bad. Indeed, many of the sequences of actions are credible, and this in itself raises the trail. <br /> <br /> However, the characterization was terrible, the plots could be easily combined with any American blockbuster that you could have the misfortune to watch, and it lacked the entire character. <br /> <br /> It seems that the original robbery failed in the original skewed film, which does the predictable thing and introduces the emotional factor in connection with the death of Donald. Sutherland's character. This gives our cousins ​​in the United States plenty of opportunities for hypocritical, tall eyes, seeking revenge against the "villains", which he milks to predictable excesses. This is never as obvious as in the scenes with Charlize Theron (oh, pretty! Oh, pretty! Look at her cute, wounded eyes of Bambi, everyone!), Who were completely nauseous. Her opening scene, in particular, looked like something from Resident Evil or Tomb Raider, which were both a) more interesting and b) had a better start because they couldn’t ruin the game as they could with the British cinema, which sparks have already been filled, people you really feel something and moments of inspiration. But I digress, the very mention of a pretty girl just seems to me the most maneuverable maneuver I've ever seen, and exposes a cynical Hollywood passion for passionate desire. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you like any of these actors, and you agree with any of the above comments, DON'T GO TO SEE THIS FILM! If I had the opportunity to watch Fight Club or American History X after I saw Ed Norton in this, I would refuse. Similarly, Jason Statham with Lock Stock (and I think that Transporter is fine if you like these things). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all kits are designed as transparently as possible so that you think, “Wow! He is smart! "," Ku! He is cool! "," Hey! What a cool guy! Then there is the “funny computer guy,” whose “comic relief” spilled onto his forehead, but whose humorous content can be foreseen in two minutes. To be honest, if you saw one or two of these films, you can easily confuse them with clones from Jerry Bruckheimer’s stable. Not that Jerry, by the way, is terribly awful, but he just uses clichés to make it all in abundance, as everyone knows (or should). <br /> <br /> This is where I should come clean. I didn’t manage to make it to the end, so I couldn’t even tell if there was a brilliant ending in Michael Kane’s version, but, sorry, this is just one of those extremely rare films that if I’d see it in the movies, I would go out and make a small protest on the street. It's not just that this is another one identical to the number of “Ocean” 14 or something like that (“Eleven Ocean” was good, but don't worry about the rest!) With all the heroes of brilliance, glamor, fake fool and pantomime such a movie, but I did not recognize anything at all from the original. <br /> <br /> So, if you are expecting “Italian work” and not “OCEAN 14”, although poorly written with a less well-established composition and characters, some insincere elements and cardboard cut out the writing script, then DO NOT LOOK! I don’t mind people who like a little thoughtless fun, but this is a criminal ax work that doesn’t deserve any way to flaunt itself under the name of a classic. Seriously, show pride! I felt completely justified in my indignant and disgusting reaction when I first heard that the film would be shot. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> P.S. Some action sequences are not bad at all, so add an extra “1” to the mark if you like such things.
