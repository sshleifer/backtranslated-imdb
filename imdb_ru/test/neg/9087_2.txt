Whoever compared this to the “Runners of the Lost Ark,” he knew exactly what he was talking about. He may also have compared this with some subsequent adventures of the pulp heroes. “Kay Hug” is reminiscent of Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (Shadow, the typical mysterious man - and the very first "Dark Knight" - was also considered one Kent Allard. If you take Savage's name first and add Kent to it, you end up with ... Clark Kent. Funny, isn't it?) Indiana Jones, Hugh is not against the abduction of artifacts of ancient civilization (although his thefts are often more glaring and less “charmingly fraudulent” than Jones). Unfortunately, these are two participants far from the subsequent series (from any era) in terms of overall quality. One of the first signs that something is wrong with the cinematic telling of stories is the scene in which the desperate riders, literally breathing into his neck, just watch Hug burst from his paws in a balloon. Why they did not bother to shoot down a balloon - this is just one of many mysteries in the movie that pursue these two films. <br /> <br /> The second half of this two-part film is even worse than the first. Of course, it was one of the first TV shows ever created, and therefore it should be slightly relaxed, but there are limits, even acceptable ones. (At some point, the capture of the hero does not occur on the screen, but in the narrative itself! Let's talk about cutting corners ...) Fritz Lang, it turns out, is one of the greatest directors who ever created films; Unfortunately, for those of us who admire most of what he did, Spiders is a bitter pill that can be swallowed ...
