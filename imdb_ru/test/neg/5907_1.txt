This film is not funny at all to me, and I would think that it is rather offensive for the Jewish people. (and I'm not Jewish) Why? First, the entire film portrays Zuckerâ€™s protagonist as a cheater / fraudster managing dubious deals and deals, while his son is gay, his daughter is a lesbian, and his niece is a slut. Then an incestuous relationship takes place in the family: first his daughter with Joshua and Jana, and then his son with his niece. Two incestuous family relationships. I am surprised that they did not add a story about the presence of mentally retarded people in the family ... Now, this would really complete the Nazi subhuman ideal! (gay, lesbian, Jewish ...) <br /> <br /> Absolutely disgusting film. I am surprised that this film did not receive a response from any Jewish community.
