I don’t know if I hate this film as much as when I watched it two weeks ago, but if you are expecting the events described on the box, forget about it ... it would be a good movie. The great descent described on the box is nothing compared to how I descended in total despair, which I took while watching this film. If you have seen “Recognition of a taxi in HBO”, this is the same, only fictional, and even remotely not so interesting. If you really want to see something interesting about a taxi driver, check out the 20-minute short record they do for an encore from time to time ... really worth seeing. I never, never asked for a refund for the film until I saw this ... thing. Boring, boring, boring. It offers one unique trait, which is this: it leaves you to decide what happens to each of the passengers, allowing your imagination to fill in the gaps. What would be great if you really cared for any of these people. Instead, I found myself screaming at the screen, crying like a child, praying for the end of the film or my own death. The taxi driver himself (although well thought out) runs through emotions that, it would seem, at random, from sarcastic to sympathetic, to violently mad and indifferent. Sometimes it is appropriate, in most cases it is just a demonstration for its own sake. “Gosh, I studied all these emotions in the acting class, and I'm going to use them!” Now that I think about it again, I hate this film as much as I do!
