If someone thinks this is a great sports film, this is probably the only sports film they have ever seen. Sports films have different aspects. Whether professional or college or high school. Examples of sports films that I liked (and I did not see many) are Jim Thorpe: “All Americans”, “All the right moves”, “Every Sunday”, “Eight Men” and “Rocky” and others. All of these films were little more than sport. Whether it is a person’s ascent, and then a descent from greatness, or a person who loses a dream because of the actions of a vengeful coach, or the influence of money on professional sports. There is not much content in Hoosiers. It did not even seem that the film has a beginning or an end. There was no development of character, they were all imposed on us. I could sum up this movie by quoting a very bad coach: “Go out and try to score more points than the other guy.”
