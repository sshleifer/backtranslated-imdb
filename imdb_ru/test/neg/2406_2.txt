This film is worse than Cat People, which I saw during the same week. In her all the 80s. MTV's punk rockers are real, not tuned to social networks, not real commercial PC users, boy fans and a bad guy named Splater. I really like Splater, and the film creates a feeling of blue lighting from the 80s, but the rest of it looks like a low-budget Canadian gibberish. I saw a lot of it while living in this great country, and I understand that films of this type were made because of tax breaks. Avoid at all costs.
