I saw this movie today on the big screen, and I can honestly not believe some of the comments made by people here. I really hoped that this film would be touched by me, but it is not. <br /> <br /> I’m a former Australian army and I’m very patriotic in this great country, but I feel that this film doesn’t do justice to us and those soldiers who fought in this battle. <br /> <br /> The film is poorly filmed. I thought the actions were terrible, they were not believable, and they gave me no reason to take care of them. People say that this film was graphic, there were several graphic scenes, but I found most of them very weak. The scenes of the war were very short and lasted only a couple of minutes. <br /> <br /> In general, a weak film that does not give these soldiers any justice.
