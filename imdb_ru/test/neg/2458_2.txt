After watching this movie, I left with a conscience. The film itself has a rather intriguing plot line and premise for it, but unfortunately, this is a film that you cannot watch from outside the bombing with pornography. If you plan to view this and you have a moral problem with the deterioration of the marriage act for the pleasure of viewing the audience, then you are making a big mistake. This is not the type of movie with a sex scene that you can skip on your DVD player. At the beginning of the film, the character Baldwin takes video of his sexual exploits without the knowledge of his partner. This tape and other similar videos continue to appear in the film at unpredictable times. It seems that the film is trying to make a statement about the dignity of a woman. Ironically, they turned many women into prostitutes. I gave him only 2 instead of 1, because if they had coped with Baldwin's debauchery better, it would be an interesting film.
