This is a terrific show, and we enjoyed it completely. While in Alaska, I disagree with homosexual content on today's show. I feel that you are too insistent to deliver New York to Alaska. It's one thing for a New Yorker to fight wild Alaska, but try to turn Alaska into New York? This is a good show about graceful women and real men of Alaska, and bringing a same-sex couple into a mix breaks the balance. Alaska should be portrayed as a man, and New York - as a woman. I think the first 9 shows have the perfect balance with what you all do. Can't we have a good show without an imbalance of nature.
