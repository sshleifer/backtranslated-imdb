Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. The man who made this film probably never learned not to shoot in a bright light. You can not see anything in this film. This is the way to the dark. Parts where you can see something that the camera is pointing directly at the light source, so that you get a big lens flare. So you still can not see. This film was supposed to be a radio show or something else. Some parts of the film are actually edited upside down for some kind of crap effect. Low budget movies can be done much better than that. And the low budget does not justify it. The editor had to say something when he started editing and saw that you did not see anything. Maybe the creators had to spend some of their low budget on the preview monitor so they could see what they were shooting. The only good thing is that this film is so dark that you can't see the horrible game. It also covers a crappy SFX. People in beginner film schools make better films than this. Movies shot with handy cameras look better than this.
