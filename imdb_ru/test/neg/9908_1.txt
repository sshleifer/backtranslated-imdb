What I hate most about this rubbish is the arrogant attitude of the filmmakers and network directors who impose this nonsense on the public, because they really think that the public is so stupid, so unworthy, so tasteless, that it deserves such minuses. This is inherent entertainment — watching disaster films, and using the magic of today's CGI effects, artists get powerful tools to explore what was previously forbidden to them. With this charm, we sat down to watch the chaos and destruction. Well, guess what, the only chaos that we saw was in advertising advertising the next Wednesday episode. What a let down! But wait, there was even more. The script itself was a big disaster! And then there was leadership and sluggish action by everyone involved in this turkey. But did we know it before right ?! We knew that the effects themselves were not entertainment, but still the network jesters who approved this television film didn’t care about it, because in their mantra the eternal line "never underestimate how stupid the viewers are." These guys really have to live under this motto, and I'm fed up with it. It is not surprising that viewers massively abandoned American drama and set up their camp on a reality show. at least in those programs, no one tries to make it look like anything else than this: intellectual pornography. Well, category 6 is worse than the one, because it must be different and "original." Yes, it was a disaster film, but disasters are not what they advertised!
