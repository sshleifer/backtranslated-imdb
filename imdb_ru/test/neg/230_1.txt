Bruce Willis, as usual, does an excellent job. <br /> <br /> [Warning: can be considered a "spoiler"] <br /> <br /> Although my friend thought it was good, I kept looking at my watch throughout the film wondering when it would end. After watching such great films as The Patriot and The Chicken Run, I was very disappointed in Disney's The Child. <br /> <br /> Willis plays a middle-aged man with a sharp and realistic attitude to the production of the film. positive impact on the images of people (he is an image consultant). An unknown child appears. Yes, it is he, but younger, and even Lily Tomlin sees him. At this moment, I recall something in between a poor episode of "The Quantum Leap" and an unfortunate travel film. <br /> <br /> Kidd and Willis are trying to understand why he is in this period of time. They understand it. They meet Willis when he gets older. It does not matter that he will never be told in detail how many years Willis teleports them between periods of time and brings them together for a start, how he got this knowledge for a start, how he came to realize that he needed to do it, and so on . <br /> In fact, this is a very tired, unoriginal, boring plot, in which there are several prominent actors. The good news is that the actor "The Kid" is not so annoying as he is presented in trailers on television.
