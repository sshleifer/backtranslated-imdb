Summing up this film, this LaBute transfers its sadism to the comedic farce. The predictable result is that he constantly attacks all jokes, insisting on surrounding them with bloody violence and extremely hateful characters. There is also evidence of his constant attempts to insult and make fun of everything that can be seen, but then apologize for it with weak gestures on the PC. In fact, the film simply does not work, its plot is confused, the characters are one-dimensional cliches, there is no consistency or development of something, and comedy (where it is not completely out of place) is the worst kind of High Concept drivel. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman and Renee Zellweger completely waste time on characters that look like parodies of studio audience indulgence - despite everything, make them cute, neutral (and neutered) and full of moral platitudes. Crispin Glover is here long enough to convince you that he is no longer in a movie. Chris Rock is in fact negative about fellow hired assassin Freeman - as if they were acting in different rooms, even if they were two inches apart. In essence, Chris Rock looks like a digital insert. At least he's not as annoying as Jar-Jar. <br /> <br /> By 15 minutes Labuta may well come up. Looks like he has delayed his appointment.
