Taran Adarsh, a well-known critic, praised such a duplicate film. <br /> <br /> There is a strange story in the film in which the lover sells his love to a brothel, because he wants money to save his mother, and then he receives forgiveness for it. LOL <br /> A crappy movie <br /> <br /> The entire first episode is dedicated to a novel, a comedy that does not work. Turns are shocking, but the whole second half is a mess, and the climax is a cliche <br /> <br /> Director Aditya Datt is a bad one. The music is typical Himesh. <br /> <br /> Emraan performs well his serious role, but his wardrobe, his way of walking through the songs. etc. similar to his previous films. Gita Bhasra annoys Ashmit Patel, but cannot convince himself that this actor is good at KILLING until now, and then on the descent with Mithun for a while on the screen, and he is fine, but his gap in the song makes Ranjit be fine
