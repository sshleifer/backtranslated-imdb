If you have not read Tolkien's masterpiece; Get ready for perhaps the best movie experience! However, if you have ... Having read the books several times, over the years I have loved the characters and the story and feel that I know it deeply. I have my own vision of Shire, Hobbiton and character galleries. Thus, for me, the film was a disappointment. What for? He dictates the appearance of the characters (inevitably), changes events, deletes an important storyline, removes a not so important storyline. Huge chunks of what the Lord of the Rings does what he is are simply ignored. Even the special effects of 2001 cannot justify Tolkien’s imagination (and your own). Peter Jackson made an honest attempt at the impossible, and I don't think anyone else could have done it better! But the fact remains, I regret that I watched the movie. The next time I read The Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson’s limited vision will take the lead, not my own.
