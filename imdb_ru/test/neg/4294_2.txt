“Igo on me” is undoubtedly the most controversial film in the 23 years of Stooges shorts. The reason is clear; By today's standards, this film can be considered racist. For this reason, it is rarely shown, if ever, on TV. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that the Japanese who were seen in the film were not soldiers; they were Japanese Americans sent to a relocation center during World War II. They were treated and shown as an evil enemy in this film. By consensus, including the US government, which offered apologies and reparations in the 1980s, Japanese Americans were as committed and hardworking as any American during World War II. Their imprisonment at this time is a dark spot in American history. <br /> <br /> There are a few Rick laughs in this film, but memories of how Japanese Americans were treated at this time spoil the value of the entertainment. Let's not confuse loyal Japanese Americans with their portrayal of villains in this movie. The loyal Japanese-Americans and the evil empire of Japan during the Second World War are not synonymous. 2 out of 10.
