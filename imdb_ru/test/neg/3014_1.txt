Having seen this show several times; As a woman, I was offended that there are so many stupid women who fall in love with this nonsense. I'm a little more mature than some of the “players” on this show, but I'm still shocked that the whole date game comes down to a game show: where stupid guys can score points on their unsuccessful attempts to catch chickens. If young guys are watching this and using it as a teaching tool: no need !!! Save power and hire a prostitute if all you need is a piece of ass. Maybe there are girls with the same mindset, but some, I don’t think so.
