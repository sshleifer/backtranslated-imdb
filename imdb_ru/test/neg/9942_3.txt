This is one of many attempts by the United States to remake the old classic British television show, more famous than that. From what I see, none of you mentioned, or even acknowledged, that you knew about the existence of the 50s-60s TV set called “Secret Agent”. Initially, the Secret Agent "Man" appeared in the role of the great Patrick McGuan ("Prisoner, Braveheart", "Zebra Ice Station", Ghost, etc.) The man who was named the first James Bond, but he refused it because MacGuhan he was a very devout man, and he considered James Bond’s jumping bed and violent ways to contradict his values. <br /> This show was made in black and white, and pity those who have not seen it, you miss a lot. The character that Mr. McGoogan played in The Secret Agent was called Drake, and after he finished the show, he began creating a very popular, though sometimes strange and controversial series called “The Prisoner”. The character he played in “The Prisoner” was an agent, whose identity was not disclosed, was abducted and taken to the island, where he does not know where he is or who is at fault for his abduction. What he knows is that his captors want to know the reasons for his resignation from the British secret service, and on this island the population has no names, but they are marked with numbers, and Patrick’s character is assigned a number that is “6“ It was alleged that his character “Prisoner” was in fact the same character he played in the “Secret Agent”, but McGuhan himself disputed this. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is the unmistakable theme that the original Secret Agent “Man” spawned It was written by Johnny Rivers, a famous pop musician of the 50s and 60s. And from what I've read, some of you actually think this song comes from this version of the show. You are very wrong about that. It was Johnny, and it comes from the original series, so let me help you correct the facts. For those of you who complained about the stupidity of the name of the show, well, in England it was actually called “Man-Danger,” and in the US it was called the “Secret Agent.” For such an allegedly silly name, the show went quite well. when it was first shown. <br /> <br /> Of course, the current show has nothing to do with the original, there is no such main character in this film called Drake, and I believe that they did everything possible to make this show have its version. "Secret Agent Man." But he uses a reworked version of the original theme of the song, so this suggests that this show really needs to be reworked, although it is inferior to the reworked version of the original series.
