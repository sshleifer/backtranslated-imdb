With my two stars, I will probably make it the head of IMDb "hated it" - a list for this seemingly extremely popular television series. <br /> <br /> Last but not least because of the enthusiastic comments on this site, I decided to buy a DVD series. Because I usually find British humor quite satisfactory. I gave up in the middle of the second release, and according to other comments, the “funniest” bits were already finished. /> <br /> So now I know, according to another commentary, that I definitely lack a sense of humor. But then I had to laugh like crazy, watching (and re-watching) Fawlty Towers, for which Black Books ?? albeit weakly ?? thematically related. Why different reactions? It may just be a generation thing, but you can still point out differences. <br /> <br /> Fawlty Towers and Black Books are made for a business that is designed to support its owners financially. Both businesses are not successful, but they seem ?? miracle ?? to survive. Fawlty Towers is fun because the main characters have to deal with situations that they cannot cope with. The fun is that they make a serious effort to succeed, and, laughing, they are also sorry. There are no situations in the "Black Books", they simply exist, and the owner spends time, feel sorry for himself. If the situation threatens to arise, it is quickly driven off. It's amazing how quickly and how often the subject is shot, and the main characters turn to something completely different to produce an extra joke. Tell jokes ?? and not so good - it seems that all black books are about. Why a bookstore? A hardware store would do this job in the same way. <br /> <br /> No, stop, wait. This is a bookstore, because under rudeness, vulgarity and arrogance, the main characters must be delicate and CULTURAL. They are not some stunted gorillas, but clumsy semi-intellectual losers. Hey, they are just like you and me. The way the series claims this is the only way to explain its success. In the actions of the main character there is nothing remarkable that is special about them lies in their economically unrealistic living conditions, which many viewers may envy. The main characters of that time, in which the First World currently lives, are the main characters, who, from narcissistic and senseless, express a sense of belonging and friendship, I found it incredibly funny. Is it often rather tasteless or xenophobic? but always with a goal and hit the bull's eye in his social criticism. Humor is mainly created by situations or characters with a purpose. The low ratings in IMDb may indicate that this brand of humor does not match the time, but I am glad that it is still alive and well, and I hope that this will continue.
