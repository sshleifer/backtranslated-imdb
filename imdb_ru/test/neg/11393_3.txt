This film caused concern not because of the subject, but because of how it was treated. An overweight mom (Angela) didn't even get on the cover of a videotape, like most other actors. This is unfair, but is itself a statement. I also noticed that her picture is missing in IMDb (perhaps by her own choice), and it looks like this is her only film? The language in this film was unprocessed. I watched with my 10-year-old son, because in Canada he was rated as PG, and the language sounded from their lips was shameful and disgusting. She never appreciated Shirley MacLaine like so many others. <br /> <br /> LOVE by Kathy Bates and always will be. Sineze's involvement was annoying. <br /> <br /> Little boy Alex is a great little actor. I have to see what else he was lately ..
