I was shocked to read all these wonderful comments about this film because I hated it. I laid it out to the end, but it was painful - especially the need to listen to that child’s voice. As Socact-1 noted, despite the fact that the girl claimed that she was from Chicago, she did not have a Chicago accent - it looks more like she tried to imitate a New York accent - but she didn’t work either. I was so confused that I was waiting for the raisin. Of all the wonderful actors who could have played this child, why did they choose this? And why make her say that? It was not even just an accent, it was a script, a monologue created for her. The reason I even chose this film was that I liked the idea of ​​the plot — this era in history, the type of poor and uneducated characters, the setting — and the love triangle. As I understand it, this could and should have been much better. I was just relieved to read that at least one more person felt the same as me in relation to this film.
