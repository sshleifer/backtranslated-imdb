Oh my God. it was probably the worst movie I have seen in recent years. I mean, what else can be done with the old storyline "woman inside man"? it was a lot of clichés, for example, a nerd, part of his own sequence, a “guy”, receiving what comes to him, etc., I don’t call these spoilers, because anyone could guess what was happening !! the only thing he had was Laura Fraser, who showed average performance. and as for the dream boy, it was the wettest actor act in history. even the bad guys were instantly forgotten. <br /> <br /> awful movie.
