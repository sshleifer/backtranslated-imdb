Not to say that all shows are bad, because there are several funny roles, such as Spencer, and several random incidents. But beyond that, let's face it, this is just another dry comedy that children buy into. <br /> <br /> Miranda Cosgrove was cute and funny, like Megan on Drake and Josh. Honestly, she is mediocre in iCarly and just not as funny as she is trying to be. The actress who plays Sam seems to be sleeping most of the time, and her antics are so excited that I think about them. They are not funny, just annoying. And Freddie is fine, but not so interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, the situations are unrealistic, but not everything is so bad. Some are annoying though. Here are some of them: <br /> <br /> 1. Girls are 14 years old, and they have a web show that gives out too much personal information, with a weekly audience of 27,000 people (WTF), practically without advertising, and they can still continue their lives without being attacked by crazy people. <br /> 2. Their web shows get too much praise ($ 100,000 a year for sneakers advertising, a free trip to Japan, a presentation of Plain White Ts etc.). Honestly, any person over 6 years old would not find his comedy interesting. <br /> <br /> 3. As it turns out that they are so “average”, but they have a three-story loft, Spencer does almost nothing and can still afford a lot of basic luxury items, and they have all the equipment for web show? 4. All adult idiots. ALL THEM. <br /> <br /> 5. No 5-foot girl, however disgusting and tenacious she is, will be able to destroy trained police officers, unless she is muscular. Sam is skinny and petite. <br /> <br /> 6. No one can fall 9 floors in the elevator and live. <br /> <br /> 7. Children can handle the search for criminals better than the police. <br /> <br /> The show is stupid. In fact, it seems harmless, but making children think that they can be disgusting to their elders, living alone in Seattle when they are only 14 years old with an irresponsible moron, and giving out personal information is simply wrong. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed that my cousin, who is 3 years old, likes the show. What happened to the cartoons when I was her age?
