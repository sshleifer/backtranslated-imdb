"Queen of the Damned" - one of the worst adaptations of the book to the film, which I have already seen. The only thing I like about this movie is the soundtrack, among other things (since I'm a fan of Korn, Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington from Linkin Park and Wayne Statics from Static-X) <br /> <br /> There are so many mistakes and so many bad choices that I don’t even know where to start. So many stories have been cut out, such as the legend of a twin (one of my favorites), the relationship of Armand and Daniel, and even Louis is not, not to mention a few. (The plot was dead). First, they had to make the film “The Vampire of Lestat,” because this is the second book after Interview with the Vampire, and not Queen of the Damned. They tried to squeeze so much information into one movie so that you would not get anything unless you read the chronicles about vampires. <br /> <br /> It seems that so many significant characters have no real meaning in this film. This is, for example, the case of Pandora. <br /> <br /> The actors they choose to play all the characters do not correspond to many of the descriptions of Anna Rice, especially Marius, who is supposed to be a handsome, tall, impressive blond guy with blue eyes, like Lestat. (Stuart Towsend is also far from Lestat). I did not understand why they changed the creator of Lestat to Marius instead of Magnus. <br /> <br /> “Interview with the Vampire” was a terrific movie. I liked the actors and Tom Cruise, since Lestat was IDEAL and was far superior to Stuart Townsend. far superior to this crappy movie called Queen of the Damned. <br /> <br /> Ann Rice was so picky in interviews that I didn’t understand how she had just sold the rights to this horrible production.
