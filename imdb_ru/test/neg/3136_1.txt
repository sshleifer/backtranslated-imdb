For people who have compared this rubbish with the brilliance of David Lynch, etc., Please listen to your guardian when he says ... DO NOT USE ANOTHER PEOPLE'S PC, NOT PERMITTING THEM! <br /> <br /> It's complete, and utter poo! There is no art here. This is a person who is trying to make a name for himself with the help of many common ideas that he was not smart enough to embody ONE basic idea, so instead he chose a simple option. <br /> <br /> Anyone with a half-brain can sit at home and cause conflicting images to shocking viewers, but in order to turn it into a film that people WANT to watch, you need a person with real imagination. <br /> <br /> I LOVE the shock of the movie. I saw OR YOURSELF pretty much everything you can get ... And I strongly advise everyone who LOVES the world of cinema to send GOOD CLEAR to this garbage. <br /> <br /> This is ONLY for people who would like to overestimate what they are watching, or for 17-year-old drinkers for the first time who do not know better. <br /> <br /> 0/10! <br /> <br />
