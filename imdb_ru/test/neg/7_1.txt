The legendary fiasco of Blake Edwards begins to seem meaningless after 10 minutes. The combination "Eagle landed" star! "What a beautiful war!" And Edwards' Pink Panther films, dear Lily never attracts the viewer; aerial episodes, musical numbers, romance, comedy and espionage - all this is ho-hum. At what point does the viewer give a damn? This catastrophe fluctuates in tone, never decides who it wants to be, and seems to think that it is a fake, but it is pathetic and painfully square. Old-fashioned, in the worst sense, the audience, for obvious reasons, kept aloof. It's horrible. James Garner would be much better than Hudson, who is just cardboard, and he does not associate with Andrews and vice versa. Both Andrews and Hudson did not seem to let this joke in and miscalculated with seriousness. Blake Edwards's SOB is not much more than good, but this is the only good that ever came from Darling Lily. Darling Lily's expensive and professional appearance only makes everything that she is wasted on even harder. According to the head of Paramount Robert Evans, "the film is worth $ 24 million and no picture."
