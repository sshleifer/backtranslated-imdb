I grew up watching such comedy series as Seinfeld, Roseanne, Simpsons, etc. In other words, mainstream television. Over the years, many comedy series have appeared on the air, and a very small percentage of them are really smart and funny. “Home war” is a vivid example of most modern American comedies. <br /> <br /> I give the series 3 of 10, because this is what he wants to be, comedy, but it is not. It seems struggling to be a good comedy. A good comedy should be that you brushed off your big jokes, you should not see them go, and in TWAH I see almost every joke. The characters are probably the simplest and terrible stereotypes I have ever seen on the screen, and the game is not very good, except for the father, who portrays the stereotypical beer lover who loves the American idiot, perfectly. <br /> <br /> Poor acting, incredible characters and jokes that don't catch you off guard distract from this show to such an extent that it is impossible to see it. If you don't have cable television and want to watch a comedy worth watching, try Boston Legal. It is worth your time.
