I was looking forward to it at the Sydney Film Festival. I left the theater, like many others, before the final credits, because I could no longer sit with him. It was a terrible shot, the sound sucks, and the game was worse than the episode of The Love Boat. Now I know why this film could not find an American distribution company that will release it in the United States. These are cries for low-budget high school production.
