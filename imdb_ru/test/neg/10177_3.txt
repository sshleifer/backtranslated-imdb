My wife noticed this movie on the aisle at a local video store. From the cover it looked like a science fiction film, but turning it over, my wife saw that the film was Rebecca St. James, understood that it was a Christian film, and offered to watch it. We are conservative evangelicals, but we also know that "Christian" films have a bad reputation in the mainstream. However, we decided to show it. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there were a few things I liked about the movie. The musical accompaniment - most of which was organized - was pretty good. The cinematography was also pretty good, considering that it was a film with a smaller budget. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, any merit in the work on the film was lost according to an unfortunate scenario. The film begins with an interesting premise - the abduction of a UFO - but in the middle of the plot the plotline turns wildly into an evangelistic crusade led by two main characters of the film ... which then turns into a treatise on the Rapture At the very least, the visit that was inspired by Frank Peretti (which itself was a deeply vicious film) had an endgame that tied together the premise of the film. The "unidentified" ends nowhere, even close to where they started, which is a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> As for the action? Acting skills range from decent to terrible. (Rebecca St. James plays a small and tolerable role.) For her part, some of the main characters are sufficiently staffed. Unfortunately, their talents are wasted on characters that are one-dimensional in their faces to be incredible. "The main characters" are anything; You know what is bad when two Christian viewers consider the loudest Christian character in the film to be the most annoying. <br /> <br /> A final note about the evangelistic tone of this film, which will be more interesting for a Christian than non-Christian readers. In short, it is a shame. Other Christian films, such as The Champion Carmen and The Curse of the Executioner by Peretti, managed to convey a truly uncompromising portrait of the Christian faith without the sound of a sermon or suppression. This film, by contrast, is a sledgehammer that feels so powerful and devoid of tact that it will be difficult for a non-Christian to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> I truly believe that the director’s heart is in the right place, and I welcome the effort to make a good Christian film. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. If your church is looking for a show of a good Christian film, consider the “Streets of Charity”, the aforementioned “Defender” or (if you are Pentecostals) provocative Robert Duvall “The Apostle”. <br /> <br /> Regarding "Unknown?" Rent it if you need it, but review it before showing it to non-Christians or a wide audience.
