I heard some good comments about this movie as terrible and terrible, but it is not. Obviously, the screenwriter wanted to make a terrible horror film, but at the same time add a youthful comedy for a young target audience. Frightening and comedies rarely lead to good films, the same goes for MONSTER MAN. <br /> <br /> Not very funny, neither scary nor too pleasant at ANY other level. <br /> <br /> Approaching 39 years of age, I saw my share of horror films. I have seen good and terrible, but the many films released these days are so frighteningly mediocre that I am bored to watch them. The adoption of bad films like this today really annoys me. Let's face it, they produced a lot of shit in the 70s, 80s and 90s, but then they were also considered as such. Today they are considered "good fun". - Heck!
