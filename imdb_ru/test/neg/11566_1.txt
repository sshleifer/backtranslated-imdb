Actually it was awful. The main chicken in it, who becomes topless, apparently slept with the director at the time. He was shot in a warehouse, which most likely belongs to family or friends. They also decided not to worry about making up a story. Of course, these are ways to reduce costs, but are they reasonable ways to reduce costs? No, it is not. At the very least, they could find a high school student on the “creative writing” course. These children, at least, had a lesson about the structure of history. At the very least, they could read about the 3-act structure, but, obviously, the action was not a priority. Watching these jerks run around in funny clothes that were stupid by the standards of the 1980s was embarrassing. The fact that none of these actors committed suicide in humiliation probably indicates a limited distribution of this film. If the actors really saw the end result of their hard work, then there would be a lot of people waiting to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge. <br /> <br /> I would give this film 10/10 stars, but it only deserves 1 for release at all. This film should be shown to students all over the world. This is better than 90% of the student films I have seen, and wow, this film is a piece of shiiit.
