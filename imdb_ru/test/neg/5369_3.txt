“Paranormal State” is an interesting show for most paranormal believers. I like to watch what the “team” says and what they “find”, however I know that all the shows along with the plot and the plot lines are fully customized. They go to these haunted places, and I suspect they are talking to real witnesses. I often feel that I am not looking at science fiction, but at a real film, which contradicts reality. I personally would not advise and would not recommend to anyone to watch this show, if you are not the main searcher of fear. <br /> <br /> Interesting show. Stick "Ghostbusters"
