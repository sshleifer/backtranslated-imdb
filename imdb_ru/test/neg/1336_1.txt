Simply put, this is one of the worst films ever made. The story goes far beyond being tasteless and, judging by the performance of the actors, they know it. There simply is not a single redeeming quality of this film. Patrick Swayze will have to overcome some serious obstacles in his career before people forget about this turkey.
