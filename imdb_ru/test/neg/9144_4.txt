This is the answer. The question is, what is the only reason to watch this movie? I loved her in "My name is Julia Ross." This is one of the best noir films of all time. Noir, or whatever you call it, is a very disturbing film. <br /> <br /> She also has fun in one of the worst major studio releases of all time. This will be "Vina Janet Eames." It has a creepy, promising title. He has a good composition. He has a great director. I was expecting something dark. Maybe something a little tasteless. Instead, it's a boring, regular spy movie. This is pretty much a bore. At least it was for me. Miss Foch is charming. And this is about it.
