The screening of the comedy Broadway success, Gay Divorce (a name that was considered too scandalous for American moviegoers, although it was used in the UK), concerns a meeting between a man and a woman (Fred Astara and Ginger Rogers) in embarrassing circumstances while she divorces her ; they dance, argue, do make-up, dance, argue more and dance more. Betty Grable is very attractive in short (she sings and dances in the "Let's K-nock K-nees" room with a clearly splitted Edward Everett Horton), but the star couple looks distressed and unhappy everywhere. The situation is complicated, but the characters are nothing more than one-dimensional. * 1/2 of ****
