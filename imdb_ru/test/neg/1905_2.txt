If it were not for Colin Firth, the film would have been ready for the bin! So predictable, so stupid and so bad! Only Colin Firth, as always, shines through this mess like the lonely light at the end of the tunnel !! <br /> <br /> The worst thing was that Jennifer Rubin acted! Maybe it was because of this script (did they really write it or was it written “on the way” ???). <br /> <br /> In short, the story is too long: <br /> <br /> This MUST SEE only for Colin Firth fans (like me) because he is incredibly sexy and plays well against this scenario with “mental problems”). These minutes of Colin-Screen-Time make up the bulk of this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't spend too much money on it. Try to see or get it as cheap as possible (auction or something like that), and then stick with the scenes of Colin Firth. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film can be dangerous for any mental health.
