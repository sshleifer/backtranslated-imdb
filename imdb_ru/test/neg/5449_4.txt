Congo is another multi-million-dollar adaptation of the works of Crichton. Like the Jurassic Park, the Lost World, the Sphere, etc., the film raped the book with its true meaning and essence. I will do it short and to the point. The scenery is beautiful. Actors, well, that's the best they can do. Scenario? Try to save hundreds of pages into an hour and a half movie. You will get a mess in the end, but how accurate is the mess that matters, and the Congo falls somewhere below that. There were some silly moments, for example, why did gorilla killers decide to jump into lava? And Amy, brought up by people, surrounded by people, can intimidate dozens of monkey killers around her? What is this turn of common sense? Which brings me to this. If every movie had an annoying character, then Amy is one of them. You see, Amy is this naive little monkey woman who can talk with a special backpack and a safety belt tied to her. The idea is elegant, but annoying when it starts talking. Congo is worth seeing, and not regrettable, but, of course, an unforgettable film.
