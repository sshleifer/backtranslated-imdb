Well, it was very good ... but the best picture? Please do not even close. Munich was better, Capote was much better, Good night and good luck was much better ... Brokeback Mountain - well, it had to win! The Academy voters seem to behave like the democrats of the day - please everyone will like it, but dare not take any specific positions. That's why we have a complete moron in the US. <br /> <br /> This was the MOST TOP-BEST AA presentation ... and forget the year 1987 ... since it was before. Hollywood is so afraid of its essence that it can not be "direct". Obviously, many voters did not even see Brokeback Mountain. Become a present and get. <br /> <br /> It was the most pitiful year since I looked in the mid-60s, and I was only two years old. <br /> <br /> Wake up whoever you are. Hollywood is mainstream, and this is what happened to the box office in 2005. King Kong, the latest Star Wars movie, another Batman movie, rethinking Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and much more in 2006. <br /> At least there were original best paintings, for example, Munich, but heard it before, Capote - excellent; Katherine Keener should have won, although now we know that Reese can sing like Cash / Carter, etc., Siriana was much better than Crash. This film has been filmed since the early 1960s, and should we make this film better? What a terrible night of the Oscars and a terrible year that should end in 2005 and another boring year in 2006. At least, BAFTA got the best picture for Brokeback, but what about the terrible song that won? Pathetic. I think that we have only about 20 years left in America or the United States before someone comes in and changes a little. Maybe it will be China, because they own a large part of this country ... or India, because they have all the high-tech jobs and they are the largest democratic country in the world. <br /> <br /> America has become a land of fat, pathetic and stupid. Garbage can be found in more places than in Florida, West Virginia, South Dakota and the Midwest. <br /> <br /> Drive through the local McDonalds or Burger King, for the sake of all that is holy. Order whatever you want until you get a heart attack. Save yourself from suffering.
