I can safely say that this is the worst film I have ever seen, and I usually love foreign films. The film is nothing more than a poorly done violent pornography. If you decide to watch it, get ready for endless sexism, useless nudity and a silly sensational rape scene, which I am sure is the main attraction for people who like the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot wanders aimlessly, and none of the characters is pleasant. Many scenes were filmed in the forest surrounding the river, over which girls, to create a constant feeling that someone was following them, which was a pitiful attempt to compensate for the lack of history. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I would not waste time watching the film if it were accurately described in the reviews.
