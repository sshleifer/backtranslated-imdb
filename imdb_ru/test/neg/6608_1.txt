Brodzki's artwork is a great example of how NOT to make movies. At first there was a book written with great humor. The book, which has numerous fans who are happy to provide assistance when the producers for some reason decided to hire people who have not heard of the book. Then came the script, as humorous as possible and full of nonsense. At the same time, the script was written in such a way that only those who actually read books could understand anything from the plot. It’s not that there was a lot of sense in this film (for example, “I am like an ice shard. You can burn yourself,” said Jennefer as a word of warning - a warning that this film seriously lacks this film). To add to this, we have to note that no matter how much money was spent on the film, everything looks like an amateur production with two (2) computer effects, one of which is a transparent dragon. Even the costumes look like they were borrowed from a really poor theater. It looks better. And in order to add to this, we have several “naked scenes” placed there only to be in the film, because they have no explanation for what can be called a merciful plot. The film has only one power, which can hardly make up for everything else - the music is not bad. Although, if I chose, I would prefer to have it separately. It sounds better if you do not need to look at this failure of super-production.
