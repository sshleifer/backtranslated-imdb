Despite the fact that it was “Made for Television” (and at the same time obvious, that is, cheap), “CLASS WAR” left me, wanting to get my money back, and, given that this unfortunate production was partially funded through Canadian dollars, I could just get right. <br /> <br /> What made me come to terms with this was the fact that I saw actress Lindsay McKeon, whom I had watched for the last couple of years in her role as “goody goodi” “Mara Lewis in the soap opera, GUIDE LIGHT, I take turns playing the “bad girl” for a change. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, she is doing well, like Kristen, a spoiled rich man who suddenly turned out to be poor, but with a quirky line and a twist of fate that might change her state of turning around. The irony of fate is manifested in the character of Richard (Robin Dunn), a social-radical outcast who he discovers that he has just moved from nothing to a $ 23 million winnings on a lottery ticket. Now collect Richard, Kristen, her boyfriend Jason (Wade Carpenter) and their common friend Graham (Dave McGowan) for a weekend in a remote cabin, cut off from the world of storms, and just guess what is revealed. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from excessive accumulation of the plot, characters and motives of the characters. All people are fairly one-dimensional, and rocket scientists are not required to understand that some things, and some people will go very badly, very quickly. I do not think that this is an original plot, and he does not make himself anything more. Acting is fine, McKeon is a manipulative female leader, and Dunn is very good, sometimes too good, but no one else should write about it. The only other real credit I can give to the film is one turn I have not seen approaching the end (although not the very end, which is so obvious that it hurts). Regardless, I sat all this and lived to tell a story, so I can not say that it was a complete write-off. <br /> <br /> 4/10. A movie like "watch something when nothing else is there."
