This is one of the main problems of this film, along with a large number of the biggest Quebecous films: made by very pretentious and artsy people. <br /> <br /> This is really sad, but the “big shots” of the directors (expelling Dodge Stratus ...) from this province believe that they understood the truth, they know that they like little people. <br /> <br /> We are not a rich province, every time such a big film (30 million)? !!?) done, it cut off many others who would not watch their film due to lack of government assistance. So it begets mediocrity; Only films from "family friends" will be shot. <br /> <br /> I sound angry and I do. I went to see “New France”, waiting for the journey in the lives of my ancestors, but I was stuck in the discrepancy pool: French accent (we must please our cousins, so the language of our Quebec ***) and the lack of historical research are just a few. Add an obscene love story and the same music, playing over and over again, and the dumb Quebecian viewer opens and asks for more. I am glad that this pretentious piece of shit did not work as planned by Dodge stratus Big Shots ... This will help filmmakers who are not in Québec’s very low-profile film business. <Br /> <br /> Rent a cruising bar instead and have a great time. <br /> <br /> PS: I will never forgive them for spoiling such a terrific title.
