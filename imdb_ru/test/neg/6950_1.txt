I have to preface this by saying that I like to watch bad movies that are interesting. This film provides 100%. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It is full of shitty videos of random things in the city (people walking, movement, horizon, etc.), which are not tied to anything. Then there are overly long "sex scenes." They include a lot of affection and frequent rubbing of socks on each other’s bodies. This is by no means erotic and you will find it closest to horror in this film. This is especially true for the scene in the shower, where two of the so-called “illegal” girls, who could not have been more than 40 days old, were drenching each other with blood, but there is also a crew member who splashes blood outside, while one of the girls continues smile at him. No one had to memorize any lines for this film, if they don’t read the cards clearly, then there’s a magazine in front of them that they keep looking at while they fight through awkward dialogue. Then there is Mr. Kripo. He throws away the name of Ed Wood, as if he could somehow compare, but he is far from anything of that quality. He walks through the cemetery, mumbling about random things that went wrong in the film, which really helps in the complete absence of the stream that already occurred in the film. We could not stop laughing during this film (except for the sex scenes in which we were distracted and occasionally horrified) <br /> <br /> I give this film 1/10 because it exceeded all my expectations for a horrible movie .
