I like Ali G's show, I believe that the guy has a comedic instinct, but he hasn’t yet developed it to talent. <br /> <br /> The film was a bit worse than I expected. I do not consider Ali-G insulting, just stupid. Jokes for 5 year olds, some good, some horrible. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that sounds “offensive” but really funny, see Freddy Goth-Fingerid by Tom Green. /> <br /> 2/10
