As a native Chinese, I cannot accept the idea that some people must die for a "better world." I said “a better world”, because the lie is that the Chinese have been subjected to ideological treatment for thousands of years! <br /> <br /> I believe that the majority of Western viewers may not know Qin Shihuan (meaning the first emperor), the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient China. Tianxia (the Chinese word uttered by the king, means "land and people"), uttered from his mouth, is completely a lie. Since then, one by one, all the kings in ancient China have said the same thing, but very few of them did what they said. <br /> <br /> Another fact: the Qin Shi Huang Empire existed only twenty years ago. It was destroyed by humans. <br /> <br /> I like the beautiful scenes of this film, but it can't make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant.
