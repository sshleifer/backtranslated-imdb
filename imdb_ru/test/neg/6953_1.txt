Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s appearance and his dubious influence on people like Guy Ritchie may have provoked a wave of horrific British gangster films that we have bequeathed over the past few years, but one of our most famous export films serves only to perpetuate the cycle by lending its significant name trash like that. I would just like him to take a minute before choosing this project, for the same reasons of personal gain, which, he admits, he often uses. This not only stifles his talent, but perhaps the promise of future originality from British films. <br /> <br /> None of the characters in this film is pretty or even remotely realistic, and the dialogue consists of ordinary empty threats and a colorful language. Kane also does not give the material more effort than he deserves. If it were to be in the style of the tragic fall from Grace a la "King Lear", it would help a lot if I cared about the final fate of the principals, and not just wanted them to sink into the quivering sand of life and drag on almost right away <br /> <br />
