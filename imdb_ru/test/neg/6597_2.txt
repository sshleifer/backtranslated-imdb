Despite the fact that I sat and watched it all, I must say that it was not good. It was all over the place, with large chunks of information missing from how things developed, and even inaccurate at some points. If you don't know anything about Michael, you won't understand anything. You need to rely on your current knowledge of the person to make certain points. The action was a bit dramatic, Flex Alexander didnâ€™t look at all like Michael, which pushed me away, and by the end he literally looked gray. Saying that Michael portrayed Michael as a somewhat naive, but very positive, tender and loving person, everything is fine, although from time to time he still fooled him. If you want to see the life story of Michael Jackson's "American Dream". " It is much better, but the only thing that it covers the "bad" era. I have no doubt that they will eventually make a great budget film about the life of MJ, because Michael Yu is a rock! -) !!!!
