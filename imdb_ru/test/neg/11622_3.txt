The plot of this film is similar to the original. Someone is kidnapped, the prince incest rescues her, Odet turns into a swan, a tortoise / frog / dead end at first a “bad” magician as soon as he can, and in the end ... Anyway, not so much new Except for the lack of famous voice talent. Sorry, neither Palance, nor Cleese, and so Jean-Bob disappointed.
