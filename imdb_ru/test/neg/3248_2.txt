Well, I would give it one, but I'm going to give it two, because I laughed while watching this movie ... First of all, I can make a much better movie than this ... in a week .... Special effects made this movie look like a joke. You can not make such films with terrible special effects, because then people will not take it seriously. The play and the direction were terrible too. In the script there were many holes in the plot, and the entire film was not believable. It must be the worst Indian movie ever. The songs were bad too. The game was bad and artificial. Do I need to say more? Do not watch this movie if you are not interested to see how bad it is. That's why I watched it. I'm going to the movies, and I wanted to see how bad a bad movie can be. Believe me, I watched one of the worst movies in history, if not the worst movie.
