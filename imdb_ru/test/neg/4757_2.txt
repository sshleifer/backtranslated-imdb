From what I understand, Fox was embarrassed that they released the movie Alien / Predator PG-13 not long ago. It was not well received by any means. <br /> <br /> Not quite sure where to go next, seeing as they thought that Anderson was the best director of the franchise, and they created a real scientific gem, Fox turned this small, but well-informed group of monkeys for answers. <br /> <br /> These monkeys were by no means veterans of writing science fiction films, but they saw the planet of Barton about the remake of monkeys and the House of the Dead. <br /> <br /> Their first task: to hire actors. Fox gave them a reasonable budget, but the monkeys wanted to save. Soon after, they hired fifteen television actors. <br /> <br /> Now the script. The monkeys wanted to save more budget, so they wrote the film themselves. Leaving the important aspects of the two franchises was easy. Thinking about great new lines for a wide audience to remember years later was more difficult. For a while, they beat their heads and came up with a truly award-winning script, in which there were clichés, idiotic decisions and gaping holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> While Fox was pleased with the results, he wanted to see what would become of the central parts of the film - aliens and predators. The monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget, so they decided to destroy the magnificent robotics used in the terrible AvP original, and go with a stranger in a suit who was seen in old films. The actors playing aliens had trouble fitting the costumes, as they weren’t properly matched by monkeys, so they honed their plastic heads with honor throughout the film. As for predators, the monkeys decided that one predator was enough this time (again, saving the budget) to fight the hordes of newcomers who seemed to come from nowhere. <br /> <br /> What about effects, you ask? Come on now, people. They may be monkeys, but they clearly knew that CGI would play a key role in the film. Without going into the budget, the monkeys used the standard Final Cut program and cut out and inserted into it the very pleasant effects of fire and sparks. Assembles the red and green filters on the camera lens, provided that some excellent vision Predator. <br /> <br /> The settlement was something the monkeys thought long and hard about. If it was supposed to be on Earth, in Colorado of all places, they should have made it realistic. It was here that they admitted that they could be mistaken. You see, the monkeys did not have the proper training in this department, so they thought that turning off the lights in the city and watching a movie in the middle of the night and under the rain was the right decision. They just forgot that people like to see creatures, and not look at the shadows and pour rain on the whole movie. To add insult to injury, the monkeys accidentally filmed all the battle scenes incredibly close so that no one could see what was fighting or who it was. But again, a newbie mistake. <br /> <br /> Rating. Fox told the monkeys to make a movie with a R rating. It was easy. Not showing how many injuries or deaths actually happened, the monkeys had the habit of showing the slaughterhouse after the fact. Everything was simple: the audience received the desired blood, and the monkeys did not have to shoot most of the militants associated with this violence. <br /> <br /> Some actors initially had questions regarding the script. Why does Predator's blue liquid have an infinite amount of magically disintegrating, whatever he wants, and nothing more? Why does the ex-convict drive the whole movie around in a police car? Why did the monkeys forget to show the whole body to aliens? Why do watches play a more memorable role than any of the main characters? The list of questions just kept growing, but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Fox was delighted with their work. So excited that they opened the film all over the country for Christmas and even spent a few dollars advertising it a week before it was released. Monkeys have successfully made another installment in these cherished franchises. <br /> <br /> But some ask what happened to the budget that the monkeys forgot to use? They put it in their next film: Aliens vs. Predator and Hulk Hogan. They knew the audience would be upset about the title, but they have since released this statement: <br /> <br /> “For people, don’t worry about our upcoming film. He will receive a rating of R and will have violence "" <br /> <br /> And everyone lived happily ever after. End.
