Most of the American remakes of European films are rather poor, but they are in their own league. In fact, it may even be the worst movie (Sandra Bullock) ever made. I suppose I could pass it off as another innocuous bad Hollywood thriller if I had not seen the Dutch original SPOORLOOS. The modified ending here is rather stupid (and performed with extreme incompetence), but a much worse offense than the destruction of all the intellect and depth of character that distinguished the original as classics. The real horror that can be found here is that the same person who led the SPOORLOOS is responsible for this atrocity. Real George Sluizer, please stand up?
