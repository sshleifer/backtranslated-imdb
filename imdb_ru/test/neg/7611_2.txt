I have not looked at IMDb before, but this documentary is so overpriced that I felt compelled to release. I would not even have finished looking if I had not been a guest in someone's house. The film was bad on many levels: firstly, the Tredwell video was invented. The more I looked, the more he seemed to act as a man desperate to become famous, instead of acting out of conviction. <br /> <br /> Second - the rest of the film, with the exception of Tredwell’s parents and the airline’s pilot, was as far-fetched and as banal as he. God, they seemed artificial. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, Treadwell’s bear protection mission doesn’t even make sense, because it did more harm than good by making bears get used to the human presence. I believe that Treadwell really loved bears, but there is a lot of research that shows that his efforts were flawed. Sometimes we have to sacrifice our pleasures of wildlife to really help. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the entertainment value of the film is not half that of other wildlife films, such as Penguin March and Winged Migration. The filmmakers, in my opinion, did not cope well with sequence sequencing and gave no incentive to continue watching. <br /> <br /> As a person who loves Alaska, bears and other wild animals, I would like to see more people dedicated to the preservation of our wild lands. We hope that their efforts will be less focused on people.
