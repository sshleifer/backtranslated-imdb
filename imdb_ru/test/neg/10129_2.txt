I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show. It's so boring. The jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny. As if Alex is saying something not funny or interesting, and then suddenly a laughing sound background appears. My friend and I just looked at each other with a blank look, as if we were asking each other: â€œWhat's so funny? !! " Seriously, every time we watch this show, you won't hear any laughter or cough. Just an empty look. Therefore, we stop watching this. I am personally a fan of sitcoms, so I tried to watch the show. But the show is such a disappointment to us. This show may be one of the worst comedy sitcoms ever.
