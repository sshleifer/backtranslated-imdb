I had high hopes for this until they changed their name to Shepherd: Border Patrol, the loudest movie title that was wrong with Shepherd. This is a film by the number of action movies that has gained popularity in many classic Van Damme films. There is something pleasant in the bar that reminds me of a solid goal and a universal soldier, but directed without any intensity or talent, which is a shame. There is one wonderful phrase that you have to be drunk and carry a rabbit, and some good fighting scenes, disappointed by the cheapness of it all. Often the dialogues do not correspond to the character of the characters, and the stuntmen fall for a fraction of a second before they are even shot. The final fight is one of the best fights of Van Damme, except that the director is trying to go too far, John Woo, and he also fails to present memories that nobody cares about, just interfere with the action that is Van Damme's main goal. film. <br /> <br /> Not good, not bad, just an ordinary action.
