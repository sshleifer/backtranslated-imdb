This low-budget film about a writer who goes to work at a London casino has a terrible script, wooden performances and not much to recommend. Of course, it will appeal to those who are "mainstream" is a curse, and who automatically add 20 IQ points when they hear a British accent (apologies to Jeff Foxworthy). <br /> <br /> The script is full of holes (he has already written a book or not?), cliché (relationship problems: it works days, it works nights), and gives so little insight into such basics as character motivation that is required voice narration to just move the story together. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to keep the audience from drowsiness, it includes a scene of street fighting, about as realistic as the one produced by Julius Caesar for high school. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​a stunning dialogue sounds like this: “I will watch your top ten and raise twenty,” then run to watch this movie. Otherwise, save your money. <br /> <br />
