Bruno Daniel Otoy in Petites Couperes - middle-aged model of his Pierre in “Separation” by Christian Vincent 10 years ago. In both films, youthful confidence in the ideology of left wing and love (mutual metaphors) collapses into paranoia — manifesting itself in a trap of aggression in Pierre and in desperately comical femininity in the more recent Bruno. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Otayl's fans, the actor began to rely on constant world fatigue (not unlike the compatriot Johnny Holliday in the recent L'Homme du Train Leconte). Acting is not, and becomes rather frustrating as the film progresses. Pascal Bonitzer does not help as the author / director of the project. His sequence of episodes imposed by connective symbolism is not able to hide the lack of rhythm of the film. I was particularly enraged that the impressively dramatic / romantic scenery of Grenoble was actually fired by the operator, who was clearly shivering from the cold. <br /> <br /> Christine Scott Thomas almost saved the show with her female colleague Bruno, Beatrice. She dramatizes the dizzying contradictions, intended for Bruno, in the nature of the increasing complexity, up to surrealism. Bonitzer can't stand it, though, and the labeling plot requires that Beatrice align to another bourgeois dummy. At this show, Bonitzer then denies the office of Scott Thomas Oscar. <br /> <br /> Immersion of all the characters in the bourgeoisie can be a viable and truly tragic outcome, but in this case it is a denial of cadence. (in contrast to the cruel, painful denouement of La Separament). Serious disappointment, 4/10.
