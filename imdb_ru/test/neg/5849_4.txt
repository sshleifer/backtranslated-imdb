This film received an excellent review of the “upcoming appeal” of blockbusters, which I was looking forward to when it would be released on 08/07/02. The plot sounds reasonable, one cast should have guaranteed a side splitter, but this is not true; besides “events outside the walls” it was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> It will never become a comedic classic, and I am afraid that this did not help the good reputation of the John Cleese comedy. Rowan Atkinson, now he was pretty funny, in a way Rowan Atkinson!
