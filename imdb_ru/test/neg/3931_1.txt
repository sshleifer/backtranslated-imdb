Harrison Ford plays a cop in a crime thriller. These are the ideal ingredients he seeks for the best entertainment when Harrison returns to his Indie and Han Solo, defending the witness from ruthless and merciless killers. How easy it is to be deceived. If the film had concentrated on the main, supposed themes of crime and obscurity, instead of putting barns and pouring ice cream on people's faces, this might have been more appropriate. Incredibly predictable best way to send an enemy is corn.
