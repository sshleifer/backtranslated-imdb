Well, where do we begin, this film had a lot of potential when such big stars played their part. But the whole story was destroyed by a terrible conspiracy. This film failed, as I expected, a good guy makes it alive, I mean, no one wants a good guy to be successful. The final was very worthy and very clich√©, without thinking about what ever, YOU GOT THE SITE EVERYTHING WRONG TO GET SUCCESS. <br /> <br />. time spent doing something else, this film became the epitome of CRAP. I really think the actors made this film for a little Vegas money, no doubt. Save your money, watch the best movie.
