This film is my God, this film is so poor that I am surprised that I managed to watch it all. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that Vinnie Jones should play only the London period of thugs, that's all. stories. <br /> <br /> Pisttolero is so unconvincing that it is almost a comedy. The blows to Dennis Hopper and David Carradine did not save this film .. in fact, I think it is a complete comedy, and as a comedy it deserves its 1 star .. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs .. Winnie my, I thought I saw it all when he played the Irish Tinker: P <br /> <br /> I think the average viewer will Understand that this film may simply never be a movie type .. I donâ€™t can understand how anyone can actually drop this shit
