I usually can tolerate perverted films, but this is really a sick intrusive film about myself! <br /> <br /> First, the screenwriter / director is a completely self-absorbed guy, full of unhealthy jokes. everything. Secondly, he is also a sick pervert who manipulates and poisons the minds of children! I can not believe my ears when I heard the sick and perverted monologues said by the children! <br /> <br /> I am very sorry for Zayn Adlum and Devon Matthews. Both of them are very talented, but they became victims of Eric Schaeffer's dirty little-known film! <br /> <br /> And what the hell happened to Eric Mabius's beautiful face? I mean, he met this girl whom he should marry, but he was not at the wedding! In fact, this bald guy in his place! Has time really gone so fast? <br /> <br /> In any case, do not waste your time watching this movie, unless you want to be poisoned and controlled by one patient, Eric Schaeffer!
