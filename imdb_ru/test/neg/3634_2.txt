I saw about five or six episodes of this stupid show, and most of them I was forced to watch. And I did not like the episodes that I saw. What happened to Dan Schneider? After he gave us such great shows like Drake and Josh, why did he decide to create a stupid show like this? My problem is not only with Dan, but with the guys who nominated this show for Emmy, were they drunk that day or what's the problem? Drake and Josh were not nominated for an Emmy, but that is much better than Zoe 101. The creators of this show should be ashamed of the existence of this show, let's just hope that you know who will affect the show, or even better, because it will be canceled .
