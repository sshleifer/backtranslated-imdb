Awful, terrible, terrible ... <br /> <br /> I liked the original movie. It was funny, charming and with a soul ... in this piece there are NO of these things. <br /> <br /> Reusable jokes from the original film, stupid scenes, poor animation, different voices (except for Kronk and Yzma) that sound ANYTHING like the original (especially Pacha ... * shudders *). <br /> <br /> Characters are not in the model, the animation is flat and boring, just bad work all around. <br /> <br /> And why is Cusco a moron again? I thought he was reformed ... but since then, when these TV shows are true to the original * rolls his eyes *. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but there is nothing redemptive ... in general. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
