Besides being a liar, this guy is also a complete idiot and a thief in the comedy community. Once, when I tried to watch this occasion for a television show, I think that I was really sick. I can't help but feel a little dumber every time I see one of his terrible commercials, while I enjoy great comedy programs such as Reno 911 and American body shop. This shows that it makes me worry about the permanent existence of humanity. It's hard to believe that even Joe Rogan can make someone look like an idiot. Please start praying now, when Comedy Central realizes its mistake and will complete this show as soon as possible. Have we not suffered enough?
