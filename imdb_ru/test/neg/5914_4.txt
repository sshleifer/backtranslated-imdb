Dane Yousef <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to it. I like Eddie Murphy, and I like it when a star makes a car for himself or when someone writes, decides to celebrate his own directorial debut. But when a star's head becomes too big for the rest of its body, there is always the danger of a grand Hollywood vanity production. <br /> <br /> Will the director be able to preserve his reality ?? or will he just waste money (studio, ours) and time (studio, our and his) stroke his back for an hour and a half? Unfortunately, this is the last one here. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I really like is when someone breathes a new and fresh life into an exhausted and dried up genre. None of this is here. The hostile films about the nightclub have become so worn out that even his parodies are dreary and made to death. <br /> <br /> Murphy does neither. He makes the most cliché: he connects to the usual gangster picture of the usual formula and plays it as seriously as if it were the “Godfather”. This is similar to the scenario where in the next project they put in jokes and new ideas. But it seems that someone with influence just looked at him and said: "No, everything is fine." <br /> <br /> Perhaps Murphy. He is credited with all this. In the first photo of the beautiful white satin sheets, his name appears in the headlines about five times. <br /> <br /> The plot: a young orphan saves Pryor’s life, and Pryor adopts little ragamuffin. <br /> <br /> 20 years later, the Priora dump has become a first-class hot spot. They pull big money, and the gangster wants their actions. He even has a dirty cop at work. But Pryor comes up with a scheme a la “SEPTING”. <br /> <br /> The Murphy Scenario sounds like an unfinished first draft, due to which no one had a pair to call it. Actors do not really stand out, if they stand out at all. Even almighty Murphy seems to be on autopilot. <br /> <br /> Pryor shows cool and gentlemanly manners like Sugar Ray (perhaps it would be better to call his character BROWN Sugar Ray - another proof that this person needs brilliance), but everything here is basically just rest . <br /> <br /> The Oscar nomination that the film received is deservedly deserved (“Best Costume Design” by Joe I. Tompkins), but production values ​​are the only part that makes the 30s a sense of authenticity. <br /> <br /> Some decorations look a bit fake, but it must be a comedy. Rarely one film is nominated for both Razzie and Oscar (unless this is one of the new heads of Star Wars Lucas). <br /> <br /> Now is 1938, and everyone speaks as if it were 1988, especially comedians. This is the prehistoric formula of the white man. And with all these black comedians and satirists, you expect them to revive the genre, or at least bring new life into it. Nope Murphy pretty much just walking here. <br /> <br /> Great Roger Ebert summed it up beautifully when he remarked in his review: “Murphy approaches his story more as a costume party in which everyone looks great while fumbling through a story that was not fresh at least since 1938. "<br /> <br /> Jasmine Guy played well and seemed to be indulging in his role, and Michael Lerner has all the looks, evil and manners of the prototype mafia boss. And there are times when Pryor gives you an idea of how a more interesting leader and authority figure will sound. He gives every scene , in which he feels a sense of dignity. <br /> <br /> Would it be too much to ask Della Resse to sing? Or, at least, stop being embarrassed because of all her conversations "Kiss my ass"? <br /> <br /> And the late Redd Fox can't leave most of the swan song here. He has something about Resse that could be great. No. Murphy misses another opportunity here again. <br /> < br /> "Murphy Quick" is charismatic and pleasant. But these moments are few, and they are far from each other for sure. Murphy never looked better and never was more boring. His character made me laugh twice throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Stan Shaw's boxer with a terrible speech disorder is not just painful and awkward, he is annoying. There's more to a comedy than just showing something unpleasant. You have to turn on some kind of light touch and funny situation. Seeing how he strains even the simplest words makes us pity him and annoy Murphy. <br /> <br /> Can Murphy write the script? Well?? was “Raw,” but it was really fake stuff. He wrote the scheme for "Boomerang" and "Arrival in America" ​​for sure. But she did not have the last word there. Maybe a team of screenwriters like ER could revive this. <br /> <br /> Murphy's direction is so slow and quiet that you could swear that he slept at the wheel sometimes. He has too many static frames, and he does not seem to know how to create and release the unknown. At some level, I think Quick is the real Eddie Murphy. Angry, young, hot and ambitious. But sometimes charming. Now, if he ever was just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which Murphy lies a woman in bed who plans to make love to him and kill him. You can probably guess how it turns out. Like everything else in the movie, it could be better, but ?? <br /> <br /> “Amazing,” Murphy hasn’t made another film since (he received a nomination for Razzie). And he no longer writes a finished draft for his films (he won Razzie for writing this!) <br /> <br /> This is a pleasure to watch, the music is beautiful, and there are some really good scenes. But it just falls under the category of "gems among all the garbage." They are not enough. <br /> <br /> Maybe. It must be. Did not have. Oh, OK. <br /> <br /> Dane Yousef
