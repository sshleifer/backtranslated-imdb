Do you want the worst horror movie of the 21st century? El Chupacabra is everything. “Manos: Hands of Fate” is the worst film of all time, but El Chupacabra is definitely the worst film of this century. It also has to have the difference of having the absolute worst lead actor ever. Erik Alegria, the actor in the lead role, has never acted in any other film except “El Chupacabra,” and so on. I wonder why. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the monster is attacking people, but everyone who is being attacked is moving very slowly and really stupidly. And in this city there are no policemen at all, only two idiotic detective stories - Hi! First, policemen appear at the scene of the killings, and then detective stories arrive! And, apparently, the monster attacks only in the backyard of one person and in some desert terrain at the dock. Or ... these are the only places where filmmakers can access the film. <br /> <br /> This “movie” is the reason IMDb should allow us to give negative stars. It easily deserves -10 stars, or at least 0. They should have a rating of 0.
