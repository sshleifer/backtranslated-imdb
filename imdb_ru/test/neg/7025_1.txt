Until about 1970, Lucille Ball was one great comedian. She was such a wonderful clown that I would like more people to see her with Bob Hope in Facts of Life, because she, too, could do dry coolness. and also a slap in the face. <br /> <br /> Yes, Lucille Ball was wonderful. , , While mom". <br /> <br /> Attempting to see Lucile Ball in Mom is physically impossible because there are so many vaseline on the already filtered lenses that you will need Windex to see Lucille Ball in some scenes. Therefore, even if you see Lucile Ball in Mom, you will not be able to see Lucille Ball in Mom. What is a blessing. <br /> <br /> This is the most pleasant thing I can say about “Mom”, a film about a musical from a film about a play (this can go on, but it all started with something completely funny). The book is called "Aunt Mom"). Giving this bad rap is like beating a sponge. So it does not matter that the music croaks, not sung. In any case, most of the songs were not very many. There is no difference in the first three. “This is today”, “Open a new window” and “We need a little Christmas” - this is the same song. Selena Dion should make an album with them, they are so big and boring. The murderous ballad “If He Enters My Life Today” needs a confident gorgeous voice (Eddie Gorm won the Grammy for doing this in 1967), which poor Lucille Ball didn’t have when she made this film. (True, Elaine Stritch also cannot carry a tune in a bucket, but at least a Strit can put a song on.) <br /> <br /> If you still feel that your life will not be complete if you Watch the musical of the film “Mama”, pay attention to how people dance in it, but when Lucy / Mame starts doing something other than permutation in paralysis, the camera turns off, returning immediately when the number ends, and the star poses with the dancers. Again, this is just as good. Jane Connell got the opportunity to play the role of the pathetic Agnes Gooch after Lucille Ball fired Madeleine Cahn to ensure that no comic originality would bring the star to the background. Connell is a theatrical production that, like Carol Channing and Etil Merman, cannot diminish her role in films, so she joins Lucille Ball to be embarrassing, albeit for different reasons. <br /> <br /> Luxurious dresses by Teador Van Runkle (Van Wrinkle?), and they provide a color that is absent in all but one cast. <br /> <br /> Bea Arthur as actress Vera Charles, Maime’s best friend, ignores everyone and makes her own entertainment. If only she were in more scenes. She is too old for her role, but at least she has not crippled her.
