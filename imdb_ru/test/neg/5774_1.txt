And, unfortunately, me too. ANY film that relies on a bad pun as its slogan or title should be transferred to the basket for $ 2.00, but we decided to try the second bad film in a row for a movie night. We had a winner in the “House of the Dead” - if you want a loud click, go with it. <br /> <br /> Some witch jumped into the water after Mr. Miner set fire to her. Some guy took the dump in the forest. And the same guy grabbed a new girlfriend right in front of his old one. I don't remember anything else. The last third of the film was completely tasteless, and we all waited in torment to the end.
