Recall that since the warrior queen Gedren raised and killed most of the Sonya family, she has learned the art of sword fighting. Now Gedren took a very powerful talisman that threatens to destroy the world, if not destroy, by killing Sonyaâ€™s sister in the process. Now Sonya wants revenge and save the world. Along the way, she meets a very similar to Conan (but not Conan, no!) Kalidor, Prince-child Tarne and his Falcon bodyguard. At first, Sonia refuses any help, but is later forced to accept her, and together they go to save the world. <br /> <br /> Comments: When you watch such a film and think that this is a story that this is the best element in this film, the film has big problems. Because 1) a movie like this should rely on good sword fighting and effects, and 2) the story is really very bad. It is simple and easy, and in fact does not offer anything in terms of character development or even expectations. This is predictable and boring, and the obvious couple, Sonya and Kalidor, have no chemistry at all. And the kid is just annoying. And most of the scenes are stretched so long that it gets boring. Although the film is not very long, it does not have enough material to fill its time. And so back to paragraph 1). The fights are going slowly, without incident and really bad. It clearly shows that most of the fighters are clearly blocking the strikes of the enemy far ahead of the enemy, even starting to strike. In my honest opinion, most children battling with sticks create more exciting battles by playing knights than this film. In general, this is a really bad way out, which should be avoided by anyone who loved films about Conan. <br /> <br /> 2/10
