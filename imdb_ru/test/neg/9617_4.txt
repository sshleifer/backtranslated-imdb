I will not waste your time describing the plot for this, another reviewer has already done it quite well. However, I will give you my opinion on this film. This film is mainly against Japanese propaganda. The Japanese are portrayed as incredibly evil scum who donâ€™t belong to anything, and also have very bad martial arts skills (groups of Japanese men get to where single women kick them more than once). The fact that the Japanese Fighters lose almost every (if not every) battle in the film that relieves tension. The plot is actually quite solid and perfect for a movie about kung fu. The problem is that there is not much fighting. When there are fights, some fights are pretty good, but other scenes are poorly posed. One scene Angela Mao takes six Japanese in church and kicks all their asses. The problem is that they show that she fights with them one by one, when they all have to attack at the same time. I believe that this film was incredibly cheap, considering how cheap some of the sets are. They use the same village when they are in Korea and in China, without changing it at all. Some scenes are shot in real places and they look good. In general, the only real problem with the film is the slow and uninteresting plot. Since there are few fight scenes, we have to rely on the plot for fun, and, well, I didn't have fun. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars out of four
