Lucille Ball was a powerful force on television during the 1950s and 1960s, but she still starred in an episodic film, notably The Long, Long Trailer and The Facts of Life. Although her television career remained strong, in the early 1970s her film career seemed to end - but Ball was set up for one last shot on the big screen, and the project she chose was a 1966 MAME musical. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the role seemed to be tailor-made: based on a popular novel that resulted in two different Broadway plays, Mam Dennis is a stupid, wildly relaxed woman who “inherits” her orphaned nephew Patrick leading him to a wild tour of the possibilities of life, bouncing from one comic fun to another. The music, which sounded such songs as "Open a new window" and "If he entered my life today," was one of the best works of Jerry Herman. The auxiliary cast, which included Robert Preston and Bea Arthur, was the best of the best. Expectations were high; the evening fanfare was awesome; the film was a disaster. The critics were stunned, and the audience sat with a relaxed jaw. <br /> <br /> No matter what Lucy fans say, MAME is a fiasco, so much so that it's hard to know where to start. He is poorly directed, poorly filmed, poorly executed, and in the center of all of this is Lucille Ball, unable to dance, unable to sing and smiling like a wax figure, while an incredibly bad choreography is spinning around her. But the catastrophe is hardly one; support for throwing fare is no better. Bi Arthur and Jane Connell recreate their stage roles as Faith Charles and Agnes Gooch; the first stage, the last gloomy. Robert Preston manages to sing with a smile, but he is largely on his own and clearly not too happy with it. <br /> <br /> The DVD outputs the film from panorama and VHS scanning to widescreen, but this only means that there is still terrible to see. Everyone loves Lucy, but only the least critical fan can love MUM Lucy; although I would not say that it is bad enough to make you knock out your eyes, you might like to have it. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
