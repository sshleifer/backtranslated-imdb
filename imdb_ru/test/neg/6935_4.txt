Eugene O'Neill is known by many as America’s leading playwright, but for such things as Iceman, The Long Journey to the Night, and Emperor Jones. The strange interlude was part of an experiment that he invented when the characters on the stage looked towards the audience and said that they were actually thinking and then resuming the conversation. It was a nine-hour performance with a lunch break on Broadway, so we can safely assume that we donated to many here. <br /> <br /> For the screen for all characters used voice overs. This is probably the best method for the screen. Sir Lawrence Olivier succeeded in this in his version of Hamlet. But Bill Shakespeare told Olivier a much better story than O'Neill in this example. <br /> <br /> Players like Clark Gable, Norma Shearer, Ralph Morgan, Mae Robson and others are much more animated in most of their films than they are in the Strange Interlude. The story takes place over 20 years. Norma Shearer is a young woman whose target was killed during the First World War. She begins to play a little, although this role is not shown in this version. She meets Alexander Kirkland and his friend Clark Gable. She also has a standing fiancé, Ralph Morgan, a friend of her father, Henry B. Walthall. <br /> <br /> She marries Kirkland, but then her mother Mae Robson warns her, and she reveals that insanity gallops in this family to quote another literary work. Since Kirkland wants children, and Shearer and Robson think that Kirkland’s train will slip if he doesn’t get it, Gable is recruited for breeding purposes. Of course, you can see all the complications that this can cause, and O'Neill examines them all. <br /> <br /> Gable missed O'Neill’s production so badly, but he was a novice MGM player and did what he was told. Shearer is doing everything possible to raise a very dreary story, but in the beginning it seems defeated. The best in the film, perhaps, is Robson, who brings a real bite into his dialogue. <br /> <br /> Strange Interlude took part in 426 shows on Broadway in 1928–1929 and starred Glenn Anders and Lynn Fountain in the roles of Gable and Shearer. Perhaps no one could save the film, because two years ago Groucho Marx ridiculed his stuffing in Animal Crackers. After seeing what he did, I do not think that the film, made public, took it too seriously. <br /> <br /> And since this is not the best of O'Neill's film, I also could not.
