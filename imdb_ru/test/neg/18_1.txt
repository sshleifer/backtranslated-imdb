Bloody Birthday opens with a shot from the Hospital Meadoweil. There, three children are born at exactly the same time during a total eclipse. The signature informs us that it is now “Meadowville, California, June 1, 1980”. Two teenagers in love, the Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Annie Smith (Eric Hope) set to work in an open grave. They hear sounds, and the Duke investigates. Both the duke and Annie are murdered. Sheriff Jim Brody (Bert Kramer) is bewildered and has as a clue just the kid's rope handle that Annie was holding. Unfortunately, before Sheriff Brody can solve the case, his younger daughter Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and her two friends Curtis Taylor (Billy Jane as Billy Jacobi) and Stephen Seton (Andy Freeman) kill him. As soon as they finish Sheriff Brody, another boy from their class named Timmy Russell (KS Martel) appears, the three killers do not know how much he saw. Shortly after the incident, Timmy plays with Stephen and Curtis in a landfill. Curtis locks Timmy into an old locker. Timmy manages to escape and tell his sister Joyce (Laurie Letin), but at first she does not believe him. Three children continue their murder. Their strict teacher, Miss Davis (Susan Strasberg), the lovemaking couple (John Avery and Sylvia Wright) in the van, and Debbie's older sister Beverly (Julie Brown) are among their victims. Joyce begins to suspect Debbie, Curtis and Stephen, which makes her and Timmy a target for the evil trio. Will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent 10-year-olds are truly soulless killers? <br /> <br /> Co-written and directed by Ed Hunt. I really don't like this movie. I think it is absolutely terrible and does not have a single pleasant aspect compared to 83 minutes of running. The scenario of Hunt and Barry Pierson does not give us an explanation of the motives of the murderers of children outside of the solar eclipse, which is blocked by Saturn, and therefore for some bizarre astrological reason these three children have no conscience, therefore they are the only children ever born eclipse? If this is true, why are they waiting until their tenth birthday before starting their killer fun? I guess it just suddenly turns on, right? To my credit, this is pretty good, but I still found it incredibly boring and tedious. The film as a whole is very uninteresting and predictable, children become killers within the first 10 minutes, and, as I have already mentioned, no motives are given. Sometimes it's silly too. Check out the scene where Debbie stops Steven by throwing a bowl of water at him! The sheriff’s death is explained by the fact that he fell a few steps, yes, yes, the injuries resulting from this kind of accident will not be the same as if you were beaten to death with a baseball bat, which he was in fact, any A competent doctor or pathologist would have noticed this for 5 seconds. There is not a single drop of blood in the whole film, and all the inconclusive killings are boring and inconceivable. Debbie takes 25 cents to allow the boys to look into the hole while her sister Beverly undresses. Immediately after the 5-minute mark, an early scene appears when Joyce walks from the kitchen into the living room, and a booming microphone is clearly visible at the top of the screen, not even to the devil. General incompetence continues throughout the film. All products are soft and easy to forget. The acting is generally bad, these three children annoy and irritate me from the very beginning and make watching this film even more difficult, especially Curtis in his disgusting huge glasses. I just hate this movie really easy. I can't think of any good things to say about it. Definitely to avoid.
