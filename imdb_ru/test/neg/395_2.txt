This is one of those films that I watched, and wondered why I watched it? What have I found so interesting about this? Being a truck driver, I did not find it very realistic. No, I have never used “many lizards,” and I have never seen or heard about traveling the country on a new seventy thousand RV. <br /> <br /> It was the same with the pimp who never tried the woman in question (until the end of the film, well, in general, he still really didn’t ...), and only received 50 bucks "cut" when a prostitute receives 200.00 dollars (well, 150.00 dollars) after his cut, yes ...). <br /> <br /> I'm still laughing at the comment of the lizard Ivy made (these are lizards, they will ruin something with $ 20, and some are men dressed as women ... ... or something strange), that is, we are better than them, since we can still be prostitutes, but we are paid BETTER. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's just a story of a young woman who wanted something more from life than dead end work, living at home (she is 18 years old, remember?) and embarrassed by her mother doing the same thing (dead end work ). At least she had a roof over her head and a job. She performed FIVE tricks on the road ... I wonder if she was worth $ 750.00? I think no.
