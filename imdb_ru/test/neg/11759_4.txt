This film really starts off strong. We know that Roberts is the cry of Atlanta, sent to Australia to solve Coke's marketing problems. We also know that he is an eccentric genius. Roberts' great game convinces us of this pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the plot is so unconvincing that, despite the fact that good character development has been achieved, it is nullified by voids, inconsistencies and completely boring sequences of films. <br /> <br /> Usually I'm just a fan of bold and distant conspiracies. Examples that I like include Dark Star, O.S. and Stiggs and Poppy. Combined with the fact that I have to admit that this film was well played, even I myself am surprised that I cannot recommend this film. <br /> <br /> The complete gap in this film occurs around the middle of the film. The whole comedy is instantly lost and the film darkens. After that, the film flutters. An attempt by the film to launch the comedy again failed. More surprises await the audience, and they are even darker. <br /> <br /> Of course, mixing drama with comedy can be a formula for success. However, with this film, the result is about as successful as the “new stake”.
