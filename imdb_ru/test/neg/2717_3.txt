I am easily satisfied. I like bad movies. I like movies with attractive young women in a bit of clothes. <br /> <br /> This film gives notoriety to all of the above. Yes, you understand that what you get is not high art or something similar. But even for a movie of this type, Beach Babes From Beyond is not very good. <br /> <br /> Some people gave it 10. I can only assume that these are people who had organs that allow them to rationally think surgically. <br /> <br /> This is not very good. This is just not good. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 solely because of a) novelty values ​​for famous relatives and Bert Ward and b) some girls are cute. <br /> Oh, by the way, did I tell you that this is not very good?
