Five Fingers relies heavily on barbaric, shocking Hollywood tactics to reveal a positive response in the movies. This is where this film fails everywhere, primarily because itâ€™s too graphic to be taken seriously. I was repulsed and disgusted by the fact that the Five Fingers was even done, and in fact had to force myself to keep watching it. The torture itself is terrible. Even the sounds emanating from the room where someone is being tortured are terrible. But, obviously, the creators of this nasty film felt that this was not enough. He had to go beyond what was needed, and simply and effectively destroyed all the chances of this film to some valid point of view. For this reason, this film turned out to be nothing more than self-satisfied. Five Fingers are also largely attributed to the status of the B-film solely because of its pandering to the manipulation of time. In other words, we are shown the present, and then the past is revealed in passages. This slightly distorts the usual Hollywood time manipulation. While the viewer usually shows page 95 in the 100-page script as the beginning of the film, and then the rest of the movie essentially explains the end, Five Fingers is dedicated to flashing, which becomes quite tedious by the end of the movie. In general, Five Fingers made me feel stupid for watching the entire movie, because torture is obviously obscene, and, of course, there was no need to resort to graphic distress to emphasize this. I am surprised that Dick Cheney did not appear at the end as a guest cameo as a kind of superhero of torture. This film is a great example of what happens when an important topic falls into the hands of greedy, thoughtless fools.
