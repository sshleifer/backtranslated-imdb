This film is about the infamous Wannsee conference, where the best Nazis gathered to discuss the organization and implementation of the “final solution”. First of all, I want to say that I was amazed to see how Kenneth Branaus plays the Nazi. With blond hair brushed back, he certainly looked like this, but didn’t play a very good role. There was no threat and cruelty in it, and in the end he came out, looking like a smirking fan, continuing the meeting. The real Heydrich would not allow the conference to spin out of control, as it did in the film. <br /> <br /> The best performance was undoubtedly Colin Firth, who played Dr. William Stukart, the man who wrote the year 1935. Nuremberg racial laws, which gave "legal responsibility" to everything that the Nazis did. The performance of Firth was a stunning, main vocal opponent of what Heydrich proposed. The best part of all was when he wore one of the Nazi thugs in words. The gangster muttered: “I will remember you,” and Firth responds: “You must! I am very well known !! ”The film is historically accurate, but let's reduce it to what it really is - 90 minutes of a group of men at the table discussing, screaming and showing off. There is no excitement, no real conflict (except for a brief argument). This is only 90 minutes of conversation! The same room, the same table, the same people. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that the DVD is worth the money. For example, I felt deprived.
