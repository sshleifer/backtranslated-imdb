A slow, heavy film with horrible acts in general - but amazing places and clothes to admire, and of course Timothy Dalton, who, as always, does a wonderful job. I wanted to laugh out loud at voice-overs - so stupid !! But Dalton is always worth seeing, even in bad movies, a wonderful actor, already an adult, but still very handsome and masculine. This film is worth seeing just to see him ... and he seems to have wandered into a romance with a bad romance, poor fellow. It would be better to spend time watching Mr. Dalton in the 1970s Wuthering Heights or in the Jane Eyre version for the BBC in the early 1980s. Poor Sela Ward, so cute, but so wooden ... of course, she was better in other films.
