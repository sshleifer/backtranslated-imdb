This film was a disappointment. In fact, this is the story "Shining with a castle" (or a very cheap set disguised as a castle, to be exact) replacing the hotel and the monster instead of ghosts. The budget is the same you will see from Cinemax porno erotica, like this picture, sets, lighting, and the video was shot on. History is an unsuccessful attempt at sincerity: there is no easier way to make your audience sympathize with your characters than to show them an experience of emotional trauma. And the injury in this film is pretty banal. Want an example? A blind girl listening to a ribbon with a language that teaches Italian words to flowers begins to cry because of what she will never see. <br /> <br /> However, there were several things in this movie: the monster is really cool and pretty scary. And there is a pretty decent amount of nudity from Raffaella Offidani, the very star of Italian “erotic” films. The blood, however, leaves much to be desired, as is acting, even from the experienced Jeffrey Combs. <br /> <br /> In addition, I only saw two other films by Stuart Gordon: Re-Animator and From In addition, both of which were outstanding. But I won't let this little footnote in his career stop me from watching many more of his films.
