I liked this move when I was a child, but now that I’m older, I see how absurd this story is. In case you didn’t read the previous reviews, it’s about the teenager and the colonel of the Air Force who stole two fully loaded F-16s to save the indicated father of the teenager. <br /> <br /> He does have a few good tricks of the air, even if the accompanying dialogue is, in essence, damn polite. <br /> <br /> Unintentional humor in the edited TV version. When the hero's father keeps Iran, I mean an unnamed country, and his captors ask him for confessions (due to why they keep him, do not worry about why or with what they want him to confuse). ) he says: "Tell him that he can accept my confession and shove him into his throat." However, his lips and, more importantly, his gesture makes it clear what movement and parts of the anatomy he was really thinking about.
