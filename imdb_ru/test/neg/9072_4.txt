Ed (Kel Mitchell) is a teenager who lives for his work at Good Burger, a small but friendly hamburger shop, while his friend Dexter (Kennan Thompson) also works there, but he lacks Ed's purposeful dedication to his work, because that he over there accidentally destroyed the car of his teacher Mr. Witt (Sinbad) and must raise money to repair the damage. When Mondo Burger opens across the road, a giant chain on fast legs, it looks like Good Burger is a story until Ed has developed a secret sauce that opens the door for hundreds of new customers. However, Mondo Burger’s Mono-Maniac Manager Kurt (Jan Schweterman) is determined to get the sauce and get Good Burger out of business. In the meantime, Ed and Dexter must rescue Otis (Abe Vigodu), the world's oldest fast food worker, from Mad Hills Refuge, and Ed can simply find love for Monica (Shar Jackson) if he can escape from burgers long enough to pay attention to it. “A good burger” is a comedy designed for children, worthy of history, acting, and generally quite a harmless children's film.
