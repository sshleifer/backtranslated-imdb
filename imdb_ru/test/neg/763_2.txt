For a scientifically designed super-dog that was supposed to be the answer to the petty crime, ChOMPS was a dummy. <br /> <br /> All I've ever seen Chomps do is sit, walk, or run. Or run, then walk, then sit down ... and then get up again and stretch, and then go, and then run to the K-Tel dance hits. And sometimes he had all the answers to the daily jumbo. But basically he just sat a lot. <br /> <br /> All I say is: in a celebrity-to-death match, Chomps failed to kill Mr. Bigglesworth.
