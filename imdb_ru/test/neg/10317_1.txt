My first warning should have been that this DVD was on sale for $ 5.00. But since it was Sandra Bullock, which I generally like, I bought it. My disappointment in the film began almost immediately. Dialogues are slow and hard. The color is distorted. I kept adjusting the volume to hear conversations. Acting amateur. Even the murder scenes have failed. Twice dead people moved their legs. When my daughter with a cash deficit offered me a dollar to turn off the film, I immediately and happily agreed. This is an amazingly bad movie. Tomorrow I will distribute this DVD at the white elephant's Christmas party.
