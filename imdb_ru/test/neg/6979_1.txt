I survived this film just to satisfy my curiosity. It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. I am amazed that this film currently has a rating of 7.5 stars. The game is terrible, the script does not exist, and the characters are so predictable and empty. For a funny movie, I can't even remember giggling once, and I can't figure out how to define it as a comedy. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this scale and find more worthy alternatives that will give you much more pleasure. Watch movies such as holidays or 27 dresses, these films will offer you a much more pleasant impression of the movie. I sincerely hope that more educated movie lovers will vote negatively for this film, as it truly deserves it, giving it a more realistic rating on which other movie lovers could base their judgments. Come on guys, let's be honest with all interested parties and give those who are associated with this film a true reflection on what exactly they created - an extremely mediocre picture that should be forgotten very quickly.
