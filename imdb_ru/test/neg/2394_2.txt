The premise is interesting, and the actors are doing their best, but the script and the directorial efforts are so scarce that it is not surprising that this film was buried - which is appropriate, given the script. Watching this, I could not decide what was worse: the script or the direction. The actors are at the top, the artistic direction is similar to the Disney movie, the music is invented, and the mood is so sweet that it gives the audience emptiness. This is a bad attempt to imitate the "Four Weddings and a Funeral." If you want to see a comedy that is as flat as a pancake, and how bad direction can turn a story into a sweet cavity, this is a good thing to watch.
