All the movies at the airport are nasty, but this is the biggest turkey of all. The formula was different for this, because it focused on TWO catastrophic flights and a large number of scenes occurring on the ground, while other films focused only on one catastrophic flight and fewer scenes on the ground. Concord tricks are worth a look at laughter, although the special effects are not as terrible as I expect for a movie of this quality, made in 1979. George Kennedyâ€™s sexist remarks are disgusting and his meeting with a prostitute in Paris is completely unnecessary (and made me shut up a little). Poor Martha Ray was transferred to a role where she did nothing, only lightening her bowels in Concord's bathroom again and again. There are no big stars in this movie compared to previous ones, which gives you one more reason not to watch this movie.
