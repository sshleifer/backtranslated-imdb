I will never go to another Tarantino movie. The whole movie was useless. My wife and I both regret that we did not stand up and did not come out at first glance at what the film really will be about (which is still difficult to determine because it was such a ridiculous storyline ... blood, courage and violence, it seemed , was the only real topic), but we continued to hope that there would be something redeeming just around the corner. Unfortunately there wasn’t because there wasn’t anything that made sense! We, like many other spectators, left the theater, mumbling “that was disgusting”, “what a waste of time”, “I had to leave”, “where was the comedy”, “it was a pity”, etc. actually made us, the audience, express our disgust and the feeling that we were just completely disrupted.The only merit in the film is the costume and the acting ability of almost everyone in the film ... there was simply no plot / script worthy of their talents. this is 1, because it is not 0. I do not quite understand how someone could rate it higher than 0!
