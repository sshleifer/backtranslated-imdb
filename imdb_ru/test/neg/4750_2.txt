I'm sorry to say that this film was one of the biggest disappointments of the year. After one of the biggest disappointments in the history of coincidences with monsters from movies, you might think that they would learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation. The sequel falls into many of the same pitfalls, the storyline was completely imposed, the dialogue was so bad that the film could be better muffled, and the action was invented and far from the giddy brilliance of each monster movie of the original films. The best part of AVP-Requiem is actually a trailer, which as the movie progresses is ultimately aware that almost every death and every really cool shot in the film has already been shown in a trailer, which leaves little that can be revealed and little to be agitated. I gave the film an extra star for letting me see a very hot woman in almost nude. the film was played out as a sci-fi monster festival with color numbers, which also played a part in the fact that nothing came as a surprise when it happened, because you saw it a thousand times earlier. The main drawback of both these films is that the creators thought that the production of films in our time will make us more interested in history, as if it ever happened to us. but what attracted people when they released the arcade game at one time was the fact that it took place as part of the futuristic version of the timeline of the Alien trilogy, which allowed more suspicion of distrust. this is where future films should draw inspiration from. because, frankly, seeing a waitress killed by a ALIEN, whom we had all feared since childhood, simply does not do it for us. let's bring the series back to its roots. Learn from former masters and do not mess with the victory formula, trying to create a “bold new vision” for which we liked the originals, and we want to see it again. Finally, the finale is the WTF present of the entire movie, * SPOILER * after a big climax, the survivors are ambushed by special forces soldiers who justify their terrible actions, saying, “We carried out orders,” and then included a dime. and start behaving well and become saviors. then, after a long retreat, when one of the survivors gazes ominously at heaven, we are cut off on the strangest climber I've ever seen, with characters you have never seen in the rest of the movie (Rescue the Government Dude), then with all the subtlety of a blow to the face shows that there will be another movie with a hint of the storyline, which will make the original sci-fi channel blush and turn its nose. So, to summarize, if you need to choose between this movie and other actions on the surface of the Earth, skip the movie and instead do another.
