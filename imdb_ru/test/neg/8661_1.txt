As a fan of almost any historical drama, and at the same time a huge fan of Jane Austen, I was horrified by this adaptation. As a fan of the 1999 version of Mansfield Park, I constantly compared them, and it didn’t work. He felt very hasty and very one-dimensional, so he quickly became bored. There seemed to be no subtle relationship, especially Fanny and Edmund, and little atmosphere, despite the fact that they were in a beautiful place. Despite the fact that I was looking forward to Jane Austen's season since Christmas, I turned it off after an hour and went to bed. It will be interesting for me to look at the adaptation of “Persuasion” and “Northanger Abbey”, the version of which I don’t like very much to find out if they will be able to tire me so much.
