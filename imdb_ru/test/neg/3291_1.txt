You have seen the same tired, worn, comedy stories, characters, stories a thousand times before you just suck more than others. First, in this series there is not a single character who is even remotely cute ... in particular, Michael Rapaport. Dave Gold is definitely one of the biggest donkeys ever to decorate a television screen ... comes to mind is disgusting. If in real life a father was so unattractive, cruel and simply unsuitable for parents ... fratricide would be the only option. Calling the remaining characters as stereotypes would be too complementary. If these characters were on the life support line, the line to turn off the power would be bright for years. How this show ended one full season, and even more so 2 - a mystery. FOX cancels "Arrested development" and keeps it on the air ??? You tell me that terrorists do not win.
