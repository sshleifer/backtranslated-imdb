The gentle New York lawyer (George Segal) is slowly losing his mind. He promised his father on his deathbed that he would NEVER send their old mother (Ruth Gordon) to a nursing home. Years later, he takes care of a senile, dangerous psychopath. He meets a beautiful nurse (Trish Van Dever), and they fall in love. But his mother continues to scare her. Seagal is ready to kill her .... <br /> <br /> Mmm ... IS IT a comedy? I have nothing against the patient, black humor, but come on ... there must be some restrictions! This film is doing everything possible to throw every tasteless sick joke he can come up with and rub his face. It is a pity that none of the jokes are funny. Jokes include rape, nudity, public humiliation, old people, swearing, and racism. In fact, this is a film that considers it clever to try to shock people and think that they will laugh at it. I was disgusted and never laughed. The film is painful, disturbing and (surprisingly) boring. The cast is the only thing that made me look. Seagal and Gordon were both great in their roles - especially Gordon. And Van Dever is also very good. But the script is against them. The only interesting thing (not funny) was a meaningless scene in the courtroom with Rob Reiner Jr. (and an attempt to identify his then wife Penny Marshall as a spectator). <br /> <br /> In fact, this film could have been worse - - in the original finals, Seagal was lying in bed with his mother and pretending that he was a dad! This (fortunately) has changed. <br /> <br /> This lousy, sick film. The lower part of the trunk. I give it 1.
