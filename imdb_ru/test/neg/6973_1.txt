Phew! What can you say about this strange, overwhelming mocking word about Ed Wood's fantasies? Well, one word that comes to mind is incoherent! Wood uses raw slabs of harmless, random frames, and then builds a “story” around them — and what a story !! Wood himself is acting as Glen, the ordinary Joe, who just likes to laze in his bride's underwear and sweaters. I think that what Wood wanted was a call for tolerance for all the Glens of this world, showing that Glen is the same as all of us below, only in the angora. Mmmm ... good. But then, we get this very strange montage of some lustful devil, captive chickens, some rude, pointing people, some video of Mur and, finally, a gaunt Bela Lugusi playing some kind of perverted, invalid Puppet Master. Lugoshes are a howl, belching such garbage as “Beaaaaaa ... dragon big green, who sees you on the threshold: he flies on boys, dandies, on pups tails and snails, beee!” Hmm, well, Bela .. .: = 8 / Here is the weird, perverted Wood logic. In the end, he reminds us that "7 out of 10 men wear hats, and 7 out of 10 men are bald." Hmmm, it must be an alien / disguise / habidashiry-cow-than !! Glen or Glenda cast a lot (no matter what it is ...) of reliable Woodslok actors, including Lila Talbot, Delores Fuller and Timothy Farrell, and Voodoo manages to persuade each and every miserable amateur mediocrity of each. By now everyone knows Bela's sad story: by the time Wood used it for this film, he was probably looking for another solution and needed a mule, but even for him this depth has not yet been reached. One of the favorite MooCow Wood mooments comes with a shooting scene depicting a scene with buffaloes - sooo crazy insane !! MooCow says “Puuuull de schtriiiiings” and copies a copy of Glen or Glenda - you won’t believe it! : ??
