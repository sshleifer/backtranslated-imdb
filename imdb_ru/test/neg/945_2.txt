this movie was just awful. Most comedic scenes seem stale and trite, and perhaps the funniest scene in the film has already been shown in previews. the whole premise of the film is so incredible and ridiculous that it is difficult to penetrate it. The actors themselves depict the most unreal characters. it's not just that films are so hard to swallow, but how they make him swallow in your throat, expecting you to be stupid and take it. The plot itself is so shallow and easily predictable. for some reason, the boy is rejected from every school he turned to (I suppose he completely forgot about attending a public college) and decides to create his own school for other students. everything goes well for a while until the legitimacy of his school is questioned. while the damn hero manages to convince his lovely neighbor to fall in love with him with his witty sarcasm, which is obviously the skill he possesses. Then comes the final fight with students who somehow unite and fight for survival in school. Of course, the main character convinces the state education council to allow his school to stay alive with some kind of "inspiring" speech. Watching this movie would be more fun if I was under the age of 16 and still didnâ€™t know all the college issues and issues.
