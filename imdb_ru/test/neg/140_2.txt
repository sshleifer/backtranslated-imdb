The success of the original French series "Emmanuel" (I watched only the first one, which is not so bad considering) led to a stream of imitations; the Italian colleague, who even changed the race of his heroine, was obviously less polished and more exploitative - more and more plunging into vulgarity during the series. Incredibly, there were a total of 16 Black Emanuelle films, and the heroine even changed the spelling of her name to avoid copyright problems !! Nevertheless, Laura Gemser - the title object of desire - has become almost the same icon as the original Emmanuel, Sylvia Christelle (although personally she is too thin for my taste)! Here she is even declared as “Emanuel”, and not with her real name - the director also becomes “Albert Thomas”! <br /> <br /> The film itself is not of great interest: in fact, it is best to approach it as a journey with decent shots of African wildlife. As for sex scenes, I don’t know how complete the version I was watching was, but although there was a lot of nudity, not one of them was very obvious - or even exciting (the scene that was closest could have been Gemser - which works as a photographer - and her companion Karin Schubert turns the camera on each other, naturally, without clothes, in the middle of the jungle)! The film also shows the artist, invented to look like Salvador Dali, but, fortunately, his scenes do not take much time. The score of Niko Fidenko is usually tasteless pop music of the 70s and, in fact, nothing special.
