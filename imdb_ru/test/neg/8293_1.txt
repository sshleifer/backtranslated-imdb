This film spends most of its time preaching that this is the script that makes the film, but obviously there was no script when they were shooting this waste of time! The trailer shows that it is a comedy, but the film cannot decide whether it wants to be a comedy, drama, romance or action movie. Press releases indicated that Shatner and Hamlin made this film because they liked the script (what did they think?). If you like William Shatner (I do), see “Free Enterprise” instead.
