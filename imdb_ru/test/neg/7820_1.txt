For many years I did not dare to watch this film. Now I know why. This is not only a comedy that cannot even be remotely ridiculous, but there is simply nothing to laugh at the film. It was even worse than I expected. I rented this sucker and still felt cheated out of time more than money. I have never seen a movie that annoyed me so much. This is a film about stupid people who do stupid and horrible things. I really do not know how anyone with common sense can actually act in such a film. I used IMDb for some time, but I felt obliged to register only to prevent the poor unsuspecting people from renting out or, worse, buying this bitch Really a waste of time and money. I must say that the storyline is terrible.
