I was not lucky to see this while traveling by bus in Africa. It was the worst movie I've ever seen. Deserves to be the best in the history of all time ;-) Without acting, without plot, very little talk. Although in this hopelessly unlikely film there are many grunting monkeys. Involuntary self-cultivation â€” you will either laugh at this or cry.
