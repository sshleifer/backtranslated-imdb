It may sound strange, but I was able to watch the first film (“The Groove's New Groove”, “Yaddaadd”) only a week ago and only because of one episode of the TV show. I simply adore the character Cuzco, but Kronk is not so bad either. Anyway, in the end I decided to watch the second film, just to watch it. I hope that this will be as good as the first, but ... excuse me for saying that, but the more humor became American, the more I yawned. I agreed with Cuzco when he started crying after seeing all these stupid pictures. <br /> <br /> However, younger children and, probably, veterans will also like this film to pieces (if they like the old-school Disney approach,), but I just had expectations that were damn tiny, much higher what they were supposed to be. Kronk is a beautiful character, kindhearted and stupid at the same time, but at the end of the movie Pacha and Cusco woke me up in a nap. (I will ignore Rudy ... as far as possible). <br /> <br /> In any case, a great movie, just not in my style, and, as they say, you should always be true to your desire.
