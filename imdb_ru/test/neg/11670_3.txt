Reasonable summary, is not it? <br /> <br /> If “Mad Max” was something simple, understandable, nothing special, but nothing bad, that is, a movie, he fully compiled it with the sequel “Warrior's Road”, So, theoretically, with a third great movie it would be a great trilogy ... now it is not! <br /> <br /> Such a huge disappointment was outside of Thunderdome! His main premise is pretty cool, with the “underground world” (think about the connection between Metropolis and The Time Machine), but this is not done very convincingly. Add the nasty Tina Turner and the bad storyline of people waiting for the plane, and this is just one huge bastard. <br /> <br /> Maybe they can brighten things up again with part 4 (although this is just likely to be one huge budget explosive thing, because it’s just wrong. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
