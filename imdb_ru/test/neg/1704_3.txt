This film, if it was made correctly, has VERY great potential. Parody films are always funny, and people like them because they are frivolous, stupid and stupid, but funny. This movie was fun in some parts, but it could have been a lot funnier. The acting game itself was in order from all the actors, but ... I was not satisfied. It seemed a bit empty, and my short headline says everything about effects. The correct green screens were not used for this movie ... backgrounds were added, after which they looked just awful. No wonder this movie got straight to the DVD lol. It was not a complete loss, it is ridiculous and will make you laugh (in most cases, and not in CO).
