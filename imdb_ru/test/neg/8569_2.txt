I did not buy it, I did not rent it, it was on PPV, and someone burned a copy of it and lent it to me, so at least I did not waste money on it. For someone who starred in "Darkness", "Nameless", "Devil's Ridge", this is a rather unfortunate film. It seems that something is connected with a group of girls who were in the monastery in those days, and now they all grew up, they were persecuted and killed one by one by a nun who comes out of the kitchen sink, toilet, and even manages to agree on revolving doors in the hotel . And what makes this nun so angry and nasty (and wet?) I don't know, it was so boring that at some point about halfway I just stopped her, put it aside and looked at something else. In fact, not even interested in asking. Oh, of course, there is something to see lovely young ladies, but hey, two of them are lesbians? I suppose there is a picture on the bedside table in the bedroom of one young lady, and what a self-respecting horror film would not be complete these days without a lesbian couple? Yes whatever. 2 out of 10, if you want to watch a decent horror movie for nuns, try “Desecration”, “Dead Waters” or “Monastery” (by the way, with Adriena Barbeau, not with John Malkovich)
