This film (even calling it a film is an exaggeration) is ridiculously terrible. Usually a big fan of Eric Roberts in the "B" movies, this scandal tragedy makes me question his real impact on List B! And, Charlie, please go back to the hope of reviving the "Diagnostic Murder" and not this ... you can't blame the nameless eye candy (uh-uh ... beauty contestants) for participating in this weak film, but you are a former TV star person! Pull yourself together. Don't even get me on Stuart Pankin. For the sake of all the good Stuart, you should have seen that this is not necessarily a real movie! Brian Michael Stoller illustrates the absolute genius only by the fact that he could cheat someone by investing money in this picture (money or time). <br /> <br /> Indeed, it was not a parody or parody film, although he tries on a film. Level 2 Basically this is bad writing and acting, camera work and editing and ... well, everything is bad. I watched it because I read an article in some magazine about the participation of agent MD, and my interest peaked due to the lawsuit in which he was involved. Now I wonder if the only reason they show him from the shoulders in the film is that he, like at the trial, appeared in his pajama pants and was barely clear (wait a second, did he ever really be considered clear? ... I got distracted). And agent MD? Is this the best they could come up with for the name of their character? Sheez. What a tremendous originality! Or maybe it should have been funny? At first, the Marriott show in the film was a pleasant touch, but after all was said and done, they overdid it and annoyed it. <br /> <br /> Rid yourself of grief by watching ...... don't say that I did not warn you about this.
