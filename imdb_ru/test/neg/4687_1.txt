Now you know the story of Sweeney Todd, most likely due to the recent film by Tim Burton. You probably do not know this, though from this story about the old fairy tale of Andy Milligan - that notorious bastard merchant who presented Al Adamson and Ted V. Mickels a race for their money. happen in the end. Over the years of watching horror and exploitation from the 60s to the 80s, I finally watched the Andy Milligan film. You see, from 1964 to 1990, Andy gave us a lot of movies about exploitation and horror - none of which was good and barely noticeable. "Bloodthirsty butchers" is no exception. <br /> <br /> There is a dialogue here, well, there are conversations, and this is one of the things that you will find here - many and many conversations. From time to time the film reaches almost the level of “Manos The Hands of Fate”, as you are constantly waiting for something to happen. While I like the cheap bloody effects, the violence is too small and far from each other, and, despite its reputation, the “chest” scene is not so shocking. <br /> <br /> I love cheap and dirty operation as well as the next fan of the trash movie, but “Bloodthirsty Butchers” is the evil that MST3K ruthlessly tears to pieces. Unfortunately, Milligan will die of AIDS in 1991, and if there is any of his film, which, I would say, I would have liked, it would be “Terrible” nonsense. This is not “Awful”, it's just bad.
