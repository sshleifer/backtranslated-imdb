I am not against a strange fanciful film. But when they are endowed with mysterious symbolism and dark dialogue, and when it is obvious that they were made for the director's ego, and not for the benefit of the viewer, I get upset. I'm not a stupid person, but I just did not understand what this film is trying to say. Or do it. The film is a great form of human communication. Why do some directors use it instead of obfuscation?
