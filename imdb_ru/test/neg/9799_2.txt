Flesh Feast starts at Miami Airport, and reporter Ace Dan Carter (Harry Kerwin, also called a designer) calls his friend Ed Casey (Phil Philbin) to tell him that he has just returned from South America, where he was investigating Carl Schumann (Doug Foster) and that he was on a big story, but still talking on the phone, he is stabbed in the back and killed. Schumann meets with Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake, she is also the executive producer), who was recently released from a psychiatric hospital, together they are discussing their terrible plans. News of Cutter's death reached Casey, and he decides to go into history himself and conduct some investigation, well, in fact, he forces his secretary of the Day of Viginius (Marty Michon) to carry out most of the investigation and just report to him, a lazy scumbag. Virginia tells Casey that they have someone named Christine (Heather Hughes) inside, as Dr. Frederick hands her free rooms to nurses, Christine tells Casey about the grotesque experiments to restore the youth of Schumann and Dr. Frederick with human flesh and specially grown larvae. ... <br /> <br /> Co-author, director, director and director Brad F. Grinter. Flesh Feast is a pretty bad movie in all respects. First, let's start with the script of Grinter and Thomas Casey, who was also responsible for the cinematography (you got the impression that most of the actors and the crew had more than one job), basically it's terrible. Characters are one-dimensional idiots and have no personality, I didn't like anyone in this movie. Whatever the cost, I really like some of the ideas presented here: the larvae feeding on flesh, the lab in the basement, the theft of the bodies from the hospital and this unforgettable end of the “perverts”, which is almost worth seeing in the rest of the film itself. Unfortunately, the dialogue is so poorly written, it sounds harsh and unnatural, that this is not true, I mean that there is one scene in which the nurse says that they “will not let us out”, which is good, except for the fact that she speaks outside in the garden to someone. We did not think about this story, since no explanation was given to why carnivorous larvae are able to restore youth, in fact at one moment, when they ask him about this very thing, according to Dr. Frederick, there is no time to explain at that moment, which sounds to me as if the people who wrote this also had no idea! Even at a very short 68-minute party, Flesh Feast is very slow and boring, poor editing does not help in scenes and shots that last too long, for example, there is a scene in which an ambulance stops outside the hospital, drives to the door, the guy leaves He goes to the rear doors, opens them, etc., etc. We really needed to see every detail? There is also another sequence in which Dr. Frederick enters the room and puts on some gloves, then she takes them off, goes to the opposite room and puts on another pair! I personally think that Grinter probably didn’t shoot enough material, so he stretches each scene as much as he can to increase the running time. I really like this quirky ending, although I really do. Technically, the Flesh Feast is complete nonsense, I'm not sure what kind of budget it was for, but it had to be small, very small. Almost the entire film takes place in the same house, Dr. Frederick’s laboratory consists of a table, plastic glasses and test tubes, some old-fashioned electronic medical equipment and a strange screen with funny colors on it (do not ask). The cinematography is bad, the music sucks, and the whole movie looks dubbed, too badly dubbed. Operational elements are also disappointing, there are a few shots of the larvae, but in fact they do nothing except move a little, there is a short scene where a corpse is chopped off and a dissected corpse and hanging limbs on hooks look good. Acting is terrible for all stakeholders, and I mean very bad, which makes the dirty dialogue worse. Do yourself a favor and avoid Flesh Feast, yes, there are one or two unintentionally funny moments, and this ending is at least unique, but for the most part it is a real amateur film production that quickly becomes painful to watch. I doubt that most people will survive this in one sitting, I can tolerate anything, but even I thought to turn it off. Definitely, to avoid this, you will be glad you did, and if you really should see it, do not say that you were not warned!
