I should have known better .. the tips were all on IMDB.com. This film was written and directed by the same guy who does not have a track record. The cast is a group of unknowns, perhaps with the exception of Joe Esteves, who seems to specialize in bad movies. Etc. Suffice it to say that I see no reason why anyone would like to see this terrible, amateur attempt to make a film. Turn on any broadcast channel at 3 am and you will see the best movies. Enough.
