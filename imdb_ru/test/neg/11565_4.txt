Well, there is no way to embellish it. The plot was ridiculous, the premise was ridiculous, the acting was unscrupulous, the effects were ridiculous, and all the scenes outdoors seemed to be filmed in Central Park in New York. At the same time, there was something in this film that I could not get away from. Perhaps it was the atmosphere, or maybe it was an evil super fox or amazon. <br /> <br /> In any case, I am not one of those who sit in the fields and criticize without pointing out some redemptive qualities, so here they are. <br /> <br /> The brutal response of the women's freedom movement is portrayed in the wilderness (central park, of course), and all masochistic young people will be very impressed. In addition, some scenes in which certain characters lose consciousness are funny dramatic (you will notice that I write dramatically, not convincingly). <br /> <br /> All I can say is that some people like movies B and I am one of them. If you are also one of them, then try. Greetings, Mr. Kincaid. This is one for the ages.
