What is this movie about? Well, if I did not know that the “son of the mask” belongs to the comedy category, I would never have guessed! Comedy? Tragedy is a suitable genre for this one more, so-called, continuation. <br /> <br /> Yes, I watched Dumb and Dumber, but I never believed that someone would ever make this title real in Hollywood. Yes, you look at "Son of the Mask" and think .. 5 minutes - Dumb ... 10 minutes - Dumb ... 15 - Dumb minutes ... And then, after 16 minutes, you can only say one thing: / I'm from here. .. <br /> <br /> Sorry, my candidacy for the comedy shit of 2005.
