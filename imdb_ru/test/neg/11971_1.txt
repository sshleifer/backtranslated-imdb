I can't believe I let myself rent this piece of trash! The game was so bad that my grandmother could have done better. The blows inflicted in the films were very close to the character that the Scarecrow knocked off the floor. Watching a movie has become a chore! <br /> <br /> Thus, this group of baseball athletes decides to go wrong, even after they were not supposed to form a coach due to the consequences. So, naturally, they still leave. They decide to tie the loser to the post with the so-called "Scarecrow". When the loser's best friend finds out about this, he and his girlfriend go to save him. <br /> <br /> Diabetes is found in the child, and he is hospitalized, and the athletes go to the beach the next day. Scarecrow finds them there and kills them all. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you really don't care. Anyway, the Scarecrow ends up having a connection with the "Diabetic Boy," and the boy begins to finish the work of the scarecrow as soon as the scarecrow is killed. Yes, it is really very stupid. <br /> <br /> He thought this film was full of crap. Sooner or later, the only living (naturally) are the guy and the girl who are the main characters :) Evil is then passed on to the guy, and he kills himself in order to break the curse so that no one else will suffer. Touching hey No, do not waste your hard earned money, I give him one point, because he is the lowest, otherwise, he does not even deserve so much.
