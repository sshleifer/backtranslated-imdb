This episode had potential. The basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment (but a telephone that constantly rings) is somewhat interesting. And when she explores the noise, there is real tension and fear. But the stupid script writing destroys any promise the episode had. <br /> <br /> First of all, a woman readily admits that she sees things that will cause most of us to run in another direction (for example, “It’s funny that the door slam shut, although there’s no wind; what was not here a minute ago; ”“ The door opened by itself, without my touching it; ”, etc.). Given these supernatural phenomena, and the fact that a woman committed suicide in a room, would she take some precautionary measures before entering it? Maybe she could have an investigation in the afternoon. Or maybe she could explore the apartment with someone else. Or maybe she could turn on the light! In addition, being in a haunted apartment, she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and argues about who has the right to turn off the phone, and then they begin to discuss the details of suicide. JUST TURN OFF THE TELEPHONE! The telephone company should not be involved. Go to the phone and turn it off. Case is closed. <br /> <br /> Finally, showing the phone cheater on the floor as if he was alive was just ridiculous. If the director wanted a woman to be strangled by a phone card, he could do it in such a way that it would not look cartoonish. Brave little toaster?
