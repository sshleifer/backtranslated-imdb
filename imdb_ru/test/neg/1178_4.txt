There are many reasons why I am not a fan of fact-based films, but most of all, the way directors give themselves a creative license for this story. If they have such a big imagination, then why not use this talent to make something original? Otherwise, stick to the facts. It could be a good movie if only they did it. Ed Gein was a frightening man. It is said that if you take Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Leather Face, wrap them in one person, Ed Gein will still be more painful / scary. So why can't anyone make a film about him that can convey this? When will they realize that reality is ultimately worse than fiction? <br /> <br /> I read books and watched news programs about him, and now I'm not a screenwriter or something like that, but I believe that there is enough documentation on Gein, you donâ€™t need to write a lot of history about all these atrocities he committed without creating murders that were never documented. I know that he was convicted of only two murders, but with all the evidence found in his house and shed, there should have been many other ways to connect this film, and not use the relationship of the deputy with his mother and girlfriend as filler, and too lot. <br /> <br /> I think this is interesting to me ... why did I find out more about supporting characters at the end of the film than about Ed Gein? Why didn't we recognize his mother, father, and brother and the relationship between them ... what made him the psychopath he was ... what kind of violence he suffered as a child who might have contributed to what he became? Instead, the only thing we got from his childhood is flashes of him like a little boy ... running. <br /> <br /> At the end I give him 4/10 stars. This is 2 for blood and 2 for Kane Hodder. Despite the fact that, in my opinion, it was a kind of bad cast, considering that Gein was a small man, and perhaps effeminate, and Hodder is not at all small and not at all like what I consider feminine. Maybe I was just excited because he was Jason Voorhees.
