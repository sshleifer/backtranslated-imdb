Calling Rocketship XM the classic of science fiction is more likely due to its release date (1950), its skillful ability to capitalize on Destination Moon advertising and the appearance of actors who will later be filmed on television as Mike Sea Hunt's Mike. Nelson, Rockford's dad and Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is bad enough to be a good feed for MST3K, and it’s best to watch with comments from Joel and the robots. This type of movie is best for adding riffs from MST3K characters; something preaching, slow, poorly written and full of terribly bad games. While unintentionally funny things, such as Plan 9 From Outer Space, defy satirical comments (because the film is constantly breaking away from the owners), really bad and boring movies, such as Rocketship X-M, are ideal. Therefore, add a few stars to the rating if you are watching the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> The main story is that the crew makes an unplanned turn to the right on the moon and goes to Mars. On this planet, they find the remnants of human civilization destroyed by atomic war. Only one Martian is shown in close-up, a normal woman who is blind, or at least has no pupils in her eyes. Men look like "fools" in the old cartoon "Popeye", they deftly run over the rocks and throw boulders into the team with amazing accuracy, especially if they have to be blind. Of course, none of this is ever explained, as this will require some signs of logical analysis on the part of the authors of the script. <br /> <br /> Scenes on Mars are presented in something called “sepia color” to distinguish them from the rest of the black and white film. If you think “The Wizard of Oz” because of this, you will be disappointed because it is just a black and white material with a slight brown tint added to the print in post-production. <br /> <br /> In accordance with the retarded sexism of the film, the ice woman scientist confuses her fuel calculations - coming and going. Her inability to compete with men makes her feminine side surface to the surface, and she and Mike Nelson grumble sweetly at each other, facing their doom (insert the sound of a gagging). <br /> <br /> The real film stars are reporters at the command center. So much so that MST3K was inspired to specifically welcome these unidentified heroes. Fearless squad "novices" is shown during the first 10 minutes of the film, and then located at a distance of about 12 inches from the technicians and control equipment in the command center. Later, they are called upon to ask the idiotic questions that the director of the mission needs in order to present the already too obvious message of the film. <br /> <br /> DVD has a very low sound level, does not contain subtitles and is accompanied by a trailer. Although you will be grateful that this is only 77 minutes, it’s still about 60 minutes more than in any 30-minute episode of “Twilight Zone”, the content of which is several times more than in the entire film. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
