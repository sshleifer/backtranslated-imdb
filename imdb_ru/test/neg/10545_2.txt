The first toxi film was dark, bloody and fun. This film is a ruthless battle with raw jazz music, no bloody stuff and the worst tox mask I've ever seen! His deep voice became a light, happy voice, the characters from the first part reappear as actors who are NOTHING like them (Claire, Junco's mom), change the names of characters (Claire or Sarah?). He lacks all the brutal violence, dark humor and political incorrectness of the first film. If not for nudity, this film could be rated PG. Really lame. I am a HUGE fan of the first part, I just can not bear it.
