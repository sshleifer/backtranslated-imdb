Just ONCE, I would like Kunz's work to be given to a worthy scriptwriter, director and producer! ONLY ONCE! <br /> <br /> This is a good attempt by Gene Leclerc and Chris Sarandon, and an even better attempt by Victoria Tennant, but everything else is clean, clean, garbage. The screenwriter should be shot for killing Kunz’s work in this way, and the director ... please. <br /> <br /> The story is well written, but the script is rather boring, incredible and terribly executed. The only elements that work are the performances of Le Klerk, Sarandon and Tennant. <br /> <br /> Personally, I really wanted it to work. I adore Kunz’s novels, but they never gave them the attention, support, and talent they deserve. If they had invested in the work of Kunz the same money that they had raked in barrels full of king, Kunz would quickly rise higher. But alas! I am afraid that without influential people who believe in his work, he will never have a chance. <br /> <br /> As an adaptation to the novel, this film was a complete shit. As an independent film, it was not so bad, although extremely weak in many places with huge holes in the plot and a terrible, tough, unprofessional dialogue that should never have come to the final version. This film could not realize its potential with a bang. If they had followed Kuntz’s original work, a little more carefully, and invested a decent amount of production money, this could have been much better. <br /> <br /> However, all I managed to see in this was how well it could have been. <br /> <br /> He estimates 4.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
