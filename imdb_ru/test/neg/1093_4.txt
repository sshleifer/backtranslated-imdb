I donâ€™t know if this exceptionally boring film was conceived as an unofficial continuation of French Connection, but it has many of the same drawbacks: the script is so confused that the viewer remains untapped and feels out of the picture and the direction is so cold, so lacking that even a great chase sequence cannot revive things.
