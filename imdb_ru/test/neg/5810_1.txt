It is difficult to say exactly what to say about this very boring and boring little film. History is predictable, when not quite funny. It's all about the "submissive gestures", which, as presented here, carry absolutely no conviction. Yes, MGM's “production values” are great, and yes, Miss Lamarr was exquisitely beautiful, but she and the great Spencer Tracy have absolutely no “chemistry” together - and this is the only thing that could make this parade of clichés all efficient ... I understand this movie received bad reviews when it was originally released; the passage of time did not improve it.
