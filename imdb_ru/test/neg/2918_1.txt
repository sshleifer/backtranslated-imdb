If someone had returned to the dawn of the conversational picture, he would have predicted a bright future for Harold Lloyd. Unlike his competitors, he was a comedian trained on a legal stage, and not on a performance raised in the purgatory of a music hall or vaudeville. He had a good voice that matched his image. Moreover, since 1924, his “silent” films included episodes based on sound preferences lost in the audience (for example, the Fall Frolic bells sequence from FRESHMAN and the monkey sequence in THE KID BROTHER). Yet the sound features of Lloyd have consistently failed at the box office after the WELCOME DANGER news has weakened. Lloyd blamed his fall on many external sources, but did not understand that the enemy of the character from Glass was not healthy, but the Great Depression. The pre-depressed audience, frivolous because of optimism, may have supported this ambitious lover in whom they saw their surrogate; The depressed audience despised him as a person who might lose the right to buy out a mortgage and throw them into a ditch. This problem of character selection is aggravated by Lloyd’s perception of an insincere joyful crowd. Sincerity, of course, is a subjective assessment, but one cannot deny that Lloyd, despite his own tragic upbringing, can never play a convincing appearance. Perhaps this is because he was afraid to return to this state forever. Cat Paw fails for these reasons, but she alone suffers from exposing Lloyd’s pro-fascist program. Many filmmakers believe that Lloyd was offered to make this film because he saw the FDR presidency as a dictatorship, intending to saturate the rich and mitigate crime. We must remember that he was not alone in that feeling. Last year, DeMille filmed the pro-police drama on this day and age. We must also remember that America was founded by hot tax protesters and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it. PTS suffered because in the “comedy” she treated fascism frivolously and because its release was particularly inopportune, given the events in Germany this year. The Production Code of 1934 will ultimately limit the glorification of justice and reaffirm the supremacy of constitutional law, however cumbersome it may be. The ideal of a benevolent despot, a well-intentioned omnipotent leader who creates a utopia, once liberated from the checks and balances of this omnipotence, dates from classical antiquity. For this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter, although it acts as a safety valve. Ironically, the very existence of TCP, a film that demonizes the democratic experience of its country of origin, shows that America’s FDR was safe enough to accept criticism. No one sees parallel criticism in Hitler’s Germany, Stalin’s USSR or Mussolini’s Italy. But is it possible to laugh at the gallows humor in anticipation of fascism? Lloyd’s unappreciated film is skewed to the right and may have been written by Dr. Goebbels himself, if he, of course, had a sense of humor. This creates an alternative history in which the elect re-establishes order and loses honor, ANY MEANS REQUIRED, and does so with kind character and fun. The coming fascism, to which the left is approaching, is, of course, the “Great Dictator” of Chaplin. This latest film has the advantage of being established in another country and is based on a slightly veiled real persona and events. The great dictator today laughs little, because he underestimated the scale of human evil, but he succeeds, despite his unsophisticated and inappropriate utterance of speech, because he has a clear advantage, confirmed by history. Lloyd, however, should be credited for two things: firstly, he did not make any pro-fascist films and did not make any hypocritically pro-allied films during the war: secondly, he never sold TCP to television. The world after 1945 saw the face of fascism, and it was not funny.
