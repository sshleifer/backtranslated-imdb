There are many reviews that describe this film as the worst movie ever made. Surely there are a lot of mistakes: an inaccurate game, rather dull and stamped, and sometimes a paradoxical scenario, as well as the standard sound of a B-film and “special effects”. As already noted, there are many dark scenes that make _Cave Dwellers_ the fabric of a science fiction film, especially when compared to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, this film is not the worst film ever. Most, if not all, (including this review) of these reviews are written by MSTK3 fans. Therefore, many of these reviews are largely a brief description of the episode _Cave Dwellers_ MSTK3. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Joel, Tom Servo and Crowe notice Mad Scientists that this is the worst film ever sent to them. Of course, loyal fans took this quote and ran with her. I found this film fascinating - not as it seems _Forrest Gump_ - fascinating - but in the efforts put on this film by some actors. In addition, this film is funny without processing MSTK3. This is because _Cave Dwellers_ does not take himself seriously and is not trying to import any righteous topic into his viewers. For all the puppet monsters, medieval hang-gliding, and continuity errors - this film no longer touts what it is, a superficial depiction of a rather superficial genre. <br /> <br /> I also can’t push myself to hate Miles O'Keeffe or Lisa Foster. Instead, this hatred of Coleman Francis, Tony Cardos, Jennifer Lopez, Arch Hall, Jr., etc. <br /> <br />
