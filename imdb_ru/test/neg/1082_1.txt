How to start? I first saw “Italian Work” a few years ago and, while visiting a rental store, I could not remember why I had a bad feeling. Now I do. <br /> <br /> After voting for the ratings of this film, I saw the statistics. Apparently, this film is most liked by girls under 18 years old. Not surprising. They didn’t pay enough for Charlize to flare up, and I believe that some women’s magazine rated Mark Wahlberg as “AMAZING.” <br /> <br /> Besides the fact that this film is completely predictable, the actors are mostly eternal Bee stars and even the bad ones are abused horribly, the film is filled with an obvious product placement and imagine: he even manages to repeat himself without making a sequel! The first 15 minutes is the best part of the film, and everything comes from there, and when they understood this, they decided to use the best hour again at the end, repeating the details of their golden robbery. In general, a lot of noise about anything. <br /> <br /> I think Charlize Theron is good, and Ed Norton could be the same as he was before. Besides the fact that at first Donald Sutherland “look, I am also here” appeared at the beginning, I would say that in this film there should be “a passage if you are over 18”.
