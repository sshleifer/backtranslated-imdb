It is gratifying to see that other IMDb reviewers had the common sense to pan this disappointing film, risking defaming the great Vadim, Malle and Fellini. <br /> <br /> These directors can be talented and artistic in their own law; However, trying to betray this mishmash from the attempts of erotica and chic of the 60s, as "in any way" relating to the stories of Edgar Allen Poe, they exposed themselves as deceivers. Either (A) they did not bother to read Po's stories, or (B) they read them, but were so shocked by their own egoistic program that they did not bother Po. <br /> <br /> Imagine if Metallica connected their guitars, turned on amplifiers to 11 and released 3 chords, claiming that this is Beethoven’s 9th symphony. This feeling you get after watching this movie. If you are a Vadim / Malle / Fellini fan (Metallica), you will dig it out. If you are a Beethoven fan (Poe), you will vomit. <br /> <br /> METZERGENSTEIN ... <br /> <br /> Here we start with Edgar Poe’s fancy version of porn. Well, “porn” may be a bit extreme haha, but at least you should name his version of Barbarella (including, I have no doubt, some Jane outfits coming directly from this SCIFI messing around). Vadim falls into his own old cliche: the girl lying on the bed enjoys some kind of man, while from the camera-pillow we see the apathy in her eyes; general fatigue and irritation of a woman who does not find satisfaction in hedonism. Cute things, but Metzergenstein is no place for that. And in addition to the Barbarella outfits and irrelevant erotic motifs, Jane Fonda’s terrible American accent and unconvincing play by the European Countess made it the worst actor since Julia Roberts in this lousy version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. <br /> WILLIAM WILSON ... <br /> <br /> Here's a great story by Po, which tells about a madness that claims to be a man when he realizes that he is no longer unique in the world. If you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme, watch Star Trek episode No. 27, "The Alternative Factor." But here Malle reflects on this central theme and instead focuses on ... any guesswork ...? Yes, eroticism, sadism and debauchery. Ho hum The role of Brigitte Bardot is a complete invention to achieve this goal, and the director again turns the classic story of Po into a masturbatory catharsis from his unanswered sexual problems. Do it in your free time, Malle. I thought we were here on the day of Po. <br /> <br /> TOBY DAMMIT .... <br /> <br /> Absolutely the worst of the three, and possibly the worst film I’ve seen since “Staying Alive.” At least Fellini has shown some tact when changing the name, but his departure from the original plot, theme and humor of the story is so great that I wonder if he chose this video from his private collection of home movies with the words "Edgar Allen"? Poe narrates "about it and introduced him in this collection. I was very tense, to find some thread to get acquainted with the works of Po, but they were not absolutely. <br /> <br /> The original story of Po (“Never put the devil on your head”) is a short and cheerful dark fable about a man who constantly exclaims: “I will put the devil on my head ...” In a foggy morning, the devil accepts his for suggestion. As a result, this is the most painful and dumbest thing you have ever read. It was Po, the comedian, at his best (yes, Po wrote a lot of comedies. Also look at Prediction and The Devil on the Belltower, if you want to try his witty, satirical works). <br /> <Is this the version of Fellini? It's tasteless, heartless, and not at all funny (unless you think it's funny to see someone drunk stumbling over himself for 45 minutes). Here Fellini’s selfish pomp is about an artist struggling with hypocrisy, pretense and mediocrity of cinema. Much of this happens at the awards ceremony, where Fellini hits us in the head with sarcasm, cynicism and the classic "sour grape" attitude that we find in all films related to cinema. Pay attention to the sarcastic attacks on "critics", a recurring theme in Fellini films. For someone who considered himself above the critics, Fellini, of course, spent a lot of time talking about them. In any case, I feel that Fellini just took a few blows of 8 1/2, put them together and sold them as the story of Po. Worst "adaptation". <br /> <br /> I think I’ve put more effort into printing this review than any of the three directors who made Po.
