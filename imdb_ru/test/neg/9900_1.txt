This is a TV movie about every cliché you can come up with for a movie about a disaster. The only problem is that it is not very well done. <br /> <br /> My brain is still offended by scenes in which Brian Dennehy might be looking at a computer monitor, looking for weather data and showing on this monitor: video footage of a cluttered weather ala advertising of weather channels. Why watch the local news feed on a blurry alley to understand global weather conditions? You caught me. <br /> <br /> During the first two hours, some of the worst effects of CGI known to man are also noted. Watch the semi-trailer and the aircraft, which look as if they were made on the Commodore 64. <br /> <br /> All the omens in this “movie” are made with the subtlety of a sledge hammer, the dialogue is imposed, and I can’t think of a cute character which I want to experience in the second half. <br /> <br /> The hero that I hate most is the foolish wife who deceives her husband. Perhaps if she raised her finger at any time during the show, instead of being a helpless woman who stands on the same 10 square feet of kitchen all day, her husband will not sleep with a PR manager of a rival energy company. She is so helpless, in fact, I want to rid her of her and my sufferings. I hope that everyone in this “movie” dies in the second half.
