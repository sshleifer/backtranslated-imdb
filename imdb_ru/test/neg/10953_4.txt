Down in the cinema I saw a movie that I just needed to see. It looked like a funny low-budget horror / action / western that I could get into. Yes, I knew it sucked, but I rented it anyway, hoping for a laugh. There were only a few laughs. It was a very stupid movie. It all starts with the bounty hunter, our main character, who is perhaps the weakest main character in the history of the film. He looks / behaves as if he could fight Chuck Norris, but he cannot. His dialogue sucks too. Anyway, he goes to the village, shoots some zombies. You could say that they tried to make it longer by pasting these boring scenes, where it takes 3-5 minutes to reload or watch a few zombies. At least the zombies look cool. Somehow, some people get shotguns, some zombies die, and in the end, everyone is dead, except for our main character, who was supposed to die in the beginning, when four people shot him down.
