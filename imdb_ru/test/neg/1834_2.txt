There is an endless supply of trashy horror films. It seems that people never get tired of trying to scare and excite. Alas, these attempts are very rarely successful. This unfortunate film has almost no redemptive value. The story is very predictable, most of the actors are not very inspired, or simply misinterpret special effects of very low quality. It took a lot of effort not to turn off the DVD and not go to bed. With such a limited number of foreign films released in the United States, why in the world someone wants to import this nonsense. To top it off, there seems to be Anatomy 2, for those who have nothing better to do. I would prefer to see how the paint dries.
