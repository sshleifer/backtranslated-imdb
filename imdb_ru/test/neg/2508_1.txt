this movie is so incredibly awful! all about it was rubbish. You canâ€™t say anything good about this movie, acting, screenwriting, directing, effects - everything is just as bad as each other. even Ed Wood could do better than this. I seriously recommended staying away from this film if you do not want to spend about 100 minutes of your life or how long the film has been. I forgot. This is the first time I wrote a comment about the movie on IMDb, but this film was only on television, and I had to inform the world of movie lovers that this film sucked eggs !!!!!!!!!!! so if you have decency in you. go and make a much better bad movie like critters 3
