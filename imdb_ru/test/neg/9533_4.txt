This film was so unfocused, incoherent and uneven that it was an attempt to watch it all. (I really thought there might be some interesting plot elements.) It was nothing more than a film about coming of age for a thirty-year generation. Complete shit, and I have no idea what Julianne Moore did in this, since that was the only reason I took her off the shelf at the rental store.
