After the success of Star Wars, interest in science fiction films increased. It was one of those cheap attempts to make money fast. <br /> <br /> A group of spacecraft survivors landed on a planet inhabited by motionless dinosaurs, where half of them die systematically (people are not dinosaurs). Porn Movie Level Action. Cheap special effects, even for that time, although it seems that a lot of effort was put into them. <br /> <br /> Costumes were pure 1970s, like hairstyles. Aah, 70s. I expected the disco to start at any moment. <br /> <br /> Nothing to recommend in this movie.
