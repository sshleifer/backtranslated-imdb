What is it about the French? First, they (apparently) love Jerry Lewis much more than the United States. Secondly, they (it seems) like the work of Edgar Allan Poe more than anyone else. This should be the "Baudelaire effect". <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong ... I'm a Po fan myself. But this trilogy manages to turn three of the stories on below average ... well, I'm not sure what they are made of. <br /> <br /> “Toby Dammit” is Fellini’s wonderful film, but this has nothing to do with Poe’s story, at least in terms of the theme. It's nice when you first view. Terence Stamp copes with an interesting role. However, he has nothing to do with the Po or the spirits of the dead. <br /> <br /> Metzergenstein is a big mess. How did the movies Vadim? It's just awful ... not even up to the standards of an amateur film school. Depending on the DVD menu you have, try to skip it and save your time. <br /> <br /> William Wilson is the most faithful segment of the work of Po. He doesn't have much style, though, even if it includes the most bizarre snow fight, I think I have ever seen in a movie. (It looks like the boys are throwing napkins or maybe handkerchiefs that have been rolled into balls.) <br /> <br /> My advice is to skip Metzergenstein, see William Wilson, and then if you are a Fellini fan (I don’t), leave Toby Dammitt on while you cook dinner or make snacks.
