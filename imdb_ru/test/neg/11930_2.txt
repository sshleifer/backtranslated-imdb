In the animated series: <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux was an immoral rebel who was completely cut off from everything and everyone. She was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, witty, biting, self-confident, sarcastic, deadly, indomitable, ambiguous - all at once. The original Eon had layers after layers of depth. She almost never allowed to relive her personal emotions. The original plot was delightfully ambiguous and thought provoking. You could never tell what the motives of Eon were. Eon was a militant anarchist, whereas Trevor was a radical idealist, because of this they could never have any semblance of stable relations. <br /> <br /> In the film: <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux works Monica and its political and personal motives are very clear. She was cute, loving, vulnerable, easily influential, emotional and very predictable. Eon in the film had a maximum of one layer of depth. The plot was obvious and contrived. Everything is fully laid out for you from the very beginning. There was little conflict between Eon and Trevor, at least in terms of personal philosophy. The only conflict between them was that they were on opposite sides. <br /> <br /> The film was a terrible disappointment for me. I felt betrayed. They took the idea of ​​one of my favorite animated characters of all time, squeezed out all the depth and personality from it and pumped it with full Hollywood cliches. The essence of the cartoon was completely lost in this film. <br /> <br /> The only reason why I don’t put this film as “1” is because the visual effects were incredible. It was nice to see some familiar animation scenes, such as flies in the eyes, made with computer graphics.
