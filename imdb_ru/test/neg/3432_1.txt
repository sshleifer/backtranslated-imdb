I must say that Krasinski is the only reason why I even watched this film. He is good. However, everything else in this film is so below average that it is not worth the time and effort spent on watching it. <br /> <br /> There are many technical / aesthetic problems in this film, namely: frame selection, framing, camera movements in monologue sequences, extremely poor editing (possibly due to the total lack of smoothness between frames and between frames) general terrible action (with the exception of Krasinsky). <br /> <br /> It was too theatrical (in the acting and presentation) to develop some disturbing moment in this film ... which is surprising, because the whole thing is a bank robbery, which should be at least somewhat exciting . <br /> <br /> How is the film bad to get, then let go, and then distribute? <br /> <br /> Something reminds me of a graduation project of a C-film student, although probably not even that good.
