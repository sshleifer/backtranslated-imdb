University professor Justin Thorn (Jimmy Smits) did it. A handsome, sophisticated teacher, with a loving wife and two adorable children. He plays the saxophone, owns an expensive car, and his students love and respect him. But when temptation causes, in the image of one of his bright, cute, sexy and willing pupils, Jennifer Carter (Naomi Watts), he foolishly gives up. The next day, he is accused of raping her, and his ideal life could be destroyed forever. <br /> <br /> When we see an American actor in an Australian film, we know that we are not waiting for a masterpiece. But even when viewed with low expectations, “gross misconduct” is a huge failure. Based on a play with a rather extraordinary title, and then adapted into a fairly pleasant book, it cannot attract, convince, or even remotely interest its audience at the most fundamental level. The script is clumsy and inconclusive; action, for the most part, is not much better. Watts demonstrates acceptable performance, showing for the first time her emotional rawness on the screen, but she is the only good thing in the film that looks like she can't even wait to finish. <br /> <br /> The direction is not terrible and not distracting in any way, but simply painfully mediocre. In addition to the aforementioned Naomi Watts, which can be forgiven, seeing that it was at the beginning of her career, the acting is wooden and it gets worse and worse during the film. Usually the reliable Jimmy Smits didn’t seem to have tried, and who could blame him? All these minor mistakes, however, only add to the final fatal flaw in the film, which is that the focus is not at the right place. Any sympathy for the characters or interest in the result is lost in the sea of ​​what is essentially entertainment entertainment for adults. By the end, the audience will probably be bored, tired, and willing to do something else in their ninety minutes. If you just don’t want to see Naomi undress 4 or 5 times, you can certainly afford to skip this movie without incident.
