I outlived this movie at Sitges last month. If there is an opportunity to “film” a film in order to avoid its existence, it should be first on the list. Maria Lydon is not a director, she is just a stupid woman who pretends that by holding a camera with her hand and shouting “action”, she makes her a professional director. What mistake! The film itself is meaningless and is a waste of good actors who could do something better in another project. Val Kilmer does nothing except put his face in front of the camera. His character does not have a certain weight in the film. The same can be said about Joss Ackland, Vincent Gallo or Joaquim de Almeida. It is a shame that the character Rade Serbiji was written. WARNING SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Most of the time he spends alone in the tunnels, talking to himself (now I do it, now I have few bats, I will search in my bag now I turn left, now I I turn to the right ...) just to give viewers a clear idea of ​​his actions. It's just nonsense and proves the lack of talent of the director. THE END OF SPOILERS <br /> <br /> A common joke about this piece of garbage among the audience was that the name of the film itself gave the key to understanding the rating that everyone should give: ZERO
