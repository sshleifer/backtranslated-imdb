I do not think that this film had the effect that was meant for me: the sight of American soldiers shooting at wounded soldiers from the other side, and beating wounded prisoners in their wounds to torture them to make them speak, made me cheer for another the side. This, of course, made the American troops look like "good guys." Was that supposed to be acceptable?
