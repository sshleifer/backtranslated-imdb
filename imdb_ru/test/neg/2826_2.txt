I wrote an essay in 1981 when I graduated from high school called “The Last American Virgin”. I also had a girlfriend named Nancy, who was a prostitute in this film. apparently her daughter took my essay one night while she was sleeping in my house. A year later, I wake up one morning and see an advertisement for this film. I was 18 years old, and I based my essay on the experience of my life. the film is a little different from my essay, but definitely taken from it. I had no evidence of this, except for my English teacher, Mr. Versace, who gave me an assessment in an essay. I let it go and never did anything about it. I thought what would happen, I don't care. a lawsuit against anyone involved in this film. I just needed to take it off my chest, since I had never really told anyone about it, except for my closest friend, and they agreed to keep it a secret. That same year, when it came out, I saw Nancy in the market, she really had the courage to ask me if I had any good stories or scenarios that she could look at. I guess that’s what Hollywood is about, telling stories wherever you are. It was interesting to see parts of my life on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Ghostwriter!
