The storyline about a man's love for an innocent child, whom he sees with a distorted face and on the opposite side of the world, is a petty egocentric "girl from the valley" who shares her birth date and eventually makes a big difference in both of them living there. What a wonderful and decent storyline. But in this story, on-screen writing and / or directing and / or editing are so poor that they take most of the joy out of the story. The character of Linda Hamilton moves from the understanding of the mother to the evil witch and back faster than the bullet, and for what purpose? Conflict, conflict, conflict, without delay. Katie (girl from California) and her boyfriend, mother Katie and everyone else, including the poor lady at the airport check-in desk, adoptive father Lin, who is the sweetest, most attentive person alive, and his wife and biological son, are all in permanent conflict. I really wanted to enjoy a spiritual story, but the only thing that made me SMILE is when all the hatred and fights ended. There have been too many unexplained or illogical events, many of which do not add to the story. My wife and I continued to look at each other and ask ourselves how such a good cast and what should be a great plot can be so bad.
