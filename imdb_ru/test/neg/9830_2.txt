If you ever wanted to know more about taxi drivers, then this is a great movie to watch, for educational purposes only. Now I just hear it: â€œWait, wait a second! Why don't we follow the taxi driver all his day! Taxi drivers are fun, just like the people they meet, and they talk to each other just for a couple of minutes, so the rest of the actors should be cheap! Harry, you will take care of the filming, Joan, you have materials, Brian, you will find several actors, and we will all meet here tomorrow to start shooting! "<br /> <br /> The first 90% of the film could not have been worse if it happened. At least without any planning there is always an element of surprise. In some Jim Carrey films there is something added, and they always perform well at the box office. The problem here is that the first 90% are written pretty well and that sucks. Paul Dillon plays a taxi driver in Chicago who works all day. We pretty much see what he sees. People sit in car and get out of the car, and he drives around the city. He talks to these people for not For a few seconds, and then we have several more people. <br /> <br /> I confess there were some funny moments here and there.The religious family tries to persuade the taxi driver to go with them to church, he takes the pregnant woman and her husband to the hospital , breeds a rich businessman from his girlfriend, a poor girlfriend from her boyfriend and takes a rape victim home.I assume the moral of the film is that the taxi driver is more than the taxi driver and has a big influence on the lives of its passengers, what could you do amb. For some people, it is just a means of getting from here to there, but for others, his usual words help to change the direction of their lives. <br /> <br /> The last passenger of the day is used to try to make sense of the rest of the film, and to a small extent it succeeds. There was a bit of a sense of remorse in him when the vast majority of films sucked, and then at the very end he tried to do it all the best in one or two changes. The film as a whole did not impress me, but there were a few points worth seeing again. As for the actors, this is Paul Dillon. John Cusack, Gillian Anderson and Julianne Moore are all in it, 30 seconds each, but do not look at any of them, otherwise you will surely be disappointed. I pay tribute to other people for the fact that they shot here is not an ordinary film, but not very good. Just not enough material to keep you on the road for half an hour. It was a decent effort, but it still failed.
