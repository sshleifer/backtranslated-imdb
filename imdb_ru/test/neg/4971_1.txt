In 1993, Sega released the boring, dull video game of one of the biggest films of all time. Quickly realizing their mistake, they developed a different version of the game, stating that it would be bigger, tougher and better. <br /> <br /> None of them was. Both were slow, boring games. <br /> <br /> You can choose either Dr. Alan Grant, or ... a predator. Both have their own problems. Why would Dr. Grant kill all these guys from the army (what are they doing in the game)? And why does Raptor kill the other Raptors? Strange. <br /> <br /> Obviously, not learning from his first mistake, Sega really threw the ball on the original version and the so-called Rampage Edition. One of the slowest, slowest and most boring platformers I've ever played.
