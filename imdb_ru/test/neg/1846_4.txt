Whoever wrote the screenplay for this film has obviously never turned to books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I have never seen so many mistakes in a biopic since her early years in Selorone and Jamestown to her late years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but this will continue for pages. In general, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucy Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be unhappy with how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried their best, but the film seems terribly sloppy to me.
