This, in my opinion, is a very bad film, in which Arnold Schwarzenegger is starring (despite the fact that he plays a supporting role) only to sell more copies. This film, obviously influenced by films of “Conan” with a similar theme, cannot seem pleasant and, in the end, does not entertain at all. <br /> <br /> Stars Bridget Nielsen - Sonya, a beautiful woman who was given an incredible role. forces of the ghostly figure after her village was ransacked, her family was killed, and she herself was raped by soldiers of Queen Gedran (Sandal Bergman). Gedran is a tyrant queen who wants to control the barbarian world and is looking for a talisman protected by Sonya’s sister. Upon learning what happened, Sonya is sent on a rematch, and at the same time she must save the world from the wrath of Gedran. Calidor (Schwarzenegger), a mascot master, intends to protect her, whether she wants him there or not. <br /> <br /> The first big problem with this film is the beginning. The events that led to Sonya getting her strength could easily make up from ten to fifteen minutes of a pleasant movie. However, the beginnings begin with what seems to be a short minute “Earlier on ??”. Segment from the television show. If they actually made these events part of the story and later turned off part of the filler, they might have been able to start redeeming this film, but, unfortunately, they did not (I wonder why director Richard Fleisher currently only shot two the movie after "Red"). Sonya). <br /> <br /> This film also depicts some of the most annoying characters in the story, such as Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.), who is a stupid character and simply adds an excessive amount of camp to the film, which sometimes works, but this case fails with a bang. It was obviously recorded in the film for some comic relief, but with the general absurdity of the film, in any case, this was another costly mistake for Red Sony. <br /> <br /> Despite all his flaws, there was a good fight Scenes involving Nielsen and Arnie, which are worth noting, but this is not enough to save the turkey. Acting is about as good as in films of this quality, and even Arnie did not seem to be too worried about his performance. I do not recommend this film at all; for me it's a waste of an hour and a half. My rating for "Red Sonja" is 3/10
