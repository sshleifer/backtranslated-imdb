Free Willzyx (the stupidest name / title) is the worst episode of ANY of the TV shows I watch, which includes X-Files, Alias, All 3 Laws and Order, All Criminalists, Family Guy , Simpsons, Chapelle Show, Colbert Report and much more. South Park has been my favorite comedy show for a long time because of its disgustingly obscene content and disturbing black comedy. Free Willzyk has no content I mentioned earlier. It was so boring, so obscene that it could well be an episode of Sesame Street. Kyle goes to Sea World, where several workers joke at him, making him think that the whale is talking to him. He became friends with the whale, actually became friends with him. Hello? This is South Park! the same show that brought you "Canceled", "Chicken Chicken", "It Strikes a Fan", "Death Camp", and much more! Not Spongebob Square Pants! Ugh. I actually watched the whole episode, which in 30 minutes of my life I will never return. Anyway, I was very much against this episode, and I cannot believe the shocking decline in the quality of Matt and Trey's work.
