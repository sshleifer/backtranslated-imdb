This is a comedy / romantic film, filmed by Andy Tennant, starring Will Smith, Eva Mendez and Kevin James. <br /> <br /> This is about the professional dating doctor Wil Smith, known as Hitch, who helps men meet women they are interested in. He is currently helping the slim, awkward Albert, who is obsessed with a very powerful, famous and rich woman named Allegra. At the same time, Hitch became interested in gossip columnist Sarah, Eva Mendez, who was commissioned to write about Allegre. When Sarah’s best friend is disappointed in love with a man who Sarah considers to be a Hitch client, she plans to take revenge on Hitch, and misunderstanding leads the two couples to a conflict situation. This film is not one that men should see as it has many male beatings, both unobtrusive and hateful. There are also double standards that you must be blind to not notice. Hitch and Sarah are both very careful about the opposite sex, Hitch still loves women, despite his burns from them in the past, and teaches men to make them happy. But, of course, Sarah, a sexist fanatic, often makes sexist comments in the spirit of "men want to have sex with anything." She is obsessed and knows that she looks like a goddess and knows that there are no “real men” there. Most of all, I was annoyed by the “bad” guy who wanted to quickly communicate with Sarah’s best friend, who is a classic example of a defenseless “victim”, and even after Hitch refused her, received a blow from Sarah. after which she says: "Now I am satisfied." Add to this the "still depressed" vibrations that you get from Allegra when she is not allowed to spend her own money after you ask permission from the men's table. Despite all the garbage speculations and generalizations - women can always say when you are not frank with them? - This film has the right point of view that love simply does not exist in America. There are some funny moments in this film, such as Albert and his dancing habits, but in general this film only exceeds the terrible film “Honey” by the limit.
