This film is intended solely for fans of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. <br /> <br /> I’m angry with TCM for showing this mess more often than Bachelor Mother, a delightful original. I'm still angry that some Hollywood boobs thought it would be a good idea to remake Bachelor Mother by filling it with some inept songs that only serve to interrupt the flow of pretty comedy. Instead, Hollywood could spend the time, money, energy and talent on this terrible remake to give us something new and original - Wow, what a concept! <br /> <br /> Bachelor Mother (original) with Ginger Rogers and David Niven is a spicy stew boiling with sexuality. This is a wink of the 1930s in Heise. The Bundle of Joy (remake), with Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, is strictly milk and cookies. This is a handshake of the 1950s with Eisenhower. <br /> <br /> Which cast would you prefer to watch - Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher and Adolf Menge, or Ginger Rodgers, David Niven and Charles Coburn? For me, each cast member in the original version is much better than his / her counterpart in the remake. <br /> <br /> In the original the beautiful, young Ginger Rogers is at the peak. David Niven feels great as a somewhat spoiled, sophisticated and at the same time bewildered heir of a rich department magnate. And I always love to see Charles Coburn in the film. In the film “Bach-mother” he is priceless, like a desperate grandfather. <br /> <br /> In “Bundle of Joy,” Debbie Reynolds is her usual cheerful personality. She is good at this role, although her play (along with Fisher’s play) completely changes the tone of the story. As an actor, Eddie Fisher is hopeless. He absolutely lacks on-screen "presence". Here he is too useful for this story. His actions are completely mild and ignorant. In addition, his singing is so soft and unremarkable that it was completely forgotten by the whole world. The only time he didn’t really hurt was at Butterfield 8 - where, by the way, he doesn’t sing. Here, the only unsuccessful performances of Fisher are enough to spoil this film. Adolph Mendju, a favorite character, plays a decent role, but not one of the best. He makes more noise than commands. He and Fisher are not convincing like father and son. <br /> <br /> Do you see a musical for music, is the story just random? Or watch a musical for a story, with some (hopefully) good music used for seasoning? If the first, you might like this lame remake. Otherwise, you are much better off watching non-musical "Ginger Rogers", "Mother Bachelor"
