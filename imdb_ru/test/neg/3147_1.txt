I did not watch this show so much when I was young. And I think that I watched only one episode that was about the Railways, I believe, because I loved the trains and still do. Even then, I thought it was a children's show. I mostly looked at Arthur. The songs are pretty weird too. And I don't think that is so educational. They just sing some stupid nursery rhymes. This is a stupid show, all adults who love this are crazy! If you want good children's shows, watch something like Arthur, Mister Rogers Neighborhood or, even better, Playhouse Pi-Via. I thought Sesame Street was boring when I was little, but even that is better than Barney. Believe me, this show is pretty stupid, there are other children's shows that are better than this. I see a lot of reviews that many people do not like this show. Now there are several mature people. I hope they shoot this show off the air soon.
