I have seen this film several times, it is definitely one of the cheapest action films of the eighties. So, I think many viewers will definitely change the channel when faced with it. But, if you fall into the big trash, “Dragon Hunt” is created for you. The main characters (the McNamara twins) are sporting mustaches and look so funny in their camouflage dresses. One of the best scenes is when one of them gets a shot in the foot and still kicks his enemies into nirvana. This movie is really awful, but again, this is a great party!
