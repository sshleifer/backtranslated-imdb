Maybe it struck them in the 50s, but this is one of those films that are aging badly. This preaching, serious, oppressed working man sounds live broadcast in the "Playhouse" 2nd level "Rod Serling". The “plot” is written by this book, the problematic background of the character Cassevetes looks intrusive, and love interest is unconvincing and indecisive. <br /> <br /> Sydney Portier gives a good idea, but he is sure that there were annoying, haughty snot. If I had to work with this guy in the warehouse, I would probably also like to hit him with a grab hook. Jack Warden is good because, as usual, he plays Jack Warden. <br /> <br /> Like 90% of films rated by IMDb (be it classic, mediocrity or crap), somehow this score is 7 points. -Some stars. It in no way deserves it. Save your time
