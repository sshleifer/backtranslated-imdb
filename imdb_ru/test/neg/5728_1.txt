I watched this film or part of it in the hope that it would be fun to laugh at how bad it was, but it soon became clear that it was just silly. For one, you have the worst actors ever! The main "actress" Birgitta Nielsen is terrible, boring and hardly even attractive. And she, of course, does not look like a warrior who could easily kick the ass of a veteran warrior, but she does. And what about the feminist attitude is just hypocrisy. If one of her family was killed by a woman, then she attends some kind of warrior school or something like that to learn how to fight with men. She then joins the fat servant and his children's king, whose city was destroyed by Gedren. These two characters are just stupid and destroy the atmosphere that the film was able to create. After that, I could no longer perceive Nielsenâ€™s painful acting, as well as stupid cliches and lack of real action. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger as Kalidor was the only part of this film that actually made it remotely observable. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie about Conan, but this is just nonsense!
