I don’t remember, at least in the last ten years, a film that I liked less than Mia’s mom. From non-existent acting to disgusting singing, I shuddered at least once a minute. I do not believe that I could remember at least one short piece, which I endured. I know that I will never watch this disaster again. I can not believe that with such high expectations because of talent - Colin Firth, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, that the film can be such a failure. But to see the lack of acting, seemingly drug-induced dance, and then the horrors of horror, to hear the singing of Pierce Brosnan (!) and in case you missed it the first time, the one that I will never see again.
