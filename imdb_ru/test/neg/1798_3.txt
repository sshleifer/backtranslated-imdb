Taking the Horn on Conrad's Heart of Darkness is not exactly what I expected. Although this film is based on one of the most studied and interesting texts of history, it has become simply boring. The plot simply can not comprehend the viewer. In a sense, it looks indifferent. <br /> <br /> Traces of the text are easy to see, but still this is not the “Heart of Darkness” of Conrad. The screenplay by Benedict Fitzgerald (who also wrote The Passion of the Christ) simply uses Conrad as inspiration and thus becomes the “Heart of Darkness” by Fitzgerald. The film is simply not worth it, if you are not particularly interested in Conrad or, perhaps, John Malkovich.
