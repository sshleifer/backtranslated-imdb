Although he only made his debut film in Australia and went to the UK and then to America to continue his career, the Australians will tell you that the greatest movie star they ever made was Errol Flynn. I'm not sure that he ever returned to Australia after his success in Captain Blood. Nevertheless, I attribute this film to well-known Australian disrespect for having undermined one of their own. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem in telling the story of Errol Flynn’s life was that he told enough truthful stories in his life. until the very end in his memoirs "My evil evil ways." I could see that most of the film was based on this and on reading between the lines of this book. <br /> <br /> The infidelity of his mother to his father was not written, but could be inferred from reading My Wicked. Evil Ways. He did not particularly like a woman, it is clear from several sources. <br /> <br /> I would like the film to tell more about his adventures in New Guinea, so that for me it was the most interesting part of My Evil Evil Ways. As for his street fighting in the Depression, I tend not to believe it. Even if he succeeded in this, I guarantee that it would spoil his appearance enough, and he would never make a career as a leading person. <br /> <br /> However, the people living below think that the atmosphere of Sydney during the Depression was well captured, and Guy Pierce was charismatic Errol Flynn. The American public knows him best as an honest but honest Lieutenant Exley in Los Angeles Confidential, released the same year as Flynn. <br /> <br /> But the movie “Confidential Los Angeles” was a much better movie.
