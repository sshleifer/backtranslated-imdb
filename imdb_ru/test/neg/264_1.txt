Oh, how critics fell to praise their golden boyfriend Paul Schrader (author Taxi Driver), when this film was released. I have never seen the qualities that they discovered when I watched this movie that day, so I revised it to see if I understood it wrong. Mishima is extremely uninteresting. This is a cool, unremarkable film about the author living / working in a cold abstruse culture. Flat reconstructions do not attract your attention because they are emotionally drifting and stagnant. And the rest is just awful ... soldiers sing songs about masculinity, which they swear, how to brush their hair, admire swords, etc. <br /> <br /> This should be a triumph when you found out that you landed Philip Glass; but then you have to get something out of it. Eyeglass assessment does not offer anything different from his other works, and at the same time does not give the film any tangible value. In 2010, it should be clear to everyone that Schroeder squandered his career at work that is of no importance and importance (Cat People, AutoFocus, Light Sleeper, Patty Hearst, American Gigolo). He can tear you apart and kill the impulse of the film faster than anyone else. Schroeder made a resume full of lousy, amateur films.
