Bad Quentin Tarantino breaks, at least, I hope that this is what they wanted, because at least then I could respect the director for admiring Tarantino. One scene - the “singing” scene with Rose McGowan - is far from brilliant and brilliant for this film, and the director could be mistaken only by mistake. Thus, apart from his inspiration for Quinton and Rose McGowan and her one good scene, this film sucks. Some of the dirtiest conversations I've ever heard, I bet that McGowan speaks little because of how stupid her dialogue would be. Trying to be funny, never, trying to be dark and not doing, trying to be stylish and just soft. Whoever puts in money for such films, I hope that it was all the directors, so no one's money was wasted. If it were not for McGowan, the whole cast is terrible, and when McGowan is your best hmmm, I should be surprised.
