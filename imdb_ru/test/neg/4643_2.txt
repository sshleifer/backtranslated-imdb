I know that Full Moon, or any other film studio in this regard, can never bring back the funny and raw sense of science fiction that was the original “Trancers”. And with the last two recordings in the series, where Jack Det was instead of Jeff of Los Angeles in the Middle Ages, it became quite obvious that there was little hope of reviving the Trancers series. Inhaling a new life in a film is one thing, but to bring our main character out of his element and put it back in the past, well, it did not work! So now with Trancers 6 Full Moon has breathed so much new life into the series that we no longer even deal with Jack Det. Now we are dealing with his daughter Joe. Jack is in her body and must go into the past and once again fight with trances. <br /> <br /> * Minor spoiler: the first scene of the movie is revealed * <br /> <br /> To prove how bad this movie is, you only need to watch the first two minutes of the movie when the original Jack Det. But actually this is not Tim Thomrson. These are his clips and sound bytes connected together (believe me, you can say that they are linked together) terribly to provide the viewer with the latest from Jack Deth's real humor. And from that moment on, things are only going down. Having this girl, Joe Det, as our main character, while Jack Det should be in her body, is the worst idea in the world. When this nice young woman behaves like a rude and tough man, this is not the way! It does not work, and it does seem silly. <br /> <br /> I don’t intend to go into the aspects of special effects and makeup, because most people who read this know what has become the full moon: indeed, it’s a low-budget enterprise. I don’t know what to say about this film, except that I really would like the Full Moon to be as it was during the days of Demonic Toys, Puppet Master and Trancers 1. Then, when the special effects were not very good, tell It was. They made serious b-films for serious fans of B movies and horrors, but this is not happening today with the new studios Full Moon. I yearn for the good old days and sincerely hope that the Full Moon will be able to pull myself out of this terrible recession in which they are now. <br /> <br /> Trancers 6 gets 2 out of 10.
