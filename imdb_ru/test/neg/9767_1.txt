This film was not good at all. I was able to catch it at the film festival and did not appreciate the content that I was forced to watch. This is a well-made film about a family that wants to reunite after the death of the cornerstone of the family (Gabriel Union). The stars of the film are Billy Dee Williams as the brother of the Union Gabriel Well, in fact, Gabrielle Union portrayed a woman in her early years, which should help explain why the woman was the elder sister of Billy Dee Williams. This should be the worst performance of Billy Dee William in his entire career. He looked as if he did not remember his lines in several scenes. He was an unpleasant, hardly ever sympathetic character who gave birth to a daughter, being married to a white woman with whom he already had a daughter. Two daughters are now older, and when the daughter he had with the white woman (Lucy) tried to contact him, his other daughter did not want to have anything to do with him. Billy Dee's character was so pretentious that the only way to get him to fly from Paris to his sister's funeral is to tell him that the funeral was already over, and his deceased sister left him, taking responsibility for the processing of her documents. Why did they have to fool him? Because he did not like to attend the funeral. I know. You ask, “But he didn’t want to attend his sister’s funeral?” Yes! He argues that he does not like to be close to the forced feelings that are shared by people who respect them. He wanted nothing to do with it. Now we have to empathize with this ** hole? The rest of the performances in the film were flat with equally flat characters. The director and editor did not think about how the film would develop. Memories were painful to watch. It was a bad movie. However, it seems to be a favorite at black film festivals; a film that glorifies African-American dependence on Caucasians to find love with which they can live, even if it is a healthy relationship. When such unsuccessful love stories win the best festivals at black film festivals, it makes me doubt the opinion of the black people about the film. At the same festivals, the only films that receive awards are educational films about African-American culture and black films made by directors of the Caucasus. I'm not saying that something is wrong with the white man directing stories written for colored people. The problem with these films is that they never argue from both points of view, which are usually films that are actually spoken to the masses. These films are often one-sided forms of didactism. These films fail to fulfill the authority of both sides of the argument that the film revolves around. Writers and directors never compose scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement, with the same truth and energy as those that enhance it. These films are always inclined to argue. I say that the people who conduct these black film festivals judge a film by its pure content, which means directing, acting, writing cinematography, editing, etc., for me, or they judge films by a strictly delivered message. about african american culture? Is it expected to expect a film like “Constellation” to get a chance to make films such as “Baby in a Million” and “Sideways” in the world? What happened to the entertainment movie? When I mean entertainment, I mean the ritual of sitting in the dark, looking at the screen, putting tremendous concentration and energy into what you hope will be a satisfying, meaningful emotional experience. Why can't these festivals appreciate films that preach without a sermon? Why these black film festivals do not recognize films that speak well of works that are absolutely honest and truthful? “I believe that we are not responsible for curing social problems or reviving faith in humanity, raising the mood of society or even expressing our inner being. We have only one duty: to speak the truth, ”- Robert McKee. Now I fully agree with this. The same black film festivals suppress "Hustle and Flo" as if it were that horrible film that stereotypes blacks. However, this is an honest film about a pimp with a dream. Pimp can't dream? I remember the last time I saw a real pimp, he was a man. And aren't they, pimps and prostitution a harsh reality in our society as a whole, not only in the black community, but in the whole world? The forces that are in “black Hollywood” believe that such films make African Americans look bad in the eyes of others, as if others don't know that there are pimps in the hood. The truth is that as long as African Americans in films do not accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world, our films will never have a chance in the world. This movie was terrible. The best thing was cinema and Zoe.
