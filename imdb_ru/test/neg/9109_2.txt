** May contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Okay, let's end this movie with one word: bad. Two words? Really bad. Now, why do I think so? Let me explain. <br /> <br /> Guttenberg heads a special brigade of four who are assigned to pick up the deadly virus after some arms dealer stole it from the laboratory. They do this by attacking arms dealers in mid-flight and somehow returning the virus after some struggle. However, there are suspicions regarding Guttenberg, because one of the terrorists knew his name. After parsing, the team members are attacked by unknowns, and everyone begins to suspect that everyone else is involved. Deciding that they cannot trust their bosses, they decide to steal the virus again and try to lure out possible intruders. <br /> <br /> Theoretically, this is a conspiracy that could work with a low budget. a film that just aims to be shown on television. However, the plot is compromised and the film is destroyed in several accounts. Firstly, the plot is completely predictable, and it’s not interesting to know how the film will end in three minutes. Secondly. Acting is really bad, or the actors are meant to act like dolls. I have not so many emotions, a change in facial expressions, etc. I was especially disappointed in Guttenberg with the fact that I could do much more, but I failed in trying to become a rude hero. In addition, although I am by no means an expert in this matter, I am fully confident that I could put together the best team of undercover operatives, picking up five strangers and teaching them during the week. This seems to be a theme in the film to make things as stupid and unprofessional as possible. This applies to both good guys, bad guys, and witnesses. Then I sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultants, if any, in the film. For example, I spilled liquid nitrogen on my hand, and I didn't break instantly. <br /> <br /> I don’t know how to actually do this, but let's say that this film has a predictable plot, a bad game and they seem to be amateurs by all means. Sorry, could not be better than that. Do not watch this movie, it's not even so bad, it's funny. 2/10
