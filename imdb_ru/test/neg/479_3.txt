Screenwriter, director and starring camp champion Bruce Campbell. It is easy to say that this is a budget for a meager deal; shot independently in Bulgaria. All I can really say for sure is that stupid is not always funny. Campbell plays a wealthy American businessman with a cheating wife (Antoinette Byron) and tries to close a business deal before they kill him. He hires a taxi driver to drive him through a strange little town; not knowing that his wife "continues" with a taxi driver. In a few moments Campbell was beaten; taxi driver killed in the same place. The mad scientist (Stacy Kitch) continues the experiment by putting the mind of a taxi driver on an American's head. With huge stitches on his forehead, Campbell breaks free and wanders the streets in search of his wife; all this time he argues with a strange voice in his huge head. Campbell distorts his resilient face, making silly expressions when he argues with himself. Thus, Bruce does what he does best, and undoubtedly his many admirers will be pleased. I have the impression that it should have been written as a direct comedy. The cast is completed by Ted Raimi, Tamara Gorsky and Vladmir Kolev. Keep an eye on this on the sci-fi channel.
