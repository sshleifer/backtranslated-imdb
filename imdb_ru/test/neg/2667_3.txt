Okay, just what the hell should all this mean ??? Halloween 6 (let's just call it that, okay?), Without a doubt, the most DEADLY film in the series (and from what I've heard, the look of the original “producers” doesn't sound like something less puzzling than “ official "release). What a mess. <br /> <br /> This is not a very bad film, as some have said. It has its scary scenes and some pretty intense moments - it just doesn't make any sense! Do not tell me that Michael was “designed” from the very beginning to be evil, kill and destroy, and blah blah blah. It was bad enough when they turned Michael into brother Jamie Lee Curtis (they just had a reason to leave her in the second film) - that’s too much. <br /> <br /> It would seem that this is another case. The filmmakers are trying to be “too clever” by coming up with a new premise that will shock and amaze all of us. Bad move guys. We are not looking for an explanation why Michael is killing, so please do not try to feed us this shit. Show me Michael, who looks menacing and kills a bunch of people. Show me Dr. Loomis, who is trying to track him down and, as always, come very short. Do not waste (what turned out to be) the last performance of Donald Plesance, telling me (in the most obscure way) that Michael was “created” by some cult from hell and that his “seed” will be passed on to another and ... oh brother. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 has its moments, don't get me wrong, and we all know that there were much worse sequels than this (Hellraiser, anyone?), so get what you can from this do (especially effective scene near the end of the film, when Michael attacks along the deep red corridor) and try to ignore the plot of the worm. Hopefully, one day we will all be able to see a “producer producer” and maybe get a chance to make (a little) more sense in all this. Until that time, this will have to be done ... <br /> <br /> -FTM
