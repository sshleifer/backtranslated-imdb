First of all, this film is terrible to nausea, and I advise you to avoid it at all costs if you ever want to eat ice cream again. I tried to look at it because it looked like it might be funny, but it soon became rather disturbing because of the ice cream made from body parts and surprisingly graphic effects. It starts with a boy named Greg, who witnesses the terrible murder of ice cream (later Greg goes crazy and becomes the main character) from what seems to be the murderers of the crowd. There is no explanation for this murder, making it the biggest WTF event in the whole movie. Other, less important points of the WTF include a surreal asylum, where Greg is going (with the participation of evil clowns), a woman speaking in tongues, because she was obsessed with the Holy Spirit (what it has to do with what I don't know), that Olivia "Holy crap, her career hit so hard," - in this Hussey. <br /> <br /> None of these reasons is sufficient reason to view this. The only reason for the Tuna character is that he is a skinny guy with pillows stuffed under his shirt, so he looks like a fat kid. For some reason it seemed funny to me. I didn’t sleep all night than I should have watched this film, just to see if there was any reason why they couldn’t use a real fat man for this role. Although I fell asleep to the end, I learned from other reviews that the Tuna eventually loses “weight”. Well, they didn't have the budget to really implement it. Suggestion to the director: how about making the character ... not overweight? <br /> <br /> That's all; If the prospect of Tuna has not interested you sufficiently, there is no other reason to admit the existence of this film. If disgusting horror films about ice cream are your preferred source of entertainment, check out the much superior “Material” instead.
