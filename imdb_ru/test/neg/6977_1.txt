Sitting in a large armchair with armrests, with a huge book in her lap, the one and only Bela Lugosi looks into the camera and in terrible vocal speech, which sounds like he is mocking reading Shakespeare, it sounds clumsy: the constant feeling for unknown things that come from endless periods time reveals a lot of startling things (giggles), startling? because they seem new (Lugosi’s eyes are now bulging, with raised eyebrows and mocking mouth, he continues) most of them are not new, signs of the ages ”(CUE of visual lightening accompanied by the sound of thunder, which then continues to rumble for an amazing 86 seconds). <br /> <br /> And so begins the fact that perhaps the worst film ever made. This "film" is almost beyond description. Narrated in the style of half-thought with an invisible narrator explaining the plot ... as it is ... the story revolves around the vicissitudes of a man named Glen (Ed Wood Jr.) who dresses; hence the reference to Glenda. The film has no real structure. Instead, it consists mainly of a random assortment of vignettes, which may ... or may not ... relate to Glen or to the motif of disguise. One long sequence consists of some unknown woman wriggling on the couch, followed by a man who beats a woman in what we call S & M. today. <br /> <br /> Then, at odd moments, Bela appears without apparent reason. and talks more meaningless dialogue, for example: “When he is wrong, because he is doing the right thing, and when he is right, because he is doing the wrong thing; pull the string, dance under it. " BUT? <br /> <br /> About twenty percent of videos are made up of videos, followed by a VO storyline, which is linked to the motive of the storyline, but not to frames. From here we see video materials: noisy city streets, motorways, a huge herd of buffaloes and a playground full of children. But it gets worse. In the dressing film, we have 58 consecutive seconds of footage of the hot steel casting furnace and 84 consecutive seconds of the scenes of the battles of World War II. <br /> <br /> Even the simplest things don't work. In one scene, we see the headline of the newspaper, which reads: "A man dressed as a girl." Under the heading, which was clearly pasted or pasted, an article about ... taxes. In one of my favorite scenes, a woman behind the scenes publishes: “Airplanes, why against the will of the creator,” in a voice that sounds as if she had just inhaled helium. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Lyle Talbot, the acting is terribly awful. Production design is cheap and boring; (but you gotta love these sticky wallpapers). Editing inaccurate. Most of the background music is only suitable for elevators of the 1950s. B / W cinema has too much contrast. And the costumes look like something that came from a thrift store. <br /> <br /> This film is so bad that Plan 9 from space, for comparison, looks like Citizen Kane. I just don’t know how to make a movie worse than the Ed Wood movie Glen or Glenda. But, fortunately, it has Bela Lugosi. Every time he opened his mouth and looked into the camera with those big bulging eyes, I almost fell to the floor with laughter.
