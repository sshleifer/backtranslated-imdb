Who the hell is responsible for this terrible distortion of one of my favorite books? That's just terrible. terrible game, terrible script. History is not even close to its old self â€” and what were they thinking about? Robin Williams, for God's sake! This is really beyond description. I don't see it. Seriously, don't. Not even for a laugh. Especially if you're a fan of the book. It may just be the worst adaptation of the movie - everything is divided and broken - the characters that are important for understanding the sequence of events are seriously isolated, and every potentially interesting place in the book has been changed (example: Vienna - New York) into something deeply uninteresting. <br /> <br /> For those who have not yet read the book, this is mostly a fictional biography about a writer who has grown up, is studying his letter, and so on. His mother writes an autobiography, which is welcomed (despite her protests) as a kind of feminist manifesto. The book is well written, attractive and long. His prose is simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> This film, on the other hand, talks about Robin Williams, who once again tells us to seize the day.
