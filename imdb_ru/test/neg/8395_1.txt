This film is, frankly, the worst piece of trash I've ever seen. it is slow, the plot is less and boring. filmmaker deserved to be shot. There were different aspects of the unintended comedy, one of which was Jared's strange camp. Raised a lot of laughter, but also yawns a lot. do not look with anyone, anytime, anywhere. If you hate someone, recommend him to buy or rent it. a great waste of time and money. Thank you Gus Van Sant ... no. I can't think of anything else to say, except that I never watch this movie, it will make you jump off a cliff. I hope that Gus and his comrades read this comment before it is too late, and he makes a sequel or some other catastrophe with what seemed to be filmed using a camera phone.
