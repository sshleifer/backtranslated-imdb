I think the cards were stacked against the webmaster, because from the very beginning there was such an itchy feeling that something was wrong, but I could not figure out how to do it. Then it struck me. Dubbed. For a while, they controlled most of the lines, either voice-over or off-screen, with a little hint here and there, until it became painfully obvious. This type of dubbing gets on your nerves and there’s nothing funny about it. I hate duplication, but at least the martial arts films that are poorly duplicated seem to be inappropriate, as a rule, they have a sense of humor about it. <br /> <br /> I needed a movie about a hacker who does real hacking and things like that, Maybe the other side of the table of the movie “Hackers” (about a person trying not to let them in, but about people trying to enter ). What I got was some poorly written, sometimes pointless murder mystery with a bunch of bad chase episodes, a supposedly inept hacker, castrated without his little ego, and the director, who clearly did not know how to handle the camera. I just wanted to get there, grab the guy's camera and shoot the damn thing myself. Editing was not much better. Actions? Well, I think if the main guy didn't have such a bad script from which he would work, he would be at least watchable. The main bad guy was okay too, but almost everyone else was a joke. Duplication didn't help, but the acting was pretty bad, even taking it into account. <br /> <br /> Before I get to the worse things, let's think about a few good things. Well, once or twice. Despite the elementary graphics, I rather enjoyed things in the cyberworld, the few that were in them, and I would prefer to watch films mostly about, inside and around it, than about the cool environment outside in the “real world”. The falsifying fingerprint thing looked cool, but in the end it turned out to be useless in this aspect of things. The cordial gadget that reminded me of Kronos Guillermo Del Toro was interesting, although since the plot device had been torn from the pages of Escape from New York, it was terribly intended in the long run. There is one moment when the bad guy is unconscious, and our hero is right there. Why didn't he then try the bad guy's thumbprint (since the heart device was activated by the thumb)? However, some interesting gadgets and cyber materials, if they could be used better. <br /> <br /> Now, who dares to compare this film with Blade Runner? Both films will take place somewhere in the future, and in both films there is some unusual novel, sort of like. There is a murder investigation, but I have seen a lot of murder movies in the center that are neither like the Blade Runner nor the Webmasters. Identity, for example. This is where the similarity ends. Period. There is no comparison as there would not be between Blade Runner and Hackers. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director who is well versed in art and knows some of the basics of filmmaking, for example, where to put a camera. The webmaster is cheap, and not just because of the budget. This is cheap because of bad writing, and because most often he chooses the easy way (for example, writing a character who barely appeared in the first place to save the girl at the end so that she gets to point B without a Hero). so that he can do his own thing. Very comfortably. Or the factor of sympathy for the character, about which we have no reason to care. Or meaningless things, such as a machine set up to stop them so that someone can leave.). <br /> <br /> He is trying to be fashionable, he is trying to exploit, he is even trying to finish the turn, which is not surprising, and he is trying to be exciting. But a bunch of almost identical episodes of chase, bad writing, editing, terrible shots, bad games, etc. Does not make an exciting movie.
