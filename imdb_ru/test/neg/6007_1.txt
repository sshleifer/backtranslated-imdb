overvalued, poorly written, poorly acted. The academy generally watched it? I think no. political content guaranteed him an Oscar nomination - the Indo-Pakistan border - a little boy, terrorism. Everything connected with the word "terrorist" attracts attention in this post of 9-11 world. it's like Holocaust movies that are guaranteed an Oscar nomination regardless of their merits. <br /> <br /> and, please, cinematography does not mean taking pictures of landscapes, which are primarily cute You have to be a rotten shooter to spoil the beauty of the desert. at least it didn't win an oscar. at least they got it right. it would be a parody.
