I rarely saw an action / unknown movie that was so boring. None of the action scenes is exciting, the storyline is nothing special, except for a couple of actors, the acting is bad. Charlie Sheen (Platoon, Major League) plays a major role in the headquarters of the White House, who finds himself in the center of a conspiracy who wants him and other people to die. Donald Sutherland (“Time to kill”, “Fallen”) plays a friend who tells everything he can, and Linda Hamilton (Linda Hamilton, Terminator, Dante Peak) plays a reporter who is involved in the situation. Charlie Sheen is fine with the star, Donald Sutherland is a good actor who plays well. Linda Hamilton gives a bad job. With a bad movie, I really might like it if it has a good ending, but this movie has a very crappy ending with some almost ridiculous things.
