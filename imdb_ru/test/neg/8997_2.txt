After reading the brightest comments about this film, I decided to rent it, despite some suspicions in television films. I had to follow my instincts. <br /> <br /> I tried so hard to warm the film and find meaning in it, but I just could not. The story never attracts you and does not sound believable, and the game is sloppy at best, and ridiculous at worst. Everything in this performance is amateur. <br /> <br /> Mary is happy to look at her with joy. She may be the only performer who can avoid this disaster without damaging her career or reputation. I will not even check the name of the lead person - I hope he again appears in advertising. <br /> <br /> Even poor Vanessa Redgrave, whom I adore and respect, all the time seemed to be directed by Katherine Hepburn in the role if she really was dope at home. Perhaps she needed money. <br /> <br /> If I can save one person from losing 100 minutes for this prank, I will feel justified.
