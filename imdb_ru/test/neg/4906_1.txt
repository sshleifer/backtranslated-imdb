I respect Mike Hodges, and I really liked Get Carter for his bleak prospect, but Croupier just looks like a boring ITV drama. <br /> <br /> Restrained, cold game - not just the prerogative of the protagonist. , it applies to the entire cast, that is, nothing can oppose the character of Owen. <br /> <br /> None of the characters evoke any feelings at all, except boredom. The end of the film is also untidy at best. <br /> <br /> Camera work, etc. Pretty good, but if you want to see how Hodges looks best at Get a Carter, don't worry about this uninteresting, unintelligible trawl. emotions he lit up better 20+ years ago
