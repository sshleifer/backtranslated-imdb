Today You Die was the 4th Seagal film in the mini-marathon that I just held. Wow, I don't know where to start. As time goes on, he mumbles his lines more and more, and the scenes between Seagal and Trich, where they seem to be improvised, are confusing. And what does his girlfriend's dream have to do with anything else in the plot? I can not recommend it to anyone except the strongest fan of Seagal, and even then you are better off with his earlier work. Of the 4 films in my marathon ("Under Water", "Into the Sun", "Alien" and "Today You Die") was the worst today. The previous reviewer mentioned this, but the use of the footage was quite obvious.
