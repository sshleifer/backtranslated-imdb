The interference begins with the fact that the unemployed Martin Sanders (Andres Bagg) hears something strange on the phone, hears a mysterious man talking to a prostitute named Diane and getting ready to meet her. Shortly after Martin reads the local newspaper and sees on the front page a story about the murder of a prostitute and remembers what he heard. Martin trusts his friends Laura (Virginia Lustig) and Aaron (Oliver Kolker), but they don’t believe him. Then, shortly after the same thing happens again, the newspapers report a phone call, a man, a prostitute, and her death. Martin decides that he must find the killer and put an end to his murderous fun, but who is it? <br /> <br /> This is an Argentine production, which obviously was filmed in just eight days (why so long?) With a budget of about $ 3,000 (why so much?) Sergio Eskenazi wrote and sent, and I can't believe some of the brilliant Interference comments regarding IMDb. Of the 195 user ratings I’m writing, 113 of them rated this bunch of crap 10 out of 10, sorry, but no one can make such a bad movie, literally, the perfect score of 10 out of 10. If the score for an IMDb movie is fixed, that's all, I honestly do not believe that if you showed the Interference to 195 average people, more than 100 of them would rate it as absolutely perfect, not on Earth at all. User comments are also surprisingly positive, and all IMDb users who wrote comments for just one movie are. One user (except me), who actually wrote more than one comment, gave him the bottom of 1 out of 10, which sounds almost correct. Everyone has the right to their opinion, but I would put my life on the fact that most of these positive comments refer to fake accounts created solely to get this piece of shit. Where do I begin? How can I adequately describe how bad the interference is? The plot is a mess that basically lives or dies because of its horrible twists, while most twists turn the plot on its head and change the perspective of everything that was done before, in a smart and appropriate way, and this is the real surprise here. Interference, which twists the first half of the film and makes it completely meaningless in the sense of “this did not happen”, and the turn is so badly treated that it leaves you more questions than answers. What made Martin go crazy? Why did he submit phone calls? Why did he introduce the killer? Why did he present the headlines? There is no explanation for Martin’s behavior for an hour or so of that film, there is only one absurd revelation that he had all this in his head, and that was all, that’s the whole exposition. Then there is a plot twist about Martin's missing wife and her lover before Martin, for inexplicable reasons, starts killing his friends for no apparent reason. Sorry, but the Interference is so bad, so boring, so poorly written and thought out that, frankly speaking, I can't figure out what to say about this positive. Sorry, man, but this is what I feel, simply “Interference” is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and this is a complete mess both conceptually and technically. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, Interference was hot in just eight days. Honestly, this is not the case. No, it seems to me that he was shot dead in five days! The whole film is goosebumps, at Interference, probably the worst night shooting I've ever seen. It was as if no attempt had been made to illuminate the scenes, as if the creators had just entered a dark room or basement or something else and were simply shooting the scene, regardless of whether you saw anything. The scenes that take place on the street during the day have this horrible, unnatural blue-green tint for them for no apparent reason, which just looks stupid and is becoming increasingly annoying. This strange tint is not repeated on the inside scenes, so they are also quite sharp and noticeable. There is no real horror or panic, in fact I would say that Interference is more like a thriller than a horror. As for the blood, in the refrigerator there are two decapitated heads, a knife is pierced into someone's mouth, and nothing else. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, its budget was about $ 3,000, which makes Interference one of the lowest-budget films ever commercially released for sure? Some people think that because of the limited budget of the film, all reasonable viewing standards should go beyond that, and we should accept any old nonsense, not so! To watch this on a DVD, you still have to pay good money, and I personally think that we have the right to expect some kind of good product. If it can be released and rated as Oscar-worthy, then we can all release our holiday camcorder footage (including awkward karaoke shots and total darkness scenes, since we forgot to remove the lens cap) and win top prizes at the next Cannes Film Festival! Acting is terrible, although the leading woman Virginia Lustig is actually quite sexy and helps alleviate the pain of the last twenty-odd minutes, as she shows a lot. <br /> <br /> “Interference” is an absolutely horrible film, seriously, I beg you not to be fooled by all the fake positive comments, no one will be involved in it or have any agenda to give it 9 or 10 out of 10 Amateur mess that is really terrible to sit through. Sorry, but as I understand it, sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind ... you have been warned!
