The Chairman of the Board of the Carrot Top and its AT & T commercials are vivid proof that the fecal mass carried by flies is available in orange. However, FREE is not available, as HBO charges for such garbage. Blehhh The highlight of COTB is that it undoubtedly fills suicide hotlines across the country, possibly providing work for thousands of telephone therapists who lost their jobs when the restored memory treatment was discredited, although (unfortunately) Carrot Top probably contributes to its decline AT & T sponsor line with increased phone traffic from exhausted HBO viewers. I can visualize crowds of injured viewers, a phone in one hand and a fully charged .45 car in the other hand, gathering despair at the last minute before getting off the board of life to escape from the ghost of the COTB echo sly monster echoing in their synapses, as the throes of burning, irreversible meningeal edema.
