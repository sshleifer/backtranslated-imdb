I read reviews of other hacks on this film, and although it is certainly not the best film ever made in the science fiction / horror genre, it's not bad if you accept it for what it is. budget, travel to b-film, which (let's say) “borrows” from such as “Alien” (nasty alien monster who cocoon their victims), “Species” (gorgeous and intricate “cosmic girl”) and “Incubus” ( Breeding angle of the beast with captive girls). This one is a seriously stupid film, and all this was obviously done with a limited budget, although the alien is not so bad (in any case, I saw much less convincing costumes in rubber suits). None of the cast is Oscar material, and the Isle of Man really doesn’t double for Boston, Massachusetts, very convincingly. The plot is also quite predictable, and the premise that the alien ship had to travel billions of miles and hit the ground in the center of the campus, where all the girls — thus conveniently providing a rich source of perfect breeding victims — is completely ridiculous. However, the film has its alarming moments, there are several servings of nudity and half-nakedness, and there is one of the few appearances in the film by the beautiful and tragic model / actress Kadamba Simmons (as “The Cosmic Girl”), which Aged 24 For years, her jealous boyfriend killed her in London shortly after making this film.
