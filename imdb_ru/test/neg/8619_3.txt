Even though it was set up to be a showcase for some kickboxing and sword playing, "Vampires: The Turning" (VTT) may have been aiming for it. Since he does not even claim to be a good vampire film, VTT cannot deliver the blow he might have tried. <br /> <br /> Using the idea of ​​an 800 year old Thai vampire was interesting, but the story of the offspring that she mistakenly brought to life (and now has to wipe off the face of the earth) actually reminds me of Gizmo and his plight in Gremlins, and that's not a good thing when it comes to a vampire. > <br /> Stephanie Chao is attractive and acts very well as a “good” vampire, but she lacks emphasis when you realize that she is an 800-year-old vampire. In addition to this, when she tells Connor that he is a “young soul,” she does not give a line with the weight that you expect from the “old” soul. Attractive, but not believable. <br /> <br /> Meredith Monroe was more believable in her role, but for a graduate of "Dawson's Creek," you might think that she would have more screen time. The question of whether Amanda is inferior and "turning" is the most compelling reason to continue watching this movie, and you will never get it. You get to tease it, but you never get any type of character development for this plot device. This is a cheap way to play your audience, guys. <br /> <br /> If you want something that is a good movie about vampires, find Lugosi’s Dracula, and if you want a sexy movie about vampires, you have dozens of Hummer clicks with much more power than this. After all, if you want good or sexy, this is not the place. It is simply forgotten.
