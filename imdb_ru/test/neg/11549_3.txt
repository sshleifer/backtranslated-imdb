Admittedly, I tuned in to this in the hope of seeing a few frames of James Brolin. Unfortunately, there was only one film at the beginning, and the rest of the film was very boring and, ultimately, did not make much sense. <br /> <br /> The story of what came out of this is focused on Nick and Julie Atkins, a couple whose marriage is beginning to become obsolete. Nick, a successful businessman, is focused on work to such an extent that he ignores Julia, who is trying to fill the void, returning to school. Julie's longing for the passion that she and Nick had at the beginning of their marriage begins to take the form of powerful sexual fantasies that block reality for a few minutes at a time, forcing her to do such things as a hot breakfast and fold her husband's papers. At first, she fantasizes about her husband, but as the film progresses, she begins to fantasize about other men and about encounters with random strangers with whom she meets. This leads to the fact that she plays out her fantasies with disastrous consequences for her marriage. Can she and her husband rebuild their relationship? Is it worth saving? <br /> <br /> This might be an interesting assumption, but the penalty is so mild that you wonder why they were worried at all. Characters are not developed. Motives are not explained. Reference information is not provided. No research is being done on how Julie got to such an extent that she could not control herself, and no explanation is given of how she will do it in the future. The end product is a mess that is as confusing as Julie’s fantasies, which are surprisingly underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> The game is a mixed bag. Donna Mills, like Julie, does a good job with the material she is given, although her constant self-pity really becomes harsh after a while. James Brolin behaves as if he reads his lines from cue-cards, and even his anger because of the unfaithfulness of his wife is difficult to buy, he shows so little passion for the whole problem. Support roles are usually forgotten. <br /> <br /> Disappointing interpretation of what could be an interesting story. It’s more a pity, because he doesn’t even offer the eye candy that he promised.
