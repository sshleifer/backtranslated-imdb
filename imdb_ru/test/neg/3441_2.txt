These authors try to recreate the characters that they have on the scrubs in another lesson, but the characters with whom they are stuck do not have charisma or acting ability, not to mention writing, seem to be bad and light. These guys are trying to create something that would be good if the composition was not so disgusting that it would leave the show only a lifeline to be two attractive teachers who barely support it. The humor on this show seems to be trying to attract an audience with I.Q. 40 or lower. Another reason why this show is unsuccessful may be that the scrubs script is great, and this show must follow it, leaving the viewer in a strange position, not knowing, crying or just losing hope in new sitcoms. together. This is just my opinion, but I think these guys have to stop now before they humiliate themselves more than they already did.
