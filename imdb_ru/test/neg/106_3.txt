Dr. Stevens (Michael Harvey) is in a mental hospital. He has a different approach to insane. He conducts unorthodox treatments. He treats everyone like a family, there are no locks on the doors of patients, and he allows some prisoners to fulfill their perverted fantasies. He allows Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) to dress and act like a soldier, and Harriet (Camilla Carr) becomes the mother of the doll, including allowing her to put her to bed in her cot. Dr. Stevens outside allows Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross) to cut a log with an ax, this becomes a bad move, because as soon as Dr. Stevens turns back, the judge puts an ax in his shoulder. Shortly after nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotic) arrives at the sanatorium, agreeing on a possible job with Dr. Stevens. She is met by the head nurse, Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Broom in the role of Anna McAdams), and she is invited to go all the way. She learns and becomes loved among patients. However, in the end, everything starts to deteriorate, the telephone lines break, an elderly woman named Mrs. Calling (Ray McAdams) cuts out her tongue, and she has a strange feeling that something is somehow wrong. Then, one night, all the dark secrets of the Sanatoriums are revealed with the use of violence. Producer and director S.f. In this film, Brownrigg has a great central idea, which is built into the cool finale, but ultimately it's hard work, due to the limited budget and the rather slow script of Tim Pope. Prisoners have too many boring dialogues, not much happens until the last twenty-odd minutes. The film has no real visual quality, as it was completely filmed at the Sanatorium, and its territory, in fact, is a large empty house in the middle of nowhere. There is no graphic blood, a few splashes of blood here and there, and that's a lot. There's a little naked, but not like blood. The game is quite strong, especially Golotik and Broom. The photo is flat and uninteresting, and I can't even remember what music was like. Completing a sharp turn is excellent, but it will take too long to get to it. A film that had great potential, which was probably held back by its budget. Well, I think, but I think it would have worked much better if the story had been turned into a half-hour episode of "Tales from the Crypt."
