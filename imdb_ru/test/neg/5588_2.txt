Wow, what is it on the shelf of a video rental store in front of me? Nothing but doubtful "continuation" up to 8 mm. This was not a very good continuation of the film, which had a very definite end and an abundance of emotional depth much greater than this film. <br /> <br /> Essentially, from the literal description of the plot, American diplomat David Huxley, and his bride, Tisch Harrington, venture in the dirty underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary, to find out who blackmails them with porn videos , filmed from them with a prostitute, Risa. The whole story is based on the different characters that make up these various sex clubs and undress throughout the city. The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish learns that the ransom for the video and (essentially, later in the story) her bride, who left the money of her trust fund, mostly returns to her future husband, as the story unfolds to the very end . <br /> <br /> I didn’t like how it had nothing to do with the original 8 mm. The only thing closest to the original is the type of thriller he had, the fact that David ends up with some tricky trick to keep him captive looks like the strange world of the first movie, and the fact that the whole movie has sex decorated on almost every key scene. Otherwise, it is a completely different movie. This created a lousy love story before the end was known, which makes the ending more likely, because I didn’t believe the words coming from David’s mouth all the time. But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that could cause him trouble. <br /> <br /> In most of the “shocking” moments of the film, there were funny nude scenes that tried to evoke emotions. in the audience, to cheer for Tish, to figure out the plot so that she can leave this "hellish" sexual debauchery. I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed episodes when there was nothing but sex to show. Even the menu screen on a DVD is nothing more than a movie with naked women on it, which makes the DVD completely provocative. <br /> <br /> David was not a hero throughout the film. You could guess that he was the main problem long before the end. All the actors who played every role were new to me, which may explain why they forced so many of them to undress in order to achieve acting “respect”. There were gaps in the plot (How did David and Richard finally impressed Tisha on his father, getting the rent they wanted when David was so passionate about this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?) There were some technology-related moments (for example, for electronic correspondence as the queen of slavery), and the character-brother-gay, who only did what he showed, as the director tried to get a fake of Joaquin Phoenix to play this character. The tag line shown in this profile for this video is also a complete BS, because it was not about the last breath. No one really dies. But they had a good sequence of car accidents that came out of nowhere ... but it was a good 10 seconds out of an hour and 3/4 of a movie. <br /> <br /> Take a ride (and possibly buy) the original. This is one of the best and more original films by Joel Schumacher. This movie is better. I would not recommend to see this if you do not want to compare apples with oranges.
