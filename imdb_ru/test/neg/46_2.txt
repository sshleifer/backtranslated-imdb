Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in the “screaming teen” of horror cliches with a more thrillerlike rhythm. In a sense, the Acolytes are very successful, but in many other respects the film fails. <br /> <br /> In general, Acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of naivety and innocence of youth in endless horror films such as Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers have sex, run around with a cry and one by one they are broken by some kind of monster. Instead, this innocence is replaced by pride, vengeance and arrogance. The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from imminent death and despair, but they could not do it because of their own demons. In the end, you have the feeling that there was no (and perhaps no) innocent victims. <br /> <br /> As the name implies, the film also strongly affects following the leader or authority. It was used in the literal sense of whether the main character would look like a serial killer, and was also used less directly throughout the entire film. Following the central figure is a recurring theme throughout the film. <br /> <br /> All this time, the filmmakers also included a lot of clichés, which I suspect were intentional and gave the film a unique blend of depth. like superficiality I found intriguing. This, perhaps, inadvertently goes well with the characters, which at first glance are very superficial, but as the plot develops, it becomes obvious that they, at least, are the two main male characters, rather complex. <br /> <br /> Technically, however, the film has many problems. Cinematography, which, as a rule, is highly valued, I find quite sophisticated and overly stylized, using the formal 2/3 approaches too rigidly. Many transitions that I felt were also overly stylized. The use of symbolism was not only vague, but excessively used. <br /> <br /> The plot was poorly planned and based solely on misinformation to achieve a rather unexpected end, which was poorly resolved and left the audience embarrassed. The methods used to resolve the climax are cheap and poorly prepared, the motives are usually unclear, and the plot points remain ultimately unrelated. <br /> <br /> In general, the relative originality, themes and theses of the film are lost in the labyrinth of poor technical execution, overly stylized images, obscure motives, dull and unnecessary symbolism and cheap bends, supported only by the absence or completely incorrect information. <br /> <br /> If the film were better executed, it would be great. However, Acolytes only get two stars, in my opinion.
