I did not understand people who rated it above 5. I think this is a terrible film from any point of view. Plots, acting, art, dialogue, music, whatever! I don't mind a low budget .. Anyway, you have to get some point. To wander, to be surprised ... meaningless ... then the two boys started kissing in bed. awful, just awful I love indie movies, don't mind it's slow. However, this film disappointed me from every point of view. Even Graffiti, not artistic. <br /> <br /> I was wondering what kind of people would like it. I am 30 years old. Is it for teenagers who have some kind of loneliness in life, or do I just not understand? What did I get then? Waste of time! Please go to some others.
