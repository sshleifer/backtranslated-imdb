Irwin Welsh’s follow-up activities in Trainspotting appear on the screen in three short stories in Edinburgh, featuring several Wales trademarks, drug culture, depression, the working class, and Hibernia football club. It’s not easy to look at places, it’s not less than very well written, 2 of the stories have a darkly comic twist, and the 2nd story is a serious (and shockingly realistic) plot. I will not appeal to the majority, including me, to some extent, but I will certainly accept the cult of followers.
