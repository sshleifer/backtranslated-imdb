I made this film at a local movie store, not expecting anything to flare up or present itself. Since it was a class B film, made with a very limited budget. The opening scenes of the film were quite original, as was the plot, and that was what made me rent a movie. However, the film becomes very boring and disappointing in some moments. There were a lot of holes in this story, and there were also a lot of disappointments in acting. By the end of the film, I prayed that a higher power would strike me where I lay, because I was very bored, but, more importantly, disappointed with how the story turned out. I still do not understand what really happened, and I do not care. In conclusion, the devil will cry with disgust, having learned that Hell (his region) was used as the basis for such a crap film.
