I looked through the first two nights before coming to IMDb in search of information about the actor. I saw a rating of 9+, which surprised me, since I was not impressed by what I saw. (For reference, I believe that the Lonely Pigeon was the best western TV anchor in history. I grew up with the MGM series in Culver City in the 50s and have a certain respect for the Western genre.) <br /> So, I I saw a glowing first review and decided to read "more." There I found several reviews with 1 or 2 stars, which well summarized my feelings about the lack of character development, poor editing, the feeling that he was shot in the background Universal (MGM is long gone), and the general impression that this is not so. going to come close to changing my feelings about LD. I got the impression that the overwhelming majority of those who decided to write were “less than 4.0”. <br /> <br /> This made me think about the process that gives a rating of 9+. If people giving dozens and nines do not waste time to justify their vote, are the ballot boxes filled with people with monetary motivation? I have long used IMDb as one of the tools for showing films and considered it the best available. Now I'm not sure about that.
