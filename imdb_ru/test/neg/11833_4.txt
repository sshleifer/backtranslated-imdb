Films about the mundane for me are often the most interesting of all the films in the hands of an insightful artist who studies all the perverted small details of the mundane. French cinema, it seems, often copes with such things very well, and I love French cinema. <br /> <br /> This film was about the mundane. It did not have much conspiracy. They were just characters who lived in the city, very normal people, and everything happened. But these were not very interesting things, and they were not studied very astutely. The film captures a bit of the mood, but it was not a particularly exciting mood. And although I can’t think a lot about what the film did completely wrong, almost at every level it’s not possible to do something right. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of characters in this movie. Many of them were similar to each other, so it was difficult to understand who is who, and what is their relationship with each other. I do not mind making some effort to understand the film, or even watch a particularly complex film, more than once to smooth out the details, but this was a mystery whose solution was not worth it for me. > The only good thing I can really say about this film is that the cinematography was enjoyable — functional, not brilliant, but enjoyable. The camera often took good pictures in the form of postcards. But it is rare to find really interesting little things in it. <br /> <br /> I saw some not very good films at the Seattle International Film Festival, but it was the only film that could not be obtained. any applause when loans rolled. I felt a big collective sigh of relief when the film finally ended. But I suppose there are people who would like it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
