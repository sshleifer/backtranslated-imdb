I, like many this evening, endured a cold winter and long lines to see what I expected to become one of the best films of this year. However, I remained hopeless in many ways after the loans collapsed. But, honestly, there were redeemed qualities (although there are very few of them). Let's start with what worked. First, the Lycans: in all senses? from their terrifying physicality to their pure ferocity. Action: sublimely visceral when this happened. Nayi / Victor & Shin / Lucian: Great. Now what was not (and there are many). It was not a movie, but rather a collage of episodes (and do not expect to see any characters from other films besides Raze and Tannis). There was a well-written storyline and something real to combine these pieces of film. The story seemed to start right in the middle ?? on the threshold where Lucian decided to rebel. Consequently, there was no context; no voltage; no sense of betrayal ?? devices needed to work the rest. Moreover, it ended in the place where the climax was to begin (which was to occur after the feud had cooled slightly). Oh, and that was too short. The purist will also be offended by certain freedoms, taken for certain facts previously revealed in the first two films, but judge for yourself. In the end, this film was held for a long time on short “background” scenes (for example, on the stages of various councils), and, as a result, we never recognized the main players ...). -D
