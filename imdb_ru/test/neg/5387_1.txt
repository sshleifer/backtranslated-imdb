I have not heard of “The Soap Girl,” but I saw a poster with a five-star review of the film “The Threat of Cinema” outside the theater, so I thought how bad it was? Well, I soon found out. My God, this film was terrible. The most wooden action I've ever seen outside of a porn movie. Absolutely painful dialogue. I just can not understand how it was done and why someone agreed to be part of it. And I find it completely incomprehensible that it was actually shown in the theater, and money was paid for it. How did it happen????? And most importantly, what did the guy think of the threat of films?!?!?!?!
