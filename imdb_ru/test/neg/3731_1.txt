The Feeling of Minnesota is one of the worst films I have ever seen, it is also one of the most disgusting films ever made. This is due to a woman who is forced to marry a disgusting mafia. At the wedding, she meets her brother Jax. They have sex in the house after eating a cake, and then decided to run away together. The other brother, of course, comes after him, blazing, and he kills his wife. Jacks wakes up to find her dead body in the bathroom and bury it. He seems to be friends with Jax, and they are trying to collect money together, because someone is blackmailing them, because he has seen them and the body. It happens around, and several characters die or come back to life, but it never comes along with something that could be called a good storyline. The performances are terrible to almost everyone. Cameron Diaz, Keanu Reeves and Dan Acroyed. Direction, dialogue and visual effects are just awful. Disgusting and terrible movie.
