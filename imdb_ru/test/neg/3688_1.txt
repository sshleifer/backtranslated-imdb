This may not be the worst movie ever made, but it is absolutely the most boring. I wonder why it is removed mostly in the dark, and Vincent Gallo moves away from the camera or looks down? Because he does not want to show his face for having agreed to participate in this film. I liked his early things, but the pretentiousness of the Brown Rabbit and the subsequent participation in this madman knocked him down in my book. And Val Kilmer? I really want to send him a sympathy card. "Doors" to this ??? In fact, the casting was the only reason I watched this movie, and Val did not even appear until the movie ended halfway through. Just a sad movie.
