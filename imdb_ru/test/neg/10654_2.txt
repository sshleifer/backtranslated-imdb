This film is terrible, it was so hard to believe that Katie became a sincere teenager, able to save the pitiful Chinese, there was no convincing argument in the film to prove it. And the rest of the plot made no effort to show us something more than cheap common sense ... <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, and the only thing we can extract from it is what it demonstrates, how arrogant a person can be. Cathy must have inherited her arrogance from her mother, the most annoying character I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> The game and the scenery were fine, but the plot destroys everything, full of cheap cliches and hypocritical scenes, I expect to not see this film in my life anymore. Skip this!
