Somewhere in the USA, young Claire manipulates her friends Mick, Billy and John, showing a letter that Bob will send to her, and the group cowardly beats up Bob, and Mick kills him with a piece of wood in the forest. Mick feels sad and decides to tell his mother what he has done, but John and Billy threaten him, with tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> I believe that “Wind” is the worst film I've ever seen in my life. The terrible scenario is ridiculous, and it is almost impossible to write a summary, as there is no plot or plot, only a sequence of detached scenes. Amateur and acting skills are amazingly poor and terrible. It's unbelievable how producers put money in such garbage, distributors release this crap all over the world, and viewers like me buy this DVD. I waited until the very last scene, because I was curious to see how bad this film could be, and I was impressed, as it is worse than I could have imagined in my lowest expectations. In the end, I wonder why IMDb does not offer a zero in the voting system, since the garbage really deserves this vote. My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Força Invisível” (“Invisible Force”)
