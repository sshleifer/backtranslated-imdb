Where do I start with Killing Mind, before mentioning the good? This film is about a young psychological profiling woman from the FBI or about something that for some reason goes to work for the police. There are several recognizable faces, such as “I love you, dude” from “World of Wayne,” playing cop (also a good age for a beard!), And two guys who seem to always play cops, playing .... You guess the cops. One of them was one of the cops at Gross Point Blank following John Cusack, and the other was an FBI guy with specifications in Final Destination, who is also in Fugitive as another cop. I know that the FBI, the American Marshalls, the CIA, etc., are not policemen, but they are all the same. To some extent, they enforce the law, making them cops in my book. Feel free to disagree with the definition of a cop as you like, they are still considered as those who are trying to knock down the bad guys. Anyone, I digress. A woman works alongside these police officers, who seem to be just sitting in the library in the basement or something like that, and for some unknown reason decides to resume the case, which was not considered by Jonks. She saw a dead body in childhood, so, naturally, she decided that she could open a case because she was personally attached to him! I also like how a person representing the psychological state of other people witnessed the scene of a murder in childhood. Of course, this is the thing that can screw someone's head ?! She starts asking questions to a certain journalist who covered the story when she was open, even if he seemed to be the same age as the woman, so he allegedly either wrote for the newspaper when he was 10, or he wrote several school reports on it, and she decided that he would be the best person to ask about it. <br /> <br /> Then we see that, like the resumption of murder cases 25 years ago, she tries her hand at petty theft, like some really imperceptible guy running along a busy street in a balaclava. The way to mix, dork! In any case, she and the police, who eat ice cream in the park, pursue him, and crossing the bridge with the woman and child standing on it, the thief grabs the child from the mother’s arms and throws the child into the river. This, if you have not guessed it, is the best part of the film. I'm not a sadist, and I have no hatred for children or anything like that, but the scene looks so stupid that I promise that you will get your pants wet by laughing at this if you watch this movie. It gets better when a policeman from “Final Destination” and “Fugitive” jumps to rescue the child, and then announces to his friend: “This is a child!” How he didn’t know that before he jumped, he followed me. <br /> <br /> In any case, she chases a thief, but loses him. Later, she recalls that a random dog did not bark at the thief, so she suggested that it was him, and decided to hunt down the thief through the dog. There were no marks on the dog or anything else, so as she learned where to find the dog and thus find the thief, this is another matter that I will not go into. shortly after, I stopped watching. The story moved very slowly, and after I stopped laughing at how to throw the child, I lost interest and missed what was said. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I will go ahead and accept that the killer was a typical journalist, because he seemed a little worried, and she spent a lot of time with him, and anyone who looks at Colombo knows that the person is outside the police who spend the most time with the investigator are your bad guy. In addition, other people's reviews say the killer was pretty obvious, so I'm sure it was him. <br /> <br /> In general, a film about pants, but it is worth seeing only one of this glorious scene.
