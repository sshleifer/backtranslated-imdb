If you do not like a bad game, bad editing, funny dialogues and incredible characters, you will hate this movie. If you like all of the above, then if you are a Lynch fan, then you will love Mulholland Drive. It is possible that this is the worst movie, which will be rated higher than 7.0 on IMDB. <br /> <br /> Besides the work of Naomi Watts, it will be difficult for you to find a competent actor in the Mulholland film. Acting School "hide your face with your hands when you don't have meatballs." Given the scenario with which they had to work, it is surprising that all the actors did not hold their heads in their hands. <br /> <br /> Characters roam and leave the film who do nothing to advance the plot. You have a bounty hunter, a mysterious cowboy, adultery and her clichild lover, a mafia figure sitting in a dark room that speaks through an external voice box, and many others too numerous and tedious to mention. Suffice it to say that they manage to do a little more than fill the screen time. <br /> <br /> This is not so bad as it distracts the viewer from the fact that there is no noticeable plot in the film. You will wait and wait until all the loose threads come together, and in the end you will be terribly disappointed. The hardest thing for a writer is to put everything together believably at the end of the film so that everyone feels satisfied. For a writer, the easiest way is to create a lot of odd characters and place them in scenes that are not related to the film as a whole, then take several consecutive streams and mix them at the end for the sake of surprise. Guess where Lynch is going. SURPRISE !! <br /> <br /> You know that you have a bad scenario when you have to resort to dream sequences to make some sense. In the end, the sequence of dreams covers all sins. Dreams should not make sense. In a dream, anything can happen. <br /> <br /> Editing is similar. Let's just say good editing doesnâ€™t attract attention. Much of the way of editing this film seems to be done with the sole purpose of drawing attention to the editing. "Look at me ... you see my editing ... Am I not a genius?" Well, well ... NO! This film has all the signs of the worst and most indulgent French films. <br /> <br /> So why is this movie so popular? My theory is that this is just another sign of the decline of our culture. Melodies are hard to compose, so let's listen to rap. It is difficult to follow the charts, so let's do without them. Pictures are difficult to draw, so let's pee a cup and insert a crucifix into it. These are symptoms of our time, and Mulholland Drive is another part of the disease.
