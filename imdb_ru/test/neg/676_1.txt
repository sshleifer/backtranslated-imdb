Tyra Banks should teach these girls that this is not only beauty. Inside also means something. Many of the past winners looked half decent, but terribly cruel and create problems for other girls. I see Tyra is less connected with girls in each season. The only thing worth watching Top Model is Mr. J. Manuel. Recently, Thira had a participant who was transgender before the operation. I felt that she had to do more to encourage her. It was obvious that she had no confidence that her original anatomy manifested itself in her feminine look. Tyra should have given her advice, or perhaps she sent a Tranny resident Miss Jay to help the girl. Instead, the participant was greeted with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism. It's a shame because I really enjoyed the first 3 seasons. There is a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons on DVD, and Top Model has only 1 season on DVD. This is called taste. Top model seriously needs to upgrade a little more humanity.
