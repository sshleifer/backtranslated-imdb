I think I would prefer my heaps to be clipped by a pair of rusted hair clippers than to carry another 5 minutes of this film. In fact, I did not even bother to go into details! Not sure how they managed to push the needles into the wooden actors to cure them! It would be better for all interested parties if they only bombarded the island after they found out about the virus, so it would last until the commercial break was over and we could continue to live. Plus one more thing was this nonsense commissioned by the god of the channel? All they seemed to do was praise the bleeding gentleman most of the time. Avoid the plague! Actually I would prefer this!
