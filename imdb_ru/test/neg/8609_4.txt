I watched the world premiere of this on Starz Action. They call it "Vampires: Turn." The plot was a bit confusing. In the introduction of the 800 years war there is a voice over, and I did not quite understand. A film about a young couple somewhere in Asia (maybe in China, I don't think the movie is pointing). The couple has an argument, and Meredith Monroe escapes and is kidnapped by a biker gang of vampires. The guy finds a group of vampires who do not kill people, and enters the battle with bikers. The human killer group is somehow involved, and the final sequence of the struggle occurs during a solar eclipse. This film has nothing to do with vampires or vampires: Los Muertos. An embarrassing, but worthy deed. Four out of 10 stars.
