I believe that Cockpuncher is the best work created at the Steven Seagal factory in a long time. This film was the first that I saw after that beautiful film. My point? He made. Every movie is the same. Maybe he will be good at machetes, because he will not be a star. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> P.S. Thanks for talking to UCSB when I went to college. It was a terrific speech. You really influenced some people. <br /> <br /> So, should I write ten lines about this movie? Mmm .... I like the smoker who killed a bunch of fools. Whenever someone smells like menthol look. Because there may be a deaf glock killer (and another loud one) who wants to kill you. <br /> <br /> Is it ten?
