I work in a video store that rents this video in Lexington, and I have to say ... that it was never made. I even know some people who have worked on it, who regret it. Bad effects, terrible game, especially a bad script. I swear, the dialogue would not have passed for the original PSX Resident Evil; it's so bad. If you want to know how not to shoot a movie, watch this movie to find out just one or two things. If not, do not waste your time. And even the director knows that it sucks, because he keeps coming to try and get us to sell the movie. No sir. I watched two thirds of the horror section, and this figure is even lower than Plan 9 from Cosmos. Even Ed Eud would say, “No. This is too stupid even for me. ”
