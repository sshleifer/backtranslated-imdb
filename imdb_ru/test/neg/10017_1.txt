The New York family is the last in its neighborhood to receive a television set that almost destroys David Niven’s marriage to Mitzi Gaynor. Bedroom comedy, which is rarely solved in the bedroom (and still nothing sexual happens there). Gaynor as an actress has about the same range as the oven - it turns on, it turns off. The only compensation for the film is the auxiliary work of fun Patty Duke, before “The Miracle Worker”, like Niven's daughter. She's gorgeous; "Happy anniversary" no. * from ****
