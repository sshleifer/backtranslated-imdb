I watched the movie after checking its rating on IMDb. Then it was at 8.0, and I thought, “Wow! That should be good. ” I thought wrong. The beginning of the film actually retains what the plot promises, but then it drops exponentially under its basement. I think that, without the character of Richie Knicks, everything could be fine - although he is the reason that the storyline goes on as usual. In my opinion, the character is too extreme and difficult to endure. In addition, the way in which the protagonist goes from the beginning of the story to its “climax” at the end, in part, does not matter and could be easily omitted - an alternative, I just did not understand the film. <br /> /> Although I have to admit that this is “easy viewing”, and I had no problems watching the entire movie when it ended, the final did not impress me somewhat. Overall, rather mediocre.
