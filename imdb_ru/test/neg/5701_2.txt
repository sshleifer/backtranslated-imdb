In this film there are EVERY clich√©s of all films about terrorism or the crisis of an airliner. <br /> <br /> However, it cannot be traced due to the good performances of Rowland, Loken and Smallwood (and, possibly, Enberg). <br /> What is surprisingly bad is the computer animations that they try to pass off as live scenes. Boy, o boy, the CGI scenes in The Last Star Fighter, shot in 1984, are better than these (shot 17 years later). The feeling of chepnis really makes your back tremble. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this film could have been much better, with a bit more budget and taste.
