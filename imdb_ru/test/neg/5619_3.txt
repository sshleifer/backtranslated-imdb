With this film directed by Roger Avery and Quentin Tarantino, who filmed the script, I was sure that it would be a pearl. I was wrong. I don't hate this film, but I don't like it at all. <br /> <br /> I love Roger Avery because of his amazing direction in the rules of attraction and his scripts to fiction and a quiet hill, but he is a mistake in that. do i really need to comment on tarantino, we all know that he is a genius. <br /> <br /> This film is only about a gang robbing a bank, but fails because of the stupid people involved in the robbery. <br /> <I’m disappointed in Tarantino and Avery for shooting this film, but I don’t change my mind about how amazing they are both. everyone makes mistakes ......... 3/10 ........... j.d Seaton
