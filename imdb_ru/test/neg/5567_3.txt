At the beginning of the 00s, production companies experienced a short passion for supernatural genre films in France after “The Crimson Rivers” and “The Brotherhood of the Wolf” turned out to be hits, so several films were green or saved from them. ” the live video "fate. However, France, unlike the United States, Britain or Italy, has a small tradition of fantasy B-films, and it quickly turned out that Samouraïs, Bloody Mallory or the continuation of Crimson Rivers were rash attempts recreating a kind of magic that never existed in French cinema.When they failed, the producers returned to their usual tariff: derived farces or the hundredth self-respecting tribute to the French “New Wave” of the former critic of “Les Cahiers du cinéma”. <br /> < br /> "Brocéliande" can only have been highlighted by the Enjoying this short window, as it serves no other visible purpose. This is your slasher film mixed with vague mythological elements and horror references, and you will find effeminate heroes that look like weird American campus, and the plot twists are so lazy that you don't care, because you guessed it one hour ago, even before the movie began. <br /> <br /> These elements make all the fun in the B-movie of the 70s or 80s, and you expect them in the movie of the 70s or 80s. However, we are no longer in the 80s, and no one warned the director Doug Headline, as this tribute to the slasher genre is nothing more than a derivative film Slasher. The title itself is not new, and since the early 1980s, he has been writing about such films as a critic, but as a director he has demonstrated a lack of skills and ambitions, which makes Brocéliande a bore. <br /> <br /> When you collect clichés from a movie subcategory and hand them to an experienced and resourceful director, such as Wes Craven or Quentin Tarantino, you get Scream or Death Proof, movies that are imitations of old guilty pleasures but also increase these cliches and add to them a lot. This is called “talent,” and therefore you cannot confuse these latest films with their original inspirations made decades ago. <br /> <br /> Brocéliande follows a lazy path and reproduces only the worst elements from past films (unfortunately, for the male viewer, the giver of nudity is mostly absent). There is a very strong resemblance (presumably unintentional) between the plot of "Brocéliande" and the offended "Halloween 3: Season Of The Witch", as both deal with the supernatural rituals of evil druids and some silly attempts to take over the world on Halloween night. Since even the plot of "Halloween 3" makes more sense than this, this means that something seriously went wrong with Brocéliande.
