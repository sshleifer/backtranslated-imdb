I thought maybe ... maybe it could be good. The early appearance of Resuscitator (Jeffrey Combs); a lot of respect for old horror movies; Troma label on the front panel ?? This movie can be a gem! I thought wrong. <br /> <br /> Frightmare is a boring, undervalued, underrated respect for the terrible films of the past. The story is old, young people rush into the house, get drunk, make love and interfere in things that should not be forged. Often ?? It uses a formula from recycled film-slasher, this time with a dead actor named Conrad Radzoff. In fact, the performance of the actor Radzoff Ferdi Mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film. He looks great with a haughty character in the style of Dracula. But as far as children are concerned, this is not so good, because Combs has only a minimal role. <br /> <br /> There is no entertainment value in the film, there is only one cool character and one or two scenes that can attract your attention, I do not recommend this movie unless you desperately want to see something the only film left in the blockbuster.
