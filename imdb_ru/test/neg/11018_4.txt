This completely ridiculous film is so confusing, pitiful and unrealistic that in all 90 minutes of ruthless torture I probably looked at the clock about 70,000 times! Lucy Bell is much higher than this nonsense, and for her to descend so low is rather distressing. I have to admit that the whole audience I was in was laughing hysterically, but most of them were Greeks or Italians, so I think this humor will probably make them laugh, but not me. All that makes this movie is sick of watching these idlers, who justify their stupid actions within 90 minutes. God, and I can never return those 90 minutes ago!
