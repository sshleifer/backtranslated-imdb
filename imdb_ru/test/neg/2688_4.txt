This film is really amazing, over the years I have gained a taste for films about Japanese monsters and I know well that early examples of this genre can be bad. However, this one reaches a new low as it follows the adventures of Johnny Socco (?), The Young boy who controls the Giant Robot, and his fight against the evil Gargoyle Gang, who seems to have an endless supply of horrible giant monsters to dispose of.
