When to start? Some guy has some kind of Indian pot, which he cleans, and suddenly Skeletor attacks. He hits a woman on the neck with an ax, she falls, but then she gets up and apparently does not suffer. She runs into the forest, and it turns out that in the forest there is a basement shopping center. She meets a maintenance worker and Skeletor attacks again. Fortunately, like any good maintenance worker, he has a gun and shoots a guy. It does not work, it all starts on fire. <br /> <br /> Some people walk through the woods. Despite the fact that they traveled together on foot, they sit down and introduce themselves to each other. Wouldn't they do it when they first met? In any case, they are "under cover" members of the Delta team (I think, under cover, because in this way they do not need to pay to put them on uniforms). Lovely girls are different things, such as a sniper instructor, and I can't remember the others. It doesn't matter. In the end, they all take out their weapons and immediately bring different things to them. ? In any case, they meet an old Indian who sits in the forest. He wants beans. Do you know how pork and beans? He mumbles some things, I can only assume that this is the premise of the film. I relied on hearing the premise from the commercials, because you can't understand what it says. <br /> <br /> So they walk around the forest a little more. All dialogue is a quasi-military burden. I mean all this, as in every single word. For example, "It reminds me of when we were in Kabul" or "It reminds me of when we were in Laos." Skeletor attacks again. Let me give you a brief summary of the main attack. One of the female characters is hiding behind a tree, and she is pointing her weapon at the approaching boy on a horse. For some reason, she does not shoot, but screams to someone else several times. Then, when Skeletor comes up, she jumps out from behind a tree so that Skeletor can stab her with her spear. Then everyone starts to shoot. Bullets cause sparks from trees. Obviously the people who made this film never shot a tree with a bullet. They do not produce sparks. <br /> <br /> Then Casper Van Dim suddenly behind the wheel of a half-car tries to run across Skeletor. He misses, and the truck stops. Van Dim was injured, apparently, he slipped through the seat and hit his hip on a window handle or something like that, so he crawls out of the truck, and it explodes. Later, he dies in the forest, and everyone says a bunch of quasi-military macho BS. They meet a couple of guys in the woods and tear down their “secret” status, immediately identifying themselves as from the army. For some reason they beat the guys and then they leave. <br /> <br /> There are other things, people are muttering, the camera is trembling, etc. I think this is, after all. <br /> <br /> My theory is that the Sci-Fi channel gets a little annoyed when everyone makes their films, so they remind us how bad the films can actually be. Like, do you think our films are bad? Well, you did not see the bad. HERE BAD !!! Well, now that we’re gone from this, our other films are pretty good in comparison, right? <br /> <br /> Well, this is just a theory.
