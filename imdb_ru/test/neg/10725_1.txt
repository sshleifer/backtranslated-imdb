Satire about greed and money, what? Behind this fiasco, there is more greed than any of those they are trying to make fun of. The reign of Jim Carrey, of course, was short-lived. He has an unbearable presence on the screen. The insincerity of his image is nothing more than terrible. He created this, this “masterpiece”, so he cannot blame anyone here. “Comedy number one in America,” shouts a desperate TV. Of course, Jim Carrey should have guaranteed full houses, but the game is over. If I sound evil because I am. I spent a sunny day in California, plus, between tickets, parking, the Coke apartment, etc., Almost $ 45 for this thing, starring and producer Mr. Kerry. No more, do you hear? No longer.
