So, my summary line is a cheap trick. But the film is full of them, and it is absurdly praised, so ... I caught this film on TV (uncut, since all films are shown on television, this is for you Americans who can say that I didn’t like it because I’ve seen an abbreviated television version - fortunately, this is just a thing from the USA) and I had no idea what it was. I turned on, caught the last minutes of the show, and the film began. A minute later I began to ask it to be a comedy, given the particularly ridiculous clichéd beginning (yes, I know that this is a bad film in the film, but I don’t know why I didn’t switch channels), but what a way to try to interest the viewer! And yes, the film was actually a comedy, albeit an unintentional one. <br /> <br /> Marina Zudina is quite pretty, but what the hell, what a horrible show! Although the role of a foreigner in this role is smart enough (she does not speak so far until the language barrier), nevertheless, excuse me, Marina, playing dumb does not mean posing as Harpo Marx. Her actions are unintentionally funny in many ways, just look at her when she draws X in the air while being pursued by the killer. He wants to kill you, it's time to play Zorro. We get a lot of "running up the stairs" things that transmit stress, as in the worst slasher, and things like tugging the carpet and a bad guy shooting at another. Ugh! Will Hollywood ever learn? However, the best / worst gem is that the guy is electrocuted in the bathroom and ... Well, I have never seen anyone electrocuted to death in the bathroom, but I'm sure in real life You do not see the blue cartoon rays, you? What about immediately trusting the mean guy, because he SAYS that he is a policeman, and not to ask him to show you his authority? So he turns out to be a real cop. But, nevertheless, it does not make sense to ask for a badge (according to the plot, we can always think that the credentials can be fake or it can be a crooked cop. Scenario 101). What about a big turn? Do not tell me that you didn’t see it happening 200 miles from here ... <br /> <br /> I’m sorry for poor old Alec Guinness and his useless cameo of footage. Now I think about it, what's the point of giving him a Mystery Guest Star loan ... in END titles? The film is over, there is no more mystery, and everyone and their brother identified Guinness (even non-film fans will recognize the “old man from Star Wars”). But it will be better, so we can pretend that this is not the late great actor. <br /> <br /> People continue to compare this with all people, with Hitchcock. I suppose it must be John Hitchcock, the milkman, since the late Sir Alfred would be embarrassed to watch, let alone do it. And it gets 6.8 / 10 ???? This is material Bottom 100! But then we are talking about a rating system that allows “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” to appear as the third best movie ever created (see “Top 100”), so ... <br /> <br /> 2 /ten.
