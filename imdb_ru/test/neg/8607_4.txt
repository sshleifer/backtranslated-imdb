Sex life of potatoes Men talk about the sexual life of several men involved in the delivery of potatoes. So there are no surprises. In fact, this is almost what you can expect from the title: that is, this is a bizarre comedy involving sex and men with potatoes. Sometimes the film works. This is a sharp, sometimes uncomfortable comedy about the life of rather unimportant and rather average men who face different problems with women. Where the film is clearly not working, and why it failed at the box office, is that the bizarre, uncomfortable details might just be too fancy and uncomfortable. Instead of laughing during a scene when a man hanging from the basement ceiling masturbates another man when he makes love to his wife, I think most of us just moan awkwardly and wonder what Andy Humphreys thought. Well, maybe we were shown that he was thinking too clearly.
