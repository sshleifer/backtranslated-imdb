“Residential Complex” is a small comedy comedy, filled with extraordinary characters, created instead of a real story telling a young psychology student (Lowe) who takes over the management of a residential complex and finds itself embroiled in a murder mystery ... hmm, can call it that. These low watches contain no expectations, no thrills, no drama, no action, no few precious funny moments, no nude, and almost no romance. "Residential complex" is a tolerable, unforgettable junk food only for the most needed potato dishes.
