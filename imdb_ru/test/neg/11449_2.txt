The topic was good, the direction was fine. Mohanlal was effective in his role as a major. The game of supporting actors was at best amateur. The casting director and director should be responsible for this debacle. Havaldar Jai was terrible, he stood out like a sore thumb, with his bad history. He did not look from the side and did not move like a soldier. There was a scene when a satellite channel was required from the clash with the militants, and they showed it from the camera. The satellite is located a hundred miles in the sky, so the only angle is from above. It was a rather awkward moment. The audience has matured these days, and they will find out when someone is trying to pull wool over their eyes. The director is a major, so the story may be beyond his personal experience. There are no problems, but the film is as good as its actors and director. Therefore, if Major Ravi is going to participate in any other projects, he should pay more attention to casting.
