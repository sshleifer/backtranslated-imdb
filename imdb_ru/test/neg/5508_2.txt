I'm a fan of Jesse Franco's quirky style and even a lover of his crappy films, and my personal opinion is that he, in addition to several very exciting films, also created several masterpieces, such as the brilliant "Paroxismus" aka "Venus" In Furs "of 1969, for example However, the indisputable fact is that in the 180+ films that this very prolific director took in his career, there are also a lot of horrors. “Sadomaniya” of 1981 is definitely one of these abominations, just an extremely bad and less plot film with the ability bore you despite the post Of course, the constant Nude will entertain you for 20 minutes, but as it goes on and on, it’s likely that after a while you will be bored. The only thing that made you I watched this, there was an intensity of carelessness, which, as they say, is a little funny. <br /> <br /> After a couple of newlyweds are lost in the desert on some island, they are stopped by a bunch of women, naked to the waist with a weapon, the guards of the local prison camp. While the husband is expelled from the island, the wife is sent to a prison camp, a place of torture and sexual humiliation, led by the sadistic nymphomaniac Magda and an extremely perverted ruler. The prisoners are, of course, perfectly hot chicks, most of them blondes, the warders are completely topless, women with rifles. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you can call it that, is of course very stupid, but who will look at it for a good conspiracy anyway. The only interesting thing about “Sadomania” is the high level of exploitation, even for the film “Women in Prison.” The film probably has two short scenes where we see a woman who actually wears a top, tears contain all sorts of sexual perversions from rape to bestiality, and some torture scenes are really nasty. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that a movie with such an extreme level of meanness can still be so boring. Trouble will keep you in the beginning, but after the first 45 minutes it was really hard for me not to fall asleep. It also makes me wonder why, of all the porn stars, Jess Franco chose ajit Wilson, who was, according to most sources, a transsexual who was born a man (well, maybe for that reason). If you really want to watch it, make sure you have enough beer at home to sit and watch it only for meanness and exploitation (and, perhaps, for some unintended light fun). Don't expect to be entertained, however, it’s almost unbelievable how a movie with such a high level of meanness can be so boring. I'm a fan of Jess Franco, and always will be, but “Sadomaniya” is just bad. 2/10
