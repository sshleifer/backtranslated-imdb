*** GREAT SPOILERS! *** The "Feast of the Flesh" of 1970 is more than an unworthy end to the career of the great Veronica Lake. It has a wide reputation as a horrible bastard, and rightly so, I must say. As a big fan of low-budget Horror / Exploitation, especially from the 70s, I nevertheless decided to watch it, mainly because of the cool pictures that look like the camp on this site, but after watching, I had to admit that the picture on actually has nothing to do with the movie. This site features the cover of a DVD collection entitled The Feast of the Flesh, which contains four films, including Sergio Martino's The Mountain of the Cannibal God and I Eat Your Skin Dala Tenney. However, the collection does not include this boring turkey. The Flesh Feast is not only lager and funny, but mostly rather tedious, which is even more touching, considering that the film lasts only 70 minutes. In addition, do not be deceived by the title, the film is not terrible at all. Nevertheless, it is watchable, if only because of his courage and, especially, an extremely silly, but, therefore, somewhat entertaining ending. The film tells about the ridiculous story about Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake), a brilliant woman scientist who can somehow restore the youth using a larva that feeds on flesh (do not ask how). A group of criminals (or terrorists, or someone else), who is paid by a radical political group, appoints a doctor to restore the youth of the “mysterious” commander. After an endless hour of meaningless nonsense, it turns out that the mysterious commander is actually Hitler himself. Previously, it was completely obvious, but I still had to laugh, because the final of the film was so incredibly silly and unintentionally funny ... This film is very inadequate as the last film of a great actress and former beauty queen, like Veronica. Lake. With the exception of the lake, the performances are ridiculously bad, even for a zero-budget production like this. Bad performances, however, I can easily forgive in films like this one. What I can not forgive is the extreme boredom. The last five minutes make it watchable for avid fans of camp material, but I still recommend skipping it.
