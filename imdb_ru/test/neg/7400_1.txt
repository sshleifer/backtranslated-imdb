What a bloody inconvenience! You cannot get on such topics with a budget TV and some clever director who cannot distinguish between Lanc I, II and III. All silly clich√©s are good on the spot; at the level of the character and person, the story is so noisy and unbelievable that it hurts. And all those responsible for it are happy for brilliant ratings. Technical details: garbage. Lance, flying so close, would have knocked out a dozen from the sky. One-engine night fighters attack the line of the stern: funny. As I said, compiled by the director, who, I am sure, had never heard the name Lancaster before this project and some of the 3D guys who turned Lancs into ducks. But this is minor compared to the general mediocrity of this film. Although it may be too harsh, I dare say that it harms the memory of those who died on both sides. TV shit entertaining stupid masses who don't care. Shame on the guilty. Use your brain next time. And enjoy the profit you got from it.
