This film plays like a crazy episode of VH1 "Where They Are Now" or "For the Music." In the first half of the film (which depicts his “glory days”), Abby Hoffman is inadvertently portrayed as a kind of delusional rock star. You know the view; the soloist is a pose, a cute boy, who did not write a single music, has no clue, but receives all the glory by gift and chicks for free. Therefore, he takes his success for granted, abuses it and ultimately destroys it along with himself. Indeed, Hoffman’s glory days ended abruptly when he was arrested for selling cocaine, missed a bail, and disappeared. <br /> <br /> The second part of the film is devoted to the time when he was hiding. In this we see Goffman as a miserable, weeping girl, endlessly accusing all who please, but only herself for his fall. In the end, time passes by it completely; and he can never handle it. How sad. END. The end of loans is rolling and it is NO! We learn that Abby Hoffman eventually committed suicide in 1989. <br /> <br /> I’m sure that this is not the image that filmmakers intended Hoffman to create this film. Given that Tom Hayden and Gerald Lefkort participated in this, I am sure that they conceived this film as a kind of tribute to the life of a man who in the end was an icon of the 60s and the anti-war movement of the left. In this they failed miserably. In the film, Abby Hoffman is presented as a meaningless caricature. We are never told what drives them. How did he come to his views? How did he manage to capture the imagination of a whole generation? How did he organize such an extensive movement? Why in the midst of his fame, he became involved in cocaine? What for? Who knows, and since the filmmakers do not seem to end up, who cares?
