Great plot, director and cast somehow make up a really awful film, told in that flat, semi-documentary style that was so popular during the making of this film. (And hello, this is NOT a film-noir!) The dull, overly complex, overcrowded history has no arc, no point of focus, not the slightest excitement, and fluctuations from one scene to another with no discernible goal, except for the valentine of supposed and highly questionable collaboration between the American and Mexican governments in the matter of illegal immigration. <br /> <br /> The scene I hated this film was when Montalban and Mitchell bravely run away from their captors, trying to save Montalban’s wounded partner from being killed by a thug from a pistol who drove part of the farm. Montalban says that something like “quickly - we have to try to save him”, but instead they lie on their stomach and agonize about 5 (!) Minutes of screen time while the car clicks on Murphy and NAKONETS knocks him (or, as we suppose the car just stops, the other rogue detects the presence of two “rescuers” and shoots them when they run away again). The scene is over. All this is so terribly filmed and completely anticlimatic. There is nothing worse than the main character (allegedly Montalban, although behind the scenes he shoots more than half of the film), who does not even try. God, Ricardo, do SOMETHING! <br /> <br /> I know that this is Anthony Mann, but, damn it, not ALL of his films are classics, people. How bad should an old movie be to get a rating below 6?
