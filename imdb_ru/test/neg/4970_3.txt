I saw the trailers of this film and found the cinema and what was presented interesting. I saw the IMDb rating, and 6.8 confirmed that this is a movie above average. So went to see him. <br /> <br /> The story of Mandy Lane (Amber Heard) ?? beautiful girl in high school, which is the subject of male sexual attraction. Mandy Emmett's friend (Michael Welch) provocation to another fellow student to show his love for Mandy leaves his classmate drunk and jump to death. Nine months passed, and her teenage friends invited Mandy for a summer weekend on a secluded ranch. three girls and three boys go there! The guard Garth (Mount Anson) works at the ranch. During the very first night of the murder occur ?? one by one the members of the group are killed. Who is behind the killings? I will not say here to spoil the sport ?? I liked the movie? NO. After the usual interesting discovery ?? the film unfolds down with each unfolding event. In half the cases when the killer is revealed, the person loses all interest in the remaining process. There is a final twist in this story that shocks the audience, but rather made me not believe and laugh! Is all this waiting? Ha ??! Amber Heard acts and plays his part well, like a shy and conscious girl ?? who knows about her beauty and the desire of men to her. The rest of the actors are normal ?? nothing to say. There are so many films made by teenagers and boys who go to a lonely place, and gradually someone kills them one by one ?? that it doesn't interest me anymore. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Levine tries his best to make the film interesting, using modern teen talk, loaded with sexual connotations, but not allowing the film to rise above the mundane. <br /> <br /> The only and most attractive grace of the film is its cinematography by Darren Gene ?? who captured a beautiful picture, beautiful images!
