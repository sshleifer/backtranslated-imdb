Is there any reason for reviving the characters 10 years after the only reason they worked for the first time was that the actors played them. <br /> <br /> Who can replace Jim Carrey or Cameron Diaz - or better yet? which can replace them at discounted prices, since most studios know that sequels do not bring the same income as the originals, so they cut corners from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> Where Good movies will play if powerful Hollywood studios can litter the 3000 weekend opening cinemas with any stacks they think may be attracted by the general public. <br /> <br /> Enough people, this continuation should stop and Hollywood people should start acting together or start distributing a much better foreign product that floats in limbo. <br /> <br /> Wake up Hollywood because people are awake and don't buy it simply because it is new and brilliant. Give us the good stuff and send the rest to the DVD shelves, because once and for all we take the cinemas !!!
