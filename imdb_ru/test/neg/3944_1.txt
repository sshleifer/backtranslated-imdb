I could tell it would be bad from the trailer, but the lure of the DVD box made me rent it anyway. Boy, I was right .. <br /> <br /> In addition, for some reason, the DVD version is VERY fuzzy and sometimes unclear (in terms of video quality). It seems as if they were shooting the entire movie with a 20-year-old video camera, it looks so bad. I really did not like the plot, and after watching the movie I was very let down. I will not tell any spoilers, but let me say that the end was so bad that I laughed, it was done many times before. <br /> <br /> This whole story looks like something from an average schoolboy's English newspaper. If I had to call one movie the worst horror movie I've ever seen, this one might be easy. I can't believe they really released this movie. It really is not worth any rent or a penny of anyone's money, unless you want to laugh at the expense of the film.
