This film is one big stereotype. Acting (except Philbin and Harrison) is terrible, and the horrible scenario only aggravates the situation. I have to agree with another review that “local” characters sound ridiculous, as do “Caucasian” characters. 3 stars out of 10 for 1) Philbin 2) Harrison 3) Surf scene. (1/2 * of ****) See “Aloha Summer” (**) and / or “Beyond Paradise” (***) for Hawaii to do everything right, especially BP, which I find interesting and brilliant.
