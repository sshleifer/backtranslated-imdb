SPOILERS: The original Road House is one of those films that I know is clichéd and unoriginal, but everything is done so well that I am ashamed to admit that I really like it. It turns out that many of my friends, whose opinion about the film I respect, think the same. Therefore, when they try to make a sequel, it’s as if it was written by some schoolchildren who were given the right to continue, it’s just bad; really very bad. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Jonathon Schach is listed as one of the authors, and I can only hope that his membership in the WGA will be canceled. The letter was simply bad, and all the authors of this film must resign due to the complete lack of originality and some of the worst dialogues in this millennium. Schaech already seems to be the king of the sequel "straight to DVD" (8mm 2, Poison Ivy 2), and now, seeing this and 8mm 2, I think that his acting ability is missing. He was terrible, just terrible. <br /> <br /> And not scary fighting scenes make this movie terrible, but take it away from me, they are bad. Each battle scene is a slow hit (still making a whiff sound in the air), which is then blocked by an adversary who returns a strike that sends the first guy to the ground. This is repeated throughout the entire film, worse than any bad 1970s police show. Or the fact that many people involved in fights, for some reason, seem to have a mouthful of cherry relief. And we have to believe that Will Patton is a fighting machine; his battle scenes look so amazingly fake that I was honestly embarrassed watching <br /> <br /> In this ridiculous movie, complete logic makes it terrible. For example: the character of Jonathon Shah is in the city for one day and already tells some girl that she barely knows who does not know which side she is on: “I am with the feds, but do not tell anyone”. A female villain who fights with a good girl in one scene of fighting acrobatics that competes with any superhero is still easily held by Will Patton, the “old man,” in the other scene just holding both of her hands while he some line of absurdity is pronounced (“hit me once, shame on you, hit me twice, this will not happen”, this is bad), and then hits her with a head. Jake Buzie's villain shoots the feds after being caught in the middle of a drug deal, but no DEA agent or anyone else will go to him and take him away after, in fact, they just let him go, because “this Sheriff's territory. ” Busey wants a bar because he is “in a great place” for drug deals, but his own home seems to be just as good, obviously, offering all the benefits a bar should have. Jonathon Sheik's character is supposed to be the son of Patrick Swayze’s original character, but Swayze’s surname is Dalton, but Shah’s surname is not (like Swayze’s alleged brother). And in this film, Jonathon Schach looks about 50 years old. I looked at him, he is 17 years younger than Swayze, but he looks awful. <br /> <br /> But my favorite idiotic scene in this film is the most boring fight scene ending in the films: the villain makes his way through the windows on the second floor, and when they go down, I think, “Please don't tell me that he pinned something ... ”and, of course, my worst fears were justified. <br /> <br /> In fact, I could talk about what I hated in this film for another half an hour. Suffice to say, let's put an end to these ridiculous sequels on DVDs for theater films, at least with Jonathon Sheikh.
