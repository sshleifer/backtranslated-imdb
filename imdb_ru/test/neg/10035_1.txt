If someone tells you that this picture is simply awesome, it’s probably somehow related to creating it or making a profit. This film is a real loser, and it copies situations from big budget horror films, not to mention soundtracks. I would not advise this to my worst enemy. This is a low budget movie with amateur actors. Looks like it was shot for a film competition. The game is terrible, and it will not surprise me if the script is written by script writer Hee Hou. My family laughed at it. Grade ZZZZZZZZZZZZ completely. You will not be scared by this. Here is one little taste of the horrific elements of this film. When a guy gets his foot, trampled by Rick White’s stupid reed cane by Reverend James Johnston. The reaction of the guys is the same as if he had an amputation without painkillers. See the DVD supplements after watching the movie. When you see how Rick White and the others are talking about the film so seriously, you will laugh to the pain in your stomach. How people will spread the truth and what they will do to earn a dishonest dollar. Do not be deceived as we are, and buy this bad luck.
