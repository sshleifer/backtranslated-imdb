In the past there have been some great tv movies. An epic such as "Roots" and "Lonely Pigeon" comes to mind. Category 6: The Day of Destruction will not be remembered for promoting a film made specifically for television. The ridiculously bad story that only the horrible script surpassed, Cat6DD, as I like to call it, evokes more sympathy for the actors involved than the terror in nature that the film was supposed to show. This sound, which you hear during the film, should be the sound of wind, but in fact it is the career of Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy and Thomas Gibson (Greg from the duet Dharma and Greg) falling faster than houses, trucks and cows. can fly away from one of 15 tornadoes that we see in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The film was advertised as "nature went out of control." Instead, we get an unfortunate story about how 15 different meteorological systems are conspiring to produce 150-degree days in Chicago, and then a snowstorm the next day due to a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, which combined with the storm system from Canada, but the origin in the jet stream has changed as a result of global warming .... GOOD !! No matter what the story was, the acting was terrible, the words the actors said were stupid, and 13 scientists across the country had coronary vessels after they heard the drop that came from the film. I didn’t care what happened to one of the characters, the special effects were not up to par, even for the standards created for television, and the plot lines were meaningless. In general, I really don’t like this “television event”.
