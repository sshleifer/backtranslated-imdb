A good movie about boys should almost certainly have moonshine, car chases, a storyline that has a vague resemblance to the “plot”, and at least one very pretty country girl, barefoot with short shorts and low top. A pretty girl here (dressed in designer jeans) - but the preconditions of the redneck end there. Jimmy Dean - a natural representative of the press for sausages, but as a tough guy, a former sheriff, he does not have enough chances. Big John is big, but he does not convince the "bad" part of his nickname. Big-eyed Jack Elam, as always, is a scream, and Bo Hopkins has played this role for decades; Ned Beatty also plays a role in a small role ... but there is no STORY. This is more like an episode of In The Heat Of The Night than a feature film. Cornball porridge with easily predictable mood. Perhaps the most glaring problem with this film is that Charlie Daniels sings this theme. You know one; it became famous ... jimmy din.
