[as a new solution for this 2005, I decided to write a comment for each film that I saw in the cinema (10%) or on DVD (90%). <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the DVD has revolutionized this habit. For example, I can hear the true voice of the actors, which is an essential personality trait. In my country, non-French films are duplicated, and as a result we get aberrations: the French voice is terrible, very far from its original tone! the same voice for different people or the same people with different voices !!!! <br /> <br /> And if everyone considers my comments useless, well, in 2006 I will stop reviewing them ... Oh, oh .... So enjoy them now !!!! ] <br /> <br /> My resume means that the plot, locations, actors are not very pleasant ... <br /> <br /> Only .... <br /> <br /> Sandra Bullock is there. She is a talented actress who can make the viewer capture the film .... <br /> <br /> This is reminiscent of a female “runaway” .... So if you are looking For a moment when you escape from your life, watch the film aggravates the situation, because Sandra's life is a mess .... <br /> <br /> She has nothing left to do but her poor mother Touching Depression ....) <<br / > <br /> In fact, she has a sad life beginning of the film, she had a sad life, to finally return to it in the end .. .. what a happy end !!!! <br /> <br /> Maybe the authors wanted to tell about the life of a nerd ... <br /> <br /> very far from the best computer film of all time: * WARGAMES *
