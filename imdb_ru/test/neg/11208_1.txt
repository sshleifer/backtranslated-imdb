For many years I have seen this film as a real film about ninjas, but after studying this culture, I can only think that this is just another film about karate. Black shinobi and some weapons do not do ninjas, it is much more. Ninjas are the most dangerous warrior in Japan because they are trained in all aspects of life to survive in everything, killing everyone who tries to stop them. This film is not about a ninja warrior, but about a clown who is trying to be something that he cannot even understand.
