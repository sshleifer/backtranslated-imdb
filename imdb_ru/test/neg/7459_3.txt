Before watching this film, the 1998 version was my only experience in this Dickens story. I didn’t really like this film, but this adaptation of 1974 is progressing in a particularly tedious manner. <br /> <br /> Actors do not shine, the main couple is Michael York and Sarah Miles - especially wooden cases. the only character who really interested me was the smart juggers Anthony Quayle. <br /> <br /> The so-called conspiracy is ridiculous, but the story itself is gorgeous. This is a real lesson about how your distorted values ​​and obsessive principles can destroy you. live with an open mind and not take care of what other people say, you are what you are, if others cannot accept it, ****. Pipu was told about this early, but he did not listen. <br /> <br /> The girl, adopted by a strange old woman, reminded me a bit of the story of Kaspar Hauser, not at the same terrible level, but at the way she fashioned the child to create the performer of her personal vendetta against all the opposite sex as she thought deceived her. Pipa's childhood did not look much better. the end did not seem to fit the rest of the story. The sets looked cheap, and, approaching imdb, I wouldn’t be surprised to see that this is really a television movie (which I had no idea about when I borrowed it from the library). <br /> <br /> live and teach. so many good movies, so little time. that's why the reviews are here. so you do not have to spend your time on such films. <br /> <br /> 3/10
