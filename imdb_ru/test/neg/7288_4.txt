My main criticism with the film is animation. I totally agree with everyone else, it was very bad. Some characters have dark skin tones than in the first film, which is much better. Also the colors of the background looked hasty and somewhat static. It is a pity that Michael J. Fox did not voice Milo, he did such a good job, and James Arnold Taylor was not sure whether he should sound like Milo or Aladdin. I also took into account the lack of a good storyline. the third story was confusing and clumsy, and the second suffered from poor scripting. Worse, the first thing I donâ€™t even remember is other than a haunted fishing village or something. Nevertheless, there was good music and good voice talents from John Mahoney, Cree Summer, Clancy Brown and Tom Wilson, who saved the film from a complete disaster. All in all, the disappointing continuation of an amazingly good movie. 4/10 Bethany Cox.
