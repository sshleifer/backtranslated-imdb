This is a great example of the terrible shit of the 90s. There is nothing wrong, and the film is almost bloodless. Yes, there is some violence, but everything is politically correct, as in a television movie. This is not exactly a bad picture, I can safely say that I find it quite enjoyable. However, lack of originality really harms Voodoo. In general, if you are a part of the main audience, and pseudo-horror films, such as Cry, your favorite, love voodoo, but if you want something very terrible, avoid this movie.
