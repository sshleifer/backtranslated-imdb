Great cast, fantastic CGI monster and brilliant screenplay. If there were any of these things in this film, then perhaps he would not be one of the worst films I spent an hour and a half on. Infinite chimps with endless typewriters have not yet written complete works of Shakespeare, but along the way it appeared in their bin and somehow turned into a film. You can say that the actors regret signing these contracts with every word they mumble into the camera. CGI is highly amateurish, and they may have created more stress on the cast that Sinclair Spectrum attacked it was created on. I really liked this film, it has some episodic episodes of Gil Gerard and Walter Koenig, so I expected a funny horror film that didn’t take itself too seriously. This is actually trying to take yourself seriously, but it’s as fun as going to the dentist. Do yourself a favor. Do not watch this movie, you only encourage them to earn more.
