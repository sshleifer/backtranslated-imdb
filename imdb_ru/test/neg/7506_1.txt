I live and work in Lexington, Kentucky, the city where Zombie Planet was filmed. I heard about the film for ages from different people who claimed to be an important part of the production. Then for several years I heard absolutely nothing. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that it sits by itself in a local video store, just hungry for rent. Therefore, being a film fan, I decided to give a chance to these local filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. <br /> <br /> “Zombie Planet” is too long, boring, bad acting, killed - and these are just good things. I tried my best to enjoy it, including removing my brain and putting it on the table so that it would not interfere with the terrible storyline. Alas, nothing worked. Zombie Planet is so bad that pathetic. And the very idea that they are planning a continuation makes me believe that the director and his henchmen have not heard any criticism, I am sure that they have heard. Move on, guys. You are welcome. In fact, refrain from filming altogether. Or visit a few lessons on topics, storytelling and, well, in fact, the main directions. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, for the love of God, hang it.
