The bipolarity of this film is crazy. In an instant, he laughs at Hispanics, American tourists, and banana republics in general, and the other for burned-up villages and orphans. Even a serious revolutionary hero at some point becomes a parody of a revolutionary. But comedic episodes are not even funny, because they are clearly stolen from Star Wars. Yes, "Star Wars", "hero" - this is basically a crook with a heart of gold. Add to this the stereotypical sound effects, Latin Americans who speak English with each other, and the villain who simply disappears from the story. And what's the point? This is basically revolutionary propaganda without permission and planning (because these people simply cannot lead the country). The US government is the bad guys, but who will make money making it? Not a poor farmer, that's for sure.
