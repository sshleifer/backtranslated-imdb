"The Cover Girl" is a dim musical of World War II, in which there is absolutely nothing memorable, with the exception of the firm song "Long Ago and Far Away". This film came out before Gene Kelly really achieved his artistic success, and although there is evidence of his burgeoning talent, he mostly plays a girlfriend with Rita Hayworth. And there is a problem. Rita Hayworth is gorgeous, no doubt about it. But she is simply not a convincing presence on the screen. I always felt that I wanted to love her more than I really did, and this film is no exception. She is simply not a very good actress, and she is not even a very good dancer. How good she looks, there is something meaningless about her, and this film suffers because of it. <br /> <br /> Rating: C-
