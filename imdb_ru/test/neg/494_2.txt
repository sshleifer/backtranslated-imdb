I don't know any idiotic rock and roll clich√©s that are not used in this film. Ouffcourz, Rock Enroll Life - it's just sex drugs and parties, as well as many supermodels who are trying to ride with you The filmmakers seemed to read too many Guns'n'Roses or Motley Crue stories. I have closely watched the everyday life of an ordinary rock band, and this film has nothing to do with reality. If you are successful enough, your life is a tour, a tour. This means that you are mostly on the bus and are trying to sleep. Just sleep. Because you have to be fresh, sober and clean in the evenings. After the concert, you have a little time to defuse the stage excitement. Then you will have a little time for fun. But this is not a luxury or a dream. Artistically this film was zero. Stupid characters and idiotic dialogues. The ending of the film was funny - the main character left the heavy metal band and formed a grunge band! What kind of morality. The real 90s.
