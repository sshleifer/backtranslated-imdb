This should be the worst case of over-acting since the time of silence. Not just one or two actors, but practically the entire cast. Lee Majors and Bo Svenson were fine, but the others look like they played for the first time. <br /> <br /> So the budget was not huge. Most of the costumes and scenery were believable, but there were a lot of things that jumped out to the viewer to tell us that they could not double-check or get all the details to fit the period. <br /> <br /> I can't remember a single aspect of the film that I liked or shook my head. Your time will be better spent on burning down collected from your navel.
