For me, this film is a very, very unconvincing film for teenagers, with all the usual cliches and boring stereotypical characters (Nerds, Jocks, Popular girls, Sleezy guys, etc.), But with the main anti-drug theme. <br /> <br /> If you ever have an unfortunate chance to see this movie, follow all the references to responsibility and make it real (I donâ€™t know how to express it yet), I think the only thing to make this movie cool, it would be if they played on TV, it was on fire. This, or the DVD on which it was blown ... <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10,000 - watch Animal House instead.
