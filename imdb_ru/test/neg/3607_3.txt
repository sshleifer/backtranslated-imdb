... but, of course, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I never expected me to like the first movie. I'm not sure what happened to Disney's marketing group, but it seems that every trailer they make for an animated film ends up making me too childish, or stupid, or stupid, and yet the films themselves are usually completely different. And no film looked worse for me in trailers than Emperor's New Canal, so I was very surprised when I really liked this film, when I finally broke and saw it. I entered with zero expectations and came out pleasantly entertained. <br /> <br /> Despite the Disney track record with video sequels, I still hoped for the best experience with Kronk here ... but in the end I was just disappointed (and, unfortunately, not completely surprised, what I felt like that). There is almost no adult oriented humor. Original songs are boring and painfully cute. The animation, although not bad, still does not come close to the “Emperor” (which was not the lion king). <br /> <br /> The main plot, as such, is strikingly “insignificant” and consists mainly of a series of memories of a mini-plot — in fact at a time when the Saturday morning animated series looked more like a pilot sequence. episodes than on a well thought out single entity. <br /> <br /> David Spade gets about four lines of the entire film, and there’s not too much John Goodman in it, so overall we have too many Patron Warburton’s “Kronk” who was a funny supporting character in the first film but completely out of place as the main one. lead here. <br /> <br /> Although it may seem amusing to the children, the only thing Kronk could do for me was to make me want to go back and look far beyond the original.
