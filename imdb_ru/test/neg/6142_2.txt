My ratings: Acting skills - 3/10 Suspension - 2/10 Attaching a character - 1/10 Storyline - 2/10 Character development - 2/10 Overall - 2/10 <br /> <br /> This show sucks officially. For me, CSI Miami is the best, CSI NY 2nd and CSI 100th. I do not know, in other CSI you get into the episode that you watch. But in this you simply can not get into the episode, no matter how hard you try, therefore, in my opinion, this show is not worth watching. I know that people have different opinions, and I respect them, but for me this CSI is not good enough. So, if you like suspense, a real game / performance, a good plot, direction, character development / affection, and a good show, I suggest you watch CSI Miami.
