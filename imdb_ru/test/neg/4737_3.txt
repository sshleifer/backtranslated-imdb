Anyone who watched "Alien vs. Predator" should have known that the legend of "Alien quadrology" is not entirely suitable for the film. Among some unusual elements - the rapid growth of aliens in minutes, aliens with extremely long tails and so on. Nevertheless, the idea that the Predator species give impetus to the development of the city and the temple to create a hunt, will sound so belligerent that I could not resist. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that the end of the film would not be the impetus for this continuation, and, unfortunately, I was mistaken. For those who have forgotten how the first film ended, a dead alien predator broke through the dead Predator in his chest, which carried features of both species. ” <br /> <br /> In this film I'm going to just go through the list of “good” and “bad” traits. <br /> <br /> The Good: a lot of great people, especially men. <br /> <br /> The bad: a lot of great people squish from both the Predator / Alien and the Predator. <br /> <br /> Good: an interesting idea of ​​the planet Predator. <br /> <br /> The Bad: the inconsistent scale of the city. It is a small city without many possibilities, but with a very complex (read: large city) sewer system and a homeless person. Is it a small town or city? The police are one sheriff and three deputies, or so I expected. <br /> <br /> The Good: Um .... <br /> <br /> The Bad: Why do these mutant aliens / predators grow so fast? Within five minutes, they seem to grow to their full size. I mean, come on ... what are these things ... Chia Pet Aliens ??? And although we are discussing this topic, why is the alien in the body of the Predator mutates, and the alien in the human body is not? Does it make sense? <br /> <br /> Good: still thinking ... <br /> <br /> Bad: why only one Predator is needed? And why he sheds acid on all the remnants of the "aliens", but decides to kill the handsome governor, and then remove him and hang him upside down. I mean, so much to be incognito! <br /> <br /> The Good: Ah ... I'm stuck. I think there are a lot of loud sounds! <br /> <br /> The Bad: How do these mutated aliens / predators reproduce? Apparently, they find a pregnant woman, and in the form of a kissing movement, they put several descendants into the body of a woman. Yes, exactly what you would like to see, eh? Pregnant women with a body explode on alien mutants - as if the previous path was not rude enough !!! I mean, not even the Queen of Aliens. <br /> <br /> The Good: Did I say that the guys in this movie are great? <br /> <br /> Bad: when a nuclear device explodes buildings, how can a helicopter survive an explosion? And how reckless it is that one of the passengers mockingly reproaches the pilot: “I told you not to fall!” I mean, considering nuclear precipitation, when he wakes up in the morning, he will not have hair !!! <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I think you understood the message. Mutant Alien / Predator breaks through the body of a dead Predator, grows in minutes, kills all Predators and manages to break on the ground. More Aliens / Predators are being created, while ONE pathetic Predator comes to earth to destroy this new kind of mutant. Predator kills people. Mutants Aliens / Predators kill people. People kill people. It sucks to be the man in this movie, huh? <br /> <br /> If you are impressed with a lot of punches and blows, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you liked. First, I suggest you skip this sequel.
