I was a fan of Carpenters for a long time, read a biography, watched special events and saw the story of Karen Carpenter. This film really didn't show the real Karen Carpenter. In the film, she seems shy and largely lonely (except for one friend). The real Karen Carpenter was very different. She was sociable and friendly. She had many friends, especially Olive Newton-John. The film doesn’t even show Karen’s attempts to release a solo album and her meeting with Phil Ramone and his wife, who itch “Karen”. Itch knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York, she met with a psychologist, but this was voluntary, and once a day, and then she went to her hotel room. In addition, Karen took pills to enlarge the thyroid gland so that she could lose weight, but stopped taking them, because the psychologist recommended her not too much. Also in the movie, Karen's husband is named Bob Knight, but in real life his name was Tom Burris. In addition, Karen is not divorced from Tom, but only broke up. Karen was supposed to sign divorce papers on the day she died. In addition, Agnes found Karen naked in an unconscious closet, unlike the film where she was dressed in white. The music was very good. This was the only thing I would recommend to see.
