I love these twists and turns of British social norms, and rarely does anyone lose me. But Our Archers really lost me a bit. This is a story about social climbers and their joys of breaking the rules, but I personally find it a bit boring. <br /> <br /> I liked the Duchess, although she was too aching, and Constance Bennett was friendly as Lady Greyston, who Bette Davis could play backwards. The film comes to life in the third act, when Ernest joins the party. He is so lively and cheerful (and, in truth, he probably wears more makeup than Lady Greyston). He gets the last line of the film, and it's gas!
