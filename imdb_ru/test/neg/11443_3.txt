I watched this movie recently, mainly because I'm a big fan of Jodie Foster. I saw that this film was made right between her 2 Oscar-winning performances, so my expectations were quite high. Unfortunately, I thought the film was terrible, and I still wondered how she was persuaded to make this film. The script is really weak. The story itself would probably be somewhat plausible if someone like Mel Gibson played the role of an assassin. Jody's idea of ​​escaping with Dennis Hopper and his annoying accent was impossible for me. I really thought Jody looked great during the whole movie, which was probably the only reason I watched it all. Perhaps showing Jodie as little clothing as possible was the only reason the film was shot. I saw Jodi’s TV biography, where basically all of her films were commented on in chronological order, and this film was the only one that was never mentioned. Seeing this, now I understand why.
