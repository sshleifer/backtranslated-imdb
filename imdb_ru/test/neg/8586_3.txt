I was looking forward to watching this movie, because the trailer made it look so cool. But the fact is that this film is boring and completely confusing. There is no plot, and half of the film is a quick flash of footage from football games. An enlarged image that does not give you an overview of the games. I constantly looked at the timer to see when the movie ended! <br /> <br /> In this film there is only ONE good thing. Sound!! The soundtrack is awesome! ............. Don't expect anything from this movie.
