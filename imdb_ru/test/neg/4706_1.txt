Well, dude, where is my car, maybe at least a novelty as one of the few Hollywood films that seem to have been written, filmed, filmed and edited in less than a day. I honestly can't believe that this was done (or that I let my friends get me to sit through it all). The jokes are too stupid and predictable to be “stupid and ridiculous,” and the actors involved in them seem to be unable to create something funny if the script really provided them. Strangely enough, unlike most meaningless comedies with farces, this film actually has TOO MUCH plot - each scene seems to represent a new moronic and uninteresting plot. Of course, they obviously went for a moron, but at some level it does not work ... There is only one aspect of this film that I liked: Donkeylips from the old nikolodeysky show "Salute Your Shorts" has a very small role, This is the role that turn him into the next Richard Gere, you just look ...
