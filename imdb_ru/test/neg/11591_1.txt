Komodo vs. Cobra begins with the United Planet environmentalist Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish) and his girlfriend Carrie (Rene Talbert) hiring captain Michael Stoddard (executive producer Michael Peere) to take them to an island in the South Pacific , at first Stoddard is reluctant, as the island is a top-secret military research base, but will soon change its mind when offered a lot of money. Along with television news reporter Sandra Crescent (Jeri Manti), they set sail for the island and once found out on the beach that the military was funding illegal DNA genetic experiments that led to the huge Komodo and King Cobra dragons who ate almost all other living creatures there and Stoddard and s follow in the menu ... <br /> <br /> Co-author and director of the ever-terrible Jim Vinorsky under the pseudonym of J. Andrews, it's just awful, just hard to sit through & even worse than regular trash al Sci-Fi has the nerves, if possible. The script is terrible, predictable and extremely boring, some giant monsters of some kind are created by scientists who are busy with DNA, a group of people are trapped with these monsters and should try to escape while being eaten. That's all, this is the whole story of Komodo vs. Cobra, maybe it was an attempt to disrupt AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004) with the title, but all against It is just a thirty-second junk rivalry between two titular beasts at the very end, boring to hell and, of course, a big disappointment for anyone who hopes to get a full monster mash. The character is bad, the dialogue is terrible, the pace is slow, the story is predictable and cliché, and the whole film just sucks with a lazy script that falsely claims that both Komodo Dragon and Cobra are amphibians that they are not. Hell, Komodo vs Cobra is not even worth watching an unintentional laugh, because it’s so boring and hardly anything will happen, although the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the beach from Cobra is pretty funny for the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> How does Vinsky continue to work? He is probably the worst ever current director. How can he continue to enjoy the sound of films made in beautiful places with half decent actors and still produce such a terrible film? I think it was cut to get a PG or for its television show, since every time someone swears, it is disguised as a parrot creak! There is no blood or violence, and the monster scenes are lifeless, people just stand there, monsters just stand there, sizzle or roar too - that's all. CGI's computer effects are terrible, it's really bad stuff that just looks terrible. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 450,000, it looks so cheap, as before, it's nice to look at Hawaiian places, but that's about it. Acting skills are bad due to a disinterested cast. <br /> <br /> Komodo vs. Cobra is Jim Vinorsky’s absolutely terrible sci-fi channel “Creature Feature”, films are not getting much worse than this.
