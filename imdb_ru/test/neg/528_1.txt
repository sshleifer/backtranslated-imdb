I spent 35 minutes of my life on this turkey before I gave up. The main character is completely ignorant and strikingly unattractive, but there is no humor in his blunders. As soon as he arrives in Germany, the screenwriter removes the old phrase “there is only one room in the hotel, you will have to share the room with a pretty girl”. At the very least, you could let them develop their relationship a bit first. See “It Happened One Night,” to see how to do it right — or any of a thousand films since. <br /> <br /> The acting game is invariably negligible, and the improvised dialogue should be left on the chopping floor. It doesn’t say anything at all, despite the fact that the film has been telegraphing the destination of the relationship since Greta appeared. <br /> <br /> The first song in the meeting room, softly funny, but poorly sung. The rest of the songs (well, to be honest, I heard them only in the first half hour) are simply pointless and terrible. Most singers are painfully out of sorts, but not on purpose with humor.
