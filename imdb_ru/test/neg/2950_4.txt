First preview 18.02.2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Leon Leonard): an honest adventure film based on the novel by the author of fame Moby Dick Herman Melville. This film is about a captain of a ship who stole his eyes (which were extremely rare black pearls) from a sculpture of the God of a local tribe and hid them somewhere that only he knew before leaving Tiwi Island. He became very ill and was on a secret journey to return to the island to pick up pearls for himself, while others (like his daughter) thought he was going to be treated by a local medic. Others did not know the reason for the trip. The asylum really knew the real reason for the trip — to return its eyes to its God. The stupid part is that the pearls were hidden very close to the statue, and all this time the natives ruled their tribe without their God, who had eyes (causing them all sorts of problems). Along the way, we are (for some reason) doing a short underwater show with an electric eel fighting a local octopus (I think only Herman Melville knows what this is all about). As soon as they get to the island, the captain dies, but passes the location of the pearl to his daughter, but she also receives the curse of the disease. One of the bad guys finds out where God is and convinces his daughter to go there and steal the pearls, but at that moment the good guys find out what is happening and the fight begins. I will not tell you the results of the battle or the final, I will leave it up to you to see if you want to. As I said earlier, the film was fine, but some very stupid things, which I have already mentioned, reduced its influence. I wonder if this new "Pirates of the Caribbean" got a piece of its plot from this --- hmm? black pearl, curse (I wonder ??). Well, it doesn’t matter, these elements did not make for a very good film in this or any other case. It seems they will learn that they are a lesson, but with the money coming in for this new film, I’m sure they won’t. Well.
