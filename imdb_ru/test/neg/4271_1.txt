complete shit. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled to see this, because it is the only version of the film that I saw in Mansfield Park. I survived the first four episodes, but when it came to the scene of the sentence between Henry and Fanny, I snapped back and had to turn it off. Whoever uses this Sylvestra Le Touzel, she must be both blind and deaf, because a woman is the worst actress I've ever seen in my life. Everything is just bad, bad, bad. I dont know. I just don’t know why the people who write Jane Austen’s scripts seem unable to give her work the respect she deserves.
