Computer savvy, John Light (like John Elias), moved from Stanford to the successful young tycoon of the Dotcom era. But Mr. Lightâ€™s mocking success may be short-lived, with partners such as ambitious Jeffrey Donovan (like Robert Jennings). Mr. Donovan slept with Light Megan Dodds's girlfriend (as Lisa Forrester). Donovan wants Light to know that drunkenness and casual sex should not end in college. After reading naughty sex on the Internet, Miss Dodds turned on the lights. He could lose the Internet empire "Digital Dreams"! Veterans unsuccessfully trying to lend dramatic authority include red, sucking lollipop Mia Farrow (like Anna Simmons) and quickly drawing, computer hating Hal Holbrook (like Tom Walker). Miss Farrow looks cute with her candy. <br /> <br /> *** Objective (02/21/02) Alan Lazar ~ John Light, Jeffrey Donovan, Mia Farrow
