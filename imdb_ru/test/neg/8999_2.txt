What a waste of time. I took about five minutes and became very nervous, and soon began to move forward a bit, and rather soon there was no desire to remove my thumb from the fast forward button. I think the actors Mark Redfield and Barry Murphy did an excellent job, but none of those whom I saw, did not give anything good. Again, take this review with a lot of salt, because the film was so unbearable that I could not get to the end. Damn it, I could not reach the AMONG !! <br /> <br /> I cannot send this review because it is not long enough. Perhaps this last sentence will put it on top.
