** Maybe spoilers ** ** it's difficult to spoil this thing more than it is, but just in case ** Gee, I don't understand how someone could like this remake !! It was like the "Made for T.V" show and still pretty sucks for it. A lot of fake snow, a bad game of major stars, a bad action and that crazy pine forest in Detroit. What the heck??!! I really didnâ€™t think it would be a great movie, but I was hoping to be entertained. No, we fell asleep halfway and had to finish it the next day. I could easily miss everything else (but then I would have missed these magnificent pine forests!) I am so glad that I missed it in the theater! Bad enough to waste $ 3.50 in the video store. And I am a lover of police, action movies and dramatic films. It was a very stinky 1 out of 10 stars. Give me the original any day!
