This junk had the same resemblance to the novel as a slice of pickles with a cucumber. The filmmakers took the Alamo section from the book, turned it into a film and said it was based on a book. Hah I wonder what they did to encourage Mr. Michener to support this piece of fluff? It was just another Davey Crockett, flint rifle, Santa Ana, 13 days of glorious collection of tops. I almost started rooting for the Mexicans, just to finish this damn thing. And what was the scene where Stacy Keach was trying to get James Bowie to let him look at the knife? The sexual hints he used were underage and unnecessary. They could use the film that wasted on this nonsense to engage in real dialogue. This show was an embarrassment for Hollywood. Or can these clowns be confused?
