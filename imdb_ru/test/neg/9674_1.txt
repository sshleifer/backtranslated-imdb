This is pure CRAP, and perhaps the worst biblical thematic film ever. I mean, itâ€™s totally inaccurate because Sodom and Gomorra were BEFORE the Great Flood. They described Lot as Noah's friend, although he lived after Noah. Worse, later Lot became a pirate and attacked Noah's Ark during the flood !!! ??? And what about the merchant who comes on a boat that moves across the water with a bicycle gear ??? And exchanges alcohol for food and water, and then Noah is portrayed as an alcoholic!? Bullying and constant blasphemy one after another, and so on and so forth, and so on ... The director and all the participants undoubtedly secured themselves in the first row in hell with this garbage ... <br /> <br /> Please stay away from this shit, because you will save yourself almost three hours of your life.
