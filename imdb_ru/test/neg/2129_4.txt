I really wanted this movie to be liked, as I admire Italian robbery (especially loot jaws!), But the simple fact is that Monster Shark is not very good. There are all signs that this is a big piece of garbage; we have one of the kings of a stupid cult film, Lamberto Bava, in the director's chair - one of the best ridiculous cult actors, Michael Hopkiv, starring, and the central being, stupid enough to give even the best that this Movie should offer run for your money, and yet the film somehow still turns out to be rather outdated. The fact that the “monstrous shark” is not so common is probably a good thing, given the creature's design, but there has never been enough space elsewhere to get the film out without it. The plot focuses on a resort off the southern coast of Florida (more precisely, somewhere in Italy), where several locals ended up in the water without arms and legs. Soon, local authorities decide that this creature has never been seen before, and the colorful team of various marine experts should catch him alive! <br /> <br /> The main problem with this film is that it always seems very meaningless, and since character development and plot development do little, even the most demanding viewers are likely to soon get bored. This film is hardly known for being brilliant, although funny elements of films such as The Last Shark and The Killer Fish are unfortunately absent for most of the time. What I like in the lead role of Michael Sopkiva is that it always seems to him that he takes himself seriously, no matter what movie he was in (although he only did four). This is certainly the case here, although Bava never allows him to fully immerse himself, and he often feels just like a spare tire, like the whole movie. Most of the execution time is spent on viewing various characters other than American lager, and this is not very exciting; although Bava achieved good results by the end with an exciting flow of action, as the central monster finally begins to wreak havoc on its potential invaders. Overall, there really isn’t much to recommend this film. As already mentioned, I really like such things, and even I was bored in many cases. Only for hardcore Italian horror fans!
