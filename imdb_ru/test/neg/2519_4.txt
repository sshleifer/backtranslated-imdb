OK, this is one weird movie! Ed Wood's younger fans will appreciate George Barry's “inventive” techniques, such as video footage and stupid footage. He can turn a crack in the wall into a plot device! There is more humor than horror, but I found it uneven. You will laugh and cry, and probably wonder why you picked it up. In the introduction, Barry explains that the filming of this film began in 1972 and was completed in 1977, and their cost was $ 10,000. This is 59 months and $ 9,900 too much! If you like your cheese in the marching part, with the old "blood" of the 70s, you can find this irresistible and fancy snack.
