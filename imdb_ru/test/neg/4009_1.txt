It has a bit of that indie edge that was trendy in the 90s and which puts an explicit sale date in visual style. Characters are equally apathetic and shameless. Street hooligans in Greece wear new clothes out of the box without folds and stains. They all seem to be visiting the same barber. All of them equally demonstrate low IQ when making impartial underground commercial transactions. When something goes wrong, all because they are not real Greeks - they are pastoral sunshine boys who find themselves in a strange night city world. It causes dissatisfaction with disgruntled immigrants, but never tries to really explore problems with Russian / Kazakh / Albanian cultures. If Jannaris had the right point of view on this project, he could have made an excellent production by Bel Ami. Fleeting glimpses of tinted boy beef are the only spark in this universal gangster programmer.
