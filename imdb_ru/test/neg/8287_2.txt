The star of the school track drops dead after winning the race; shortly thereafter, her older sister (Patch Mackenzie) returns home in time to notice that all members of her sisterâ€™s team disappear. Who could be the killer? Perhaps you care to want to know about it. <br /> <br /> A rough, cheap, amateur slasher costs almost nothing, although Christopher George (as a nasty, hard-training coach) tries to raise him with intense performance. Even blood is not worth mentioning. From the beginning to the end, all this is lame, starting from the opening of the film to the editing of the track and music for the disco, as well as at the casting of E.J. Picker, once starring in the movie "Hello, Dolly" as a character named "Blondie"! That's right, "Blondie." This may mean that we should not take the film seriously, but in any case it collapsed. <br /> <br /> This is a common trash joke, due to which the films "Friday the 13th" look like works. art in comparison. <br /> <br /> The only attraction may be the desire to see the early appearance of the Bath of White film from all people. <br /> <br /> 2/10
