Throughout this film, I kept thinking, why on earth did they do it as a “documentary”, but at the same time they didn’t include real shots of people who were interviewed? Of course, it would be just like any other documentary, but then the filmmakers would have to find the meaning of the film. <br /> <br /> Using a lot of famous movie stars (many of whom seemed to be asking to be in it), in order to portray “real” people, I had a feeling that there should be a predetermined message, and the director was so tuned to this, that real people cannot be trusted, therefore the actors and rehearsing scenes were used. (Yes, I know that it was also a play, but the documentary must be a documentary.) I really found that I was struck by various stars, and I continued to expect one of them to leave the character for a moment and say, "I am a good person, because I'm in it. "<br /> <br /> This film could have a much stronger social commentary if it were more objective or allowed us to see Matthew Shepard and his killers as people rather than as symbols. (Much better,“ Boys don't cry ” had an unshakable point of view on those who were involved - both good and bad.) Instead, the project Laramie read almost merciless lecture that someone's sexuality should be taken regardless of everything and even less.
