Today I went to see this film, hoping that it would have at least a semi-intellectual story. I was very disappointed because it is not. The plot and decisions of the protagonist were so far-fetched. I was hoping for a film like “A Dog's Day,” but instead I got something completely unacceptable. I actually found that I fully hope that the “hero” will be shot down, and I almost went out of the theater several times when it was supposed to happen, but it did not happen. Robbery films should not be good films, and this one tried to be that way. Every couple of minutes in the second half of the film, I found myself saying: “For nothing.” Without handing out the whole story, it revolved around the guard of an armored car, who was in financial difficulty, and whose house was going to collect. He was invited to a robbery and accepted, only to retreat as soon as the action began. Weak.
