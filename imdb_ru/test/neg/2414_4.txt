He starts with a couple of disgusting jokes in a comedy, but he soon reveals his true colors: he wants to be a clone of "Death Wish". I say “wants” because with every minute the script becomes more and more ridiculous, and ultimately it looks like an absurd “Death Wish” parody! From the love scene in the room, inexplicably filled with candles, to the “heroes” who dress like commandos and wave their machine guns because they do not want to attract attention to themselves (!) time after he was recognized as their vehicle, this film has too many ridiculous items to fit on the list. Another important problem is that you cannot distinguish most of the characters; Of course, you know who Borgnin, Roundtree and even James Van Patten are, but all the other roles could be played by different actors in different scenes, and you won’t feel the difference.
