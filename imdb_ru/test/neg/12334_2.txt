Perhaps the film I saw was completely different from the one that others saw, however, since the actors are the same, I can only think that the cut I saw in Europe was different from the one that circulated in the USA. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was the worst movie I’ve seen in the past five years. (Watching Waterman carefully ...) <br /> <br /> Why: because, in my opinion, this director took elements from every thriller that preceded it, mixed them, put them in the wrong order with the wrong music and published it . <br /> <br /> (Examples: nothing happens, the music becomes scary, and yet nothing happens. The “angry” officer annoys us in such a way that the actor can spoil any acting class. The instant that comes from nowhere There is an inevitable scene, and in the next scene all the problems have disappeared.) <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a smart movie: see Memento. If you want to see the best thriller: look at any thriller that comes to mind. If you want to see Patrick Swayze: see “Dirty Dancing.”
