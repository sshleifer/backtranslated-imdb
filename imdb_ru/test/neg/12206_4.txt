Director Delbert Mann was a much better director than this film. He directed ALL THE SILENT TO THE WESTERN BEFORE, THIS IS A MINK CABLE, AND THE LAST PATTON DAYS, among others. This mediocre, made for a television retelling of Dicken's masterpiece, is so bad that even those who are not familiar with the often filmed story will be unhappy. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the film is available only from two well-known providers (Brentwood) and BCI Eclipse LLC, the transmission quality is poor, and the fuzzy and dirty audio track makes the task of finding this movie on video useless. <br /> <br /> I always thought that if a company was going to put a movie on video and take money from it to buy it, then they should at least have a decent copy of the movie and work well on the transfer. Unfortunately, neither of the two suppliers has such a work ethic, and the result is only suitable for a discount basket at a local discount store. <br /> <br /> The story is told mainly through memories, which makes the film episodic and talkative. Much of the rich detail of the novel is lost in this translation. The characters of Martha, Tradles and others were circumcised, and the relationship between young David and Stearforth is not well understood, so we can only wonder why David is hanging out with the guy. <br /> <br /> The relationship between David, the young man and young Agnes never develops, and it’s hard to understand why she and David end up getting married. Since Martha is not counted, it remains a mystery how Dan Peggotty finds her niece. And the lack of Traddles makes David a very lonely person. <br /> <br /> Some people attribute to this film a good job of shortening a long novel. I disagree, at best, a clumsy work in a book. Anyone who saw the 1935 version of George Cukor would agree. <br /> <br /> The performances in this version of Fields in the role of Micober and Rathbone in the role of Merdstone are definitely worth seeing. And the later version of The Masterpiece Theater (April 2000) and “Hallmark” (2000) are outstanding achievements in the television adaptation of classic novels. Directed by Simon Curtis and Peter Medak, responsible for these films, deserve the highest praise. <br /> <br /> My last commentary to David Koperfild in 1969: "Do not buy it, there are some much better versions of the film." In stock. If it's on TV, switch the channel to something else. It is a waste of one hour and twenty minutes of your life. Sorry guys, but I can't praise such a terribly bad movie.
