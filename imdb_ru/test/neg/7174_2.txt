This is a terrible reworking of a very good film In the Air, with Frankie Darrow, Mantan Moreland and Marjorie Reynolds starring. I managed to walk a total of about 20 minutes before turning it off. Almost all the lines are identical, I have no idea why they will make the movie again. I completely disagree with the previous post, which does not like songs (there is the same thing). The original singing is first class, I'm not sure that Marjorie Reynolds really sang herself, it's hard to say, because the vocals are usually later and the songs are very good, surprisingly in the movie "B". If you have the opportunity to see the original, it is available on DVD. You will be pleasantly surprised.
