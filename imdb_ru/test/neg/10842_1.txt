This film looks like someone has a cute idea for a film, he thought about two or three funny possibilities, hired a good actor, and then passed it all on to a really bad screenwriter and even worse director. The director made a romantic comedy about worms, as if it was a dark, ornate film - strange camera angles, blue filtered shots, delay, and a close-up look at the raindrops. Steve Zahn was good, as always. Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; he was perfect for a romantic comedy. Sandra Bullock valiantly fought a character who was supposed to be crazy, but whose folly consisted of such things as the insane kiss of her husband, whom she hated, giving up her child, going to the carnival, offering to undress for money and furious ride with airlines. There were very few funny lines in the script; there was no physical comedy; it was boring. This introduced potentially funny situations and then turned them off before they could evolve. To crown it all, the “turn” at the end was a slap in the face to anyone who expected a merry romantic comedy. If you saw the trailer for the film and you liked it, like me, my advice: do not go to the movies. This will only ruin a good trailer.
