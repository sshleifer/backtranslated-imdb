This film was pure genius. John Waters is great. It's fun, and I'm not tired of it, even after seeing it about 20 times since I bought it a few months ago. The game is great, although Ricky Lake could be better. And Johnny Depp is great. He is such a handsome man and a very talented actor. And seeing most of Johnnyâ€™s films, this is probably my favorite movie. I give it 9.5 / 10. Rent it today!
