I expected that this film was originally supposed to show before the election. CBS last shot in throwing excavations at Bush. This film was just awful, but I still watch it. ** Minor Spoiler ** I think that CBS had the same people who "provided" a reminder to make a half-cut in half the sequence. What is the plot of the bad guy? Can the game be more far-fetched or is the dialogue more like Ed Wood's movie? Who ever thought of this script, please do us a favor to stop writing. If you want to watch decent films about class B disasters, then watch “Earthquake”, “Flooding”, etc. Avoid this mess in the movies. A hint at CBS, do not show us this nonsense. Give us repeat runs of CSI instead. Better to act and more believable.
