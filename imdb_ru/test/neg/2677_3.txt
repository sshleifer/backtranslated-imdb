There is a lot of bad in this movie. It can be said that creating a sequel to “Halloween” was a bad idea, and we should feel happy that previous records, even at the lowest level, could still be observed. But even so, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers - even today - is so bad, it is shocking. Bad movies at the worst. There is so much guilt. But where to start? On whose shoulders does this fault lie? <br /> <br /> Director Joe Chapelle - director? Well, at least the sixth part is fresh on the visual front. As for the visual effects, you can see how Michael kills in rather disgusting ways, even if it doesn't quite fit into the overall tone of the series. <br /> <br /> So, can Daniel Ferrands the problem scenario be the culprit? Well, to be honest, he did everything he could. By the time you reach the sixth record in any series, you have nowhere to go. Finding a rhyme for Michael’s reasoning is not so bad, since it’s not interesting, especially how it’s done here. And it really does not help that the movie was hacked into pieces and stitched back so many times that the story was completely lost by the end. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Dimension / Miramax could spoil it all. In the end, it was the first studio film from the Halloween series, and we all know what happens when too many cooks get into the kitchen. Gosh, look at the incredible lows that they dragged Hellraiser to? I think everyone is to blame, because, apart from the actors and the guys from the visual effects, no one seems to have made an effort to get a decent click. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that no matter how you cut it, cut it up, cut it into cubes or kill it with an electric shock until it blows its head, “Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers” has never been good the movie. Noting the record low for a series that almost killed Michael Myers' credibility, Curse is just a curse. The thorn angle was never interesting, nor was it enlarged. Useless blood is so out of place and replaces stress, which is a trademark of the name "Halloween." By the end of the film, it stops making sense, stops trying to push the plot, and just tries to find a way to kill the characters and finish the movie before anything else is lost. It is sad that the last performance of Donald Plessens is perpetuated in this film, even if this man did everything he could in the worst possible conditions. And for the most part there are other strong actors in this film. Paul Rudd plays the weird, antisocial adult Tommy Doyle in a rather natural way, while Marianne Hagan copes with the role, portraying a sympathetic female role. On the other side of the coin, Jamie Lloyd’s re-casting was a shame, and, thank God, Devin Gardner is no longer filmed. As a kid in a movie haunted by The Man in Black, Danny is anti-Jamie in that he annoys, cries and is absolutely incredible in his role. It's sad when in a horror movie you don't even feel sympathy for a child. But I think this is "Halloween 6" in a nutshell. In fact, this is anti- “Halloween”, created by the director, who did not know what he was doing, and the studio, which had its own program. Hell, even the music is bad. Many will try to paint it like a sharp Halloween because of its fantastic twist, but in fact, it's just silly. Apart from good visual effects and worthy characters, “The Curse of Michael Myers” is almost as bad as it turns out. And it comes from a fan!
