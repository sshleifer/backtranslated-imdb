The production of the film "The Heart of Darkness" in 1994 was in no way capable of justifying an outstanding book. The film contained unnecessary scenes that confused the viewer and did not help him understand what was happening. The director was clearly not experienced, and if he is, he did not show it. In addition, scenes from the book were omitted or altered, scenes that were quite important. The film made me bored and became a waste of time. The characters behaved as if they did not know what was going on, and the actors did not depict the emotions that Marlow and the others showed in the book. In general, the film was terrible, and he absolutely did not have enough waiting time, which was necessary to make it even remotely interesting.
