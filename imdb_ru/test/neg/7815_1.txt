This is by far the worst movie I've ever watched. I have never before rated film 1 out of 10. My advice is not to watch it. It is not even classified as a movie. <br /> <br /> You'd rather be bored on the couch than watch this movie. It was terrible to act, but the plot line was the worst. A very unlikely sequence of events that are not even funny. They are really very lame and stupid. A very silly choice of Ashton Kutcher and Tara Reid to play in this film. Maybe even a little upset their careers. <br /> <br /> When I entered Blockbuster, the focus was on this film, so I decided to make it. I truly regret it. <br /> <br /> Once you get into the movie for 10â€“20 minutes, you can predict what will happen. I was hoping to get better, but it got worse instead. <br /> <br /> I do not exaggerate it. The film is terrible. Do not look. Hope this helps.
