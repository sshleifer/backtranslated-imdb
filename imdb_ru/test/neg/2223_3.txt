Compared to the later ARABIAN ADVENTURE director Kevin Connor, this is a masterpiece. However, this does not say much. In fact, "ON EARTH" is a stupid fantasy adventure in which Peter Cushing - who seems to be on something strong - and some other actor (whom I don't know) use a giant excavator machine called "Iron Mole , Digging up to the core of the Earth - only to find that the inner part of the Earth is pink and inhabited by ape-like creatures that enslaved people. There is also a giant bird that controls the monkeys through telepathy, and we see it blinking its close-up eyes throughout the film. Most importantly, Cushing and what is his name are also met by the beautiful Caroline Munro in underground caves. And that's what I really have against this little click: why, when Munro is in the movie, she only gets ok. 5 minutes of screen time? In “The Spy Who Loved Me”, “Maniak”, “Dracula”, 1972, “The Golden Journey of Sinbad” - it is always in the background! How can Kevin Connor think that we'd better listen to Peter Cushing's fake accent and look at some ridiculous monkey man whose voice sounds like a scratched disc than looks at beautiful Munro? I don't understand. Please, somebody makes a film where this English brunette constantly appears on the screen!
