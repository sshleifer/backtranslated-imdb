Do not accept, because the premise of this film is good. This, but this is not a very good film, to make. <br /> <br /> Comedies require a sharp script and a masterpiece. Unfortunately, this poorly executed film has neither the one nor the other. Leconte, a good director in other genres, does not act in his comedic farces (another example is the Bronze series). <br /> <br /> Time for comedies is awful. Some jokes are wired. Some are rephrased from other films. Others just sit as if they give you time to laugh. The plot has dirty stories (allergic daughter, co-owner of a lesbian) and simply does not develop and does not cover the viewer. This is not funny, and for a moment it is implausible. <br /> <br /> Compare this with any comedy Billy Wilder (“I like it in the ass,” “Foreign Romance,” etc.) Or compatriot Leconte, Francis. Weber, a real genius in French comedy (Le Diner de Cons, Le Placard, Les Comperes, La Chevre, La Grande Blonde, etc.), and you will see the difference in their tough scenarios, great comedy game and time, with every joke leading to the next. <br /> <br /> Watching Mon Meyer Ami twice would be a cruel and unusual punishment, not a good sign for a comedy.
