This film was terrible, not only the plot was weak, but the acting was incredibly bad, and sometimes pathetic. Very unrealistic dialogues that people in real life do not speak in this way, and in one very monotonous said there are no emotions or feelings, except for the almost indistinguishable whisper that constantly occurs. Even editing is bad, the cuts are terrible. The camera work was sloppy and shaky on close-ups, even swaying during conversations. There is nothing positive in this film, and George Cutts needs to work on heavy equipment or something else where he should not communicate with other people, because he clearly does not know how to do it. How this film won / was nominated for awards, my God!
