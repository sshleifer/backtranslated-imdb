The only reason I rented the film was to see Jeri Ryan in it! Oh god, it was the most boring, meaningless film I've ever seen !!! HOW LAME !!! I mean, really, give me a break! After Voyager, I would hope that she would be offered the best roles !! <br /> <br /> If I were one of the last people on earth, I would NOT live in a tourist trailer for dessert !! It's just such a bad movie !! The case of the Indian tribe and how he compared it every 10 seconds really, really got old. Poor Jerry, good luck next time!
