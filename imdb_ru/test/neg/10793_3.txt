Bottomless pulp adventure exploitation in the jungle woman genre. Lousy audio, thankfully, hides a dumb dialogue. And this is terrible talk about a movie about people who do not speak English. There is no adventure; This is an adventure in the jungle with climbers and one attack of wild animals, which occurs in the memories. <br /> <br /> Three pale fools roam the wilderness of Africa and face rival famines of the Amazons. These wild women emerged from the Stone Age only enough to invent cosmetics, shoes, and underarm hair removal technology. Despite their despair about the "hus-bahnd," ladies insist that they will fight with men and burn the weaker. <br /> <br /> The only interest, as in the case of any questions, is the assortment of young women dressed in animal skins, artfully designed like 1951 bathing suits. A lot of struggle and bad dance combined with striped movements of the 1950s. No nudity or noticeable violence. On the other hand, you can hum this memorable song for a few days.
