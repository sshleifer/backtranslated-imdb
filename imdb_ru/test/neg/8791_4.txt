A funny movie in which two swinging college graduates move to California, and one becomes a movie star, and the other becomes its manager. <br /> <br /> After 10 years, the starâ€™s popularity is declining, so it is determined that it will be a TV show where women will fight for its affection. <br /> <br /> The movie is nasty and funny. Girls who vie for a lover look stupid. It seems that only one girl chose the producer of the show. She is really an amateur compared to some other women, but she is helpful and brings good marks to the show. <br /> <br /> In the third scene, you realize that the manager falls in love with her. <br /> We know that Ryan really should have become a bachelor. Although the finale is pretty pretty, you really know where it goes.
