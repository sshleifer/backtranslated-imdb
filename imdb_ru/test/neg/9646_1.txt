I generally like the work of Zion Sono, but this film was completely backward. But, unfortunately, not retarded enough to make him mentally retarded. I just sat with my mouth open, wondering when it would end. The plot has only a whisper of meaning. I think it was intended to be camped. I mean, haunted hair extensions - how can this not be? But the humor it was, fell apart. Not funny. Not scary. Do not burn. I would say that Sono may have been an employee in this project, but it looks like he wrote this boring garbage. I still need to fill in a couple more lines, what else can I say? I guess I could finish by saying: lucky next time, Sono-san.
