Ed Gein: The butcher from Plainfield is located in the small American town of Plainfield in Wisconsin in 1957, where the solitary Ed Gein (Kane Hodder) lives alone on a farm after dying, if his mother and brother. The local police had a number of serious robberies, and when the local barmaid Sue Layton (Ceia Coley) had suspicions that something was going on. Ed is a violent, sexually deviant man who kidnaps girls and kills them. The police will find out the truth in time to save Erika (Adrien Franz), the sheriff’s daughter (Timothy Oman) ... <br /> <br /> Written by: producer and director Michael Feifer, it was an attempt to create a horror movie around real events the notorious serial killer is Ed Hein, and turns out to be pretty shitty. In real life, Ed Gein was only convicted of two murders and died in 1984, but he was inspired by several films, including Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Mad (1974) and Ed Gein (2000). the worst movie about gein Despite the fact that ed gein was real almost nothing, this film is based on facts, gein never had an accomplice, none of his victims were associated with any of the investigators, there was no victim of a car accident, although gein retains its name by other people changed the name, abduction and murder of two women depicted here, actually actually happened after four years, but in this film it happens for a couple of days, and here Hein is shown as a huge muscular man in reality he was skinny th, the old and rather short. Like the actual drama Ed Gein: The Butcher from Plainfield is worthless and as pure entertainment is not better with a deadly dull pace and feeling for him, the character is all boring, and when he doesn't kill someone, Gein is shown working or just walking around and very boring There is no waiting, because we know who the killer is, and this is just a tedious wait until he is caught in the end. There is no real attempt to penetrate the consciousness of Heins, since the creators do not give him more motivation than the sometimes hallucinations of his domineering mother. <br /> <br /> There is not much blood here, there is a scene with a woman hanging on a hook with meat, there is a really badly edited scene where Gein chops off his leg, there are ordinary banks of body organs and skulls lying around, and also some blood but there really is nothing to worry about. The film was obviously processed in such a way as to bleach most of the color of the image, as sometimes it is not too far from black and white, I personally think that the lack of color makes it even more boring. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 1,500,000, I cannot understand where the money went in a very easily forgotten business. Although installed in Wisconsin it was filmed in California. Kane Hodder is completely unsuitable for the role of Ed Gane, just from the physical point of view Hodder does not even remotely resemble Gane, and he shows rather poor performance because he just stares at the camera, making silly faces. <br /> Ed Gein: “The Ark in Plainfield” is shit, and it is so simple and straightforward. Both the actual drama, and purely entertaining entertaining program, it is a complete nonsense from beginning to end, and nothing can recommend it.
