I feel dumber after watching the first 20 minutes, fortunately I went out and saved the rest of my brain, people should watch the best films and take notes on why they are rated highly, and not because of the film’s budget or special effects just good acting and correct simple things, and most importantly - not to be LAME - but I think it was done for those Sheeple without taste, and not the key to understanding that a “good movie” will not be afraid of low film ratings, save your undervalued high scores for "once in a lifetime movies." Keep in mind that many use IMDb for proven reviews and opinions, do not spoil the broth with sugar hide. Peace and love
