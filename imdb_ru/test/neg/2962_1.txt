This film was produced by Producers Releasing Corp. (China) among the so-called “Poverty” film studios of the 1930s and 40s. So you can imagine how little money was spent on it. <br /> <br /> Music is forgotten. The cast of Jerrah Yang really demonstrates the voice of opera quality, but this is a kind of discount from Dinna Durbin. The IMDb database does not show any other movie appearances for her, so let's hope that she was able to move to some position in the Grand Opera. <br /> <br /> The opening credits for the print recently shown by Turner Classic films show that this film has been preserved by the National Cinema Museum. The question immediately arises: WHY? <br /> <br /> Are their resources so abundant that they can afford to save garbage? Some low-budget musicals or musicals of that era have useful features that make them worthwhile. This film does not have. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, skip this movie. It really spends an hour of your time.
