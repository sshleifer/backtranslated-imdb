Fat Girls is one of the worst films in the indie gay genre. <br /> <br /> The rationale is promising: for a middle-aged gay teenager who has fallen into the trap, they end up in the repressive little town of Texas. His only soul mates are other losers from the village school: a cool fat girl, a naive immigrant from Cuba, and a sensitive drama teacher. So far that's interesting. Theoretically, this storyline creates a decent setting for an attractive adulthood story with a built-in audience — thousands of gays who grew up in small cities across America and experienced this teenage worry first-hand, a dozen of self-deprecating humor. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Ash Christian, instead of the nuance of the drama, approaches his autobiographical plot with a poorly executed attempt at irony and dark humor. The result is a set of incredible, derivative, two-dimensional symbols, to which the viewer cannot but feel indifferent. Sabrina (Fink) - Quasi-Gothic bitter navel. She is such a prickly, not sympathetic person; There is no doubt about the cause of her condition without friends. The chemistry between her and Rodney (Christian) registers zero. Perhaps it was a bad cast, but most likely because of the script, which simply can not be saved. Consequently, it remains to be surprised when there is such a non-existent connection that could guarantee their almost constant communication throughout history. <br /> <br /> Sabrina’s new-found boyfriend, Rudy (de Jesus), and Rodney Judy’s mother (Theaker) are some of the most exaggerated cliché characters ripped from dozens of other films. Rudy is a nervous, underperforming immigrant / nerd, filmed directly from every obscene “comedy” ever made by teens or television or movies. Judy is the born-again obsessed with Jesus and great hair. Just when you thought that Tammy Fay's case was done to death, Christian puts in a scene where Judy's mascara runs with tears! Is there anyone in the civilized world who might think that this weary, old stereotypical gag is still funny after he saw him nauseously for 20 years? <br /> <br /> In addition to unsuccessful attempts at sardonic humor, there are many mysteries of inconsistencies in history. Rodney considers himself a "fat ugly" loser. However, at the same time he manages to participate in random and regular improvised meetings with the omnipresent school athlete Ted (Miller). Although these connections are devoid of emotional satisfaction, most gay teens (filled with rabid testosterone, like their hetero brothers) find this quite enviable, given the more common alternative to involuntary celibacy. <br /> <br /> Rodney finds the object of his love in Bobby (Brüning), an exotic graft from England. Despite all the plausible chances, the guy not only lands in this tiny village of TX, but is also conveniently open to gays. Like Sabrina, Bobby is an icy, evil clever girl, and the viewer lacks a head to understand his attractiveness. <br /> <br /> To his great pleasure, Rodney was invited by his new hobby to the city gay bar, where Bobby claims that he is a DJ. Upon arrival, the future guy immediately leaves Rodney alone and goes to another part of the bar for a quick meeting with a rather handsome young man. This is another of the ridiculously inexplicable elements of the plot, since Rodney's feeling as an outcast is supposedly largely due to his lonely existence in the parish city. No matter how small the city is, do they have gay students in high school? Secretly bisexual football captain? Lesbian moms? Gay teacher? and in the center of the city there is a gay bar (under the patronage of attractive men, no less)? Apparently, this place is not so provincial. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, Edge of Seventeen by Todd Stevens shot almost the same material with a much more creative, honest, touching and humorous film.
