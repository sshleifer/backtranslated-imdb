The narration was clear and concise, but overall the film never attracted my interests, the scenes seemed flat and boring. Historically, Genghis Khan had a very interesting / epic life, but the film could not capture it - instead he focused on small skirmishes like youth and a love story, I think I saw disguised in a number of other films. I never felt sympathy or sympathy for leadership â€” yes, he had to overcome slavery, but then it seemed he could easily get to theft, murder, and double crossing his way to the top. The only quality that could be used is photography. Landscapes, of course, helped to create a dull atmosphere of the film, unfortunately, combined with the darkness of the plot. I remained indifferent and disappointed.
