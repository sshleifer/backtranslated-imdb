This show is based on the concept that loud + nasty + repetition = funny. There is no comedy writing, in fact, I face serious consequences, even comparing it with entertainment of any kind. Here is the premise. Two girls randomly publish their scams on the Internet, and after their initial success, they are followed by fun, they invent the idea that they should make a webcast to demonstrate their brilliance. <br /> <br /> OK, so where do I start? Let's start with the track of laughter, often used, but never a good reminder that we, the audience, should laugh. According to the guys from Foley, this show is the funniest thing on the planet. We all have to throw loads in our pants due to the brilliance of humor placed in front of us. The laughter track goes seriously every few seconds. It is quite possible that Scooby-Doo usurped the excessive use of the king's track of laughter. <br /> <br /> Then with a trick that sounds like this: “screaming at the top of our lungs — a crazy bunch of words — seems silly” is not enough for success. Wow, and let's not forget to create new words to sound funny. What is web-licensing and poop? What the hell ... <br /> <br /> Finally, acting skills. I can not fully complain here. The actors are young and inexperienced, but this should and can be corrected by good professional help. Because of his inexperience, Nick should help the actors define their skills. Instead, in the usual way, the actors are placed in front of the camera and say “act”. What for the most part is a robotic repetition of lines, missed time and a total epic failure. <br /> <br /> The absence of anything on this show makes a disgusting idea of ​​how not to be funny. Do not waste your time. This show humiliates all of humanity.
