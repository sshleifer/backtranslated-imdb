This film was bad, but so bad that in the distant future it could become a cult. A sort of film noir meets Plan 9 from space. The story was, well, actually there was no story. There is a place reserved for Ed Woods and Russ Meyers, and this film proves it. “So bad, it can be good” is the best way to describe it. I seriously doubt that this film will be shot by any legitimate distribution company, so it is unlikely that he will see wide distribution. <br /> <br /> I’ll add that I expect to see more actor Ron Carey. He made the best of what he had. The rest of acting, if I can call it that, was pretty easily forgotten. I have seen worse from big studios with huge budgets.
