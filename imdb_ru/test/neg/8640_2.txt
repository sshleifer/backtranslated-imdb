I watched Netflix Instant a few months ago and left a review there. <br /> <br /> Let me say that most of the other reviews are very accurate. This film was bad writing, bad acting and bad directing. I also liked Russell and Pare "in the old days", and I really hoped for them. In my review of Netflix, I mentioned that I had lost interest in the film and started washing dishes and making a sandwich, but I still watched the movie from the kitchen. When I returned to the living room, I was very distraught when the last 5 minutes of the film turned around. I even rewound it to make sure I didn't miss anything. This film is completely devoted to how to make a "twist" ending. I suspect the idea sounded good, maybe the script was intriguing, but the budget was so non-existent that the kits were really missing. And yes, I believe that all these “bad sets” were an attempt to give the viewer a hint. Everything he told me was a "low budget". <br /> <br /> In any case, the reason I came here was because at the weekend I saw an overview of Shutter Island and what the reviewers said or didn’t say. , make me believe that Shutter Island is the same thing, only with a budget of 50–60 times more! (Actually, I have no idea how much the Dark World costs, but I hope that they have not spent more than 1 million!) <br /> <br /> So anyway, I thought that if anyone rework the script a bit, getting a bigger budget for a better “look” (whether it’s the best stage designer or the best color coloring, just a man with foresight), they could turn Dark World into a decent product. Now it sounds like it does Shutter Island. They seem to understand the correct vision, but the scripts can still be turned off. Money can not buy everything, but they must be in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> PS My 2-star rating for Russell and Pare.
