Now, let's see if I understood correctly that a crazy serial killer is walking around killing real estate agents ... well ... what’s wrong with this scenario, I can live with it. <br /> <br /> What's next, the slasher with the tax inspectors killed? Road guards cut to death? Should we be sympathetic to empty-headed and petty money-obsessed people? Uh ... no. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if you do not joke, this is simply not a very well-made film with bad acting and brutal effects, the climate scene is especially dumb. You can almost see the director shouting "action" to the stuntman as he falls through the window glass. <br /> <br /> As another reviewer rightly said, starring in the lead role in The Mist, it was Nadir’s career, Adrienne Barbo. Therefore, I was glad to see that she lit it up by becoming the voice of "Catwoman" in the animated series "Batman", and also watched the extras in the live action movie "Catwoman". NB: by the way, this is not a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie, think about a bad episode of “Kozhak” or “Streets of San Francisco”, and you get an idea of ​​what is offered here.
