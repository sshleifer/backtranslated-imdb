The accident is overloaded, thought out and overheated. An excellent example of how to make a pompous and important film with a message. Haggis tries his best to express his point of view, and interrupts in almost every category of the film. He is very in love with his own sense of social significance and has all the subtleties of a jackhammer to the skull. Of course, racial attitudes affect everyone, and there are many ambiguities in this matter, but the Crash universe works to suggest that we are all victims of our own ideas about race. This is a tedious thread that repeats itself to nausea and wears out during the first 30 minutes. I found the results of the characters unsurprising and compelled, and the film spent ages to splash out and die. The fact that this film is in the top 50 IMDb films is evidence of the public’s willingness to be deceived by Hollywood malaria. <br /> <br /> Indeed, if you want a real “wreck”, see one from David Cronenberg: dark, twisted, and original. This film plays as preaching, tedious and masochistic.
