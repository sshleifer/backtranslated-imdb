If you have never read the classic science fiction novel on which this mini-series is based, it can really be good. Unfortunately, if you are a fan of the book, you probably will not be able to watch more than the first hour or two. All political intrigue was removed from the film, the most important scenes from the book were taken out, the motivation of the characters was completely changed, and the words from the wrong characters of the mouths. While in the novel, Paul Atredis was a teenage boy with incredible political prowess and an excellent understanding of how the world works, in this film he is hot and upset. Avoid this movie at all costs.
