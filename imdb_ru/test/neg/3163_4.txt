To be honest, I met a real Han Soo Ying and saw how an American actress portrays her, who has nothing to do with the fact that the Chinese make me turn my head while I watch this movie. Why Hollywood can't get Nancy Kwan instead ... at least its true story ... because for God's sake ... Dr. Han Soo Ying is Chinese, I know, because I met her personally <br /> <br /> and watched the entire cast .... so few Asian faces in the movie about an Asian love story make me think too <br /> <br /> I think the acting is good, but without real Asian faces in Asian love story the plot is so banal and the whole load of Baloni /> <br /> It's like another movie that I know about “The Conqueror”, I imagine, to I have to get out my eyes when I see John Wayne as Genghis Khan !!!!! <br /> <br /> and worse. ... how on earth can a man born in the Mongolian steppes come up with Alabama's southern accent ??? !! and cheap imitation of something Asian <br /> <br /> Good Gour <br /> <br /> No wonder that one day I will see Dr. Martin Luther King Jr br /> <br /> I would very much like to see this <br /> <br /> and laugh at the whole roof !!! <br /> <br /> Cheers
