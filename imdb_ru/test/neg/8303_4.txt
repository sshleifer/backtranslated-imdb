A real gothic horror classic! <br /> <br /> Um, actually this is a terrible movie. Best in this: Rosalba Neri's naked nipples. Strongly sucking stuff. <br /> <br /> Yes, of course, Rosalba Neri is one beautiful lady. I had never even heard of her before, but she is a damn pretty woman. But, to be honest, those were her nipples, which made it for me in that very last scene, before the film suddenly ends, all naked and fixed ... Just the nipples of a dream, dude. Well, sorry, I got a little carried away ... <br /> <br /> In general, I got what I expected from LADY FRANKENSTEIN: This is a dirty and terrible film with a big silly, ugly monster Frankenstein and a pair of naked boobs. And there is a lock in it. So I was not disappointed or something else. In some places, he pulled too much (the first resurrection of the creature lasted for ages, and Papa Frankenstein just experimented, talked, tried something else). There was one funny, stupid homage to the original Frankenstein: instead of throwing the little girl into the lake, here the Mongoloid Frankie took his naked chick and threw her into the river. I was laughing. <br /> <br /> Some of my friends, however, were too outraged by this film. Maybe I expected too much. But Rosalba's nipples were probably worth it ... (Damn, I really need to stop mentioning her nipples). I think I'll just finish this user comment now.
