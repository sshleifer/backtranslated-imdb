I have just been to the cinema in the center of Prague, I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> Not because of the poster I found a very old-fashioned heroic Hollywood style <br /> <br />. Not because of the high level of the main role, which reminds me that the majority of these high-profile French films with high roles are usually pitiful. But only because there are not so many films in my French mother tongue in such a city <br /> <br /> as Prague. And because I love Ajani, Depardieu and Rappenau Cyrano. Then I decided to write this short comment, because I think that <br /> <br /> I really disagree with the main stream of comments on this film on imdb. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. The film just looks like a poster. The characters <br /> <br /> are as stupid as they look. For a while, I <br /> <br /> thought Ajani would be a caricature — just a funny character <br /> <br /> that you can laugh at. No, she is not! For example, when she decides to tell <br /> <br /> Depardieu that it was she who killed the fat girl that she killed at the beginning of the movie, then the violins come in big fat pity <br /> <br /> music that makes you cry and understand that the character Adajani is the deeper person it looks like. Maybe it was humor at the 10th level, <br /> <br />, but I'm sorry that my sense of humor is not so high! If I want to watch <br /> <br /> some funny French film about the Second World War, I’ll watch La Grande again <br /> <br /> Vadrouille! This is definitely more fun! I also read on imdb <br /> <br /> that Lemoine plays great in this movie. I have to <br /> <br /> say that I have never seen such a bad game! (Well, I have never seen a single Ed Wood movie.) However, the film is well shot with a lot of good <br /> <br /> (very expensive) scenes, such as a scene with the Pantheon in the morning <br /> <br /> when the German army arrives in Paris or when refugees settle in Bordeaux Bridge I think Rappenau is a good director, but <br /> <br /> he copes better with a good script. With Cyrano was easy. He <br /> <br /> shouldn’t write dialogs! <br /> <br /> I give 1/10.
