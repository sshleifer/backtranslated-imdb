An artificial melodrama with a script adapted by Mel Dinelli from his play “The Man,” concerns the hostess of the boarding house, who accepts a restless craftsman who can be killed. Despite the solid work of Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan (both try their best), this tedious yarn is not very inventive as part of its one main set (which quickly becomes visually boring) and the sparsely populated composition of characters (however there is a smart dog who feels the worst! ). Suspicious and without humor, with a raised indication from Harry Horner (perhaps Lupino should have sent?). Where are all the expectations promised by advertising? Dinelli was also a co-producer. * 1/2 of ****
