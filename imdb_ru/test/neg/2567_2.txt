Dr. Steven Segal saves the world from a deadly virus outbreak. This film seems to me stupid seriousness, turned into an unintentional classic of the camp (the best look). Memorable lines include: “Knowledge is like a deer. Throw him, and he will flee from you ”and“ Drink this. It will make you feel better. ” This is very bad - they could not have done worse if they had tried. <br /> <br /> Seagal is trying to convince you that he is 1. sensitive - saving a defeated pony; 2. A good father - a scene of cooking saccharin for his daughter; 3. man of science - looking at the false spectrum; 4. in harmony with nature - with the help of homeopathic remedies; 5. politically correct and multicultural - having Indian friends; 6. iconoclasm - by opening rural practice after the former life in the national research laboratory; and 7. action hero - being really fat, but still can fight. ROTFL. <br /> <br /> It’s nice to see a Saturday night movie with friends, preferably (but not necessarily!) Intoxicated.
