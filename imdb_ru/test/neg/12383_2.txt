This is almost Ed Wood's territory. Yes, this ridiculous crash of a flying monster looks like something between a turkey buzzard and a bad day in the dentist's office. And this screech of sound effect makes the nails on the board sound like Mozart. And why the Giant Claw, when a blunt beast devours its victims with a mechanical jaw. We get close-ups of an ugly chicken foot, but no more. I think the producers thought that a more appropriate name for Big Mouth could be the comedy of Jerry Lewis. And if we talk about comedies, then this whole “antimatter” is crazy, the funniest thing in the Lewis film. I guess the writers were stuck for the reason that the ordinary duck hunter could not take care of the flying threat of the 1950s, so they came up with a real dummy - anti-matter from another galaxy. Yes, this KFC fugitive is supposed to have flown in from another galaxy behind antimatter shields, as explained in painful detail by one of the film's permanent geniuses. In this case, this is Jeff Morrow, the pilot, whom I collect during off-hours, advising Einstein the secrets of the universe. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is also Morrow, who keeps ridiculous production outside the Hall of Shame of a bad movie, as he actually delivers his lines with an open face. Moreover, it even sounds like it believes them. This is a movie with a triumph of first order. Damn it with Oscar, Morrow deserves a battle medal for what he has performed above and beyond the call of duty in the most extreme conditions of bad cinema. Watch the leading lady Corday, then you can measure his stamina under fire. She looks like she just woke up in a bad dream, and maybe, if she stops, no one will notice her. I barely did. Well, the first time I saw this disaster on the road, I saw a haze in the back row of what is now a residential building. I had to learn my lesson and disperse another 12-pack a second time.
