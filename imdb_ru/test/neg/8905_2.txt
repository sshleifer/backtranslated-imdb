Last night I was watching a TV guide and watched a film with Heather Graham in the lead role, which I liked in films like Boogie Nights and Austin Powers, so I decided to watch it. It all started well, but you could tell that the story was not enough, and about halfway through it began to deteriorate. I do not remember that this film was in cinemas, and I am sure that if he was, he would not have been there for a long time. The action was stale and unconvincing, the dialogue was stupid and predictable, and the story was confusing and stupid. Definitely, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I like movies like the ones they were compared to, like Fight Club, but this one doesn't fit !! Since then, Heather Gram has done much better. I gave him 2 out of 10, but that's because I clicked on the wrong number, I wanted to give him 1.
