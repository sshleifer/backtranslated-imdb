The Brave One is about a New York radio show host named Erica Bane (Jodie Foster). Her life is a dream living in a city in which she grew up and loves. She has her great fiancé David (Navin Andrews), whom she is going to marry. But one night, when Erica and David are walking with their dog, they are attacked and robbed by a group of degenerates, leaving David dead. Erika is recovering, but later becomes overwhelmed and injured, and struggles with real life. She buys a gun from a guy on the street for protection. But one day she goes shopping in a store, and a man enters and shoots a clerk. It was then that Erika shoots and kills this man, and she becomes alert. Kill anyone who tries to threaten or harm her or others. At the same time, Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard) is tracking down this elusive unknown killer and will be friends with Erica in the process. Erika begins to regain her sanity by killing these cruel people, but she’s not sure if what she’s doing is right is moral. And when she and Mercer get closer, he doesn't even realize that the unknown killer is next to him. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster plays very well in Brave. She brilliantly portrays this type of violent, morally corrupt character. Terrence Howard is also great in this film. Both have excellent chemistry together and strengthen the film to a certain level. Bold looks visually untouched, and conveys some brilliant camera work, but not all of this works with great effect. Scenes where Erica is completely traumatized and afraid to go out of his front door to meet with the world. The camera swayed back and forth to the sides almost as if in a dream and really captured the moment with the essence. Considering that almost every time Erika killed someone, everything had to happen slowly and show her facial expression in the smallest detail. Slo-mo was properly used when Erica committed her first murder. But why continue to do this effect almost every time she commits a murder? Filming creates a great atmosphere in most films, but there are several scenes that are simply unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The Brave One is very keen on how these killings emotionally affect Erica. Her fiance is murdered by a group of thugs, and suddenly her love for New York is turned upside down. She understands that her beloved city has a dark side, and she talks about this in her radio show. I do not fully understand this yet. Erica behaves as if she never understood that violence can occur at night in the city, and this is pretty silly. If she lived there all her life, she must be either blind or very forgetful. Erika also seems to crave inhuman, suicidal people. She really doesn't even need to look for them, they just come to her, as if they are begging to shoot themselves for their wrongdoings. The brave first decides morality and the proper use of violence, and then suddenly glorifies it. The ending is very negative, completely immoral and inhuman. It also negates the goal of the character Terrence Howard, who is spending so much time trying to develop it evenly, and suddenly his morals turn to another level. The moral in “The Brave” becomes very fragmented, and by the end simply collapses everywhere. So what's wrong with violence? Is it good to commit murder, if it is for the sake of revenge? I almost refuse to believe it. You know why? Because I have a conscience, which in this film is probably not enough. It is wrong to take the life of another person, no matter how bad he is or how much you hate him. Erica Bane intends to stop these villains, but in the end she is no better than the terrible people she kills. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard give this film a lot of strength. Brave contains a strong message, but this message is immoral and wrong. This film can look beautiful, well played and intellectually strong. But it gets pretty rotten by the end. I give “Brave” 1.5 out of 4. The message is very non-standard and morally wrong, and it cannot be saved by a good game.
