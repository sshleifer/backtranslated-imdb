Do you hear this sound? This is the sound of H.G. Wells, rolling over in his grave, between this version and Spielberg’s cinematic abortion, it was a tough year for a classic novel. But at least Steven did a few right things compared to this shit. Hello, the ships were not big insects, they had names. These were tripods, and the aliens worked by three. The ships and the aliens were wrong, in fact you do not see the aliens to the end. The effects and cast are working great. But these actors are much better than this “film” deserves. Most of the film, if not the entire film, is Howell's character, reflecting on the destruction, dating one person, they join him, and he loses them for one reason or another. At any given time on camera no more than two people, although most of the film. It’s as if they were making three films at the same time, the film would be over budget or something like that. Such a fat, unique and significant only watchable adaptation of the history of “War of the Worlds” is a version of GEORGE PAL as far back as the 1950s. BLACK HOLE.
