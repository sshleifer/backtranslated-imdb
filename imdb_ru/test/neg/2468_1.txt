This movie is terrible. If you plan to watch this movie ... two words NOT. It's tasteless, the storyline is really lame, and the jokes are even worse. The game is really pathetic. I can't believe this movie was made. Rather, see “American Pie”, “Greek Trekking” or “Autotravel”, if you are set to comedy for teenagers. This is about two girls who go to Malibu during their spring break. As usual, they didn’t plan much and called (I think her name is Michelle) an uncle to break up in his Malibu mansion. Uncle Benny strictly forbids them to hold any parties, and, as you may have guessed, they go ahead and do it. Please, I urge you not to watch this movie.
