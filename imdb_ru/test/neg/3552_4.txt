A plot that is dumb beyond belief. However, nonetheless, it should be recognized that the main actors play their roles as if it were Shakespeare. And so it should be. It is not their fault that the author seems to be in a coma. <br /> <br /> Hats off to what is actually a very tricky representation of Joanna Kearns. It proves that just because it is not on the page does not mean that the role cannot be captured and buried. And she does it with pleasure. Good for her. <br /> <br /> The same goes for Christina Elise, who is meant to be a little more embarrassed and weeping, but goes far beyond what the script asks for. <br /> <br /> And the Grant Show, too. Prime and Prime Time soap graduate (Ryan Hope, Melrose Place). It is always universal and undervalued. Its main disadvantage seems to be that it cannot be ignored. He is a strong, well-grounded actor, capable of more than is usually given to him. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is mainly window dressing. <br /> <br /> The direction is enough, and the script, as I said, is rather idiotic. <br /> <br /> Watch this video to enjoy three good actors in the main roles, enjoying the much needed chewing of the scenery. It's fun.
