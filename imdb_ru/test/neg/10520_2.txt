This film - the blatant robbery of "Air germ" - REALLY about parents who are too worried about raising children. All the weaknesses of the characters (for example, adult coaches who do not know the game) are taken to the extreme - so much so that they are completely incredible, not funny. <br /> <br /> There is no semblance of reality here, guys, and you will not show sympathy for ANY of the characters. <br /> <br /> The best thing in the film is the beautiful sets (uniforms) of the opposing team in the first game the dog plays. Perhaps this was chosen because the situation is supposedly near Arlington Heights, Illinois, the home of Brian McBrideâ€™s Columbus Crew franchise.
