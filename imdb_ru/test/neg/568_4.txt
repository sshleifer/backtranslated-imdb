Really funny story with good actors, but she somehow misses. The actors are older, but none of them looked particularly good. They needed better make-up, take a picture or something like that. This is supposed to be a love story, and yet the film had a rougher look of a street film. I liked the cast, but I think the performances were pretty soft. This is where the director's weakness manifests. Perhaps if Mrs. Spielberg directed Mr. Spielberg, it would be a much better movie.
