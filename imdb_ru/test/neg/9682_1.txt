This performance of "Noah's Ark" returned Holmark's (and Turner's) reputation to 100 years. Nevertheless, production has its own bright side ... experience for beginning filmmakers in how to "not make a movie" <br /> <br /> Where can we find these quotes and situations in the annals of biblical literature and common sense: < br /> <br /> "Okay, guys, let's sit down." "It's too bad that God created the sun to shine only during the day, when we really needed it at night." "We do not kiss ... we only whisper to each other in the mouth." <br /> <br /> Timber for the construction of an ark with the inscription "Georgia Pacific". Metal nails. Children's flying kites. A merchant (like James Coburn can sleep after that) sells Chinese hats. The pirates attack the wooden Ark, which they wanted to capture, with fiery tar balls released from catapults. Glass bottles of wine (Noah was constantly intoxicated. It was a miracle that he could see the Ark, not to mention its construction). Lady Godiva (Mary Steenberg in a light wig tipping the Ark on a white horse ... still appreciated G) Repel biblical pirates with an iron (teflon-covered?) Skillet. Landing on Mount Ararat after the passage of the Straits of Hercules. <br /> <br /> etc., etc., etc. <br /> <br /> Special effects ... they should be seen in the order not to believe them. <br /> <br /> The list can be continued. This film is not to be missed; but if you need the full TV version, you must call NBC to view it on the screen ... but only if you agree to remove the entire responsibility from NBC for broadcasting it at all. In video stores there is only a version with a flaw (without pirates, etc.) ... that is, in those video stores that dare to stock up on it. <br /> <br /> Marvin Kohn <br /> <br />
