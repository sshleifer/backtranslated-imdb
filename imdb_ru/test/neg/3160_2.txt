Sphiris used this documentary to promote the punk stereotype. This documentary is biased and directed, not objective. Cutting techniques that move from interview to interview can be used to take the spoken word out of context. When you watch a movie, the idea of ​​an awkward idea wakes up because of punks interviews. Group members and other punks seem to have low intelligence and are unable to explain their motives or give detailed or consistent answers or even answers at all. I very much doubt that if some of the respondents knew what Spheeris was creating, or saw that the final product would allow them to be included in the project. This film puts the punks in a bad light, making them seem unreasonable and narrow-minded. Sphiris film should not be taken as a representation of the punk scene L.A. If you want to watch a good punk documentary, see “Another State of Mind” with the participation of the Youth Brigade and social distortions.
