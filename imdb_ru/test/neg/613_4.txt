I became a big fan of Carpenters, and I didn’t really like this movie. <br /> <br /> I feel that he is too focused on her anorexia and did not allow her true personality to manifest. I didn’t like Cynthia Gibb too much; especially knowing that she decided that anorexia Karen was a suicide, which clearly was not. Although her family was not too good for hugs and kisses, I thought that in the film Agnes (their mother) is terrible. <br /> <br /> I found several scenes that are troubling, for example, where she sees herself in the mirror, which seems to distort her and makes her more difficult; I thought the metaphor (so to speak) was quite effective. When the family plays billiards and discusses her divorce, she goes crazy and Richard is shocked when he consoles her and feels that her frail body is also quite moving (which is probably not the right word). <br /> <br /> Overall, I feel that they had to show her a more playful, fancy side — her true personality. Even though the focus of the film really didn’t make sense, which made the person understand that it would lead to anorexia (although, of course, no one could know about it), and almost made it seem unreasonable. In my opinion, the film was a poorer anorexic singer than the story of Karen Carpenter. <br /> <br /> I would suggest that they changed the name / profession of her husband, and all because they could not get his permission to actually include him (there were some bad conditions), but all this aspect was inaccurate with the changes. On this note, I can not remember the film, which tells about her longing for the family and children, which largely prevails in her life and explains her tumultuous romance and quick marriage with her husband. <br /> <br /> In general, this is ultimately a low-budget film for television, which is not of very high quality and can be disappointing if you are a hardcore fan who hopes to see not only Karen’s disease. I feel that such a legend deserves / deserves a better film as a tribute to an amazing person and a stunning voice.
