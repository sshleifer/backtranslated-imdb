What really stood out in this film was how little plot made sense. So many characters were randomly introduced, it was like I imagined Tommy Viso's “ROOM” to be rethought for the Disney Channel film set. We had a wise old couple who kept hanging out where Jane worked, telling the same story about how Soda brought them together, or Jane's mom / stepmother / random woman, who all appeared at random times. <Br /> <br /> Aaron Carter’s acting is definitely the highlight of this film: I was really looking forward to every scene in which he appeared. Editing is terribly bad, with scene cuts that do not make sense. The character "Jane" is really annoying, loafing around and scoffing at "JD McQueen." The scenes with “Music Awards” are more depressing than anything else. And the ending of this film is surreal.
