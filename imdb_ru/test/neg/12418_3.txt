If you decide to watch Wild Rebels, do not expect anything deep and significant. If you're looking for a movie that explores the relationship and structure of a motorcycle gang, Wild Rebels is not the movie. If you're looking for exposing the collapse of the American education system and the problem of juvenile crime, Wild Rebels is not the movie. If you're looking for a film that tells how low-income rural police departments face a well-funded, well-organized gang, Wild Rebels is not the movie. But if you are looking for an absurd film filled with a scene behind the scenes of unintentional humor, terrible acting, plot on thin paper and production values ​​in the style of a public theater, Wild Rebels is a suitable film. <br /> <br /> “Wild Rebels” is the story of a livestock driver named Rod Tillman (Steve Alaimo). After a fiery collision (from which Rod leaves completely unharmed, despite the fact that he has only cotton trousers and a London Fog-style jacket for protection), Rod decides to abandon him. Having no plan for the future, except wandering aimlessly along the back roads of the South, he stumbles upon a motorcycle gang of Satan's Angels (the crew are the three silliest guys who ever button a leather jacket and the woman they seem to share. This group of hooligans spends their time terrorizing a rural city in Florida, committing such atrocities as stealing a newspaper from a neighbor's mailbox. These clumsy idiots need someone who will be their driver during some of the big crimes they have planned. Apparently, these three Einstein can only drive two tires, not four. Therefore, they hire Rod to commit daring exploits, that only an experienced stunt driver will be able to keep the car in the middle of a gravel road during a chase at low speed. In the end, they detain the bank, enter into the aforementioned low-speed chase and arrange the toughest exchange of fire with the police ever filmed. I could go on forever, but you get it. <br /> <br /> I hate the term "so bad it is good," but this seems to describe Wild Rebels well.
