I'm sitting here writing this review, and the film is not over yet. In fact, I just checked and there are still 45 minutes left. But it does not matter, do not need to bring it to the end. I’ll just write this review and laugh while the film plays in the background and stumbles over some supposedly horrible conclusion that I don’t want to see or know. <br /> <br /> What explains my hostility to this film? Characters are not believable. The plot is implausible. The pretentiousness of the film is disgusting. In fact, every element of the movie sounds false. Bushemi obviously thought he had something to add to the dozens of films in which the worn out themes of dysfunctional families and the seeming meaninglessness of life were already being explored. However, Bushemi was wrong, because there is nothing new in this film. He tries very hard to be depressing, but, fortunately, no one can really get depressed, because it is obvious that such people do not exist in the whole world. <br /> <br /> But what is depressing is the knowledge that, somehow, several undeserved awards were recognized for this film. Disgusting !!!! The bottom line: stay away from this useless movie at all costs.
