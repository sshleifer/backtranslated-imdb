Director Niko Mastorakis made a cynical grabber (by his own admission) who is too cynical to surprise anyone except a fan of the sophomore genre. <br /> <br /> The most extreme, opposing genre image to paraphrase the character in VIDEO, “to have a philosophy”; this is what makes them dangerous. <br /> <br /> The philosophy of ISLAND OF DEATH is to throw many of the “shocking” elements into the cinematic mix and slowly mix. The result is a dish without taste, but with an ugly appearance. <br /> <br /> Not to be confused with a Serrador diamond. WHO CAN KILL A CHILD? (sometimes called ISLAND DEATH), Mastorakis’s efforts are focused on the Greek island, which is the scene for various forms of slaughter, small bestiality and some mass distortion. <br /> <br /> Everything moves at a dull pace, and the violent scenery is badly aimed. <br /> <br /> Advertised as “A film that the censors did not want you to see,” I would venture to suggest that the censors never saw it, they just read the press kit before their knees jerked up.
