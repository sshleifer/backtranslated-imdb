The most terrible thing in the new horror film directed by Carter Smith “Ruins” is the closing credits, in which comedian Ben Stiller is listed as one of the executive producers. What did Stiller think about when he plunged his money into this chiller about the accursed carnivorous underbrush that sneaks up on its victims and devours them. Oscar-nominated screenwriter Scott B. Smith from The Simple Plan, adapting his own bestseller, unswervingly adheres to the standard cliches and conventions of all 20-year-old scary sagas, where reckless young people do everything but common signs that entreat the forces of evil to eat them, If in this nihilistic nonsense would not have been enough stupid characters, we are treated to another film where American tourists are threatened simply because they are Americans. In addition, unlike the really good horror films that explain why the monsters need to be fed, "Ruins" does not give an explanation for the supernatural machinations of their villainous vines. <br /> <br /> The Ruins structure resembles the horror film 2006 “Tourist”, where slimy South Americans catch brainless American tourists and collect them for their internal organs. Indeed, Turistas has generated some legitimate thrills and cold. “Ruins” generate nothing but thrill or chill. An evil mastiff, who suddenly rushes to the camera to growl at our heroes, is as close as possible to the thrill. <br /> <br /> The rest of “Ruins” is borrowed from another film: “Descent,” an excellent chiller of 2006 telling a bunch of babies immersed in a nightmarish experience when they are lost in caves inhabited by caves. albino mutants with bloodthirsty killing. Several other films that served either intentionally or unintentionally also come to mind. This is a simple 1968 Hammer horror classic “The Lost Continent” about deadly vegetation threatening innocent bystanders in a sea of ​​abandoned ships, and the Roger Corman cult class “Little Horror Shop” (1961) about a New York flower shop that grows a plant to eat people the store. <br /> <br /> “The Ruins” unfolds in picturesque sunny Mexico, where four American students from college frolic, Eric (Sean Ashmore from the movie “X-Men”), Stacy (Laura Ramsey from The Testament), Jeff (Jonathan Tuckers from Sleepers and Amy (Jena Malone from Pride and Prejudice) end their tequila-soaked spring break. Stacy loses her valuable earring in the motel pool, but Mathias (Joe Anderson from Beethoven Copy) restores her, and the group hugs him as a new best friend. These people live at a party, and they have already made friends with a trio of Greek tourists. Matthias tells them about his wayward brother, who accompanied the lovely female archaeologist to the distant Mayan pyramid, which is not in the guidebooks. He offers to take them with them, and they will. <br /> <br /> The first rule of horror films: if no one knows about the place where you are going, you would be advised to avoid it. Since they had only one day left, and they did not undertake any adventures, our two couples, together with their Spanish-speaking Greek friend Dimitri (novice Dmitry Baveas), decided to follow Matthias and check out the pyramid. They take a bus to the inside of Mexico and are looking for a taxi to take them the next step in their journey The taxi driver looks at the map and warns them to stay away. The second rule of horror films: when the natives warn you to stay away, you stay away. A fresh twenty-dollar bill helps him change his mind, he drags them to their destination, and then jumps off their seats in an instant. <br /> <br /> As soon as our heroes discovered a mysterious Maya pyramid covered with underbrush that suspiciously resembles a kind of Mississippi kudzu in the jungle, superstitious aborigines will appear. They know that the pyramid is being pursued, and they do not hesitate to kill Dmitry when he tries to dispel their fears. The rest of the main characters scramble to a safe place at the top of the pyramid, while paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping. In the end, the vines slip out to greet our heroes and eat them. At this moment, The Ruins are turning into the Beetle, Ashley Judd’s recent and ridiculous schizoid film about insects falling under your skin. Soon our heroes tear apart each other in the vain efforts to extract the vines from under their skin. One particularly horrible scene shows that Americans tear off the legs of a German guy to save his life. For comparison, this makes the tortures of the Spanish Inquisition look tame. <br /> <br /> “Ruins” is just another grape mess that has nothing to buy.
