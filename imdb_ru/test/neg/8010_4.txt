Many years ago, the feature film "MA2412" tried to become a kind of "regional blockbuster" in Austria. One thing is certain: I hope that no one outside will see this. Perhaps, if you are familiar with the original sitcom, it would be interesting to see what the director Zikherits filmed from his series. I think he missed his chance and wasted time and money. <br /> <br /> Until now, many directors and writers have failed to make the concept of the series compatible with the 90-minute film (for example, Alf, Inspector Gadget ...). You can see how difficult it is by looking at “MA 2412”. The result of this attempt, in my opinion, tastes like an endless television episode (and not very successful). He does not give the plot, humor tries too hard, and the direction seems very unfocused - as is true for the visual style. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I clearly would not recommend this ...
