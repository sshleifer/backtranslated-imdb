I usually do not classify movement as boring. I'm not a big movie buff, and my feelings don't need to be stimulated during a movie. In fact, I like a good rational logical dialogue and storyline. Unfortunately, this film does not have any of these characteristics. Diane Lane is the only saving grace in this film, and even her beauty cannot save her. Terrible imperious music equals retarded dialogue and acting skills. None of the actors is really connected with each other, and as a result, the film is not associated with the audience. I assume that the scenes where the townspeople are marching somewhere should have been added to the story, but it seems that they were inserted only to fill the space. Scenes seemed changeable and incoherent. There were some beautiful pictures of the ocean and the beach.
