Caution for the buyer. The alpha video release uses print that defies description. The film was shot in color, but you will not recognize it in the first 25 minutes or so. The imprint used is so faded and decrepit that it seems almost sepia. After 30 minutes, some color seeps back into the print, but from there to the conclusion the color comes and goes. Keep in mind that even at best, the color is pale and blurred. It seems that the print was recorded from a television that did not receive better reception. Adding to this parody is the most difficult supply of lines I can remember. Even the voice behind the narrative gives rise to a stupor. Each line is delivered in this annoying wacky behavior. I found that I wanted them to hurry and endure the words. For this reason, I could not wait for the end of this film. This is one of those bad, good films, but I would like someone to find a half decent print.
