The main premise for this film is every woman's fantasy: the vagina that kills and eats men. Well, at least, this is a fantasy for every woman who has ever fought with a man. What is it, 99.9999% of women? But do not worry, this is not a terrible food for men. It is more like a ridiculous impregnation of them, like a drain plug. There is no blood or parts left. So for fans of blood, courage and blood, forget about this film, there is not much blood here. <br /> <br /> The two main characters of the film are somewhat unrealistic. Elena is a good girl who becomes a prostitute. Meanwhile, Dennis is a good guy who is chasing Helen. <br /> <br /> At the moment, the story is already a bit stupid, but then they add two more equally stupid subtests that simply send this film to a bad story. B-film territory. The first new subtext about Dennis, who found a new love with a pair of Siamese twins; and then, in the end, he killed one of them and became a fugitive bank robber. The second new subtext tells how Elena found a new love with a sweet policeman who saved her from a bad date related to prostitution and decided that she wanted to marry her. Dennis and Helen eventually meet again at the end of the film in absolutely unbelievable circumstances, and in a magical way, Helen's killer vagina heals!
