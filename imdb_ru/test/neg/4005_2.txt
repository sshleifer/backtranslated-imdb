I think this film had really bad production value. The lack of action makes me think that they should mark this as early documentation. Perhaps he had no money to make it. I feel bad because Jackie Robinson was driving to the big leagues in the big leagues. <br /> <br /> I believe that he was much better than many white players of his time. He had to be really great to break the color line of the time. Not enough, that is a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that there was no more information about its creators. Perhaps they were limited by the quality of the actors who were willing to take on the project. Maybe there is no money to get good people.
