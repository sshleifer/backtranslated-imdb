ATTENTION: I advise everyone who has not yet seen the film not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> If you plan to watch this movie, DO NOT DO IT! I warn you ... this film is terribly boring and mostly horrible, and not in the form of a horror movie. I accepted this film “Piranha” for another film “Piranha”, and when I noticed that I had made a mistake, I still decided to watch this movie. I wish I had not. This film is so terrible and intolerable in every material that I could not allow someone to say that this film was half decent. First, this film should be called “Boring Conversation about Wildlife”, and not “Piranha”. They only show piranhas ONCE! At the same time, due to the fact that this film sounds so bad, I fell asleep only after 20 minutes. In the end, my mouth was wide open, and I looked gloomily at the empty TV screen. This is a VERY badly directed and poorly shot piece of garbage, which I was afraid that I had brain dysfunction after seeing ...
