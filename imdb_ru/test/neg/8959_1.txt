I got this movie as a purchase, get one deal on troma.com with The Ruining (which is not much better). The main reason I wanted was to watch “Star Worms II: Attack of Pleasure Pods”, a DVD is a double feature of this film. I really didn’t know what Actium Maximus was at the time, and when I saw the trailer, I got scared. It looked awful. But what can you say from the trailer? Well, apparently, I could say a lot. This film, to be honest, had no meaning for me. The special effects were so terrible that you cannot say what is happening in the name of God. I understand that Mark Hicks had an extremely low budget, but come on. And it's sad because in the interview it sounded like it was an epic film and meant more than you could see. But, unfortunately, watching a movie is one of the most boring hours and 15 minutes in the life of any person. It is so painful to sit. I really can't even explain the plot to you, because I didn’t understand it at all, and, unfortunately, I saw this film two times! Obviously, they used some type of puppets for “alien dinosaurs”, as in “Star Wars”. But these special effects are terrible, I can not emphasize this. And in most cases, bad special effects are normal, but this film really needed them. It happens on some futuristic planet, where alien dinosaurs are fighting each other, and bad actors are running around in hooded sweatshirts, and they look like they are in KKK. And some kind of box with blue light on it - the president. I know that in an interview Mark Hicks said something about making it a television pilot, well, I understand why it did not reach CBS or NBC. There are two good things in this movie. 1. The music is actually quite good, it has an epic score that gets stuck in your head for a few days. And 2. Lloyd Kaufman’s performance is funny as always. In general, do not waste your time, but look at Star Worms II: Attack of Pleasure Pods!
