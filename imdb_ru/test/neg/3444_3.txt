this show bothers me. he takes up slots on Nick, which can be reserved for the new prince or George Lopez. even full house and rozanna. they are better than home improvement. First of all, Jill's mother is so annoying to me. she is a hypersensitive whiny child, and I really despise her. Brad is a fat toad, and he is also annoying. and little brother, I don't even know his name! I don't notice him at all! this is probably not the fault of the actor, although it is probably the writers. Tim is just a dumb ass. although Jill is definitely my least favorite, I donâ€™t like any of them. The only reason I gave this stupid show three stars is because one star goes to Randy. as an average child, he is still an annoying little brother, but an older brother, and I like his funny character. another star goes to al. as a plump friend, his character is pleasant. Except Randy and Al, this show sucks.
