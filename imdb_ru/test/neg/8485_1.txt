I can not believe this! I thought it was a good sequel when Jim Carrey had a kid in the film, but instead it was a film with crap actors, a silly plot and silly scenes. This should be in the “shitiest shit movies in the ground”. Thank God, the same director didn’t do this, because it’s so stupid with some cartoony details, as fart is not funny, neither urine nor dancing! I laughed at it because of how stupid a man did it, like Homer Simpson making a movie about donut! I wish someone made a remake of the son of a mask with a plot like this! The masked guy (Jim Carrey) and his wife have a son who is a normal child. When a child finds another mask, he also becomes a mask, and the masked guy tries to regain his mask! This is very crap, so I’ll give him 1 out of 10. Fu * king sh * t!
