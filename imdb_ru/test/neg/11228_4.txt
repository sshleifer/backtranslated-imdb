“Crime of Passion” is a film that disappoints in most cases. Where do I begin? Plot? This is desperately oversimplified and full of gaps. Direction? Reminds cheap B-film. Actions? John Laughlin is absolutely terrible in his role as Bobby's “Frozen Wife's Friendly Husband,” Annie Potts is unconvincing as Amy's “Frozen Wife”, and this is only Kathleen Turner (above average), and Anthony Perkins (excellent), who gets a decent acting score. More precisely, Anthony Perkins plays the role of Rev. Rev. Peter Shane, while Turner manages to portray the roles of sexy China Blue and frail Joanna Crane. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, only Turner and Perkins’s speeches are not enough to help the film get a rating above 4/10. Watch it if you want to see Turner in some sensational scenes (although even by this indicator a film can easily compare with its competitor - “Basic Instinct”, for example), otherwise avoid.
