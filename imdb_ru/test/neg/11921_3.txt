He began to watch it, but did not believe any of the characters. In particular, the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress simply did not work for me at all. The scenes between the bakery owner and the assistant were good, but the rest was very slow. It was a very superficial film, and it gave me the feeling that I was watching a play, not a film. The characters were very “stage”, and the storyline was very similar to the stage farce. By the time the pyromaniac stuck to the assistant, I was bored, and I didn’t care what happened next, and I disconnected. Glad I didn't pay to see this. I did not laugh and did not even smile once. It seems that Americans have a strange tendency to classify their films as “comedies” when they are funny, not funny, haha. I finally learned to avoid what Americans call dark comedies, which usually turn out to be terrible, strange and unfunny. Now it seems I will have to be more insightful when they call the film a romantic comedy. Maybe comedy means something different when it comes to the film, and not about the series in America. I don’t understand why America can produce amazingly funny comedies, such as Two and a Half Men, Will and Grace, King of Queens, but I don’t seem to be able to make really funny movies without using toilet humor. This film was not rude or anything else. But it was not at all one big yawn ...
