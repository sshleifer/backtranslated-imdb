This show is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, of course, it is a fake. But painful to watch. I personally know that a more creative film influenced minds that could “make” it real. A young lead man cannot be more unconvincing. He reads everything he says. Do we really believe that he knows what he is talking about? There are many ways for Blair the Witch to be on this show. Fear does not produce what seems "cool" and generated by the computer. Nor does it produce such notorious lines as “What was it? Have you heard this? ”In addition, there are real compelling psychics who do not just“ want to be on the screen. ” Another DUH factor is ... how these producers think that we are actually going to buy this paranormal activity, just magically happen within 2, maybe 3 days (if we are lucky), which they take off. I do not think so. Week 2+ on one site would be more convincing. Also disarming what they think, including NASA's “radar checks” and computers that show bizarre jokes really scare us. And IE: Exorcism should not be delivered as an “Exorcist. When are they going to do it right? Possession of the devil or other evil spirits affects people in different ways. They don't just growl and lower their voices, like Linda Blair, or fall around, like Courtney Love, during drug addiction. As stated, the best concentration on “extrasensory abilities” will greatly help this show. We want to see and hear EVERYTHING that presumably flashes before them. No business card to another story bs. And the last remark: “Falling stars” do not arouse interest when you previously showed fake UFO pictures. I can once again emphasize that the young dark-haired man who hosts this show is absolutely terrible. Avoid this show. For fear: see old episodes of Unsolved Mystery ... and not new ones (in the re-creation everything turned out wrong). But this is for another blog.
