I watched 5% of this film tonight, and you can tell me that I need to watch the whole movie in order to understand it, but to be honest, I don’t think so. <br /> <br /> What the hell is this story in this movie? I saw a lot of people running around in a factory and shooting around. <br /> <br /> How to start? Well .. <br /> <br /> 1) They shot at the whole place, as if it were a Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The whole place is made of metal, but not a single bullet lit on metal surfaces. <br /> <br /> 2) No rebound. Metal versus metal will surely cause a rebound, but obviously no one will suffer from a stray bullet. <br /> <br /> 3) Magic bullets? In one scene, a bad guy is standing right in front of a good guy when another good guy appears behind the bad guy and shakes him full of metal. You see the bullets coming out of his chest when she explodes in a bloody mist, but the good guy in front of him does not suffer at all! 4) After a man sprays a wall all over his body, two good guys tell each other a few jokes, and they laugh and look like teenagers playing with soft weapons. <br /> <br /> 5) Sound? At some point, the good guys cut the wire, and the alarm went off (who the hell cut the wire to turn off the alarm?). The lady shouts “Anxiety in the blah-blah sector”, and the bad guy's boss says: “Okay ... this ... this ... not ... not ... training ... bla-bla" is very, very amateur method. Oh, we were ambushed by terrorists, this is not training, but I will sound like it’s not in vain. <br /> <br /> 6) Focus !! At first you see that the bad guys are loaded with weapons. the reason is that the same guy gets the same ultrasound twice. Deja vu or loop scenes? You literally see that every bad guy gets the same weapon, and they are blocked and charged the same way. the weapon jumps out in the clip, and the bad guy is superfluous. XX locks and weights. When they began to open fire, you MUST see flashes of the trunk. Boooring !! 7) Actors or teapots? One of the supposed good guys for some reason throws a smoke grenade, and, of course, the bad guys suddenly find themselves inside the smoke, because they don’t smoke or something like that, so they don’t see it happen.They cough and moan as if it were anthrax in a pomegranate. Then the semi-boss of the bad guy arrives, and he doesn’t even cough when he enters the smoke, he simply pushes away the other bad guys, and they suddenly realize that the smoke is still not anthrax. <br /> <br /> 8) In flick? I think yes! A guy sliding down a metal pipe with an ultrasound scan in his right hand, obviously shooting at someone at the height of his eyes. I would like a guy to shoot an ultrasound with one hand, and I would like him to take his hand later. An extremely bloody mess of bloody blood in some way. Small * pops * and a red hole with a torn shirt indicate that this guy is dead. Although the first bullet hit his heart, a good guy who is a super trained green beret is still tempted to empty his clip into a dead guy. <br /> <br /> 9) One of the mentioned trained soldiers jumped out of his hide with an empty clip! How stupid can you be? Always check your clip before encountering an unknown number of enemies! 10) Boring scenes. Similar to flash scenes in barrels and scenes with lock and loading, the film is full of scenes with a loss of time when people run in a clearly empty building. Go to action if you are going to make a movie B, please. <br /> <br /> My two cents for this movie.
