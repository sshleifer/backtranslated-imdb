I first heard about this movie on Flashback Weekend in Chicago 2007 for Nightmare on Elm Street. Robert Englund was really talking about the film, and he was great in his role in “Hatchet”. The same can be said about Tony Todd. Knowing that this is the first budgetary director / screenwriter with a low budget, he provides as much as a large budget, as well as a reworked / rethought film “Holloween” (2007). <br /> <br /> Technically, this is not justified. couple of places The alligator attack seen was too dark. When this happened, the dark head of the alligator on the background of the swamp, clinging to the black pants, became almost invisible. The mood music in the swamp scenes was too loud and tinned, like a bad comedy series. And just like Halloween (2007), someone is smart enough to have a gun, but, of course, shooting a killer is just a pause button for a killer. The end, well, as soon as I saw where he was going, I understood what was going to happen, not very original. <br /> <br /> Highlights of the film are characters and their interaction. Unlike Holloween (2007), we meet people and care about what happened to them. Ben (Joel Moore, who is also the leader of "Spirals"), as well as Marcus ("Not another film for teenagers") as the best friend and funny person for whom they support during the film. Shapiro (Joel Murray "Dharma and Greg"), Jenna (Jolie Fioreavanti) and Misty (Mercedes McNab from the films "Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Series", "Angel: The Series" and "The Addams Family") give a tangled reason for topless women. Mr. and Mrs. Permatteo are playing regular television players (Richard Reale, “Established for Life”, Patrick Darbo, “Step by Step”), since the older couple you know have no chance, even the guide Sean (Parry Shen) is a particular character. I hope to see more from everyone who participates in this film, but I think that he will play better on his home video than in the theater, sorry.
