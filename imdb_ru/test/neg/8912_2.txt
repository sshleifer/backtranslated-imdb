Ah, another Seagal movie. Not later than a few months to fill the shelves of video stores. How bad, how in the underwater ocean? Not. But this does not mean much. Like perfume on a pig. <br /> <br /> Seagal is a professional thief who wants to quit, but goes to his last job, only to be crossed by his boss twice. He goes to prison, and he is assisted by a gangster who helps him break free and get reckoning. <br /> <It's nice to see that Seagal is finally not playing an agent, a policeman, or what he usually plays. Looks like we really get the USA in Las Vegas. Then the Eastern European territory as usual. There is also no wire fu here. Don Fountleroy copes with his work. <br /> <br /> However, most of the fighting scenes with Stevie are clearly double. Scenes from other films, lack of realism and logic in even the tiniest situation. Seagal and Trich do so-so team, inspiring (unintentionally) laughing one minute. Sighs the rest. <br /> <br /> Several famous people end up in slums. from his extraordinary days. Nick Mancuso appears in sleepwalking mode to take a check. No more rappers. You are welcome? At this point, battle scenes and scenes are more predictable and, as a rule, are regenerated more often than ever. This is an obsolete scene from which Seagal must come out or hang her. He should have come out a while ago.
