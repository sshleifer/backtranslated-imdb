The main plot is good and can be interesting. The music is so great that it became the theme of the music for the IRON CHEF series (although in the film it is too abusive and too intrusive). So, how did this movie turn out to be so poor?!?! Well, the plot was about 95% predictable, and the characters were as one-dimensional as possible. And the dialogue ?! What kind of person will actually allow himself to get a loan for having invented stupid macho nonsense that implies dialogue? You get much more realism from most cartoons! The bottom line is that this film has some good moments, but it is so overshadowed by beaten cliches and rotten dialogue that it quickly becomes tedious. And it's a shame, because firefighters deserve better tribute than this mess! If you don't believe me, look at the number of the stupid things listed on the IMDb for this movie - WAY beyond what you expect to find. They just did not care to solve all the problems and problems. Thus, as a result, the film seems hurried and needs rewriting and re-editing.
