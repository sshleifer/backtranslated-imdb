I can't believe how stupid this movie really is. The storyline (written by Keira Knightley's mother) is what destroys the film to the extreme. it's plainly boring, absurd, and absolutely pointless ... <br /> <br /> This film lags so much for most of it, especially at the beginning. the story just went on and on about their daily flirting with each other, often at times like a threesome. In this film, you have an annoying couple of the dead (the poet and his wife) who are completely drunk from the very beginning. the wife sleeps with other men to make ends meet, while the poet is a pervert who thrives on cheap boobies and women. a wife who too quickly became friends with her former childhood lover (played by Keira) suddenly becomes jealous, knowing full well that both of them were lovers since childhood. something is wrong here .... i mean, come on ... take the lady program with you! what do you expect. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that the former lovers meet again with the new wife hugging her, then envy, then the former lover gets married, and her husband envies, bombards the house of a crazy drunk couple, the crazy husband calls the police, and they ultimately go to court for attempted murder. that's all that is briefly stated ... <br /> <br /> In this film there were moments like quality and good play by Killian Murphy, but other than that, I can't believe I watched it ... I complained about this during the film and some family members watching this with me fell asleep. I decided to give him a chance, and I had to stick to my first instincts.
