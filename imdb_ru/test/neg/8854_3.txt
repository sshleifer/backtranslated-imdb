This film is about the gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead. There is a lot of talk on the Internet (for example, if you install a program on a computer, you will see dead people - very much like if you play a video tape, you will die in RINGU). To be honest, most of this seemed rather stupid to me and lost me. What really seemed interesting to me was the idea that the dead live in their own separate existence - being completely alone forever. It was sobering and fascinating. <br /> <br /> I love Japanese movies and have seen a huge amount compared to most Americans. However, one genre that has become popular in recent years, to which I simply cannot relate very well, is horror movies. I know that they are very popular, especially because they are often reworked in the States. I saw both RINGU and THE RING, JU-ON and GRUDGE and was quite ambivalent, despite their popularity. The only recent horror film that I really liked in Japan was “SEANCE” - an adaptation of the great British film “SEANCE ON A WET AFNERON”. And what I think made SEANCE different? Well, unlike other films, as well as KAIRO, a lot of money was not spent on special effects or attempts to frighten the public - instead, the emphasis was placed on the plot. The bottom line is that these other films are very similar to American films, such as HALLOWEEN or Friday 13th - with scary things jumping out just to scare the public, and the plot is just secondary (at best). For me, I want a story - not cheap thrills or ghosts as the main focus of the film. <br /> <br /> With a relatively high rating, I know I'm outnumbered, but I just don’t find this a very nice movie. Too often minor things happen that may surprise someone a little - but the characters start screaming, crying and acting, as if saying: "This is the scariest movie ever made, so you'd better start shaking." Well, I think that he is just trying too hard, and I would like him to focus more on the afterlife seen at the end of the film, and on the plot, and not on scare tactics.
