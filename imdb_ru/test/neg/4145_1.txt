The incredible starts in Los Angeles when Jim (Roger Klein) and his wife Alice Fellaps (Tamera Knoll) swear when they ride in the pouring rain, unfortunately Jim crashes into the car, and his daughter Heather (Lee Silver) is dead, while Alice turns in a wheelchair of vegetables. Devastated by the death of his daughter, Jim begins to visit prostitutes, then he kills them because of the voices in his head. Hmm, that's all. <br /> <br /> Written, directed and directed by Chad Ferrin. I hate Unspeakable as a movie. There are some films that you see from time to time, which move “gate posts”, as was the case with everything that you watch after that, some films are so great that everyone else will judge them, while others, as for example, "Indescribable" is so bad that they set a new cinematic minimum. It's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I'm seriously surprised by the positive comments on IMDb, although I'm not surprised by the low overall rating on the main page, I'm not sure that I missed something, but for starters, Unspeakable doesn’t plot, no plot and much seems almost random. In Unspeakable, there was nothing to keep my interest or entertain, and as a result it became a test of endurance to get to the end. The film is trying to be shocked by some tasteless scenes of sexual abuse of the cursed boy by the priest, there is a scene in which the disabled person beats on her own, she falls to the floor, and her dodgy nurse begins to feel her dirty genitals, legs and underwear. If someone can find such crap interesting, then I will just cut my wrists, the character is one of the worst I've ever had the misfortune to know, the dialogue is terribly bad, with some it sounds like it came straight from a dirty fagot porn worst. It doesn’t work like horror, because it’s not scary in the least, it’s absolutely fun and frankly insulting to say that he is trying to be a serious drama about someone who suffers big losses and tries to cope with it, and in general, I just think This is a meaningless, trash, poorly made piece of crap from Troma. <br /> <br /> Directed by Ferrin making a film like some poorly made documentary, special effects are terrible and remind “let's get tomato ketchup on our actor’s face” The audience will be convinced that they died a bloodthirsty death, there is no graphic violence except for suicide when someone puts a knife in his mouth. Given the number of prostitutes in Unspeakable, the nudity level is kept at an absolute minimum ... <br /> <br /> Obviously, Unspeakable had a budget of about $ 20,000, and all I can say is, where did all the money go? Oh, a quick note for the directors: if you are going to record sound live, make sure that your actor has no roles near the main road, on which half of Los Angeles seems to be moving ... Playing the actors is a shit, period. <br /> <br /> Incredibly, in my opinion, complete nonsense. This is probably not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's right there, and I don’t remember seeing such a terrible movie recently. One to avoid if you are a masochist or insomnia.
