I thought this movie was fine. I don't think he was great. He was too slow for my taste. A lot of drama, but not a lot of action until the very end of the film. This film was mostly dramatic. A film that paid off, not so close to the end, so to speak. For me, the scenes of breaking through the dam and flooding the city were normal, but too short. The film itself is well made, the acting is decent, but it just didnâ€™t do it for me, after all. I think this was due to the fact that during the entire film there was very little voltage or tension. at least I think so. Another factor is that I recently watched "10 .5" and its sequel, "10 .5: Apocalypse." These are two large budget "events", which, in my opinion, are very difficult to understand, in terms of special effects and scenes of destruction. As a result, I have to evaluate the Killer Flood: Day, Damn it, at 4/10
