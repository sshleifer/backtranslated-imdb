A silly horror movie about five 20 someone (3 guys, 2 girls) going to this place in the wilderness. What they do not know is Dr. Chopper and his assistants, who attack and kill anyone who risks in their forest. They use their body parts for some experiments ... or something else. In addition, five college girls and two lesbians are thrown to be killed and show some cleavage. <br /> <br /> Pretty desperate. The story is confusing and boring; the blood is ridiculously false; Dr. Chopper and his assistants terribly beat; there is some awful black “humor” here, and people just stand there while their friends attack them, or just stand there and let people kill them. <br /> <br /> It was rather insulting. There are several advantages. The turn in an hour was pretty good, and the five young actors are really good! Chase Hoyt is great as Reese; Butch Hansen is fine, like Jimmy; Ashley McCarthy is also good as Tamara, and Robert Adamson has his moments as Nicholas. Best of all, Chesley Crisp as Jessica - she was excellent! Some of the dramatic scenes between these five were well played and interesting. Unfortunately, the dialogue was not for them. I give him 4 points for their performances, but here it is no longer worth mentioning. I hope these actors will get decent roles.
