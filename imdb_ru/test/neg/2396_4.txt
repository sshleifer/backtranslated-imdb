“Love and human remains” is one of those clearly scripted, obviously played, clearly staged films that are so obvious that the speed of escape from his tricks and fictions is beyond my comprehension. It is not necessary to explain that this amateur click tries to squeeze every clever line, every misanthropic overtone, every peculiar sexual addiction in one film with no care to make the play suitable. In short, sensational shit without sensation ... which pretty much just leaves shit.
