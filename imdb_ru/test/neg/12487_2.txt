The remake can be successful. Adaptation can be successful. It doesn't matter if it is a remake or an adaptation. <br /> <br /> A good movie is a good movie, and a bad movie is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Sarkar, I fear, was a very bad movie. First of all, just making the characters look dangerous, or macho, they do not bring an aura into them. <br /> <br /> What was so brilliant in Nagra (the character of Amitabh Bachchan) that we had to be in the aura of his “strength” and what showed the “goodwill” of the character? Nothing. <br /> <br /> A commentator told about this fact, and Amitabh continued to give facial expressions. Amitabh can now give brilliant facial expressions, but why should that mean something, if there is no story or history to go with it. <br /> <br /> There was no proper description of the characters who worked under the 'sarkar' too, Just because the person had glasses, why we should assume that he is wise. ] The flow of the film was generally boring because scenes from The Godfather were created (for example, the policeman who hit Abhishek Bachchan), the elder brother was killed by Abhishek (as Fredo was killed by Pacino’s orders) he could pack a film with too little history and depth to go with it. It really was a problem. <br /> <br /> If you try to collect 3 hours of complex parts, such as the Godfather, in 2 hours, and this, too, with a small amount of dialogue, you will get a vivid show from a cricket match, never make the full effect by watching for the full match.
