I can't find any value for this movie. It seems that it is based on the philosophical school of the Lion King. The father is killed, the son cannot fill the shoes and tries to run away, etc., etc. And so on. D. The only difference (except being in the barn yard instead of the jungle) is that the barn yard is trying to “revive” club music They try to be cool, trying to be cool. The problem is that this is really not cool. It's like that guy. Everyone knows at least one of those guys who are older and still hang out with young people in a vain attempt to cling to their youth. They try to be cool to fit, but in reality it is not. Here is this movie. <br /> <br /> But if you have the money to burn, and you feel that you are paying someone to take 90 minutes of life away from you, by all means, don't let me stop you .
