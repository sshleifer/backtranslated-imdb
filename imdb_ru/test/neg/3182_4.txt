I rented this film because I like to watch things with Lauren Graham in them. Well, she was the highlight. All the others seemed completely separated from the picture. You kept looking around at those who watched the movie with you, what? However, she provided some clarity, as she was the only normal character in the picture, which in fact says little about the film. Personally, it was too far for me. Nevertheless, I am glad that I rented it, despite the fact that I would never want to own it. I still feel that Lauren Graham was a strong actress and even thought that she was not the main character, she seemed to have stolen the film. My husband and I were happier and more concerned about her character ending up as a character of Josh than about the two main characters.
