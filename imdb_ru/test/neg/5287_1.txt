The game was very bad, you had Kostas Mandalar, acting like a stupid brother Forester Triple X, similar to Scott McMahon as his deputy, which I believe you should take care of, but nowhere is there any emotional involvement. You have Stupid lesbians. It's not that I deal with lesbians, I'm not just stupid, who run around in a punitive shirt and in a grunge-style hat, who constantly ask if anyone has seen her dead lover. <br /> <br /> A villain can be scary, and somewhere there is a story about morality about trying to fight with age and death, but in this film it is lost. Kostas Hearst Helmsley points out that they will soon become victims on their way back to the city, while, obviously, there are city lights behind it. <br /> <br /> Ed Gein also mistakenly said it, but he pronounced it like Jin. As a citizen of Wisconsin. We had a share of Monsters Gein, Dahmer and McCarthy, but if you are going to use it, say it correctly. <br /> <br /> God, why I watch all these horrible movies. Oh, yes, I crave punishment and watch over it so that you donâ€™t have to.
