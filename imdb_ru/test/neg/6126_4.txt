The beginning of the film is promising. When Jeanne Pollet (Anna Muglalis) heard a story about an incident that happened on her birthday, which increases the likelihood that she is the daughter of the famous pianist Andre Polonsky (Jacques Dutron), she decided to find out if this is true or not, and considering the fact that she also plays the piano is not such a remote idea. Jeanne meets Andre and his wife "Mika" Muller (Isabel Huppert) and their son and on the way reveals the fact that there are some secrets in her family, the same in her own. <br /> <br /> OK we saw it before, and it was done in a more interesting way than here. The nature of "Mika" Muller was left without us, who understands her motives for her actions, and she is not interesting enough to take care of her. The piano scenes look fake, and the entire plot of the piano does not add anything to the characterâ€™s understanding, but serves to make the film longer than it should have been in the first place. <br /> <br /> In short, a very disappointing way out of Chabrol, which can do better than this
