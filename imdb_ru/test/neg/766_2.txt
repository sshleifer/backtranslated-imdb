Tom and Jerry are flying goods to Africa. But, being white people, they are concerned that they will not be safe, so they put on a black face to match. As soon as they put it on, they accept the black dialect and completely inhabit their new characters. They crash into the ocean and use the plane's wing as a raft. Before they reach the ground, they suffer from an overly tender octopus and more serious danger from sharks, swordfish and whales. Once on the ground, they are frightened by fantastic creatures and hide in a cave. The inside is even worse when they encounter live skeletons in a black face. And after leaving the cave, things become even worse than when cannibals discover them. <br /> <br /> "Plane Dumb" is a particularly casual effort by Van Beuren. One example: a lion, unknown to Tom and Jerry, enters a cave earlier than they. But the animators must have forgotten about this, because the lion never appears again. Another example is the final, which is not the end: it’s just an arbitrary stop. <br /> <br /> According to the poster on YouTube, the cartoon “was originally intended to show the voices and caricatures of the popular comedy team“ Negro ”. known as Miller & Lyles. But Aubrey Lyles died of tuberculosis before the recording was completed, and co-directors John Foster and George Rufle were forced to rework the animation in the story "Tom and Jerry". <br /> <br /> They should not have worried. Rough animation and poorly executed jokes make the film a loser from start to finish.
