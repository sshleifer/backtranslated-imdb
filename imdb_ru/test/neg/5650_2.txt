Well, I got and watched this movie based on a rather high score here (now 7.1) and some good reviews. IMDb is usually a good guide when it comes to evaluation, although in this case I was very deceived. <br /> <br /> The film is a modern detective story, Vinnie Jones is an investigative journalist who is investigating. death of the builder. Associated with this is the fictional novel by Dickens (“The Mystery”, which takes place in the 18th or 19th century), which also tells about the murder. Both subject lines are connected with the discovery of an unpublished manuscript. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting? It could have been, however this film is terribly failing in a number of areas: 1) Acting. Mediocre at best, but it is watchable. No worse than your regular British sitcom, although there is a little better for the film. Especially with a score of more than 7. 2) Music. The music used is terrible, distracting and annoying. Especially the music in the pub and the music that plays in the apartment of the journalist. 3) Storyline. This is a big joke. Everywhere there are gaping holes in the plot, and even the obligatory love story is so unreal that it is almost ridiculous. In addition, without going into details, I can say with confidence that the finale is absurd and is one of the worst works and storyline of the year. 4) camera work. At times, the camera's position and gaze distract, and they are absolutely useless for the “story” <br /> <br /> I’m a bit of a movie fan and watch an average of 1-2 films a day, but this is easily the worst film I've seen in a few months. Do not waste your money or your time on this garbage.
