I really wanted this movie to be liked, but the move was too slow. <br /> <br /> It was a good story, but actually it was like watching a slug race. <br /> <br /> The film would have been better served if it had more action. I don't mean anything grand, but at least something in the background. <br /> <br /> This would also help songs that set the tone / mood for longer periods in which there was no dialogue. <br /> It has been about 10 years since I saw him, so I might have to give him one more chance. <br /> <br /> 3/10 or * 1/2 (out of four)
