After the death of an astronaut in space, he is returned to a military base. Alien embryos are found inside a person - he is the master of what could be a terrible alien invasion! This film comes to us from director Bernard L. Kowalski, who also directed Giant Leech Attacks (see Separate Review), but may be more famous for his work on Colombo. The executive producer was Roger Korman, known as the creator of much better films than this one ... especially in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> This film is crappy and poorly designed. The interesting thing is that these are bad effects, not the movie itself. One scene shows a close-up of alien embryos, and this is an embarrassing cartoon image. Even in 1958. And then, when an adult alien appears ... you wonder why he wears shoes. Or, if you're really insightful, you wonder why you saw an alien costume in other films. <br /> <br /> By no means will you see this worst science fiction film. And you almost have to give him credit - the alien master, catching up with the idea of ​​a military base, is preceded by “Things” and “Alien” by several years. I do not know whether these films were inspired in any way (I doubt it), but at least it was ahead of its time. In addition, the film falls through and is great only for drinking. I have not seen the version of the Mystical Theater of Science, but this film is worthy of their insults.
