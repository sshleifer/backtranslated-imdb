I am glad that I did not pay to see the “Little Worm Boy”. <br /> <br /> I sat there, hoping that something original and / or funny would happen. <br /> <br /> This reminded me very much like these predictable English comedies of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> I won’t worry about the brief overview of the plot, I suggest you do something else for 90 minutes <br /> <br />
