According to Lucien Rebate in his Historical Music (Robert Lafont, BOUQUINS 1973 page 338), Beethoven's character was not very compatible with women. He had many “Platonic passions” with women members of the “Viennese aristocracy”, to whom he dedicated several “sonatas”. But musicians, even composers, did not claim the husbands of the “Beautiful Ladies." Haydn was the "servant" of Prince von Esterhazy, Mozart died of drunkenness or poison, and Beethoven, according to Rebatet, was a frequent client of "street prostitutes" in Vienna. The British biographer Newman says that Beethoven contracted syphilis before he turned 40 years old. That he became deaf because of this is possible, but not sure. <br /> <br /> The premiere of the Ninth Symphony was held on May 7, 1824. The Vienna City Theater, along with the Sanctification of the House of Overture and the first three parts of the Missa Solemnis. This was the composer’s first performance in twelve years; the hall was crowded. Although the performance was staged by Mikhail Umlauf, the theater bandmaster, Beethoven quietly shared a stage with him. <br /> <br /> So what's left of this "Female Fantasy". Ed Harris’s interpretation and characterization is pretty good, but too linear, based on a painting by Fernand Waldmüller dating back to 1823. She is in front of me. This shows a person who despises (perhaps hates) the World. For good reason.
