With Knightley and O'Toole as presenters, this film had good opportunities, and with McCallum as the bad guy after Knightley, perhaps some tension. But they threw all this on a silly evening frill, and then with the remnants of the war Maudlin. It was, of course, completely superficial, beautiful English country and the coast or not. The number one mistake was that Knightley starred so early in the film when she could easily play someone a couple of years older, instead of choosing someone ten years older. play the role. They missed all the chances of a big conflict among the actors and instead stupidly used simple and inexpensive heart elements.
