When I talked about these events that happened a few years ago (it’s hard to believe that this really happened), I thought: well, there is a reason for an interesting story here. Many secrets were never revealed, the horse was never found, the main conspirators were never captured, and so on. <br /> <br /> However, this film seems to be diverted to the study of characters and very little attention is paid to the plot . However, some other questions arise, for example, why would Mickey Rourke be in this movie? It's nice to see Rurx’s career soar again, but he should cringe at the mention of this garbage. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in a topic, do a search on this topic on the Internet, you will be more educated and, I dare say, have more fun. Avoid this.
