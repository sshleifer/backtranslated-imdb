I had never been interested in films about cannibal before I avoided this movie genre a couple of months ago. <br /> <br /> I recently had to undergo knee surgery, and I found that I had a lot of time My hands, because I was not able to work, so I decided to see almost all the horror films that our local the video shop could offer, I would venture to that. <br /> <br /> Christ was a mistake! I have never seen such a bad movie in all the years when I was a drug addict. This is just a bunch of s ** t, put on a DVD and sold as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of respect for other horror fans who can turn off their brains long enough to enjoy this shit, they have more brains than I ever have, and this is some kind of achievement! 0/10 and this is generous.
