I watched this film in Blockbuster and thought that this could be a good Sunday night, when there is nothing more to do. So I bought it used, 3 DVDs for $ 25. Although it was cheap, it would be better to spend my money on a nail in order to drive through my leg. <br /> <br /> The film started off well. It seems Dark and mysterious. I have always been delighted with the films about vampires and samurai in childhood. I thought the combo would be really cool. The first battle scene was pretty cool. I was excited for the rest of the film. Then the film seriously sank into the nose. <br /> <br /> I understand that this was a great success in the east. I think because of the twins. I do not see it yet. This film, except for the first 10 minutes, was absolutely terrible. A lot of films in this genre have the potential to be great and blow it up terribly. This is just another victim. <br /> <br /> Jackie Chanâ€™s role in this film makes no sense. Whyyyyyyyy? Complete nonsense. Although he probably earned a few dollars. <br /> <br /> The only cool thing about this movie is the swords they use. A good idea. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
