This film was missing in many areas. We are talking about this guy like Elvis, who drives cars, and these bikers from SATANS ANGELS are approaching them. One of them is called Banjo, and they beat up college kids for fun. They want the Elvis guy to be their driver. At times, I wanted people from MSTK3000 to be quiet, because the film was really good. Of course, there was violence and a lot of silly phrases like â€œWhat kind of beer do you want? Cold. That was stupid. The dude who plays banjo is a great boxer and I was glad to see him act in several battle scenes. In addition, a biker named FATS had a Nazi swastika jacket !!! It was pretty brave if I should say so.
