I have to ask myself, do such films get the support of people associated with the film itself, who come here and criticize it? How can something so terrible score so high? When we were children, my parents went to watch a lot of films on more adult subjects, including the letter R, until we became old enough. I remember only two films in which they said "yes"! when they returned home. This and “Catch-22.” <br /> <br /> Awkward doctors and staff in a dirty hospital take part in the film, rambling stories and a group of people living inside the city (which look like a refusal from the 1970s) Norman Lear, sitcom) arranges a protest. The worst part is the "murder mystery", the crazy old man doing the "work of God", killing doctors and others. When he confesses, Scott and his girlfriend show little emotion. They only care that he gets out of the place where he will be "safe and happy." The doctor who falls dead from a heart attack pretends to be a man so that he can escape. Oh dear, what a funny movie. <br /> <br /> This film didn’t “make me think,” didn’t laugh, and didn’t evoke any other feeling except “It should be better,” but it never happens. People wonder why it was a failure, no wonder there. It is interesting how there are enough participants in IMDb who consider this film a good one. YECH.
