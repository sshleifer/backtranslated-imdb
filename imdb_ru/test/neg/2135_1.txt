Never before have there been so many ugly people gathered together to make the same ugly movie. <br /> <br /> In the waters off the coast of Florida, there is something huge and terrifying that leaves behind half-chewed bodies. his trace Unshaven beer addicted Bob thinks he caught the “evil voice” of Thing on tape. Bob's assistant, a surprisingly unattractive and painfully thin Stella, decides to enlist the help of Lady Peter's mucous, an electrician whose equipment can help them find the mysterious creature. But anyone who puts his nose too deep into secrecy turns out to be dead, killed by a hired killer with a baboon and a bad perm. What is the terrible secret of the Sea Killer? <br /> <br /> Ugly scientists are confronted with hot things, inept police and doctors puzzled over a growing number of corpses, Stella and Peter are looking at the beach, and characters that do not bother us, kill or tear. The sea killer, the strange combination of octopus, shark and a pair of large dentures, never seems as threatening as it should. Conspiracy to create a monster does not make any sense. None of the characters are particularly pleasant, and those who can be killed immediately. It is badly shot, poorly duplicated, the plot is less of a mess. Everything is so dirty and smelly that I could not wait to take a hot bath. I had sushi plates worse than this movie. Avoid this, unless it is a version of MST3K.
