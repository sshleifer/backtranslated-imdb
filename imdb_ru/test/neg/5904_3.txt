Robin Williams is great in this film, and it’s a pity that the material doesn’t suit him. It can work if you buy in "U-S-A! Number one!" mentality, but the story is wise, nothing much happens. It's a shame because the film is really trying to say something and speaks sincerely about it. It simply does not give enough emotional impact.
