So you've seen Romero films, huh? And you saw Jacob's Ladder, right? And the more recent Hellraiser films? Ok, now let's make a movie of all three, just let's just put it all together and make a big mess out of it, sounds like a good idea? <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Absolutely awful. Yes, is it an indie movie that gives crap? Is this a pass to make cinematic excrement? The film is trying to establish trust by focusing on the interaction of the characters, this is obvious. Unfortunately for authors, they do not interact well with characters. This is not the night of the living dead; characters are nothingness screaming their meaningless lines to each other in a vain attempt to catch microphones on the set. Dialogue is never interesting. For a film in which so much attention is paid to interacting with the characters, you might think that the characters have something to say: “WHAT we are going to do,” “I don't know,” “GOOD, WE DO SOMETHING.” we will do? "I DO NOT KNOW." "We have to leave." "LET'S ONLY ACCEPT OUR DESTINY." "No, we must leave." "WELL GO THEN." "No, maybe we should stay." <br /> <br /> This is not an exaggeration, there are exchanges in this film that reach this level of redundancy and meaninglessness. <br /> <br /> What's the worst part of this movie? Half of this is a dream, and it really has a zero goal. Nothing in a dream has anything to do with the rest of the film. The authors could not decide whether to make a film about a zombie or a movie about monsters, and therefore they just made both. This is clearly an absurd, the cheapest trick in the book, and this is insanely offensive, especially since I am pretty sure that they have torn the idea off Jacob’s ladder, who took the concept as hellishly more competent than these pranksters could ever hope to do. <br /> <br /> And then there is editing. Years of watching MTV and playing horror-inspired video games must have inspired the filmmakers, but sadly, of course, they didn’t realize what primarily led to changeable editing and entanglement in these materials. In this film you will often get confused, and not in good, David Lynch, but in bad "Wait, I thought that she had just been killed, no? Then who the hell was that? Wait, who is this guy? Where did he come from? How did they get here? "this way. It is constantly and constantly bad. <br /> <br /> This film is a ridiculous piece of garbage, and you should look for it only if you want some friends to crush him and laugh at him. <br / > <br /> And as a final note: as for the “comedy" that people talk about in other reviews, this is all unintentional. In this film there is not a deliberate comedy. It is supposed to be a serious serious study of the characters, because that the filmmakers want to have confidence in their concept of horror. eniyu, their claims do not match their abilities.
