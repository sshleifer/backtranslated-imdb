I bought this item used in the "trash can" of the video game store. I wanted to get a feeling of guilt from watching what I was warned, too intense to look at; I wanted to shock. I wanted to feel guilty and bad about watching a "forbidden film." I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Ferox doesn’t work because it’s so agile and fake. Most of the time the camera does not show “shocking” punches, chops, cuts - you just see the consequences. (They show breast grip in detail). The special effects are just fine. Nothing that tells you about violence is real. “Cannibals” are obviously poor people from Central / South America who were dressed like savages in the jungle and ordered to behave mean-spirited. These people, obviously, were generally to get some money, or food, or both. Again ... just not convincing. <br /> <br /> However, like everyone else, here is the real killing of animals. This is a degree of realism. For me, it was more shocking than gutting, scalping or castration, and even then the death of animals is not at all so terrible, maybe just sad.
