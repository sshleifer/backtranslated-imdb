The strawberry blond has a great script, but I just wanted Errol Flynn to take part in it, not James Cagney, he is not the person for this role. I think Olivia did a great job. This film is also a day dream, so itâ€™s difficult to follow. I do not like the attitude of the male character; how Cagney presented it was just turned off. I give him 3 for the bad game of the main male character. (If you like rude men who like to constantly fight and argue, then this is your movie). Strawberry blond would be better if the main character had a more positive attitude, and change the script so that he was happy that he and Oliva. <br /> <br /> This film indicates that money does not bring happiness, women are right jokes. Simple and not the best movie, but everyone must decide for themselves.
