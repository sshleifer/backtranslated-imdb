I just watched National Lampoon's “Christmas Vacation 2” on DVD, hoping to see something like the original, wonderful Christmas Holiday comedy. I have not seen anything like it. You can say from the very beginning that this film was simply not going to match. It is a pity that he has a name that links him to the original Christmas holidays. This is really sad. The film can not stand on its merits. I think that too many people will watch this film by the name, and it does not come close to this level of comedy. In addition to the title, there is very little connection between the film and the original “Christmas Vacation” and even less with Christmas. The comedy is very simplified and the plot is poor. Children can find humor here, but most adults only chuckle here and there. This film is a failure. Do not waste your time on this.
