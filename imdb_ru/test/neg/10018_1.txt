The best thing in "The Prey" is the slogan ... "This is not a man, and he has an ax"! The film itself is a soft, smelly ... endless shots of insects and wild animals make the viewer want to die! Any slasher fan will not like this trash ..... See Friday the 13th again and write down any found copy of this movie! <br /> <br /> This is also rated as one of the 25 worst films ever made!
