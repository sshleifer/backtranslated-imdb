How this film can be classified as a drama, I have no idea. If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen, I would try to erase it from my resume. It was as historically accurate as Xena and Hercules. Abraham and Moses merged with Noah. Lot, Abraham's nephew, Lot, appears thousands of years before his birth. The Canaanites roamed the earth ... right? What did the writers think? Was it just ignorance (“I remember something about Noah and animals, Lot and the Canaanites and all that from Sunday School”) or did they try to insult the maximum possible number of people on the planet - from Christians, Jews and Muslims geologists, psychologists, linguists ... in fact, no one was offended? Anyone with even a little taste would wince at that!
