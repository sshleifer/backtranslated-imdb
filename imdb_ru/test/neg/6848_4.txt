Three young cinema employees were asked to open a long-closed ancient theater, in which many years before that occurred a terrifying series of horrific murders. It seems that many more murders have happened since then, but all this remains unknown to these three young employees who have jumped out, hoping to finally succeed on their own. As they get closer to the great evening of re-discovery, things become increasingly weird and more disturbing when objects suddenly begin to move on their own without any visible help and a terrible old man, apparently pursuing the room. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's really terrible. In fact, if it were not for the secretary Maria Voronova, who was such a fiercely independent, outspoken young woman who steals almost all the scenes in which she appears, and an incredibly hot chick, who played an incredibly sloppy, but completely sexy Selina, it would be a complete loss. Another good thing I have to say about this film is that some of the murders in the cinema are really inventive, although not too hard (a preference for me, but not necessarily for others), fashion. The rest simply wallow in constant despondency (so extreme that rare few can find humor in it) and run through the predictable slasher, killing annoying characters one by one.
