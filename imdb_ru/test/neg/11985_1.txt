It is clear that this could have potential in more capable hands, but given the track record of Uwe Boll, it would be surprising if there was any merit in this farce. <br /> <br /> The first 5 minutes is the madness of the classic monster movie. - even horrible one-liners delivered by GI type soldiers. Joe, they feel as if they were moved from another enterprise to the same genre. <br /> <br /> You will be a favor if you leave the film at this moment. You have already passed all the main points, and you save yourself from the suffering associated with some of the worst actions in recent history. <br /> <br /> Next, enter the absolute trash talent. The leader has the same charisma as the garden slug. <br /> <br /> It has a clumsy, tricky romance in it — it’s so wrong that you can only guess why this scene was conjured up. Firstly. Typically, interludes of romance and nudity are used in the genre to add a little humanity and sympathy to other cardboard-cut characters — here it has unpleasant consequences for all cylinders. <br /> <br /> The effects are bad and the action is incredibly boring. While other classics demonstrate originality and imagination in the face of budgetary constraints - it just seems like everything has been spent on catering. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are no useful features here - even “this is so bad” is almost good ”. This is just bad and bad. <br /> <br /> Our hero asks the leading asterisk about that the nights they spent together and how she would rate him. She gives him 2 out of 10. I give the whole case 1 (I would go to 0 if it were possible). <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this dribbling, there is a lot of crappy movie that surpasses this ridiculous rumble in the jungle. <br /> <br /> And finally, the film has nothing to do with the popular game Far Cry (at best it is very weakly based) on it). <br /> <br /> Awful, move!
