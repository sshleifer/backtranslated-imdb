I went to see the movie, because my boyfriend was crazy about how much he wanted to watch it, and how his friends already loved him. Therefore, I came with a neutral attitude, not expecting the worst. Unfortunately, this is what I received. I could write a 15-page article on why this is the easiest MOST IMPORTANT movie I've ever seen. But for your benefit, I will point out the pros and an infinite number of minuses. Getting started, acting was very good, especially Christopher Waltz and Melanie Laurent. There were also a few lines that deserved laughter and a couple of scenes with expectations. Unfortunately, a good game, a little humor and uncertainty - this is where the good moments end. The whole initial story could be great. The family of the Jewish girl is undressed, she hides, then meets the man responsible for her pain, and then bears a great plan for revenge. It sounds very good. But the film would not be as “satisfactory” for Americans and Jews eager for Nazi blood. I have no problem with World War II movies or Nazi murders; I saw Defiance and I like it a lot. However, this is the way and attitude with which our potential heroes are killed. I will give you a vivid example of the hypocrisy that this film exudes. Our hooligan gang ambushes the German unit and kills / scalps all of them, except for the sergeant and two other soldiers (no problem yet). They ask the sergeant to disclose information about another German unit. When he “respectfully refuses” to betray his fellow soldiers, they beat him on the head with a baseball bat, encouraging and cursing as if they were at a football match. They took this nazi head crazy! Now let's look at hypocrisy in this scene. Here is a hypothetical situation: a group of American soldiers were ambushed and captured by the enemy. The same scenario follows, and the American commander will rather die than betray his comrade. The enemy hits his head with a great holiday. It would infuriate the audience if this scene were in the film. This American soldier was a hero who put his people on himself, and these barbarians brutally killed him! Well, what about a Nazi sergeant? Well, he's a Nazi and deserves the most cruel death, right? Coincidentally, the Nazis felt the same way about the Jews. See the hypocrisy? Celebrating the Nazi butcher, we put ourselves on the same sadistic level. <br /> <br /> Big hypocrisy number 2: The Nazis are shooting a propaganda film about a German sniper who kills about 300 American soldiers. Toward the end of the film, the film is revealed. Hitler and his peers giggle with delight, watching as an American soldier shot out the window and fell into the fountain. The Nazis are cheering like a soldier after a soldier, falling to the ability of snipers. This should annoy the American viewers of this scene. These evil Nazis laugh at the death of our brave people! Well, the irony is, isn't that what we did (or should have done) all the time while we are watching the Inglorious Bastards? To laugh at the pain of others simply because they were “bad guys.” How would we feel if the Native Americans somehow made a hit film in which they smell bloody vengeance to American settlers? Or what if the Negroes made a film glorifying the revolt of Nat Turner? Well, about the hypocritical flaws. <br /> <br /> I will summarize other reasons for the 1-star rating. 1) Throughout the film, wonderful characters were visible. Brad Pitt even tortures a woman by thrusting a finger into her gunshot wound, because he suspects that she has betrayed him. He is a good guy? 2) Scenes last longer than necessary. 3) Brad Pitt’s southern accent, presumably in Tennessee, is HORRIBLE and annoying throughout the movement. I will leave now, since I have 700 words. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that the population no longer thinks, it just wants blood. And that is why this film received such a high rating. I recommend this film to the ignorant or if you are a Jew and just want to see the beautiful "fantasy of justice." Personally, when I finally left the cinema, I felt that I had a scalp (or would like me to have it so that I did not suffer for 2 hours of mental abuse)
