First, I am amazed to see that this film has received a rating of 7 on this site. At first I thought that industrial people could enter IMDb and increase their rating. but, looking at rotten tomatoes and seeing that this film has something like a 76% approval rating, it seems that perhaps people have just been deceived again to accept the pretentious nonsense for depth. I mean, this movie is just awful. the action is just awful, but the rest of the movie is worse. at the very least, acting causes some (unintentional) laughter. <br /> <br /> A skateboarder boy takes part in the story and is interrogated with his friends for the murder that took place in the park where they ride. and it's all. the rest of the film consists of the aforementioned terrible game, terrible dialogue, slow shots of people walking, faces of people skating, often tuned to music that does not fit the stage. perhaps it was made to be "cool" or experimental or fashionable. or perhaps it was done in the hope that it would deceive people, forcing them to think that it was somehow deep, but it did not work. nothing in this movie works. it's pretentious trash. I can not recommend it enough.
