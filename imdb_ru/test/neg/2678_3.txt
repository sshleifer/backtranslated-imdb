Looking through the comments, I do not see much love for this film, and it is not very difficult to understand why it is rubbish. <br /> <br /> Now I will start by saying that the finished product was damaged in many ways by the death of Donald Plesans (Dr. Loomis) in post-production. This required reconciliation of the film’s conclusion with Loomis, who bought the farm, and took what should have been a double twist at the end, when Michelle traded places with the mysterious “Man in Black”, and I don’t mean Johnny Cash. /> <br /> Now to the story. The fifth film ended rather unsatisfactorily when Michael Myers escaped from prison with a mysterious man in black. It turns out (agg) that this person knows the origin of the evil Mikaela, and is also a colleague of Dr. Loomis named Dr. Wynn. They also kidnapped Jamie Lloyd (Daniel Harris played him in parts 4 and 5, but JC Brandy played here). Jamie, pregnant, escapes from Dr. Wynn's lair, and so Mikal follows her and kills her. But she had a child, so now he needs to track down the child so that he can kill his great nephew. <br /> <br /> We hear several ridiculous explanations of the evil Michel associated with the Gaelic curses on bloodlines and mysterious symbols. For some reason, a radio program is broadcast from Michel’s hometown, which gives Michil several more unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film, like this review, is vague, confusing and aimless with a very anti-climatic ending. . <br /> <br /> Some sex scenes and nudity. Bad conspiracy, passable effects, with some good jogging the mill kills, but there is a great lack of motivation. What should have explained everything, it only stirred up a few new questions, made parts 4 and 5 meaningless and became a bad way for a great actor in Pleasance to end his life and career.
