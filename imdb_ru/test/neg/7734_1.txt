It is impossible to avoid comparing the “Hero” of Zhang Yimou with the “stealing tiger hidden by the dragon” by Ang Lee. They were both budget Chinese Kung Fu movies with exciting cinema of the Chinese landscape and superstar actors. But besides the obvious, in fact, nothing more to compare. The “hero” fails at almost every level that really matters, proving that famous stars, beautiful landscapes, and action effects do not replace the director’s artistry and foresight. <br /> <br /> The entire marketing hype that preceded the “Hero” premiere did nothing but make its failure spectacular. Predictably, “Hero” attracted viewers when it first opened in cinemas in mainland China and Hong Kong, which brought him instant box office success. However, although the scenario was liked by government censors, the Chinese audience reached new heights of caustic criticism and sarcastic wit to express their contempt. Online critics, both professional and amateur, declared the film “ideologically disturbing,” “from the point of view of deep slavery,” written “either by an amateur historian or by someone with ulterior motives.” One article was simply entitled: “Hero, you make me sick!” <br /> <br /> The film’s deepest flaw is its plot, which is not only morally reprehensible and based on an unforgivable historical delusion, but also the worst for the film is boring It is known that all the epic blockbuster films take on some bold historical facts, but the “Hero” goes beyond the artistic license and turns into unforgivable ignorance when it tries to glorify the emperor, who was as cruel as Stalin or Hitler. "Hero" does not compensate for the lack of a moral compass, having fun or having fun. Instead, he makes an extremely unsuccessful attempt to be “deep” and simply manages to be pretentious and preaching. <br /> <br /> Although historians agree that the first emperor of China was ruthlessly cruel, Mao Zedong was known to have admired this ruler - not surprising, given Mao’s own tyrannical rule. Similarly, the communist government in Beijing sees an allegory that is easy to draw between the First Emperor and his own methods of the iron fist, so they were especially pleased with this latest work of Zhang Yimou. Tony Leung, one of the “Hero” stars, in an interview to advertise the film, noted that the Beijing government did the right thing in 1989, putting down students' demonstrations, because it was necessary to maintain “stability” in China. For these comments, Tony Leung received shocked criticism in his hometown of Hong Kong, but he just loudly outlined the main idea of ​​the film. <br /> <br /> Director Zhang Yimou said his goal was to transcend the values ​​of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kung-fu novels and films, revealing the highest wisdom. Unfortunately, his version of "wisdom" turns out: OPPRESSOR RIGHTS. In China, where thousands of years of historical reality penetrated this message, art became the last refuge where people could find freedom from such tyranny. The great popularity of the Kung Fu novel can be explained by its ability to escape to an alternative world: the one where Kung Fu warriors roamed the country, looking for adventure and fighting for justice, without fear and defeating, in spite of everything, their own strength. superhuman skills. Only in the novel did man ever defeat the legitimate power in China, and only in the novel did the oppressed find their leaders. Going against this tradition of the Kung Fu hero, Zhang Yimou did not go up to a higher truth, he hoped, but fell to the level of government propaganda. No wonder the government was so nice. <br /> <br /> Some movie lovers may secretly ask themselves: “All moral judgments aside, is it at least interesting?” Fortunately, the answer is “No!” Since the same story is told again and again with in small changes, it becomes tiresome to look at it. Moreover, three conflicting versions of the same story serve only to confuse character development, since the viewer has very little time to feel sympathy for any of them as soon as the “real” version appears. <br /> <br /> The film is not devoid of beautiful images. However, all the scenes collapse because they do not connect or improve the storyline. Using different colors to distinguish individual versions of a story seems simplistic and far-fetched, and cinematography seems more conscious than truly beautiful. Great for the trailer, but disappointing when you come to see the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Those in China who showed contempt for the unrealistic kung-fu “Crouching Tiger” expected a lot from “Hero”. 'Jet Li, who plays a major role, is a real Kung Fu artist who held national titles before starting his career as an actor. His previous films showed limited acting abilities, but many hoped that Zhang Yimou would be able to use Li's flexible body movements to full effect, while at the same time using him properly in a role that would not set his acting abilities. But it should not have been. The “hero” is trying to go beyond the kung fu genre, so there are not so many battle scenes, and Jet Li is expected to perform the difficult part of the action: an inner transformation leading to deep wisdom and self-sacrifice. As expected the casting director, Lee failed miserably. Meanwhile, the only fight scene in which real Kung Fu skills are revealed is the first scene of the film between Lee and Donnie Yen. All subsequent scenes are disappointing, so the “Hero” cannot satisfy even at this level. <br /> <br /> Although most viewers outside of China are unlikely to be aware of the historical distortion of the cruel First Emperor’s story, it seems even more unlikely that they will accept Zhang’s version of “Chinese wisdom”, which is something else Besides. Perhaps the only time that viewers leaving the movie “Hero” saw them smiling, rather than yawning or frowning, at a special show for Chinese government officials. <br /> <br />
