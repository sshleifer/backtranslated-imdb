Maybe it will get better. I would not know. I did this for the first twenty minutes or so before cutting it off and entering into a period of mourning. It was obvious that the plot itself was familiar. A man, Paul LeMatt, a professor of entymology at Columbia, travels with his dog to a small town in Ohio in search of his former wife, Diane Scarwid. There he meets people who either ignore him or are hostile. Oh, they may smile, but something happens under them. <br /> <br /> Such an arrangement is a home lawn for both filmmakers and viewers, and it is full of possibilities. You can get neatly drawn commercial success, such as Bad Day at Black Rock. Or it would be, and, REALLY, a good episode of the Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> The cast also has experienced performers, as well as some previously known names. Kenneth Toby, a science fiction veteran, outwardly friendly motel manager. Diane Scarwid can show an impressive performance, as, for example, in the Silk Forest. For some others, their range is limited. <br /> <br /> But it is poorly directed and poorly written. <br /> <br /> An example of a battered direction. This dog from LeMatt does not like Kenneth Toby. Therefore, when LeMatt goes outside, Toby sneaks to the window of his room, looks at the dog and shudders. Turn to LeMattu on the street. He hears his dog howling away. Then a POV shot was taken of, presumably, the dogs, rushing towards LeMatt, then past him as the wind blows, and LeMatt is staring at the camera. Cut to an identical shot - coming from a different direction! Whatever the camera imagines, what LeMatt looks at is never shown. Maybe it was nothing, because suddenly the wind stops, and LeMatt is alone on the street, looking a bit puzzled. “You should never have brought this dog,” says smiling Toby from the porch. Question: What the hell is this scene? <br /> <br /> An example of a shabby letter. Well, TWO examples. (1) If you were sitting and writing a stereotypical waitress at a diner in a small town, without any craft, you would have invented an insensitive kid with tied hair on his head and chewing gum walking among the tables. Right. (2) Everything that resembles credibility is thrown out the window in favor of special effects. LeMatt's car stops, then explodes, waiting for it to be repaired in the garage. Panting to stop: believable. Explosion: supernatural. Even Edgar Allan Poe would not approve such an event. <br /> <br /> And the invaders themselves? Think of a modest masterpiece, such as The Invasion of the Body Thieves. Something goes wrong in the small town of Dr. Kevin McCarthy, and half of the film is required to solve the mystery, and all the time the suspense accumulates, and the doubt grows. Here, twenty minutes after the film began, a stranger enters the motel room and tears off a plastic face, revealing a pulsating light-emitting naked brain. Pregnancy is interrupted. <br /> <br /> I won’t tell you the end, because I don’t know what it is, and I don’t care. I suppose it has something to do with insects, because otherwise Paul LeMatt would be an entymologist? (By the way, who is engaged in his studies?) But I'm not even sure that the mistakes were involved. It is possible that a business with errors was accidental. The authors may have made him an expert on insects, and then forgot all about it. This will not surprise me.
