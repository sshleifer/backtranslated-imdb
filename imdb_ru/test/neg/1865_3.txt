This is a pretty bad movie, but, well, at least this movie is at least not as sloppy as Guli’s third movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a bad film in terms of his writing, directing, acting and basically everything between. He has such a weak, simple and mocking story, which, moreover, has nothing to do with the previous recordings from movie ghoulies. He has been trying to connect the film with the first Ghoulies film since 1985, but then, on the other hand, if they really wanted to link this film with their predecessors, then were there Ghoulies in this film? Instead, we now have little people played by Tony Cox and Arturo Gil, dressed as demons. Not that the Ghoulies from previous films were some kind of classic characters, but nevertheless they were the heart and soul of the film, and also gave the films a certain amount of fun. It looks like a film about Gremlins without Gremlins. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie is not very interesting, because it lacks tension, good mood, intriguing characters and, basically, everything else that you can think of, because it is assembled together. people who are clearly not the most talented in their business. Just like the director Jim Vinorsky resumes, with films such as Breswick's Witches and its sequel, Alabama Jones and the Busty Crusade, House at Guter's Hill, Party of the Screaming Queen, Naked Woman Project "and the sequels" Project "Naked girl 2: Frightened topless" and "Project 3 Naked girl: Nymphs of the Mysterious Mountain" and "Da Vinci" on it. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is rather stupid and polite, but this is not enough to promote this film and give it additional entertainment value. You know, this is a kind of cheap movie with some lame special effects, costumes, make-up and actors that no one has heard of since. <br /> <br /> However, this is not the worst film in the series due to the reason why “Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go to College” is a much worse movie, as it had several terrible failed attempts at humor . At least in this film there are still attempts to be serious and professional, although the end result is far from perfect. <br /> <br /> Bad film making and, perhaps, it can be watched only by those who saw Guli’s previous recordings. <br /> <br /> 3/10
