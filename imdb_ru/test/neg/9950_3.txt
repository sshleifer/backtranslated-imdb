The mad monster begins in the laboratory of Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) when he refines his discovery of how to turn a man into an evil wolf monster, injecting the blood of animals into a man who turns out to be his stupid servant Peter. (Glenn Strange), apparently, he plans to put the serum at the disposal of the military department, which will use it to create an unstoppable army of these monsters, the main soldier! However, first things first, because Dr. Cameron aimed to take revenge on people who rejected his experiments, forced him to resign and publicly mocked him. Dr. Cameron implements his plan and uses his monstrous creation to kill Professor Blaine (Robert Strange) in an unfortunate turn of events. Dr. Cameron cannot control the beast and was noticed by local farmer Jed Harper (Eddie Holden) who spreads the news like a forest fire, in another unfortunate set of circumstances a reporter named Tom Gregory (Johnny Downes) finds out about this story and begins to investigate, he begins to suspect the doctor Cameron, and since Gregory is dating her daughter Lenore (Anne Nagel)) he has a lot of opportunities to sniff ... <br /> <br /> Director Sam Newfield is really low-budget stuff from the 40s, and worse - boring unoriginal low-budget stuff. Fred Maiton's script stretches an extremely subtle premise for almost 77 minutes, which is too long, there is no diversity in history, and this is basically the same thing over and over again. The characters are boring cliches, a mad scientist who conducts senseless experiments that create a monster, a fragile pretty daughter, a reporter who plays a hero, and by chance both explore mysterious deaths for which the mad scientist is responsible and romantically connected with his stupid daughter servant, stupid idiotic police and stereotypical gun, owning farmers, who are always accused of drunkenness. It was probably a cliche even in 1942! The film takes place at a rather slow pace, and director Newfield never manages to maintain or create something like excitement or an atmosphere that is a bad thing. Technically, the film is not great, obviously the budget was insignificant, and the crazy monster looks lame, resembling an old homeless wine that had not been shaved for several weeks and had a couple of plastic canines in its mouth from a joke shop. Black-and-white cinematography is basic and static, like most films of this period, while the good Dr. Cameron's laboratory consists of a couch and a table with a few miserable scientific subjects at the top. The action is hard and wooden, with Peter, who throughout the film looks like a fool, Zucco, like a mad scientist, does not convince and is easy to forget. Mad Monster is a rather unfortunate horror film, there is very little entertainment here, although at least Iâ€™ve come to the end in one sitting, which when I think about it is in itself an achievement!
