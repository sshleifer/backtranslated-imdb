A tremendous effort that achieves some success to adapt the classic story of the Odyssey to a portion of the period of the nostalgia of the 30s. Adventurers this time flee from criminals wandering in the south, affected by depression, and they face trouble. <br /> <br /> The strongest side of the film is a wonderful musical soundtrack, in essence, resembling not only the era in which it is installed in, but spiritual references that are distributed in the film. In addition to its importance to the tone of the film, music is just fun to listen to. <br /> <br /> The film damages the fact that the characters are really not so pleasant. In comedy, you need this element to have fun with them in their misadventures. Instead, we have a group of selfish, arrogant, soulless, vile-minded people who really have no positive points. They are not impressive enough to make you hate them, so itâ€™s generally difficult to communicate with them. They are offered as clowns, but as people who put on clown makeup and march in parades, they are simply not funny. <br /> <br /> Like the story that inspired it, the film shoots these guys "Odyssey", where there are various symbolic (some even mystical) characters. At all there are offensive stereotypes, and the operational word "stupid". People are bullied to the right and left, and therefore no one remains particularly interesting or attractive. The film does not like its own characters, and it also does not allow you to love them. <br /> <br /> Baptisms on the banks of the river, beautiful sirens, stolen cars, fist fights, radio preachers, people who are beaten with sticks; all thrown at you in a scattered way. Some cause laughter, others embarrass or tire you. I laughed when the nerd defeated snot because of a particularly disgusting hero. But there were a lot more pointless free scenes; example: some guy from the 30s Dillinger shoots cows from a machine gun. Comedy? Symbolism? Not; just meaningless violence that detracts from the intellectual nature of the source material on which this story is based. <br /> <br /> Other Odyssey adaptations are much better. If you're not a George Clooney fan, rent something else. But buy a soundtrack CD; great music.
