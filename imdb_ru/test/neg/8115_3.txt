Although it is terribly outdated, I MUST insist ... PLEASE DON'T REMOVE! Honestly, it just does not help, because there is nothing that could be added or modified to make it cinematically better. <br /> <br /> The novel on which it is based was atmospheric, well written, really creepy work, but on the film it simply does not translate. Most of Kingâ€™s written masterpieces cannot be translated into film. I'm not sure why this is so, but when you are viewing this work, if you are viewing it, you will most likely understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> Book? It is wonderful. This is not a masterpiece, but it is more than just entertainment. <br /> <br /> Movie? Do something else. You can thank me later. <br /> <br /> He estimates 3.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
