This film is absolutely terrible and terrible. It’s not a low budget, it’s not a budget film that makes Ed Wood’s films look like art. The action is terrible, but the scenery and props are worse than anything I've ever seen. A regular subway train is used to transport people into the evil zone of mutant killers, Voddi Strode has one bullet, and the battle scenes are shot in an abandoned gravel pit. There is sadism, as one would expect from an Italian video against the 80s. Talent was not used to make this movie. And female love interest has a huge ass - Italian taste is possible. Even for the 80s Italian standards, this film is damn terrible, but I think that it came out at a time when there weren't so many films on the video, or the audience was not particularly picky. This piece of shit has no entertainment value, and it’s not even funny, just boring and very cheap. This is actually an insult to the most stupid audience. I'm just wondering, how does an actor like Woody Strode really turn out to be such a turkey?
