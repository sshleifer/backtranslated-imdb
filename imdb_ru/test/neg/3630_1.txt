Blond main character, always believes in everything, and when you stick together, you can do ANYTHING! The shy guy, the best friend with curly hair (rips off with Gordo), wants to become a film director and secretly falls in love with Zoe. Best Spanish girlfriend (rips Miranda) Strange smart girl Quinn (rips off Larry Tudjman) and popular reserves preparation Logan (rips off Kate) And Zoi's younger brother, annoying (rips off Matt) <br /> <br /> Zoe is sexually popular girl with two best friends. The only thing he lacks is the funny little sacred cartoon that Lizzie McGuire has, and Hillary Duff was much prettier. Jamie Lynn Spears is more like a toothpick in the topic.
