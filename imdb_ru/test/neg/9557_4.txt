The film was supposed to be released in 2002, and it was very much awaited because of promotions, but it finally came out in 2003 after the death of the producer. <br /> <br /> The movie is good in parts, but overall itâ€™s not very good <br /> <br /> The scenes between Rani and Ajay are fine, but the other scenes are not well processed. <br /> <br /> The film is too similar to BOLLYWOOD Hollywood, and although it was planned before it was released first, so the originality is lost <br /> <br /> Milan Lutria is generally disappointed after KACHCHE DAAGE <br /> <br /> The music is good, but too many songs <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan looks exhausted, and his appearance suggests that the film was delayed and his acting play looks too boring. Rani is good Sonali is also good, the rest is fine
