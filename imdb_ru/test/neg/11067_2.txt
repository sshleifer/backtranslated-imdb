I have not laughed for so long for a long time - or have seen a film so ineptly made! Talking about what is so bad made me laugh! <br /> <br /> First, I estimate that about 40 percent of the length of the film I could not say what was happening, or even what I saw. I can only describe how the camera works, how frantic an LSD meets. There are whole segments, minutes long, where all you can see are blurry flashes and fragments of the cave wall, people and various other unidentifiable things. I spent half the movie asking my teenage daughters what was going on, but they couldn't follow it better than me. <br /> <br /> Then there are “black” moments when we are trying to scare us (ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooblency goes out for everyone, and the screen turns black - and I mean not only a few seconds. I think the longest lasted almost two minutes. I think a clean film is one of the ways to cut costs ... <br /> <br /> I suspect that the “director” recently read a book about what needs to be done to make a scary movie and decided to drop them all about 20 times each. <br /> <br /> There are three good things in this film: 1 / It is short, 90 minutes (although still half it's too long!) 2 / All the characters are dying (after all, no one can be taken care of) 3 / There was one really good scene - when the group was inspecting the shaft from which they descended to find that their rope had fallen to the bottom (saw what is coming), a large boulder is pushed through the hole, sealing them. I did not expect this, and it was really frightening. <br /> <br /> And what about the early scenes around the fire with a frame, after the shot, after shot shooting from camp lanterns. I swear, the director used almost the same shot about 20 times in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure that after the first kill, the EXACT blood on the cave floor is used twice in about 90 seconds. <br /> <br /> By and large, it is a BEAUTIFUL creativity. I will see almost everything, but this is close to where I draw the line.
