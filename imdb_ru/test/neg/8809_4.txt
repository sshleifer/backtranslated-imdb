Eh. This is a movie about popcorn, nothing more. I watched it with a bunch of friends (and although this may not be the best way to watch a horror movie ...), and much of the dialogue and action was laughable. <br /> <br /> It made me crave a real movie. :) <br /> <br /> The main problem is the lack of tension in the film. He continues to float back to the scenes of "explanation," which dissipates any noticeable tension. <br /> <br /> Is the character's attitude distorted? Yes, they suck. I will not say who they are, but they simply add nothing to the movie / storyline. <br /> <br /> (By relationship, I mean two main characters.) <br /> <br /> Ik. My recommendation is: watch this movie if you can't think of anything better. Mediocre at best ... Maybe not even that.
