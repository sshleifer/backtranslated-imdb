Some giant scorpions are on a submarine and kill everyone. Two months later, some marines and scientists responsible for the scorpion project are sent to the submarine to pick up their cargo. After finding 200 corpses, the commander of the marines tells the doctor: "I need to know if there is anything here that could be dangerous for my people." Gee ... do you think? She refuses to tell him what's down there, referring to the "need to know." Yes, it measures it pretty well. One of the scientists, apparently, some idiot scientist - very hard for an idiot, easy for a scientist. He was given the task of fixing the lights. He finds a light control panel, cuts the wire and squeals like a banshee. Then he does it again. He then takes the hammer and splits the control panel into pieces, causing all the lights on the submarine to start working. <br /> <br /> And so it happens. Apparently, this was done in Sweden; I'm not sure that the Swedes have a really strange sense of humor, or they are just terrible directors. I tend to think they are horrible directors. If you guessed that at the end of this story there was a huge explosion, well, sorry, but you need to know, so I can not tell you. <br /> <br /> If you have to watch a movie about giant scorpions, let me offer Tail Sting, a funny and funny movie about scorpions in an airplane, or Bugs, a rather modest movie about scorpions in a tunnel. Look at this movie as an emergency. Oh, it's watchable, it's hard to turn it off just because of the sheer insanity of it, but that's almost all it takes.
