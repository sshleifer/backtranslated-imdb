When my mother went to the video store to rent a movie for the night, my sister and I learned a lesson to always accompany my mother to the video store! In fact, the only reason she chose him was because Colin Firth took part in it, and she * coughs *, thinking that he is a good actor! <br /> <br /> It all starts with some beautiful species of Africa, and then goes DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN. After this film, I was very surprised that Colin Firth achieved what he achieved, because this meaningless film can ruin any acting career. <br /> <br /> The story of a divorced woman whose son is trying to bring her to a man named Matthew Fields, whom he met, making an impression on his friends because of his big house. <br /> <br /> Divorce Nemie doesn’t like Matthew at all, and he meets with the local vicar, who doesn’t like her son John. ... and the same with him! <br /> <br /> Sorry if you do not agree with me, and I hope that I have not offended you, but to all the people who have not seen this movie, I leave you with a word of caution, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !! !!!
