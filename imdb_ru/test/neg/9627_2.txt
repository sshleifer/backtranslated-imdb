I saw the “Mirror Mask” last night, and it was an unsatisfactory experience. <br /> <br /> This is a film that is visually rich, but with a slow direction, a bad storyline and a two-dimensional characteristic. <br /> <br /> However, I knew this when I entered. I was ready to trust the two gentlemen with whom I walked (knowledgeable comic lovers) that the visual effects would be unusual, and they were. Unfortunately, the leadership inexperience meant that the scene behind the scenes passed with a bit of dramatic tension or conflict. However, this is a comment that can be made by many artists whose work is transferred to the screen and who are entrusted with the leadership. Pace of the plot is lost, as the camera with love stops at beautiful photos. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't go at all without the certainty that the style of the film is worth seeing. I tried with the work of Neil Guyman, but I always had a feeling of “new clothes of the emperor”. I live in hope, but last night was no exception. <br /> <br /> I don’t think I can continue the analysis of Guyman’s works without losing the will to live. Read the rest of the comments and all its flaws are eloquently described. However, I cannot understand how he imagined that he had some understanding of the mind of a fifteen-year-old girl, and that what he said added something to the total amount of human knowledge about growing up and accepting adult responsibility, or changing attitudes. that a girl can have with her mother. These are the central themes of the film, and they are processed ineptly, stereotypically and without depth of imagination. All the beautiful pictures in the world can not fill the part of the work, which has flaws in the basis.
