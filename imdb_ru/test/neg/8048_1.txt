At first I thought that this little fantasy excursion would be a bit interesting. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Good cast (Roy Shader as president) did not help. In this story there were every conceivable possible worst case scenario that could have occurred as a result of a terrorist nuclear catastrophe. And nothing this can happen! <br /> <br /> True - the abduction of the president could only have been accomplished with the help of a traitor to the secret service (ala "BBC-1"), but everything they depicted in relation to FOOTBALL and the helplessness of our country if it fell into the hands of the enemy ridiculously ridiculous. Seriously, even the president cannot completely outweigh our control over the missiles. The case is only used to transfer orders. In this situation, our system would completely remove the codes, and all this would lead to nothing. The destruction of Beijing could not have happened - there would have been no launch of the rocket, because the silo brigade would have been instructed not to do this (the link includes a hardware system). Just too many defenders to prevent such things. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film, like FAIL-SAFE and STRANGELOVE, led to some certainty of the concept that we are losing control over the SYSTEM. But this film goes too far and cannot stop my concept of the incredible. And this makes the experience a waste of time of the viewer. This film is a failure.
