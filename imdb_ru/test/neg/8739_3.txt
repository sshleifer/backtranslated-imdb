Honestly, I never read one of the comics and I canâ€™t remember parts 2 and 3 at all. I can compare with the first part (Werner - Beinhart), and this one here is really disappointing, compared to the first part, as well as compared to most other films that I've watched in recent weeks. The first minutes of the seam will be just an unnecessary clone of the first introduction to the film, and then it gets worse. There are some good (funny) scenes, but overall this is just another boring second-rate attempt by the German film industry that cannot succeed (almost as usual). One good thing: the film is quite short (75 minutes). The bad thing: it contains only history and jokes for 45 minutes;) -> Do not watch it
