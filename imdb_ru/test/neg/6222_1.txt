I don’t know where most of you were, but where I watched the movie, we didn’t have people singing, as some said they were experiencing, we had people laughing, mostly on the storyline, terrible dance sequences and singing like Brosnan. The only people in the audience who seemed to be delighted with the film were people of the seventies generation who somehow lived through the past with songs. I was a DJ in the seventies and even went to an ABBA concert at the Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in September 79, so I appreciated them then and so far. But this film had to go the same way as their marriages, and end in divorce. The strings were so poorly prepared, the dubbing and editing were absolutely terrible, and this must be Meryl's worst production. I cannot believe that an Academy Award winner would have lowered so low to make this piece of garbage. So save your money, wait for it to appear on the DVD, and then maybe spend your money on something better, like cat litter.
