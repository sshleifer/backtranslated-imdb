This is one of those films that you watch with a group of people. You will have the best time. This is really, very bad, as Showgirls is bad, but without the quality of Showgirls. <br /> <br /> You have the best mix of bad actors, bad director and bad script here. Everything that can be wrong, what can be done for an entertaining evening, you have here. The first of these is the “group of teenagers”. These people are the same "teenagers", like my grandmother. <br /> <br /> The director has no sense of suspicion or tension. The 30-year-old “teens” are standing around, and the “monster” comes out and attacks, and this largely happens throughout the entire film when monsters are discovered. There is no expectation preparing for this or surprise or anything. This is more like when you were children, pretending that you are being pursued by monsters and just something made up. And when I use the word "monsters", I exaggerate. More like a couple of Halloween masked guys bought at a store for 0.99 cents. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that this script was removed after a couple of days, without rewriting, and I can only imagine how badly and poorly formatted it looked on the page, because it was clearly written by an amateur without a clue. This is another example of one of the bad things about this day and age: anyone can make a movie. <br /> <br /> But of course, the worst thing about this movie is acting. This is as bad as you can get. There is not a single person in this who has the slightest skill in acting, and the leadership was absolutely the worst. He transmits each line in a monotonous manner without any expression, and you have to wonder how someone so bad could play a role in any film, regardless of who he knows. When he had to “cry” when his girlfriend was killed, it was one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Watching these people read some terrible dialogues is very, very funny. But when the black guy said "tell her ... tell her ... I love her ..." before his death scene, there was a huge laugh among our group. Funny, funny things. <br /> <br /> My one and only the hope is that this film will get bad enough ratings to take its place: IMDb has the lowest rating of 100 films. We can do it guys! <br /> <br /> PS. Is it any wonder that One “wonderful” commentary that this film received was from someone from Virginia (who has one comment, only this film and nothing else). And guess where was the film made? Virginia. I said it before, and I will say it again: people working on the film should NOT be allowed to comment on it.
