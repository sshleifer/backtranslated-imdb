It seems incredible that in the same decade, during which Star Wars came out on a silver screen, such unspeakable jokes like this and many other “adventure” films erupted. I am reminded of the equally generous, but equally pitiful Ashanti, outlined elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Regardless of what prompted the “A” actors to compile a list of such celluloid waste, this, frankly, is beyond the scope of this author. They must have been very, very desperate. To be completely frank, the appearance of Roger Moore in any film is the kiss of death.
