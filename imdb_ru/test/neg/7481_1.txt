Nothing that Carson Daly ever said or did on this show ever made me laugh or even smile a little. I do not understand how this show survived for so many years. <br /> <br /> Even a “funny” band member is like one of those schoolchildren who think that no one is good enough to even look at him. Daly and this dude are just arrogant boys. It seems that they do not even try to be a little ridiculous. <br /> <br /> A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE show. <br /> <br /> It makes me cry. <br /> <br /> I just can't help but stress how HORRIBLE this show is. Do not look. But if you absolutely need it, I recommend tearing eyes and cementing your ears with cement in advance.
