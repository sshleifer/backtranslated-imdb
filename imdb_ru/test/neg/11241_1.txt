I first saw it when I was on a date, and she thought it was a terrific movie. I did not do this. <br /> <br /> The second time I saw it last night on TV. It still sucks. <br /> <br /> Like a love story this sucks. The fact that Julia portrays a street prostitute is disgusting. For me, she was a librarian with a mini-skirt and heels. She had no hard shell to her. She was not subjected to torture, torment, rage, starvation, or anything else. Her character "HOOKER" was as vicious as comparing cubic zircon with a diamond. These two just don't fit, no matter how they look. <br /> <br /> The only cast that I felt was worth seeing was two bitchy saleswomen who were superbly played. They did such a wonderful job that I hated them for a few seconds that they were on the screen. They had a real definition for minor roles. So the film was not completely trash ... two ignorant saleswomen saved the film. <br /> <br /> Besides these two female saleswomen, the rest of the cast ... including the big names were just crap. Either all were asses, or they had absolutely no reason to fill out any dialogue in the film, except that they only praised Julia Roberts or kissed Richard Gere's ass. <br /> <br /> It was a film about how when you walk around in high heels and in a tight skirt in Beverly Hills, people look at you, and the guys who work in hotels, look at them intently, like they hit the baseball bat. <br /> <br /> In fact, women who are dressed in tatters in Beverly Hills are extremely prostitutes and prostitutes, but since they do not have bright ornaments in the form of Madonna or lacquered boots, they can be looked down upon look at others. <br /> br /> The film was terribly sad to watch a movie, and anyone who had a real character had less than a minute of screen time. <br /> <br /> This is an insult to romantic films, comedies, dramas, and even prostitutes who daily encounter wealthy clients in the hope that their lives will be perfect. <br /> <br /> The story of Julia ia Roberts, being a LETTER (yes LETTER) by a multimillionaire in a business suit and limousine. <br /> <br /> She is still owned, still telling how to act, how to move, what to wear, what to say, where to go and what to do. He controls more than a street pimp, but the guys from Disney / buena vista smear him to make it easier to swallow. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere was a black man with a gold tooth and AK-47 on his side instead of an attache, this film will be about how a woman should fight to avoid abuse of prostitution. Same story, different characters will have a completely different look. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, change the white person to black, Asian or Spanish, make the land business deal change to a weapon or drug deal and the whole concept of a romantic comedy is thrown away. <br /> <br /> As far as I understand, Pretty Woman is still rubbish, dressed in ribbons and bows. <br /> <br /> I don’t know I liked it 15 years ago, when I didn’t understand it and was led by a Hollywood deception. I hate it now, when I see through the beautiful scenery, which is called "love." <br /> <br /> This film is NOT a romantic comedy. This is a story about how to control a woman, if you have the means and income for this. <br /> <br /> This is an insult to strong women, weak women and women in general, as well as my television screen. <br /> <br /> I hate it? Yes. Does it suck? Yes I would recommend it to you? NO ... well, maybe if I really hated you. <br /> <br /> Will this review be published? We'll see. <br /> <br /> Anywayz, that's all for now.
