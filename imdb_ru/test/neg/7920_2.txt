First, they spoiled it because of the extremely poor quality of the animation, and then they got voices that do not sound like the original. They make so many mistakes in the movie. When Sasha sings in Count Me Out, the drummer disappears and then reappears, Zudi’s shirt constantly changes color, his hat constantly changes position, one of the bridges is white, everything in the background seems thick, halos continue to change colors, appear and disappear, Even heaven seems different. I don't give a damn if this is a low-budget movie, they shouldn’t cut corners during animation. They completely destroyed the first ADGTH. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack.
