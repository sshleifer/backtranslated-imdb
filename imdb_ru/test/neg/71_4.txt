There are many different versions of this, so make sure you can find one of the unpublished copies, otherwise there may be some blood and one nudity scene. Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. The cut I saw has the title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS on the screen and the Shriek Show was released, which supports the original title WITCHERY for the USA for the DVD release. This is a nice-looking imprint that seems to contain all the frames, but has some problems with framing / aspect ratio. In Italy, it was released as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT). The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films (renamed), and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company (Filmirage), which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE. To make things even more confusing, WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2. Except in Germany, where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually OGRE: DEMONS 3. Well, I'd better just shut up now. I'm starting to confuse myself! <br /> <br /> Whatever the name, this is a very terrible attempt. Some are good, some are not. I really was in this film for the first half or so, but by the end it became a meaningless mess. This is a large, empty hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston, as the German-speaking witch (Hildegard Knef) takes turns picking up different people. Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to capture "Witch Light", and his virgin writer (Leslie Cumming), who studies witchcraft, sit back at the hotel. Real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth) arrives, who demonstrates real estate to potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks. Also watch over their children; the adult daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and the very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), as well as the overloaded architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff's wife at the time). When everyone is inside, their driver is killed (hung up) and the boat disappears, so they are trapped and mostly in the grip of “Lady in Black”. <br /> <br /> So what can you expect to find here? A lot of trouble! One of the heroes has his lips sewn up, and then he is hung upside down in the fireplace and is accidentally roasted by the other actors. There is also a crucifix, witches who eat a dead child, a swordfish in the head, someone set fire, property, a tape recorder on Sesame Street, a virgin is raped by some kind of demon, the vein guys swell up and explode thanks to voodoo dolls. and some other things. From a technical point of view, this is a pretty film with pretty good cinematography, a good score and good blood effects. The location of the hotel / island is also pretty good. Blair (especially at the end) and Ross seem to have fun, and Knef is gorgeous as an evil witch. Despite the fact that people like to mock Hasselhoff these days, he is also quite good in his role. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, despite all the fuss, the film seems somewhat boring, and it becomes monotonous in about an hour, Supernatural themes are also confused and confusing. When the characters get into the witches' lair so that they can be tortured and killed, the filmmakers unreasonably decided to impose screaming actors on some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks extremely silly. And the witches' den itself is empty and cheaply designed with unfinished wood. And although most of the actors, at least decently, some of the performances (especially the “actress” who plays the girlfriend and the child Hasselhoff) are so bad that they are constantly distracting.
