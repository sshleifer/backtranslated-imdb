Well, I usually do not add comments to the films, but I finally watched a film that was so full of nonsense and riddled with incompetence that I just had to warn people. The exorcist in the Blackwater Valley tells in general terms how his wife / pederist / priest is beaten, and about this family of scum freaks, and, briefly, the younger daughter who was molested by a priest but who is in love with a ranch, becomes obsessed. Along with the heroic god avoiding the Mexican gardener who once participated in exorcism, the beating wife / pederast / priest manages to save the day, but not before the demon possessed can jump to the prostitute who the city sheriff made him hit, In general, this the film is the biggest bunch of useless (I could describe this part very descriptively, but why waste my energy on this film), damn, I've ever seen it. Any people associated with the creation of this film must be sterilized so that they cannot pollute the earth with their worthless offspring.
