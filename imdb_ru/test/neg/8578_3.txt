This film is very disappointing to the one who read the book. As Rafael Sabatini wrote, it was a pure story about piracy in the Caribbean, and he would have made a grand movement. In addition, it would be very easy to do. All the action takes place on the ship and on a desert island. Unfortunately, the writers took the name from Sabatini, and then threw away the rest of the book. Even the name of the protagonist was changed, and his personality on the screen was completely different from the personality described in the novel. This is a sad loss for someone who loves good maritime history.
