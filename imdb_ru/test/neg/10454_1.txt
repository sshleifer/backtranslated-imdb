I knew five minutes after the monster appeared where he was going. But when I saw the opening credits, I said, “Oh my god, Bruce Boxlight, Walter Koenig (from Star Trek). Gil Gerard (from “Buck Rogers”, and he is almost unrecognizable ”), then I saw John Callahan, who used to star in my favorite soap, all my children. Put on a few pounds, but he can still act. Then there was Veronica Hamill. It is a pity that I did not get sick to see her in the film. I rescued 20 minutes in the film. This is bad. I have never seen William Catt (from the movie "Perry Mason" and "American Hero Greats"). <br /> <br /> All these stars and one lousy movie. Hope they got paid. <br /> <br /> Poor Poor Poor
