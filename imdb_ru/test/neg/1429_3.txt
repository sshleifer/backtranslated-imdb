Strangeland (1998) D: John Piplow. Kevin Gage, Elizabeth Pena, Brett Harrelson, Robert Englund, Tucker Smallwood, Amy Smart, Tw Snyder, Amal Roh. The disturbing scenes of torture “illuminate” this dark, disgusting film about a sadistic psychopath who lures teens into his torture chamber via the Internet. Snyder (from the 80s rock band Twisted Sister) plays a rotten psychopath, which is a dirty “turn” (without a pun) on Hannibal Lecter. Foam is considered one of the mothers of the victims. Harrelson (Woody's brother) demonstrates one of the worst cops I've ever seen in a movie, and Roh proves why this is her only merit on the screen with an equally pitiful performance. The heavy metal soundtrack ultimately is overwhelming, the torture scenes are very visual and rough, and the ending just sucks. RATING: 3 out of 10. Evaluation of R for graphic violence and torture, strong language and sexual situations.
