Do you know the old saw about a train wreck? How can you not look away? This movie is not so good. The only reason you are still there is that you brought your children and you cannot leave them alone in the theater. You can take a nap. <br /> <br /> Tim Hill should no longer be filmed after the delivery of this terrible piece of trash. He manages to take a decent comic actor in Jason Lee and turn him into a robot, an unsure actor in this performance. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I didn’t have much hope for this film, I admit. If it was not the only family film that I could take with me to my son's Christmas, my wife and I would not have gone. God, I wish we could go back in time and stop ourselves. After about 10 minutes, I leaned over to my wife to tell her what an abomination I thought about, but she beat me to the depths of my soul. <br /> <br /> I'm not joking. It is rotten. Just awesome, as usual, the work of David Cross saves this review from being just one star. <br /> <br /> This story is tempting, offensive and stupid, as you would expect from a movie in this genre (although the latest “Curious George” was blissfully intelligent and pleasant.) The game is mostly bad. The decision to “update” Chipmunk songs For today's audience, it was impractical at best and insane at worst. It doesn't work. <br /> <br /> The old chipmunks were smart, mischievous and cunning. These chipmunks are dull, somewhat mean, unpleasant and, surprisingly, needless to the utter uselessness. <br /> <br /> Either as a retrospective, a tribute, or as completely new production, this film is completely out of order. The last drop? My son could not wait to leave. Spend your money on renting Curious George.
