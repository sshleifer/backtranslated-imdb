Son of Mask is a terrible movie. I do not like a child, and I do not like a dog. Jamie Kennedy and his wife are a nice couple, but she cannot buy the seat through this rubbish. Even in just 88 minutes (or so it was said) the film could not end fast enough for me. The only real laugh comes first with Ben Stein's short talk. That's all. The rest is just a rehash of the first movie. In fact, it is just an insult to paraphrase. Why was this sequel made ?? This film was worth millions of dollars. Why should I sit in a movie with a child and a dog, intentionally trying to drive dad crazy? Jamie Kennedy is talented, but he has nothing to do in this film. I did not bother to be nice with this movie. 1/10
