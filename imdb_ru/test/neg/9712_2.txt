As mentioned by others, could there be any other reason to watch this film, besides to see how former star of “World Wayne” Mike Myers played a serious role? The storyline is interesting, but it lacks development and sabotage senseless ends and bad characters. If there were any good scenic pictures of Ireland, it would give her one more reason to see it. But instead, he focuses on a small, normal village, which is clearly surrounded by the “green pastures” of the Emerald Isle, which are often shown in Irish films. If there was some kind of cultural "seasoning" to admire the "Irish person", it would be worth seeing, but it could almost be shot in England. Too bad for Myers, but this one cannot please or satisfy the heart of anyone who has ever wanted to visit the country of Guinness.
