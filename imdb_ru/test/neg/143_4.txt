I saw this film on VHS some time ago (January 27, 2003), simply because of the name of Paul Rudd on the cover. I really liked his performance in The Object of My Love, and I really expected a good job. However, I found this film a complete mess. The plot has a very tangled script, and the characters are underdeveloped. In addition, low-budget special effects do not help much. I do not know the previous generation Gen-Y Cops, but this next generation is not good. I don’t remember exactly why I rated this rating (and I’m not going to watch this movie again), but my vote is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): `Gen-Y Cops A Nova Geração" (Gen-Y Cops, the next generation ")
