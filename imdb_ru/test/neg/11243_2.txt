When this show started, it was quite interesting: we saw what the crab fisherman had to go through during the crab fishing season. Soon, however, he lost his focus on fishing and focused almost entirely on drama in the life of a fisherman. The episodes have become nothing more than “the captain does not like the new horn” (this happens too often), “someone is injured or sick,” “the fisherman finds out about some kind of problem at home and is disappointed that he is stuck in a boat,” I repeat. I don’t know how people can find the newest observed seasons, since each episode seems to be essentially the same as before and after it. This show should be moved to another channel and renamed Crab Boat Drama, or, even better, it would make the perfect one-off segment on Dirtiest Jobs. <br /> <br /> Didn't the Discovery Channel learn a lesson after American helicopters?
