All those who criticize The Sopranos for its stereotypical image of the Italians did not see anything until they got a good look at this Cornball gangster film that tells about such an annoying family that you almost want them to be wiped off the face of the earth. <Br /> <br /> Parents in this clan are not so bad, but their two little boys - one crazy, one mean whimsy - are unbearable, and their older useless son and daughter Pollyanna skillfully compete for the contempt of the audience. But the grandfather of them all, well, grandfather. In the role of Shika Salé (in the full mode “Dag-nabbit!”), He serves as the moral compass of the films, adding many diatribes about “hell, dirty foreigners” for good measure. If these are good guys, then it's no wonder that the actors of that era who played the villains became big stars. <br /> <br /> It’s not that you could find some kind of star performances among criminal actors, but at least they justify themselves better than the decisive Leeds family. Incompetent police do not even give enough time on the screen to further bring down the situation. Only Walter Houston, as the district attorney, raises the cliché-rich material in his vain attempts to breathe some balance into these crazy things. <br /> <br /> The film deserves praise for the fact that he entered early on the fact that, as it turned out, a very popular formula of silence-witness, and she does not flinch in describing the cruel way of life in the underworld, but in the genre there is just the best - and less xenophobic - examples.
