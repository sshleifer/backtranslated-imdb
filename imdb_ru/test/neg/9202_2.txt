First, this film was shot in 1978. This suggests that the film will still be bad. But I'm not saying that all old movies are bad. Secondly, special effects that we are terrible, even for that time. Finally, the acting was so bad that Bozo Clown could do it better. It makes you wonder how people get paid to make films so pathetic. This movie sucks!
