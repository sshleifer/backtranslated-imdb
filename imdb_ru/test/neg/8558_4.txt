LORD PROTECTOR - baby food, but for whose children? Obviously, in the frame for television or television programs, in this amateur KRULL paraphrase there are several characters - a magician, an assassin, a warrior, a scientist - following something else to defeat the dark forces that are about to release on their planet. Poorly written, acted upon and set in accessible places in California, such as municipal parks and ranches, LORD PROTECTOR has nothing to recommend it, even as a waste of time. Jay Underwood is the only actor with a “name”, and most people, especially the intended audience of five-year-olds, are unlikely to remember him from such an ancient Disney film as “NOT A PERSON.” The nameless actor who plays the wizard in a loosely fitting silver wig at least plays with his tongue firmly set on his cheek, while the people around him behave as if they are playing in a KING LEAR theatrical performance. I was hoping, at least, for a decent sequence of actions or special effects. Alas, the action scenes are pathetically staged, and few special effects are those old-fashioned colored animated jokes that we used to see in science fiction films of the 1950s and 1960s, such as Berthe Gordon's Magic Sword. The filmmakers have planned a sequel, which, fortunately, was never. Often such cheap Hollywood back-many productions use a combination of legal and porn actors. I occupied myself during the seemingly endless length of the film, trying to figure out what was in it. I did not have much luck.
