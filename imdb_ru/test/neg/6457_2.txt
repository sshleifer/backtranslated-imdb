Talk about false advertising! What did it do in the comedy section of my video rental site? I think the movie had one funny role. I can appreciate the black comedy, but it was only black without comedy. The film was generally disturbing and unfunny. Yes, Kevin Spacey was good as Buddy, and the rest of the actors were also good, but overall the film is falling apart, because we donâ€™t see enough good reason why Guy (Waley) is so crazy. The ending also disappointed. What is Buddy's motivation to let Guy get away with what he did? This is not really due to EVERYTHING. Why should Buddy go to such a plan? Wouldn't it be more like Buddy completely fucked Guy over to the police? The ending didn't seem to make much sense to me, no matter how I looked at it. <br /> <br /> In general, I did not like the film, despite the good game. Spacey essentially chews the scenery for most of the film, but by the end he gives Buddy some needed humanity. The story was not as good as the actors.
