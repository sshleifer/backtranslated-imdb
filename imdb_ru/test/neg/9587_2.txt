... why watch a television drama (announced as a comedy) in which none of the characters is a likeable or even interesting person? I can see what the writer David Renwick was trying to achieve: the oddities and unpleasant surprises he put into “One Foot in the Grave”, etc. I admit that the script made more efforts than most on British television at the moment. But really ... who cares about these people? They are cold bore. <br /> <br /> Another author mentioned a scene in which a woman sits down to watch a video about how she and her late ex-boyfriend are fucking. It was the moment when I turned off this program to never return. <br /> <br /> P.S. It is interesting to note that the posters that did not like this series are all British, while those who praise it are mainly in other countries. This reflects the fact that when the BBC broadcast this show, the audience ignored it and sank like a stone. <br /> <br /> P.P.S. Good news for those who liked it! In the fall of 2007, the second series will be released - however, without a male leader. Looks like the BBC decided to turn it into a more conventional 30-minute sitcom.
