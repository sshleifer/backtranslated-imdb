Untold ... This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The story does seem original, but it was bad on screen. Lance Henriksen, a good actor, ended up in this shit. But hey, he made a lot of low-budget films ... you have to pay bills, you know? Just kidding Lance is a great actor, but he ended up with this bunch of stupid actors. Seriously, Andrea Roth was there just for the nude scene, and other actors ... well, they were just there. There was a gradual disappearance of editing, and it made me sick! It was the most terrible movement that continues to happen, and it really makes you angry. It was also very predictable, boring and slow. He has a weird pace that just goes ... wrong. <br /> <br /> I can not say more ... do not rent it out and do not buy it. You can watch it if on TV.
