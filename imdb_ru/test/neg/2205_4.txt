I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott, so I was surprised and disappointed to find that he was barely in this movie! The film really belongs to Robert Ryan, who is the hero of jam, and the one who is involved in a love triangle. God, Gabby Hayes gets more screen time than Mr. Scott in this movie! For many viewers, this is not a problem, but I’m from Walter Brennan’s schoolmates, not Gabby Hayes ... although I’ll say that his roles were a bit more humorous than annoying in this film than in many of his films. with Randolph Scott and John Wayne. <br /> <br /> Personally, I found the film very slow, with a confusing plot that got even more confused with an unnecessary plot from the novel. By convoluted, I do not mean the impossible to understand or understand, I simply mean too dirty for his own good. <br /> <br /> The direction is not inspiring, and the two main bad guys have the most unsatisfactory arrival - Oppans at the end. The whole film looks fake, unrealistic and poorly filmed. <br /> <br /> You just don’t think that I can’t find anything good here ... <br /> <br /> Plus, Ann Jeffries is very sexy in her too short parts of this film. Not sure if this is actually her singing or anyone else, but whoever it is, she had a very beautiful voice. Miss Jeffreys also had some good moments in acting. The script needed either her or the removal of her character. Be that as it may, her pleasant moments were not enough to help the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is Mr. Scott. He looks fantastic in this film and is a frivolous lawyer to fix it. Some people complain that his characters before 1950 were too perfect, but it never bothered me. I'll take him sentimental before 1950 or cruel and cruel after 1950 ... anyway, Randolph Scott was a real western hero. <br /> <br /> I am sad to say this, but I would recommend to skip this film if you are not a devoted fan ... there are so many of the best Scott films that this film will not be missed.
