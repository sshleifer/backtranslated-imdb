One commenter said that if you like Austin Powers, you will like this movie. I liked Autin Powers, and I was disappointed with this movie. The film works hard, maybe too hard for a laugh. Maybe all the villains in this movie shouted as if the cry itself is considered funny. I understand where they tried to go with this click. A cross between Zorro and the Scarlet Jumper, but it just doesn't work. Austin Powers, if he is stupid, but clever, Zorro, the Merry Blade lacks the acumen of Austin Powers, the Big Lebowski or the Stud. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for laughter and, waiting, found myself amazed that someone had actually received the money script. My 15-year-old daughter also thought the film was flat. My 17-year-old boy who chose this movie by title came out after 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> It seems that many people on IMDb liked this film, but for me there was not enough time or jokes in a good comedy. ,
