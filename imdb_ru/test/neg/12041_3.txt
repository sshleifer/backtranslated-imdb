Carlito's Angels is a parody of Charlie's Angels, which is sometimes not afraid to fake even himself, but this does not mean that the film is also above criticism from the audience — it is amateur and juvenile (I think the fast Motion has stopped to be funny about 1914). The attack on rap music often drowns out the dialogue, and the film seems longer than it is, although it lasts just over an hour! The girls themselves are hot and charming, with beautiful thin bodies, and, although they never undress, their outfits do little to the imagination. After examining their IMDb pages, I discovered that one of them (Alessandra Ramos) is actually experiencing a film career; I wish her good luck, because although this film is bad, she (like other girls) gave him all the energy, and I don’t mind seeing her on the screen again.
