Fatal contact: bird flu in America: 3 out of 10: this film is funny and sad. The funny part is pretty obvious, because itâ€™s certainly not a sober look at a possible looming crisis. This is the modern version of The Swarm. And just like those killer bees (and the so-called killer bees crisis that caused them), avian flu joined the pantheon of doomsday-inspired media scenarios (SARS, Y2K, Global Warming) that simply refuse to actually happen. <Br /> <br /> The sad part is the blatant attempt by cinematographers to cause panic. Historically, disease pandemics have been fairly common, since not all people died at the age of 40 from heart disease. Even recent pandemics, such as AIDS, reflect the old-fashioned VD crisis (recall syphilis), which killed more soldiers than bullets. <br /> <br /> The flu pandemic in the early twenties was an unpleasant affair that killed millions, but frankly, life went on. I wonder if our overly dramatic media and their government allies, eager for power, will allow us to live a normal life today? <br /> <br /> The film itself wildly deviates from the rather competent scenes (Triage in grand Central Station) to ridiculous ones (Rednecks try to ambush the national guardsman in Manhattan). <br /> <br /> The scenarios themselves are pretty useless, since the filmmakers cannot decide exactly how infectious the bird flu is, or, for that matter, the symptoms are symptoms of an Ebola-type crash or just a long-term illness. Indeed, one scene will show everyone in costumes with a biological hazard, and on the other there will be no one even wearing a mask. <br /> <br /> The film also clearly refuses to give any practical advice on what to do in a bird flu crisis. , (Except that you washed your hands, what kind of duct tape?) Acting and directing are suitable for a television film, but the script is everywhere on the map. The latest film has a strange non-exponential overall mortality at the bottom of the screen. Just like Roy did.
