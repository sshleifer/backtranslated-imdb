Hello. I watched the first part when it came out, and I do not remember leaving such a bad impression on me, like this one. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the animation is intermittent, wooden, not processed, there is not enough naturalness - I understand that the drawing style should have been a kind of “Atlantic”, but this can be done with the help of Disney’s usual refinement ... see "Tarzan" to understand what I mean. If I had not seen the DISNEY logo at the beginning, I would never say that it was a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the plot was more like a PC game style, like the good old quest. Not that it was bad, but it lacked a story that would connect the viewer with the characters and their goals. At least it was unconvincing. The film was intended for children, but sometimes it was childish. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the music ... I would say that it was inappropriate, but it simply corresponds to the whole scene with the plot and animation. ... <br /> <br /> In general, I think it was some kind of entertainment, just by the way, the project of several students-animators, just to count the number of Disney films. It is a pity to hear it from myself, a great lover of Disney ...
