“Marsh creatures” show what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a small amount of money, some knowledge about making films, a mixed bag of novice actors and great determination, but without the necessary knowledge and skills to cope with or else. than a rather bad looking After School Special (in a bad way, not a nostalgic good way). I mean, this is a very high quality home movie / student film if you want to give it to your family and friends for free. Fortunately, I found it somewhere in the discount basket. Of course, there may be some kind of market for this kind of thing, but this is a market that seems to exist only by default, because there are so many bad films out there. Especially now, these days. <br /> <br /> The only people I would recommend this step to are beginner partisan directors. First, I would recommend them to look at a special function, PRODUCTION, included in the disc. Look at the enthusiasm of film crews, their hard work, joy and a very high opinion of their own product. Then watch the movie. After a few frames, I hope you understand what went wrong. Boringly, I went through all this and obviously the director and cinematographer tried, but I just don’t know enough about what they are doing. They knew enough to have fun, but in the end, without the necessary skills, this is interpreted as follows: they knew enough to be dangerous. It looks like a bad Nickelodeon movie (as opposed to a more decent one, I think). The pair of actors had everything going well, and a cool dude with a tattoo that looked cool (a real or fake tattoo that I don’t know) was probably the best and most natural, and I hope he does it. But their natural acting talent was what happened, despite a bad movie, a bad script, and so-so guidelines. If the director has spent more time helping these novice actors to develop their characters, successfully studying proven camera techniques and lighting principles to better lead their team, and if the script was actually worked out and not written over a week or so (according to very indulgent documentary) then maybe it could be more than a movie. Instead, this is a film that has a sense of some potential, and there are a few moments in it (more due to the genre than the film itself), but in the end it shows almost every frame WHAT IS NOT TO DO. If you want to see how a decent low-budget horror movie can actually look like, take a look at Phantasm or even Laserblast. If you want glorified home movies (no joke), purchase Bog Creatures.
