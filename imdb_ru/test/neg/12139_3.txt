Let me be clear. I hate such films. I do not like anything, where the main characters are all the English bourgeoisie. I find such literature and films terribly pretentious. You never make me read the book of Jane Austen willingly. However, the only reason I read the book of W. Somerset Maugham and watched the next film was for the class. <br /> <br /> Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is a beautiful Englishwoman living in someone else’s villa in Florence. before World War II. One night after dinner with some of her rich friends associated with the royal family, she willingly picks up an Austrian refugee, has sex with him and ditches, and then he kills herself. As the movie goes on and on, you really don’t like Mary. <br /> <br /> What a shit was in this movie. First, the film invented many plots and characters that were not even in the book. I very much doubt that the late Mr. Maugham would appreciate them. The characters, though rich, were among the most superficial and selfish people I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave him nothing but three stars was that acting was the only thing to be redeemed. The ever-talented Christine Scott Thomas is perfect for the role of Mary. In fact, I could not imagine anyone else filling her shoes. Sean Penn and Ann Bancroft also had minor roles that were as good as the main role. <br /> <br /> Get rid of the pain by watching this movie.
