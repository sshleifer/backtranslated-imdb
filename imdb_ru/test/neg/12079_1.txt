It's just when the band goes on tour, and it has only one original member. This is not the same as the classic line. All new actors play the main roles Reg, Scotty, etc., and Ashby is practically the only returning person from the first film. And he was only a minor first-click note, serving as the only redeemed group of three guys Scotty tried to help in meeting with women. The film is poorly written, showing the blunt dialogue of this side of Armageddon. Even for a T & A movie, it's a turkey. Even cruel lovers of low-cost films of the 80s will not want to sit in this film, which has no plot and a lot of bad games. This film would be better never to release. Just bad.
