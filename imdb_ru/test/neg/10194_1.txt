This film was poorly thought out, poorly written and acted poorly. All characters were two-dimensional. It was a real amateur attempt. The film was a fundamentalist Christian propaganda. Christian characters are holier than you, and they have no compassion for skeptics or indecisive characters. The film became a real “trick” both for the skeptic and for me as a spectator, putting us in a very uncomfortable situation. I complained to the management of the theater and received a free pass to another film. I remember another film on the same theme “Delight” with Mimi Rogers in the title role, which was much better and professionally made. I think I will be watching “Delight” again. If you visit "Unidentified" and you do not like it, do not say that I did not warn you.
