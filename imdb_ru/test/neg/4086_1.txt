The only feature of this film is Steve Carell. Like John Wayne, I never saw Steve Carell going too far as an actor, but that doesn't matter. He always perfectly plays his only role. <br /> <br /> As Marti Feldman once said, comedy must have an internal consistency. You may have 4 people on stage who are sitting in the garbage cans, which is normal, but if you brought the fifth person to the stage who is not in the garbage can, you should explain to the audience why he is not in the garbage can either. . <br /> <br /> Why does Evan not accept his role as a messenger of God? Why, when he takes it, is he so deeply embarrassed by it? Why no one is more impressed with how animals follow Evan (thoughtless doubters explain them as “trained animals”, perhaps from a circus). In the end, a terrible flood, and most of all we see, jump on the ark and saved, but surely thousands of people would have been killed by the flood; There is no emotional atmosphere after a disaster at the end. Instead, most of the congress has finally seen the light and is going to pursue a lonely incorrigible congressman for "speculation." <br /> <br /> I have to admit: I also liked the fish in the aquarium, responsive to the presence of Evan.
