I bought this film in e-bay as part of twenty horror films, only about a dollar apiece. When I watched it, the first impression was that it was probably the end of the 80s. Later, I started thinking - Linkin Park posters on the wall and everything else seemed to hint that I was dealing with a newer movie. Understanding this, the film has become an intolerable torment. The last 3 minutes were the longest in the history of cinema - the film simply refused to end. Is there such a genre as “Horror for children”? In this case, this film is definitely that. If there are parents perverted enough to want to present their children to horror, I believe that this would be ideal for children from 6 to 8 years old. The only thing I really liked was Greg Sipes, who was too good an actor for such a nostalgic retro double-counting bottom.
