First, let me make it clear that I love airplanes, and usually any movie with them is worth watching - and I watched a few shocking ones. However, the same does not apply to this film. James Stewart is a great actor, but he is wasted in this advertising film Strategic Air Command. The game is mediocre, and the direction is weak. I had to stop watching this terrible trash about halfway through. This was despite some really good, perhaps even the best, aerial photography. The trouble is that even for an aviation lover like me, creating something from a shocking plane (B-36 and B-47) is just too unnerving. It is a pity that the film was not made when the B-52 appeared, then the superlative degree used for the aircraft in this film would be valid. Then I could sit through it. Perhaps I am missing the point of the film, which may be the longing that my loved ones feel when their loved ones are on active duty. In any case, this could have been done much better. Recommendation? Well worth to miss.
