The way LIVING THE DREAM managed to get into Laemmle 5 in West Hollywood doesn’t concern me, as this is the worst film I've ever seen in my life. I should have known when the first scene opened, gasping for breath, Eugene, Oregon, - that this is a stupid movie with characters you like, and you feel sorry for their high school contributions, but you can't, because they are such losers, such wooden and cruel with a dialogue that is beyond the bad. <br /> <br /> Then, cliché, three high school students lose out in Los Angeles, and that's where the film could be realistic if he showed them trying to find a career in acting. But no, one works as a seller of used cars, the other is a real loser in a garage call center selling magazines. Even the bastard who runs this place attracts more viewers than this terrible actor with a terrible foreign accent. And they fraudulently get money from insurance fraud in order to create an executive recruitment company with no experience, simply showing “supposed good life” in night clubs in Los Angeles with actors who are so wooden and bad that it is better for them not to have a SAG card ... <br /> <br /> I could continue to talk about this bad film, but in the end I left the theater, in which there were six people, and when I left, four men were the only ones in the audience. I wanted this film to be liked, but I could not find a single merit in history, characters, writing, dialogue or actors. The one who makes this film must resign. Amen ... enough ...
