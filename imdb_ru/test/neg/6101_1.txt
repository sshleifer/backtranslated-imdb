And again, Columbia Pictures decides to just make a hash using the original version with Curly and without any jokes or jokes to download! By the end of this pitiful movie, when Joe gets stuck riding the bull, the studio doesn't even make much effort to re-record the sound, because if you listen carefully, you can still here. In addition, when Moe and Larry throw darts to “slow the bull so that it can get off,” it was removed directly from the original, because you can see that Moe and Larry look “magically” 15 years younger. Why did Moe let all this happen? This is a burning question that probably will never be answered, because, as far as I know, in real life he was very sensitive to any kind of criticism and had rather high standards in his work, like Larry, Curly and Schempe. Do not waste your time on this.
