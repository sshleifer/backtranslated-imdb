I assumed that “Scarecrow Gone Wild” is a boring slasher. Yes, there is a good point in this, but this is a paraphrase from another movie. The acts are so dreadful no plot. <br /> <br /> The story comes from the legend of a live stuffed cornfield. When initiation becomes a joke and puts the boy's life at risk, the effigy comes to life and begins to kill insanely. Sounds familiar, right? It comes from Scream, the fifteenth 13th, Jeepeer Creepers, Kids of Corn, you name it! <br /> <br /> “Scarecrow Gone Wild” is a movie below average. There is hardly a terrible moment. Even the final scene is ridiculous! Unfortunately, we still could enjoy it as our time killer. But I prefer you to watch something else. If you're not a big fan of bad and stupid movies, of course. <br /> <br /> 4/10
