I assume that the producers of this low-budget space / horror film wanted a serious film, but the director was set to parody. So ... this is what we get. Set in an abandoned spacecraft 1000 years in the future and populated with characters and props right from the 90s. A set is some kind of industrial complex, maybe an oil tanker, whatever. They are used as is, so the controls consist of racks of old television equipment. Obviously, one of the places is the dining room for employees, where an old TV and VCR are installed, as well as a water cooler with plastic demidzhon. Tiny Lister and Kulio get the best lines, arguing throughout history. The dialogue is filled with terms that are rather outdated even now (“Ok, Daddy”), but then maybe the 30th century is very retro? When the captain declares that the cargo on the ship is the coffin from the “Transylvania Station”, you understand that this is all put on. This is a little Alien, partly JasonX, shameless robbery of all the best sci-fi and horror films. At some point, Casper VanDin even tells his pilot to "do so" with a deadpan face. This film would be better if they just let everyone run around with satire, but they keep trying to make the story serious ... perhaps the patrons were on the set that day. In any case, a good killer of boredom, if you are not too picky. FX is as good as sets are bad.
