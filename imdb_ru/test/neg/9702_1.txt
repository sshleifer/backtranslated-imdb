I think this suggests that the Bollywood Bride and Prejudice remained more faithful to the source material than this 2005 Hollywood version. I also laughed more at the Bollywood version. (Mr. Holi? Priceless!) If you read the book or saw the BBC version of 1995 (and you liked it), then an unpleasant surprise awaits you for this film. However, my friend, who had not seen one, was slightly surprised by the film. If you are a Jane Austen purist or even a movie buff who doesn’t like historical inaccuracies, it will be painful to watch. <br /> <br /> Ugh, script. The script was the biggest problem. I believe that the actors would not have done it half so badly if they had a decent script, perhaps composed by someone who really loved Austin's work. <br /> <br /> What parodies were committed? Well, you will have to endure such incredulous phrases like "Don't you dare judge me, Lizzy!" and "Leave me alone for life!". Not only are such lines far from anything that can come from the eloquent pen of Jane Austen, but can anyone honestly believe that such words are coming out of the mouth of a cute young lady of the Regency era? The use of modern colloquial expressions is one of the many annoying ways that a screenwriter kills a book. The writer also decided to give the characters lines that were said in the book by completely different characters and all without a visible goal. Worst of all, when they try to get a little closer to writing a book, the screenwriter has an unpleasant and unnecessary habit of rearranging Austin's phrases and replacing her already clumsy synonyms with her already perfect words. As if the screenwriter sat down with a book in one hand and a thesaurus in the other while writing the script. Stick to Austin; she did it better than you! I assume that all of this was done in a “revisionist” spirit and in an attempt to alienate this film from the 1995 cult version of the BBC. However, for me it also made a parody of the true spirit of Austin's most beloved work. <br /> <br /> The casting had potential, although it was quickly destroyed as soon as the script turned on. But Keira, giggling excessively and bare your crooked teeth are not equal to charm and cheerfulness! And I think that Mr. McFuiden, although I consider him beautiful enough, read his script incorrectly, and I got the impression that he was playing Heathcliff, and not the terrible Mr. Darcy. I really liked Brenda Bletin, Kelly Reilly and the actor who played Mr. Collins. Their interpretations were really quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Yes, but Donald Sutherland! Someone called his performance like a vagabond who accidentally wandered into the set, and I must say that this is a good description. And can someone tell me why they fashioned Wickham after Legolas? Although he was in the film for less than two minutes, I suppose, and without his impressive archery skills, to liven up the film. <br /> <br /> On a note in the wardrobe, I would kill Miss Bingley for the dresses, because they were luxurious and fit more with the modern age. (Regency sleeveless evening dress? Please! Versace than Austin, that's for sure) And poor Cyrus, the entire budget was spent on her salary, not on her wardrobe! Oh, and I'm sure they eventually caught the bastard, who stole one comb from the movie. Unfortunately, they did not catch him fast enough to brush the actresses before shooting the film. <br /> <br /> In short, with this new Hollywood version, salute Austin's eloquence, his subtlety and wit, because you are completely opposite.
