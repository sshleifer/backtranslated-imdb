This is a revival of the film right in the march of the bad film industry and Saudi Arabia, I want to know how the director was able to stand up in front of industry people after he made this film, the work was very bad, we donâ€™t know how the movie Saudi companies like Rutana and others do not support Yang. Filmmakers in KSA, such as UAE. We hope in the future for the prosperity of the film industry in Saudi Arabia. But without such intervention, stupid traders and idiots make us bad films that do not benefit the reputation of the cinema in Saudi Arabia. It's like Roman and Iranian cinema. At the same time, please, the creators of simple experimental cinemas in Saudi Arabia, such as Abdullah Alayaf and others, to realize the dream of a good film industry to participate in festivals of the world far from the stupid interventions of large companies
