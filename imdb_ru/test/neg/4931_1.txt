This film is stupid, filmed by stupid people. The plot, I believe, works well enough for a horror movie, but the actions of these characters are insanely stupid! Like, incredibly senseless nonsense to the N-th degree! In fact, the entire film consists of four idiots repeatedly captured, despite the fact that they have many simple ways and possibilities to overcome their captor. It does not make sense and does not entertain. A stab in the eye is more rational, and probably more fun than watching it. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS **** End of fun !! The only good part of the movie! I almost died of laughter at the end! This whole stupid film, and it ends with the stupid girl being sent to a box for white slavery in Asia !! Fun! I thought it was a terrific ending to a really crappy movie.
