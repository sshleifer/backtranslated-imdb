I'm really sad that this is the first bad review I've ever done for a film ... EVER could stand to watch this movie, and this is the second movie from all the films that I've seen, it's simple. ... slide. The first is “Open Water,” which simply had no meaning. The next karate had no mention of Daniel (correct me if I am mistaken, please), and this final feature was a shock. It was like "If you have to fight ... win." then it showed a bird flying around, and played a flute pan, and I was like, oh. Alright, so it will take some time for this next part. And then the loans get on the screen. <br /> <br /> Damn it !! I hope I never again have to watch the film badly, I apologize to those of you who like The Next Karate Kid, I really, really ...
