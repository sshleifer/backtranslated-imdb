Good cinematography, good acting, good leadership ... cannot justify a story that is not and cannot be acceptable to any society. Amitabh often used the media to make this garbage corrupt, saying that - if such an incident happens ... then what? I would like to ask him if this happens with your own child or your grandson (say, with a girl), then what will you do? I think that every parent should take extra care before talking to any 60-year-old neighbor, if you have one-jia- with you. Such films should be banned and discouraged, otherwise you will inspire even more to do with Nitari. Such actions are atrocious, and villains in films are punished. This should be the moral of the story, and not glorify their actions or theirs.
