I tried to love this show, really, but I can't find the reason why someone would like it. Storylines are weak, the game is weak and incredible. It seems that every actor was randomly picked from the street. And it seems to me that the whole performance is just a means for Jamie Lynn Spears to go to the movies. Each episode shows Zoe as a girl that every girl wants to be her best friend and that every guy wants to meet. She is always perfect, and no one is like that in real life. How can people relate to a character who is just a Barbie doll? Jamie Lynn's play is fair, but she is not a strong enough actress to play the main role in the series. All fans of the show are just young girls who know nothing better. Sorry if you think that my comments are too harsh, but if you can find a meaningful and deep moment in this series that was not quickly sent to a beach party - please accept my opinions and find something worthwhile to watch.
