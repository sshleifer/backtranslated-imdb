Famous singers have always had a hard time breaking into a movie (the movie is replete with unsuccessful attempts), and you can go on and think about why John Mellenkamp never made him an actor. Instead of playing small roles in soul projects, Mellencamp dives into the main role in "Falling From Grace", which he also directed, and the results are as clumsy and inhospitable as this title. The story of the famous singer, returning to his hometown in shreds, revealing old family wounds, boasts the script of Larry McMurtry, but the tortuous film does not go anywhere slowly. The supporting cast is decent, including Kay Lentz (who is always nice to see), Mariel Hemingway and Claude Akins (who share one really strong scene in the film). As for the game of John, he does not look very comfortable, despite the obvious attempts to make him look at home; he seems to be covering the camera most of the time, and he never connects with the audience immediately. * 1/2 of ****
