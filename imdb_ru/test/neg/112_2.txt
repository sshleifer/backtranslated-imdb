Now I love Italian horror movies. The nicer they are, the better. However, this is not cheesy Italian. This is a week-long spaghetti sauce with rotting meatballs. This is an amateur hour on every level. There is no worry, no horror, just a few drops of blood are scattered around to remind you that you are really watching a horror movie. “Special Effects” are made up of lights that change color red every time a ghost appears (or whoever it is) and a chain pulling the sheets up and down. Oooh, do you feel chills? DVD quality is a VHS program (which actually helps the film more than hurts). Duplication is below even the lowest standards of “bad Italian cinema”, and I gave him one star just because the dialogue is so fun! And what will we know when she finally looks into the attic (at the scene, which is one minute in the afternoon, and the next at night) ... well, I won't spoil it for those who really want to see, but let's just say not very "romance"!
