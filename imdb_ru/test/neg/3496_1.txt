After 2 hours of running, Crash reveals the emotional pain of his 10-odd characters when confronted with the sometimes blatant and sometimes hidden forms of racism that underlie American society. This is the emotional pain of one of her audiences, sitting in front and desperately trying to understand what films have become in our day. <br /> <br /> The era in which we live has become so complex. Not only do we reject modernism, even the fact that post-modernism seeks to destroy all these ideas, and in no way thanks to the inspiration of the great destructiveness, is not that it is not too enthusiastic to wave the ideas of these great "thinkers" with the flags of post-modern ideas. But I digress. This has nothing to do with what the film is about, but rather with what the film is about. <br /> <br /> Of course, it’s hard to make a living in Hollywood, which serves the market, which is so post-post-post all that cynicism has become more than just a motto in life. It has become part of everything we do, and part of everything we think about, like it or not. And so a new studio product is born! Indian films, which were once energetic and idealistic in their defiant experimentalism, now seem to be as adamant as Hollywood films that are sold in indie-film markets. An Indian film must be sold in Sundance before it becomes “recognized.” And so everything is simple. Even what makes up a good movie becomes so gloomy. Considering that in the past, filmmakers simply wanted to entertain people and tell a good story - and in these seemingly simplified attempts the greatest of films is born - now filmmakers have to make films that are good in the first place; films should make people think, should be sensible, should be provocative, raise questions, yadda, yadda, yadda. It all comes down to undermining the Hollywood cinematic system, but this subversive activity seems strangely similar to the formal similarity of Hollywood films, countless ways to differ, to essentially be the same product. <br /> <br /> And I haven't even started filming yet. Perhaps I have become too choosy about the films that I see these days. Maybe this is because of my basic need to have fun, and not, say, be tested when watching a movie. But damn, this movie is one big pile of crap. And this film pushes me away not only because it follows the guidebook “How to make a good movie a good 101” for the eloquent lines of T-characters and is so witty as if they are endowed with the speech of God; this raises questions about racism and opposition to racism in America; he has “touching” moments when everyone learns more about himself and more about other people; not to mention that as soon as you hear the ambient / new age soundtrack about women singing in high registers in foreign languages, you will realize that you are interested in all the above features. <br /> <br /> And something about the aforementioned clause - that it raises questions about pressing issues such as racism - infuriates me. As with all post-post-post-post-post films, this does not mean that you just need to get a message about this problem. Because our audience is very smart for this in our days in this post-post-post-post-post world. Our audience wants us to make them think, does not want us to express things so simplified (and then they will go to the existentialists crap and say), because life itself is not simplified. Ha ha ha What else is the usual exercise we are here, then the audience needs to think about the problems, not feed them. Good, good, and good. Thus, the film aims to beat the audience with these non-messages, and since they are not exactly messages, it is so definitely thin and thin meaning well, right? So we are amazed again and again by this well-written subtlety with eloquence of rhetorical prose. And, as if the irony is not cool enough, we have a ridiculous character, the only character who does not seem to take all this nonsense of discussing racism seriously, being "turned" into one of those annoyingly significant characters where he finds out something in the end, to give meaningful views and pauses, when viewers must “learn something about themselves”. Um, yes. How I wanted to see an incredibly racist film right after that person. <br /> <br /> If we talk about long nonsense, I would not argue with the film if it were not so bloated. self-conceit. The longing that forms the whole film was more like the whining of a white boy than Spike Lee's real anger. This is so, Tim Robbins and Sean Penn, the type who wants to wave flags about humanitarism, when the only thing they don’t understand is the flag that they wave is their leaky underwear. In addition, in the world of post-post-post-post, it has become so fashionable to be completely elusive. There is nothing more simple. In his best attempts to be really kind, provocative and, ultimately, a man, he didn’t become one, IMHO, just another indie crap from a director who wants to declare himself as a credible independent director. Now, at least, Hollywood is simpler and more sincere in its manipulations.
