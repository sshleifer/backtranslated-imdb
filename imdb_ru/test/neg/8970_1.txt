I will never, never forget to watch this show at the age of about 13 years. Even at a young age, I remember thinking: â€œThis is a Baywatch show of failures without the only thing that makes Baywatch tolerable. Girls in swimwear. Nevertheless, I was too small in those days to be the owner of the console in my house. Pacific Blue Peak was an episode in which a couple of gangster gangsters are going to hit someone with machine guns ... on bicycles !!! When I was thirteen years old, I never laughed so strongly at something that should be taken seriously. Even I knew that the task of getting out and acquiring Uzis (for murder) is a task that should never be solved before lending someone a car for a day. This was the defining moment of this show. Simple crimes and situations created with the help of hacker letters so that the unnoticed hero of the world in the fight against crime The Bike Cop can take care of them. Not getting much dumber.
