Almost everything in this film is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take, for example, Mike Myers. He got to the point that you understand that his joke has not changed since the days of SNL, more than ten years ago. He makes the same joking jokes with a stream of consciousness and the same voices. His Cat is painfully unfunny. He tries his best. He is some strange type A comedian, not a cool cat he should be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The kits are incredibly ugly - and, obviously, a waste of millions of dollars. (Cardboard cutouts for the background buildings would make more sense than building the whole area and main street.) Alec Balvin tries to make a funny impression of the Great Santini, but in the end he looks and sounds incoherent. There is even an inappropriate moment for Paris Hilton’s fake celebrity cheesecake - which is remembered simply because it must be Dr. Seuss's story. Avoid this movie at all costs, guys. This is not even an interesting train wreck. (I hope that they will make Horton Hers “Who is” with Robin Williams. Then we will have a trilogy about a comedy film with a poor savior-comedian director.)
