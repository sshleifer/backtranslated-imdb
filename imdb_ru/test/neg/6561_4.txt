This film, the weakest of Star Trek's “old” filming films, suffers from a terrible scenario and obvious budgetary constraints, especially in the wrongly crafted finale. There are bones of a good movie here, and Shatner's directorial work is not as bad as it usually is, but the characters end up saying and acting differently from the previous 3 films. Lawrence Lukinbull is convincing as a Vulcan renegade with mysterious and mystical powers to influence people, and these abilities are responsible for some of the best scenes, especially Deforest Kelly, who starred as McCoy "Bones" in his second film. However, no matter how good these scenes are, they ultimately do not advance the plot, and ultimately feel more distracting. The sheer number of points from the ever-reliable Goldsmith and some funny scenes in Yosemite between the three main ones are not enough to cover the gaping chasms in the plot, and frankly awkward attempts at humor serve only to push even peaceful travelers away. In general, a huge number of opportunities that can not be realized, has its moments. Do not miss the pool table in the bar fight scene ...
