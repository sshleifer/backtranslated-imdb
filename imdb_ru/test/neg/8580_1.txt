A delightful but weak James Bond film, mainly because both the hero (Bond) and the villain (Blofeld) are seriously mistaken. Lazenby is too big and innocent to play Bond. He looks and behaves like a good-natured but dumb friend in a police action movie. The director and writer are trying to prove their credibility, but his statement about such lines as “Royal Baluga, north of ...” is simply ineffective in asserting him as this worldly and courteous fraudster. Savalas doesn't do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior are more suited to the gangster. The best characters of the film are Tracy and her father. But the performances of those actors, when they share the screen with Lazenby, only emphasize his shortcomings as an actor. This film is too long (140 minutes) for a Bond movie and offers no excitement until Bond escapes from the mountain, where it begins to rise. This film tries hard, but fails. There are many elements of Bondi, and the climate battle is top notch, but I always feel that something is missing when I watch this one.
