Well, if you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and like to mock movies, then you will have a lot of fun with it. Otherwise it may be TOO painful to see. <br /> <br /> Plot: The obsessed cryptozoologist steals a huge cruise box with a chupacabra on a cruise ship (obviously, you don’t need to proclaim it at customs or even mention that it brings on board a live animal - " equipment, air holes - just an accident "). A few probes that he hired to open the box, believing that he paid a lot of money, maybe there is something that can be stolen. As soon as the WOODEN CREATE opens, the Chupacabra bursts inside the STEEL BARS and becomes infuriated. <br /> <br /> Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> Coincidentally, Marshall (I guess the American Marshall since he was in the Gulf War, and not just some guy named Marshall) is on board, investigating some of the missing money from the safe of the ship. He poses as a seller of insurance services ("Lady, I am the best insurance you have ..."). Other glittering characters include the captain (John Rees-Davies, and unfortunately his dignity is the first victim of the film), his daughter is a Tae-Bo instructor (Sniker - Tae-bo), a pesky old stuck lady with a tiny dog ​​who you should feed the cat (guess what it is eating ...?) and the incredibly unpleasant gigolo, which could be believable in a film made in 1964, and not in a later one. Most of the acting was really bad, and the characters were just so that you could laugh hysterically when they died. <br /> <br /> In general - screaming is terrible. Poor on many levels. BAD BAD BAD. What kind??? The bullets don't even make the Chupacabra flinch, but Bimbo Tae-cho can hit him and scare him away. Hey, sci-fi channel, do you desperately need scripts or what?
