I'm not a very big fan of Abbott & Costello (although I really like "Who's On First"), and, frankly, there wasn’t that much that would inspire me to see their work. It was not very bad. He had some funny scenes, and in fact a very convincing giant, played by Buddy Baer, ​​but for some reason, given the fame of the duet and the respect they usually spend, I have to say I expected more. In the course of the story, the couple stumbles upon a job of looking after the children, and while reading Jack and the beanstalk as a bedtime story (when the child reads her Costello), Jack Costello falls asleep and dreams of himself. The story has a sort of “The Wizard of Oz” in which characters in a dream are equivalents of Jack’s real acquaintances, and the film opens in black and white and changes in color during the sequence of dreams. The scenes of the struggle between Jack and the giant and the dance scene between Jack and Polly (Dorothy Ford) are some of the fun parts of the film. Polly, of course, also leads to one of the film's questions - what happened to her? Jack and the gang obviously left her in the giant's castle! I know - it was just a dream, so who cares. Nevertheless, I thought. There were also some pretty songs and dances. My 4-year-old girl giggled a bit during this, so she could appreciate a bit of humor. I found this to be an acceptable time, but certainly not something that would convince you of Abbott and Costello as comic geniuses. 4/10
