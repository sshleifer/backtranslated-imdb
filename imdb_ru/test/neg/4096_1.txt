Well, for this abomination of the film, I did not expect anything good. I find annoying Steve Carell, and Bruce Almighty was pretty good, but there is absolutely no reason to continue. Somehow, this film was even below my expectations, even when I didn’t have them. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember the Disney film "Noah with Tony Danza"? Well, let's just say that Evan Almighty completely ripped him off in too many ways for the film to remain justified. In fact, Evan Almighty had an EXACT schema of the same plot as Noah, with the exception of a few technical details, it was nothing more than an exact copy of a much superior film that was actually ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Another thing, did someone get tired of Wanda Sykes' stupid, unfunny, extra lines that were literally in every scene? It was completely ridiculous and just dragged the film more and more. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I basically already saw the movie ten years earlier (Noah), Evan Almighty should be the most predictable movie I have ever seen. During the first five minutes, I figured out the entire film from beginning to end and finally realized that he was tearing Noah to the left and right. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you’re a little unsure whether you want to see Evan Almighty and are already tired of the fact that John Hill plays the same role in every film he stars in, he likes Bruce Almighty, and I don't want to watch a predictable, dry, unfunny movie with Steve Carell trying to act like Jim Carrey, then please don't watch this piece of garbage.
