Imagine the island of Gilligan, located in the African desert in our time. Add people who are not so close to the skipper or Marianne - and enough angst to fill the office of the German psychiatrist. Add a story that can only be interesting sporadically and literary parallelism, which never digs deep enough to really satisfy. A season with a truly grim theme that has been exploited since the first travelers in the world were very, very lost. <br /> <br /> If “The King Is Alive” were not the product of the ruling kings of Dogme 95, would this film attract so much attention? Dogme 95 is Hollywood, and Danish modern is Rococo. Being a by-product of digital technology, this Scandinavian movement seeks — quite dogmatically — to get rid of the artificiality of filmmaking, using more natural elements and getting back to the point of storytelling. PEARL HARBOR, for example, is the antichrist of Dogma. <br /> <br /> The director / coauthor of the Christian Levring saga reflects on interpersonal relationships and human nature when it comes under fire in a life-threatening situation. Eleven people on a bus traveling through the sand dunes of Namibia suddenly find themselves stranded in the ruins of an abandoned city. A local African who does not speak his language serves as an observer and narrator (whose ideas are among the most piercing in the film). When the strongest go on a five-day walk to the nearest village, the rest are left behind, surviving on dents in canned carrots and bypassing their likely future as a Chow Vulture. Former thespian Henry decides that this rather unattractive team needs sabotage, and writes by hand KING LEAR. He assigns roles, and the group spends many days studying the lines and rehearsing, trying to divert their attention from the seemingly inevitable. <br /> <br /> Gradually, the cast begins to lose him, and the wildness of his character? "Or, as William Golding would say, human nature" begins to float. If you have ever seen The Lord of the Flies, you know that all this can become ugly, that being in a lifeboat can even turn Mother Teresa into the PMSing Calcutta thermagants. <br /> <br /> The film was shot using the international ensemble of American, British, French and South African actors, who, according to Dogma, develop themselves and their roles quite organically. The king was also shot in chronological order, adding a sense of realism to the ever-increasing despair of his characters. After up to three hand-held cameras were shot in digital format, the results were transferred to 35 mm film. <br /> <br /> The most impressive performance comes from Jennifer Jason Lee, who plays boho-style pop-pie, trying to strengthen the spirit of the band in all respects she can. Henry (David Bradley) - another well-played character, whose passion for the work of his life ultimately saves the gang from complete despair. It is hard to feel sorry for other cruel wives and their courageous husbands, the stern old womanizer, the gloomy French intellectuals, the rich men who have more important places than those who left us in the desert of Namibia. Beckett may hate this question, but why does this group ride the bus together through distant Africa? Life-threatening incidence! Perfect despair in graphic detail! Steadily tedious pace! Enjoy.
