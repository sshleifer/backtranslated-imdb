On paper, it looks like a good movie. Michael Kane plays a tough and ruthless boxing promoter whose son is preparing to destroy titles. It is a pity that when a story is transferred from paper to my TV screen, it loses a certain amount of everything. I was hoping that we would be emulated by his final role in GET CARTER, and as the film progresses, he seems to acquire the qualities of a hard thriller with hard revenge, but the whole tone of the film jumps so much that you will be confused as to which It tries to match the genre. For example, Kane (whom you can't believe as Billy "Shiner" Simpson, he is just Michael Kane) has a line of laughter when he calls someone "Hattie Jacques," and then, in a supposedly ridiculous moment, his minions break someone's hand Oh, how I laughed. I mean, he should make him laugh as he plays on the screen, doesn't he? But it seems to be at odds with the way the rest of the film unfolds. <br /> <br /> It’s obvious that director John Irwin doesn’t know which approach to use in Scott Cherry’s script. Irwin is not a bad director and is well known for his war films, such as DOGS OF WAR and HAMBURGER HILM, but he is not well suited for this type of violent drama, and no one can help but feel that he is somewhat intimidated by a living legend like Kane. . Kane has the impression that he is just doing it for the money, and well-known second-person roles, such as Landua and Cranham, are basically just cameos that anybody can play.
