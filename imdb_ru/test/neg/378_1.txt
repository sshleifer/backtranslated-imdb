I love the first and third Beastmasters, but this one was an abomination. It was almost as bad as The Never Ending Story 3, for the same reasons. They captured the fascinating fantasy world of barbarian tribes, farmers' villages, witches, supernatural beings and the cult of religious fanatics using the pyramid; and thought it would be ridiculous to mix in our materialistic world of pop culture rock and roll, sushi (I think that's what it was) and luxury sports cars. These two worlds do not belong to each other. I do not want to see a bunch of ancient, barbaric-looking people dancing to some rock song on the radio in the car. I have a sense of humor, but this is just silly. This is what Hollywood does with good science fiction movies when they run out of ideas. Don't give up, the Eye of Brax is much, much better. The one I gave is 10. This one, Portal of Time, I give 1. Believe me, I do not always give such extremely high or low marks. I'm just inclined to comment only on such films.
