The film itself is not bad ... until you see the original Hitch (2005) film with Will Smith in the lead role. The film is a direct copy, and even the dialog boxes for most of the film are simply translated from English to Hindi! The plot in the original tightly executed. The Hindi version cannot interest viewers. It seems that David Dhavanâ€™s comedy rolls over when Govinda shouts hysterically all the time ... sometimes more time is spent on understanding the reason for this than on plot. :) <br /> <br /> If you know English, which I suppose you know, considering you're reading this, look at the Hollywood original. At the very least, see "Hitch" if you watched Partner to be able to compare. This is the least that we can do to support creative geniuses, whose work, I feel sad, shamelessly raised by "inspired" people, such as David Dhavan.
