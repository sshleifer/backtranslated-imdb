There is nothing like the Oscar Wilde comedy, and this film is not like a comedy. Melodrama works from stage to stage, and the comedy is completely absent. In the original story, humor comes from Americans who forget the ghostly traditions of Canterville Chase. The American father even offers some oil to the ghost to calm the creaking chains. To read a book!
