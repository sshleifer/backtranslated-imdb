I bought this movie, hoping that it would be another great toy killer movie. I'm a big fan of the Kids Game series and hoped to see the same thing here. Boy, I was wrong. Most of the film was not a bit scary, plus the only time we really see Pinocchio "alive" is the last few scenes of the film. The little girl in the film, her acting is so bad that it is almost ridiculous. Plus, the ending never showed what happened to the puppet or what made them put the little girl in a shelter or wherever she was at the end of the movie. So, in my opinion, this film - the worst of the genres of "killer toys". If you want a good series of killer toys, stick to the Child's Play franchise. Pinocchio's revenge is a waste of money and time.
