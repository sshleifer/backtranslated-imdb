Overall, I would call this a disappointing presentation. He is trying to use the old approach of the Anthology of Horror, but fails miserably. The game was bad, like the stories. Any skin shown in the film was clearly random, just to attract R-rating for sex. Typically, I think, but, nevertheless, bad. Take your 5 dollars and take the REAL film instead!
