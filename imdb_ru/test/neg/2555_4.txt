I hated the woman who played the mother. I wanted her to shut up. She had a strange manner of speaking, and the lines that she was given to read did not make her better. I had no idea why the men of the city so took with them to cause all these problems, except that in a city inhabited by men, she seemed to be the only woman over ten and under sixty. Even after a terrible tragedy, her voice was devoid of human emotions; she seemed unable to understand the events of her life. She spoke her lines with the same emotion, regardless of whether she said “I love you,” “I hate you,” “the bank shuts off,” “my dress is on fire.” Was it actually filmed in Ireland? The sun shone throughout the film, and the characters seemed surprised by the rain at harvest. I lived in Ireland in the summer of 2002, the wettest summer of a century. Almost everything was collected. If farmers in Ireland could only harvest in long dry areas, the country would suffer from hunger hundreds of years ago. It seems that there was not a lot of money to make a film. Black-and-white memories looked like they were being taken from CCTV cameras that can be obtained at Sam's club.
