The album title of the best hits Bad Company is called "10 From 6" You could just turn on this album and turn off the sound in this movie. Most of the songs played in the film were from this album. I assume that old people in the 1970s are probably tired of all the works of the period made around 1930s and 1940s. This is how I feel about films made in the 1970s. The characters in the film looked like they were auditioning for Danny Terrio. Why should films exaggerate the 1970s? The only good period I liked was Freaks and Geeks. They cut this television show. It was just like high school when I was there in 1980. I was old enough to remember the 70s, and not a single small city was like that. It was completely young. There were no reactionaries talking about hippies and the inner city of Philly. It was more than the 70s, which I remember in my childhood. This film was very boring and gentle. Sometimes I fell asleep. I do not know why the actor who acted during the 70s appeared in this. He probably tried to give it some confidence. Walken didn't even show up until the second half. I guess the only true thing about the movie was the "baby boomers" were / are a spoiled party. All the children in the film were spoiled children. I don't know what they had against their father.
