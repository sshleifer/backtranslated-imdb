There is potential with “Tell Anyone.” Curious and intriguing plot, and the French take a very American story. But for me, the possibilities were not used here. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I liked some aspects of this film, there were three significant flaws that led him to four out of ten. <br /> <br /> First, this is the silly, ordinary mystery of murder. Particularly contrived murder, she wrote or Bergerac. Being French does not remove this problem - it is just silly and in French at the same time. He is full of implausible coincidences. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the transition from the US to France seems to have chronically failed. This French doctor is hanging out in the "streets" of the French city with his new "buddies" and their crazy SUVs ... and there are car chases ... <br /> <br /> But thirdly and mostly it’s too damn long . For me, the film should have a good reason for it to take more than 90 minutes, and more than two hours requires serious justification. It once was not.
