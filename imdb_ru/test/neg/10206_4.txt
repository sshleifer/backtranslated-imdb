“No Holds Barred” is a movie you were nine or ten years old in, and it was Arnold Schwarzenegger’s coolest movie. But then when you grow up and look at it, you feel embarrassed that you are so trusting that you like it. You feel deceived, confused and stupid. If you have a little brother and you show it to him, and he tells you that he is gay, give him a five and take him to a striptease for his eleventh birthday.
