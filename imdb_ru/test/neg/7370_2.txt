It is really a shame to see so many talented people involved in what turns out to be a very waste of talent. The plot is clich√©. The direction is too shy, and the characters are almost caricatures. One of the most disappointing aspects of this film is the performance of Gerard Depardieu in the English version (this film was shot in French and English at the same time). Despite the fact that he is one of the best actors in the film, he shows the worst performance of all. I must say that Bianca Gervais is very close ... <br /> <br /> On a more positive note, I have to say that newcomer Juliette Gosselin has amazing performance in both versions. Unfortunately, this is the only good thing I remember about this movie ... <br /> <br /> By the way, I have to apologize for my not very good English ...
