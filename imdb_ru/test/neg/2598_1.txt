I have not seen many episodes of “The Family Guy”, and I am sure that in the future I will not see too many of them. Some people say that comparing this show with The Simpsons is unfair. I’m absolutely sure that this show wouldn’t exist if “The Simpsons” did not appear first, and I’m absolutely sure that I want to be “The Simpsons” so much. I don't understand what's funny about this show. In the episodes that I watched, I understood where they WANT me to laugh, I understand that someone thinks that the joke has just been told, but the joke is not funny. I think the whole show is lazy: the name, the “jokes”, the complete lack of inspiration everywhere. <br /> <br /> The best television shows (animated or not) are created as follows: the script is written, it goes through several rewrites, removes what does not work, appears inspiration, adds good, rewrites a lot, and then removes it. <br /> <br /> I present the Family Guy Episode to be created as follows: the script is written and shot.
