This show had a promising start as a sort of opposite of Ocean 11, but it turned into a superficial presentation of T & A. In fact, according to my younger brother, this is the only good part of the show. <br /> <br /> The first season was definitely the best, it was new, and interesting things just went down. The only point of redemption in this show is James Caan. The rest of the actors are not thrilled. Characters lack depth, and they seem incredibly selfish and generally unattractive people. <br /> <br /> According to a friend, "Las Vegas is like Baywaych in a casino." In my opinion, it was a generous way, Baywatch was much better and much more realistic.
