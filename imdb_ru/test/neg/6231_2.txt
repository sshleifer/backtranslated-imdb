I love most of the films of Jet Li (with the exception of “Romeo Must Die”), and I bought this film in a VERY cheap package with “The Master” and “Twin Warriors”. While the Twin Warriors were very impressive, and I was completely intrigued by this, and the master was a little “karate kid”, but also enjoyable, I thought this movie was terrible. I don’t just say this because I’m used to the best films. I say it was almost there with Kazam. The battle scenes were terrible (blurry cameras and no real battles), and the plot was your typical “stupid kung fu plot”. If you have such a stupid plot (see “A man turns into a woman to become omnipotent, and then falls in love with Jet Li”), you are better off fighting it. If you are looking for an original HK Jet Li movie, I suggest you rent a "Shaolin Temple 2" (aka "Children from Shaolin").
