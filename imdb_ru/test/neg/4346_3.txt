Not “confusing” in the sense that “Gee, this film is really complex, and therefore difficult to follow!” But it is confusing that “Gee, this film really has no idea what it does! “<br /> <br />“ The dream of a warrior ”is a collaboration between Hong Kong and South Korea, but all this is complete nonsense. A film about parallel universes mixed with time travel mixed with a love story mixed with stupidity. <br /> <br /> In the film there is a concept that amazes imagination. Again, it is not incomprehensible to the mind, because it is so large and complex, but stunning in the sense that it is so ridiculous, and no one can imagine that anyone has ever invented such a terrible premise for the beginning. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the DREAM OF WARRIOR makes sense, and this is because the entire movie should never have been made. This is pretty awful. The only saving grace is an actress who plays a warrior (and not a woman). <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
