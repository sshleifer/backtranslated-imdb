What a waste of precious time! My 5-year-old daughter brought this house from my mother's house, and we watched it with the whole family. None of us liked it. This pitiful little film, full of glaring inconsistencies, frank Christian themes and the terrible quality of the film, is not worth even a challenge. It was a bit like a bad school drama in a movie. How sad to see how talented actors (Chris Atkins, Gary Busey and his company) wander along this trite and tasteless storyline. The only good thing I can say about this film is that the dog is cute. The film was supposed to go straight to the pound. Avoid this movie - your time is better spent on the fact that the paint has dried.
