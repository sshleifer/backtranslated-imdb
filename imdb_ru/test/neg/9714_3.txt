The only reason I watched this little-known Irish film was whether Mike Myers could play a normal drama character. Well, he could, and his game was pretty good, but unfortunately, this is probably the only thing I can say about this movie. At the beginning of the film, it tells about the life of the twelve-year-old orphan Mickey, who lives with her brother and sister with their somewhat eccentric grandmother. Despite some strong expressions, it looks like a family film, but after a while it becomes clear that Meteor Pete is hardly suitable for the drama of young viewers. And the worst thing is that this is a drama with such a ridiculous and even completely implausible plot. One ridiculous storyline turns into another, and all the time there is not much point in the events on the screen. I suppose when life drama needs a meteor or something else that looks like even more ridiculous spiritual content, this is a really bad sign. Characters are not much better than the story. Despite all his troubles, young Mickey is by no means a cute character, but obviously, somehow, we had to take care of him and even feel strong sympathy for him. Does not work The same with other characters. They are basically as ridiculous as the story with the title character (although he was not the main character) as the only bright spot. By the end of the film, I still had hope that there was something behind all this incredibility and absurdity. Unfortunately, even if the author had such intentions (and I am sure that he had) in the film, they are hidden and almost imperceptible under such a strange scenario. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10. Those of you who are interested in seeing Mike Myers as a drama actor can watch Pete's Meteor for this reason, but the rest of the audience will most likely be greatly disappointed.
