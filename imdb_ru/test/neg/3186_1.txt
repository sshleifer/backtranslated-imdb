This is one of the comedy comedies filled with stars, which can a) be hysterical or b) want you to go to the dentist to pull out all your teeth instead. Unfortunately, One Night at McCool's is a classic b. <br /> <br /> Goldie Hawn recently commented on “Town and Country” that a big problem in Hollywood is that they start by hiring actors and making a deal. until the script is complete. You have to understand that they not only entered this picture without a complete script, but also daily mutilated it. Maybe we need to send postcards and letters to the heads of all the studios who say: "This is a script, stupid." <br /> <br /> This is also one of those films in which you feel sorry for the actors most of the time. They try their best to make it all seem hysterical, but they know that most of this will be accompanied not by a belly laugh, but by the sounds of crickets you can hear in a quiet theater. <br /> Is this a complete disaster? Not really. Smiles appear along the way, mainly due to the efforts of the actors. I probably would have left the theater thinking, “Eh. All was good". So why is the indisputable hostile tone in my review? The ending. If, as already noted, the rest of the film is just a setup for the final, then it skips spectacularly. I really would like to talk specifically about this, but I hate people who give out too much (even in a warning). Suffice it to say that as soon as you see John Goodman behind the inclined Paul Reiser (nothing is given here. It's in the trailer), get out of the theater and go out, thinking: “Eh. It was good.

And you will be shocked that people really will laugh at this mess. <br /> <br /> If you liked" Something about Mary "or" Meet the Parents "( both great movies), don't worry about watching this movie. Go take care of those teeth.
