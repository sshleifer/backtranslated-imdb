All this show is one and the same plot. Kushko (spelling?) Risks to lose school, he needs to go through to become emperor. He needs to learn something that he thinks is stupid, then he uses it / learns more about it and realizes that it is not so stupid. Yezma, posing as director, is trying to turn Kushko into an animal to stop him. Every episode. <br /> <br /> Anecdotes from the film are copied (Eesmaâ€™s incredibly complicated plans, Kushko constantly breaks the 4th wall, squirrels.) They should try to hire several writers. <br /> <br /> 2/10
