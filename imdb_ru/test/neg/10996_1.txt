Bad editing, bad production values, poor continuity, implausible, bad dialogues ... these films are bad, bad, bad. However, if you want the movie to be fun (a la MST3000), this is your movie. I would not advise you to spend a lot of money on this, but if you watch this film, make sure that there are many witty like-minded people in it.
