Once I thought to myself ... what is the worst thing that can happen today? I answered myself simple: “Oh, this has already happened. I rented Killjoy / Killjoy 2 "on DVD. Well what can I say? The budget was not big enough to rent a police uniform, the film cut out sex scenes and death scenes. I remember one funny line, and the game is much worse than the first. There seems to be no lighting on the “set” (somewhere in the forest), and the killer clown known as Killjoy (who makes Leprechaun look like an Exorcist) is less than impressive. This time he is not depicted by Angel Vargas and is completely transformed as a character from a crazy annoying clown into another crazy annoying clown who says a lot of “CHILD”. Somewhere between Freddy Krueger and a blade of grass ... this version of Killjoy lies. Somewhere between a pile of dirt and a pile of dirt lies Killjoy 2. This is badly underestimated. This film has no redemptive qualities, except the song at the very end above the captions ... which, at a minimum, gives some pleasure. Killjoy 2 is not even a film, but an exercise for tension. Killjoy 1 is good enough to be considered the worst movie I've ever seen. Minor spoiler ######### Let me describe one of the supernatural murder scenes. The girl is locked in some kind of wooden shed (maybe in the outhouse?) When Killjoy looks through the hole. He has small knocking teeth (for example, those that you can buy from the Gifts of Spencer), and he does something with them (maybe they get them?!). Then he holds them in his hands and utters a terrible line (which cannot be written in IMDB). From what I understood from this scene (not from what was shown in the film), the teeth went to the extension and killed the girl in some interesting, but not shown way, and then returned to Killjoy. If I were these teeth, I would run. Run far away from Killjoy so that he can never again get me. Killjoy 2, hopefully the last Killjoy that we have to go through. Even if a fan of films, as others say, is very bad, I think that this “film” could unite humanity and create world peace, if it were promised that this film and everything that reminds us of it will be destroyed . I give 2/10 - simply because the creators managed to make the pictures move.
