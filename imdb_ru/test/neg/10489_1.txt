I am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s - films so funny and stupid that they are good for laughing. So, naturally, I chose this film, especially because with John Agar it was almost guaranteed to be bad. Unfortunately, while it was a bad film, it was the worst type of bad film - boring outside of faith and unfunny. At least with stupid and overly bad movies, you can laugh at horrible monsters and horrible directors and actions. Here you will never see so many monsters (mainly because of the darkness of the print), and the acting, although bad, lower-energy, bad ... sluggish and boring. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the fact that some young people go to the Satanic Hollow to the neck. Well, given the name of the place, it is not surprising when they are later torn to pieces! Do ... don't joke with Satan's Hollow !! Well, there are reports of a collapsing object from the sky, so what do teens do? Yes, having a dance party is a very, very, very slow dance party where children almost dance in slow motion. So the Sheriff (Agar) and his people must ensure that teenagers can dance in the world without fear of chewing. <br /> <br /> As for the monster, this is some guy in a gorilla costume with a stupid mask - a bit like a monster in ROBOT MONSTER. Not quite original and not quite high-tech. To make matters worse, he makes a snorting noise and moves very, very slowly - so slowly that even the most obese teenager can easily get away from him! The way he manages to kill many times, I do not understand. <br /> <br /> All in all, too boring to be liked - even if you're a fan of a lousy movie.
