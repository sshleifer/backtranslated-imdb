I thought this movie would be completely different than just another teen slasher. Well, I was completely wrong. From the toilet seat comes a liquid nun and something really strange. I know that Spanish culture is a bit different and their films, too, but I did not expect to see a fake Hollywood film. They certainly faked it pretty well though. Why did they make the film without any new aspects? It's just boring, and it was done completely without any imagination. <br /> <br /> I thought that having a nun as a bad guy in a movie would be something really original. It turned out that this is a teenager slasher. If this were done ten years ago, it would be something new. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie to anyone, but it certainly has some comedic value! In some moments it looks like a terrible parody.
