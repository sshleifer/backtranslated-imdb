A young maid, who is not associated with women of her own age and who is looked at by a gentleman from the pension complex, invites a clearly dumb young man to her apartment on a rainy day. Nervous and overly polite to hide his sexual insecurity, she is most pleased when the boy comes home to her guest bedroom ... but not so happy when he begins to lean out of the window at night. Sandy Dennis is not an unhappy actress, but why these sad roles attracted her, I think we will never know. Based on the book of Richard Miles, and as far from commercial drama as possible, this dark material attracted not only Dennis, but also director Robert Altman (whose work is static at best). The narrative seems almost a change in the gender of "The Collector", a feature that may have sold the rights to the film, but which does not turn out to be a good idea cinematically. Even the best sequence of the film (Dennis is looking for a prostitute to satisfy his captive) was not entirely successful, because Sandy behaves like a sick and indignant (whose idea was it?). Michael Burns is pretty good as a child who uses this scruffy, talkative woman only for his comfortable dig, but Altman is too shy with a lot of strategically placed towels and flesh-colored (Altman was clearly not ready for a mature picture with adult themes at the moment ). Sandy Dennis has some very nice scenes; she does not mindlessly chat here, she thinks before speaking, and she is anxiously careful in her actions. Unfortunately, the role itself is a bummer, with an apparent slide to mental impairment, which seems to be happening off-screen. So the harsh finale is crazy, and the overall results are cool. * 1/2 of ****
