I am a big fan of prison dramas, which is reflected in the fact that OZ is my favorite American TV show. I assume that the attraction lies in complacent voyeurism when you want to see how bad things happen to the bottoms of bad people, but I found Don Siegel's RIOT IN CELL BLOCK 11 rather disappointing. Well, I knew that since it was made in 1954, there would be no bad words, graphic shankings and gang rape in it, but even in this case it is a rather weak film compared to the prison image in the early films, such as "EACH DAWN I DIE and WHITE HEAT". The problem is the preaching tone of the film with rebellion leader Dunn, which is something of a prison reformer. Yes, it sounds ridiculous, as he is a cruel antihero, and not some sluggish, tortuous embrace of a tree does good for a salary, but this is what he is in essence, he wants to see the rehabilitation of prisoners to reunite with society suffer. There is also the problem of making film B with such radical themes (rather ironically, that Siegel would later do DIRTY HARRY, where the only good culprit is dead), and this is not very good with Emil Meyer as the overseer. especially annoying in his performance. as i said disappointing movie
