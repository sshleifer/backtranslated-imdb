First viewing 17.03.2002 - 2 out of 10 (director Mario Pinzauti): Stupid, sexy master and slave, who has too many intimate relationships. This film seemed to care more about sex than about the plot, and seemed to be working on the plot about sex. The ridiculous duplication of the original Italian language in the version that I looked at with a funny ending, where an attempt is made to give an anti-brunt (or should I say one line). What a waste of time for all who follow this garbage.
