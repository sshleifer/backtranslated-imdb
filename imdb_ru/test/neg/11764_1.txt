If you are looking for an exact image of Che Guevara, a Cuban revolutionary who helped Fidel Castro in his struggle for power, you had better read the history of Cuba or even enter his name in the search engine (you are, after all, on the Internet). <br /> <br /> But whatever you do, DO NOT LOOK "WHAT!" <br /> <br /> Of course, if you just want to laugh. <br /> <br /> All reviewers of that time (and movie lovers) gave "Che!" their vote for the worst film of the decade. And not surprising; have you seen this parody? His facts are insignificant at best, Sharif is even unconvincing as a corpse and as an imitation of Fidel Katsro Palans .... <br /> <br /> As I said, if you want to laugh. /> It's like watching a co-production between The Learning Channel and Mad Magazine. <br /> <br /> One star. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Palance can make W. K. Fields?
