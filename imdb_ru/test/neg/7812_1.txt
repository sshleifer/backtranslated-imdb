Honestly, I could not watch this movie until the very end, so I have no idea if it will suddenly become better in half of the movie. But the first 30 minutes or so is one of the worst I have seen lately. Children under the age of twelve may enjoy the poorly written, acting, and directed humor of the farce, but adults who fully control all their abilities should stay away from this abomination.
