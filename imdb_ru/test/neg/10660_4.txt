I do not like Himesh Reshamia. I don't like his singing either. But his songs - craze in India, especially among ordinary people. Now that he risked becoming an actor ?? it was a big joke! What courage he has to shake as much as he can in his prime time. I never wanted to see this movie. But one thing changed that. The film becomes a super hit! After 2 weeks, Aap Ka Ka Sarur raked box office cash in 14 crores ?? compared to Apne, who collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks. Can I sit through Abne and the absurd Shivaji Rajnikanta ?? Should I give this film also an attempt to understand what this film has, what made it such a big hit? The story of a real singer Himesh Reshamia (HR), who went to Germany for a concert and fell in love with Ria (Hansiku Motwani). German lawyer Ruby (Mallika Sherawat) loves Himesh. Now Khimesh is arrested for murder. Himesh’s mission (in the last 40 minutes) after he escaped from prison is to prove himself innocent and find the real killer. <br /> <br /> Let me say that Kimesh has nothing to become a hero. He tries, but fails. He is pathetic. I thought that could make a movie click so much? Let me find something positive. <br /> <br /> First of all, the script’s saving grace is until Khimesh escapes from prison. (But after this the nose of the film plunges into intolerable idiotic frames) Secondly, the songs of this film are good, catchy, mean numbers. Third, Mallika Sherawat ?? she looks great and behaves well, like a second lady. I can imagine Mallika's fans coming to see the movie just for her. Fourthly, is the cinematography of the film pleasant ?? especially German locales, it is a treat for the eyes. Fifthly, the main part of the story is the love story between Himesh and Ria. with clichéd dialogues, which are probably related to the young crowd. Sixth, the director Prashant Chadha did a decent job, as much as possible covering Himesha’s pretentious acting abilities with frames in which Hemesh doesn’t need to act much. <br /> <br /> Heroine Khansika Motvani looks like a low-budget film hero. Raj Babbar wasted in a small role. In general, the film is below average. <br /> <br /> I was thinking about the movie ?? What if the same movie script was made with Salmaan as the main character. I think that would be much better. Maybe then I would give a film 6 out of 10. But now ?? (Stars 4.5 out of 10)
