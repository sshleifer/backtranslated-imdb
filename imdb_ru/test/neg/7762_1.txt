Week after week, these women just sweep all the men with their feet. Become a real one. None of these women are "knockouts." Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) looks like a woman picked up men! At 45 in the morning before the bar closes, after their vision and standards were equally violated by ten or eleven martinis. And yet she is the queen bee, the super-sexy killer of men. The remaining three are not much better. And their constant obscene comments ... not to mention the fact that they jump out of bed with strange men and never get sick. This show is pathetic and creepy. I do not think that any man would be terribly attracted by any of these women, even if he jumped out of Viagra, like Tick So, being on the shore.
