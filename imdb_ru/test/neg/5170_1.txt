There is no doubt that the Kokoda Trail depicts a truly great event in Australian military history - the brave defense of Australia against the brutal barbarian Japanese army. However, this film does not take into account the history of “fuzzy wuzzi” or the natives of New Guinea. that the Australians helped them carry out military operations there. The film is also unable to give a credible report about the Australian soldier and his behavior in this case. It looks more like an ignorant modern view of what it was like. <br /> <br /> Again, the Australian film industry was unable to give this important chapter in Australian history — the film it deserves. This is a worst-case film with arbitrary cinematography, bad script and dialogue, without character development and clichés in the jungle. <br /> <br /> This does not give the viewer meaningful views, except for the Japanese army, ruthless and cruel killers of a poorly equipped and poorly trained group of Australians fighting in the jungle. <br /> <br /> The film failed, like most Australian films, in order to attract a significant Australian audience, in fact they remained in the crowd. <br /> I am not going to join the usual local trash, saying that it is great because it is an Australian film. I say: either do an excellent job, or just leave it to someone who knows how. This government-sponsored film is another setback for Australia’s rich and spoiled rich children. <br /> <br /> I give him zero stars, because this is an insult to the descendants of these truly great Australians and their huge sacrifice. What a shameful waste and disrespect, and I know that this review will cause more negative for the Movie Show team and most reviewers, but I have the right to my opinion, and this is what the Australians fought for OUR FREEDOM, and this includes freedom of speech and the right to express opinion.
