Tamara Anderson and her family are moving again, as her painter's wandering father pursues her next landscape. Fifteen years old, she is in a rebellious stage. Already angry with her father for frequent travels, her anger intensifies when her mother suddenly goes to a tuberculosis sanatorium. The absence of her mother causes Tamara to lash out at her father and seek solace in religion, the boy next door, Rusty, and the spirit of a dead teenager who lived in her rented house. <br /> <br /> History is modest because of wine. It is strange, and even during his emotional scenes there is no tension. Actors depicting parents are fine. Alberta Watson is incredibly charismatic as a sick mother, and Maria Rikossa is especially effective as the mother of a dead teenager who is attacked by guilt. But Katie Boland, like Tamara, is too amateur to carry the film. The dialogue is very natural, and Boland cannot carry it out. She has her own moments, and when she hits them, she can be good, but there were too many times when she came out awkwardly. You can see how she thinks: “Well, this is my line, and that is the face that I have to do,” and not respond to other actors. She is not the only Kevin Zegers in the role of Rusty and Megan Park, as his sister Brenda also suffers from inaccurate delivery, but at least they have fewer scenes. <br /> <br /> If done correctly, the script could make her a touching film. And it has moments, but most of it is bogged down with amateur leadership and flat directing.
