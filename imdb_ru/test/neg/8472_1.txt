I have been in this horrible film for almost ninety minutes waiting for some revelation about dance, spirit, inspiration, or something, and surrendered! What prompted the filmmakers to do this? This is an elderly woman with a limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing else. To fill the story without meaning, we get something about other people in her captivity, her help to donkeys and, of course, her ten cats! I do not see this movie. And they no longer have anything in common with anyone who loved it - they have no idea. There are wonderful people in this world who can tell amazing stories about themselves and share their ideas, but Martha Beckett is not one of them. The people I took into this film say that they forgave me, but they will never stop mocking it.
