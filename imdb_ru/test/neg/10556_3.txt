As a fan of the earlier film S.J. “The Last Days”, I really wanted this film to be liked. <br /> <br /> But the most pleasant thing I can say is that this is NOT a terrible movie. There are some good performances and some funny scenes. In particular, Tori Spelling has a couple of wonderful scenes where she talks to her fiance's ex-boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good week. The script too often repeats strange matches and clichéd moments of films. (The main character went to Stanford for a golf scholarship, and his school friend doesn’t even know that he is playing a game?) . There are many scenes that look pretty cute, but ultimately turn out to be a waste of time. And you could easily cut out half the characters from the movie without losing anything. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, with all its flaws, I must say that this is one of the best gay films of recent years. It says a lot about how bad most gay movies are. <br /> <br /> I hope that the next S.J. will be better.
