It is hard to believe that such a bad film can really be released. The dialogue was unnatural. Especially poor was the image of the relationship between the boy and his future stepfather. I think you could say that they managed to create an awkward dialogue, but what was said seemed false and artificial. There was simply no waiting. The music was as bad as possible. The only reason I watched this movie was that I live in the area of ​​Death Valley and I was curious about what places would appear on the screen. Fortunately, the film was on TV, and therefore I did not waste money, removing this pathetic reason for the film! I truly believe that most amateurs could have made a more exciting plot than was presented here. It is a pity that all the film crew was wasted on all this garbage! I think the only thing I can say about the film is that some of the scenery was good.
