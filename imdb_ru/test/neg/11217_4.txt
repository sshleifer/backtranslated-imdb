This is the first porn I've ever tried to consider. This requires a different approach than usual, since allegory will not reward analysis. "I am American. I am a hypocrite, a virgin. " “We are Europeans. We are cultural and sexually insane. ” "It's nice when we all fuck each other." Talk a lot! Well, actually, anyway, relative to your average number of topless in the 60s. And the energetic “class” patina, at least, provides clean, detailed compositions. But what the hell is such a thing, what to say about pornography? Well, then: the only scene I really (rhetorically) starred with was the first time Bridget Meyer entered. There are attempts to throw in a wonderful variety of race and age, not allowing any man to be next to each other; one black guy suffers from a premature attack of editorial intercourse. And a few takes or not, one, possibly indescribable IMDb act looks as if it was partially modeled by a surgical hose. However, I did not sleep, and it was eight in the morning ... but what does the last shot mean ?!
