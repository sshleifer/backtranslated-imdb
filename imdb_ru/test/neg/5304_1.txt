Well, I bought it a few years ago, my brother-in-law, who took me to see “Get Shorty” in a movie theater, to which both were impressed with “uber”. And watched as both become short and become steep one after another. I read reviews of people who didn’t see, become shorty and thought that this film was pretty good ... I just think that this is another way for film companies to fool a paying client. All I can say about this movie is WTF? After almost 10 years, and Chili Palmer became a pussy .... The scenario was basically the same, they teamed up with Travolta and Thurman after their success in Plup Fiction, threw a couple of big stars (plus a barn with lots of nobody) and thought it will be good ... The character of Vince Vaughn was just annoying, despite the fact that I am a fan of him and Roca, both actors were not busy and unrealistic. Basically, I am glad that it was bought for me as a gift, as if I had paid money for it, I would have been very annoyed.
