Airport 79 'these films were pretty good. They had decent special effects, cast and good acting. This film destroyed the franchise, and for this there are many reasons. Let's talk about the special effects of WOW !!!! they are terrible what the director was thinking. I know that this is only 1979, but let's look at other very good films with special effects, such as Star Wars (1977) and Moonraker (1979). I like the idea of ​​Concord, and this could be the best movie from the Airport, but they have done too much with it. What about Joe Patroni (George Kennedy) shooting from a cabin window to prevent a rocket looking for heat from entering the concord? He also makes 90 degrees dives and loops. This is completely implausible, and unreal wow !!!!!! Believe me, special effects do not help this scene, and in fact they are below the poverty line ... They almost look like a cartoon, and that's how the whole movie !!! Finally, let's talk about acting, which, in my opinion, is at best extremely poor, to be fair .... Excessive acting is the main problem in this film, especially George Kennedy. Which I really like as an actor, but in this film it is not affected. All the blame lies with the director, who did a really bad job of editing and really pulled out the franchise at the airport. It is a pity that Concord is still not used today, it was a miracle of Air Travel ...
