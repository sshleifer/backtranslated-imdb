This film, despite the list of celebrities from list B, C and D, is a complete waste of 90 minutes. The plot, with its several peaks, was very predictable. It was so stupid that I can't believe I took the time to even write a review. Flex, to his credit, has grown up in his ability to act since he played Michael Jackson several years ago in the film Made for Television. On the other hand, Tanguy regressed because, a few years ago, she was more talented as a footman Felicity. When I sat and watched this train wreck from the film, with its pitiful production and terrible sound quality, I got four other letters in my head to clarify what I thought of this film. However, in an attempt to keep my G Rated scores, Iâ€™ll just say that this film is another four-letter word starting with the letter L. LAME !!!
