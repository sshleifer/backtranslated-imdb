The main character, Pharaoh, lost his wife and child in the past before the film. He deals only with emotional disabling. Too long a film, too much time spent on the expressionless face of Pharaoh, too much “road time” (one of the prohibitions of television: filling time with moving cars, trains, etc.) is senselessly trivial - actions without cause and emotion. His best friends Joseph and Domino are not much more, their relationship is based on sex (this film may give new meaning to the phrase “gratuitous sex”); Mother Domino and Pharaoh - two characters who show some emotions, but not very. It is difficult to say with all the characters in this film: an indifferent acting game, an indifferent letter, or simply indifferent characters depicted in a good letter and good acting game. The characters in this film speak very little to anyone; no wonder they are emotionally isolated, which is all the more strange because it is clear that they live in an area where people are friendly and know each other.
