I did not read any of the books and did not see the first film, so after receiving the passes to the preview show, I had no expectations. <br /> <br /> “Angels and Demons” is a tangled, tangled film, in which there was neither direction nor believability. There was very little character development, and I never cared about the plight of the main characters; the reverse was true, I was more interested in how the antagonists would succeed, since the first half of the film was almost exclusively focused on why the Illuminati are what they are. <br /> <br /> The film jumps from place to place a location with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everyone in the film is an ally when they first meet. Any analytical mind will realize that this is incredible. <br /> <br /> The climax is extremely cliche and makes you wonder what happened, and wonder why no one has seen some of these moments, he feels very exhausted and unnecessary. > <br /> Actors are not particularly believable in their roles, mainly because it was hard for me to believe that scholars, professors, and ministers of the church will behave as they do, regardless of the consequences of their actions. The events that take place are unlikely, and the pace of the film is dubious when the characters jump on tight schedules, and I had to wonder how the characters manage to move from one place to another each time. /> <br /> The most pleasant part of the film is cinematography. I found this movie to be great to watch, but it was such a mess that I found it was not worth paying to see in cinemas.
