My husband wanted to see this movie, because the review said it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, I don't like either Michael Douglas or Glenn Close, I would agree. But not for generally accepted reasons. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that need to be watched late at night when you don’t want to watch something that really requires thinking, but don’t want to go to bed for now. <br /> <br /> Yancy Butler is a really bad guy. She is not the best actress, in fact she is not even good, but she is perfect for this role in this film. All the others in it range from pine to oak, including a slightly disturbing boy who looks like a perverse Pinocchio. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The end goes a step or two too far, complete with a cliché, not quite dead, with a roar, still going to give you a moment, and then there is a shot of Pinocchio with his frozen wooden grin makes you wonder if they were going to cool or just forgot that there was botox in cosmetics. <br /> Despite this, this is a fun eighty-odd minute, and, despite the fact that this is a bad film, you may not have enough gene of humor to not enjoy it to some extent. Do not pay for it, but if you are in such an apathetic mood, then this is just what you need.
