After about 20 minutes in this inappropriate excuse for the film, I realized that he reminded me of one of those annoying people at work who always tell really stupid jokes or do very unfunny things because they think it's funny and try to entertain all <br /> <br /> This film is called “Lords of Tracy” in the title role, it’s not so bad for an actress, but her roles aren’t funny, and IT'S NOT A STAR. <br /> <br /> The acting game is one of the worst I’ve ever seen, other than the Lords, the girl who plays Casey, and possibly the colonel, who seems oddly out of place. I can not imagine why the retired military colonel would like to start the Academy of snowboarding. Do they even exist? <br /> <br /> The budget would have been better spent persuading these women to make a feature film. <br /> <br /> “Freddie Goat Fingeride” has now scored 3.5 points, “Frostbite” - 2.7. I'm confused, these two films are within 1.0 of each other, FGF is The Godfather compared to this garbage. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars
