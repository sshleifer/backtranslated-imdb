First of all, let's talk about history. This is a copy of the movie "Coupling" with the addition of Indian flavor. One guy who is a guru of love, and another person who seems to be a sucker, when it comes to ladies, and like this seemingly sucker, becomes a spellcaster with the help of a guru of love, shapes the story. Salman Khan is a guru of love, and Govinda is a lame guy. <br /> <br /> Now, when artists perform, Salman Khan replays throughout the film, he tries to be funny, but he fails. You can see Salman shouting throughout the entire film, in his performance the real game is not visible. A couple of Govinda opposite Katrina Kaif (oh God, she's a damn pretty girl. Real Beauty) in real life is a 50-year-old dude, and Katrina is a girl of twenty. In the film, Govinda looks like Katrina Kaif's grandfather. What a pity! Coming to the execution of the film. This movie is reminiscent of B-Movie and the bad imitation of the film Hitch. Where Hitch looks like a film with purpose and depth, this film is shallow and aimless, there is no justification or clarity anywhere. <br /> <br /> Just forget this movie, because itâ€™s nothing more than a boring, typical Bollywood fare. In fact, I give 3/10, because this is the lowest level at which I walk.
