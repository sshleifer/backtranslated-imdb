In 2002, when Matthew Lawrence shot The Hot Chick, I also saw Drumline that day. Drum wins by default! If Comebcaks were released in March (as planned) simultaneously with the release of TMNT, TMNT would have won by default! <br /> <br /> Of course, Matthew Lawrence did an excellent job with the defender. He did not need to resort to dirty words, which is a plus. But when he started playing with his parts, as well as with other players and touching the girl's boobs, these were cons. <br /> <br /> But the biggest minus that annoyed me is that every player has to participate in a fake music video besides Matthew Lawrence (insert the Price Horses to lose horns)! Another great musical opportunity for him, simply because he is embarrassed to make music. <br /> <br /> In the past, Matt disappointed me many times (Super Human Samurai Syber Squad), where he was so close to the musical moment. but in the end I failed. <br /> <br /> Of course, Joey had a singing career with two albums under his belt, and Andrew began his musical career. But it is very rare to find Matt's musical moment. The two that stand out will be on Brotherly Love, where he played guitar and sang "Pigeon On Your Car" (Art Atrack), which he, by the way, wrote, and that romantic moment "Boy Meets the World" when he sang "This Dame "(time is running). <br /> <br /> Matt, you played jokers for too long. Why not make a musical comeback. You have a good voice, and I miss your musical side.
