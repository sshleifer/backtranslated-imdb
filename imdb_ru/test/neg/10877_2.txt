Quentin Tarantino once said that in order to succeed in the film industry, you have to do your own reading matter or mad dogs. Writer / actor / director Larry Bishop seems to have taken this advice too literally with Hell Ride and came up with a dirty deference that borrows too much from his visual effects, music, camera work and time-changing narrative. But in order to properly imitate the film Tarantino, you need to be able to build creative conversations; Unfortunately, the main element of the “Hell's Trip” crash is his cruel conversations and vulgar monologues, which work only to disgust and embarrass the audience, while causing pity to the actors just because they are involved. <br /> <br /> A gang of biker heroes, anti-heroes, the winners consist of several weathered warriors who carry their bloodthirsty justice on lawless roads. The leader, Pistolero (Larry Bishop), is obsessed with revenge and extinguishing fires. Ghent (Michael Madsen) is simply trying to balance his chaotic, psychotic life symphony with guidance to everyone who crosses his boss, and Comanche (Eric Balfour) follows with rigid loyalty and a mysterious past. <br /> <br /> On the villainous front, Dewes (David Carradine) is the mastermind who rules from afar, though not far enough, and Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) spits venom and obscene explanations of his tattoos while wearing harpoon gun and general contempt for life. Although these characters may seem interesting on paper, after they have to rant on a terribly ill-conceived dialogue, all traces of a bite disappear faster than the funding needed for the next Bishop movie. <br /> <br /> Although Hell Riding is riddled with imperfections and missed opportunities, the main facet of its destruction lies in poorly designed conversations. And since Bishop mostly affects Tarantino’s conversational films, there are a lot of them. The first twenty minutes of the film are almost unintelligible and probably muffled. By the time the Pistolero main compression is introduced, and some phrases are used to nausea, you will be praying for death, and for the ability to turn off the sound. Even Dennis Hopper has problems keeping cool in conversations with such a stupid conversationalist. <br /> <br /> Have you ever repeated a word or phrase for yourself so many times that it just sounds wrong or makes no sense at all? Bishop starts there, and then continues the madness until you envy the characters on the screen, chopping off their heads. And when dialogue finally breaks, we turn to intermittent shots of naked female wrestling and cutting the throat. I'm not sure what effect Bishop hoped to achieve, but I doubt that he found it. <br /> <br /> Infernal Ride wants to pay homage to Quentin Tarantino’s films, Robert Rodriguez’s films and to all the films that idolize the violence and carefree attitude of bikers. But while his intentions can be noble, terribly worthy of dialogue and overly stylized editing of the timeline does not allow the audience to share the common characters of the cool guy. By the time we find out the riddle behind the motives of the characters (and maybe it will be some time before you even realize that the riddle is to be solved), it is already too difficult to take care of. And while everyone on the screen is clearly having fun, they completely forgot to pass on any of this entertainment to the audience. <br /> <br /> - Joel Massie
