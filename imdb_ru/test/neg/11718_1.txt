This film provides a cinematic example of the word "worthless." It's terrible, you can forget the plot or a decent game, because it's not there. And with the dismissal of any decent story or acting, or even the features of frightening softness, as a rule, there is only one plus for a horror movie. Appeal to those who love soft core porn. This movie doesn't even have one. Women show a little skin, but really no more than, say, a Xena show. With the exception of the main star, which is not particularly attractive and has a couple of poor, and I mean bad sex scenes. In short, if you like good films that you are not interested in this film, if you like cheese you still have no reason to rent this film, if you like erotica and soft core porn you really have no the reason to rent this movie and most importantly, if you value your time in the slightest degree, you cannot do better than avoid this movie.
