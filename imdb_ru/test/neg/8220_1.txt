For those who can send me nasty emails, stick it in. In Hollywood, there is a tendency when those who create excessively bizarre films immediately become immune to criticism. Garden State is usually one of those films. <br /> <br /> Of course, Zach Braff, the star of a rather overvalued comedy series, surprises people with his talent behind the camera, but this does not deserve the praise that such a film receives. The story is often too thin and superficial to give any real insight. People compare this film to Graduate, but itâ€™s these people who are trying to surpass independent cinema. Indie films are characterized by the same hit and miss mentality that usually hits studio films, but people seem to have forgotten that there are more bad indie films than good ones. Garden State is not terrible, but it is not great. <br /> <br /> First, the film is too fast, which leads to a rather quick return of the Bolshoi to his former life. Ten years later, people begin to behave as if he never leaves. Where is awkwardness? Of course, the situation is always solved by the scene of a quick tasting of drugs (which, I will say, was depicted fairly accurately). The film seems to represent a lot of emotional inequality, giving us the idea that emotion will come later in a deeper and more thoughtful way. Nevertheless, he does not cope with these tasks, forcing us to think about why the journey to some of his decisions and points was quickly resolved (such as the serious looting of Peter Saarsgard). It was not really terrible, but maybe we should stop praising the movie as something wrong.
