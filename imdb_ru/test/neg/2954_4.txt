The most famous thing about this film is that it was the first time that Garbo spoke in a movie. In addition, the "milestone" (if you want to call it that), this is a film that does not go beyond the squeaky melodrama, where Garbo is struggling not to fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Greta Garbo is returning to the story after 15 years abroad. Her father, the captain of the barge, is glad to see her, although she behaves a bit strange. Soon she falls in love with a gray-haired sailor, who also notices that something, an obstacle, if you like, is holding her back. <br /> <br /> In any case, these two guys do not particularly love each other and soon come to blows at Garbo when she dispels the situation, revealing her Big Secret, which is not surprising for us if you read the video box ( damn it, MGM!) In this film, Garbo is nothing but a weapon, she acts and she waves her hands and quickly loses. Two men's leash in order. Probably the best performance was obtained from the classic quiet actress Marie Dressler, who plays even the drunken captain's girlfriend. What a presentation! It is a pity that the slogan could not read:
