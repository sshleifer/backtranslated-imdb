I shot this TV version of the film “Troilus and Cressida” from my library last Thursday, and just could not believe my eyes. Where do I begin? no effort was made to make the game look distant, as if it were a Trojan War, all the actors were wearing Elizabethan dress. Moreover, most of the actors were too old and terribly mistaken - Aeneas (with his white beard) looked older than Nestor, Troilus was at least 30 years old, Hector looked like a Spanish pirate, Ajax was still poorly played, and Tersity were a transvestite. br /> <br /> Similarly, the action is bad, the duel between Ajax and Hector is short and amateurish, the camera angle focuses more on Nestor's face, so we can only see what is happening in the background, which in itself is frustrating, And not a “battle” at the end if it is due respect. We do not see how Troilus and Diomedes are fighting, and no one else in this respect, Paris and Menelaus, seem to be simply fighting before the Tercites. Even the death of Patroclus was omitted. It was all a big disappointment, considering that I went through a very boring 2 and a half hours of BBC costume drama to get to this point. <br /> <br /> However, everything was not so bad. I thought that Incredible Orlando as Tersitov and John Shrapnel as Hector played well, even if they didn’t look quite right. I would say the same thing about Kenneth Hague as Achilles, since he had no striking face and he was sometimes a bit dry. SPOILER: The climax at the end — Hector’s death — was perhaps the best part of the film, Achilles’s dialogue here is excellent and sums up the position of the cold, experienced killer. However, the terrible scene (when Achilles prints on what was Hector's head) makes it stand out anyway. <br /> <br /> Charles Gray as Pandara was amazing, like an old sloppy pervert, and I thought that the actress who plays Cressida did an OK job. The warlike Troilus, however, was annoying, and I think that the play would have been better had he been killed by Achilles, and not by a peacekeeper like Hector. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Good, but it could be better if he had a younger composition and costumes that, at least, tried to look like ancient Greek, not to mention the lack of action. 5/10
