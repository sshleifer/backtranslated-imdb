*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> I saw this movie last night at the show. I started to love Tim Robbins and science fiction. The first third of the film was very cool. The rating was good, the cinematography was interesting, the director's vision for the future was realistic, but nonetheless incredibly interesting. I remember thinking to myself: "This is the smartest science fiction film I've ever seen." Then they just couldn't keep it together. <br /> <br /> Although from the very beginning this film had a number of more “gross problems” (namely, editing, and then some of the scenarios / plot development), these questions were excusable. They became unforgivable when the film seemed to have lost momentum halfway, and then the film became tedious when you realized that it was not going anywhere at all. <br /> <br /> Robbins couldn’t breathe life into his character, but did everything he could. His woman colleague (her name now eludes me) was good in her role. <br /> <br /> It seemed that the main reason for the tortuosity of the film was that the filmmakers could not decide whether to do scientific work or not. fantastic movie or futuristic love story. They did not succeed. <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> Something from the cinema: grainy, sometimes it sounded like "21 days later." <br /> <br /> Very suitable for a futuristic film like this. <br /> <br /> I took some pictures from the scene. <br /> <br /> The music was awesome. <br /> <br /> The vision of the filmmakers of the future was realistic, but still cool and interesting. <br /> <br /> I liked the interactions with other minor characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Some scenarios were interesting (at the beginning), <br /> <br /> The girl who played Maria González (I don’t remember the name), she was good. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS BELOW *** <br /> <br /> A few questions / comments: <br /> <br /> I felt that many futuristic things in this movie are convenient for to fix patchwork history. Namely VIRUSES. Obviously, the virus that they gave her at the end of the film, which made her physically “afraid” of him, was just there so that they could stick to another sex scene, and then she could report her frantically for code 46. Then they him and erase his memory and the film ends. The classic ending of the "sequence of dreams", if you ask me. very neatly ties all the ends together, if you just make it all a dream, right? <br /> <br /> Was the character of Robbin naturally intuitive or was it a virus? <br /> <br /> Why is it wrong? Do they explore a lot of problems with a girl who is a clone of his mom? It could make an interesting story. <br /> <br /> At first, I like greetings from around the world in everyone’s speeches. But it became intrusive, especially because their accents were inconclusive. I understand that the future will undoubtedly be racially and culturally more androgynous, but by the end of this it began to be felt as an advertisement for AT & T Global Networking. <br /> <br /> If they were "outside", how could they get bankrupt for code 46? <br /> <br /> The “cover” has never been clearly defined. Sometimes it seemed as trivial as Visa, and sometimes it was as important as life or death. Again, free definitions allow them to use this to glue together pieces of the plot. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'm starting to take a negative view of it, so I’ll stop. There were some cool scenes and interesting things about this film, but it only gives him 4/10
