<br /> <br /> A few years ago I bought the film “Basement”. I heard that it was supposed to be a great movie, but it turned out that it was a failure and a B-movie. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but the film has no good effects, (Maybe they didn’t have enough money for it in the budget ???). <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this film, be sure to watch it three times. First, only and last time !!!
