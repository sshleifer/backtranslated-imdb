I'm a horror / thriller fan ... when I was looking for a good horror movie to scare me on a weekend night ... HATCHET seized ... with an impressive movie poster BLOODY PROTECTED added to the average rating in IMDb ... but I made a mistake after watching this shit ... not to characterize ... sick dialogues with naked sexy boobs. I, of course, felt that I was watching porn ... and the subset that the so-called main theme or the unknown of the story sucks a lot of time .... and here comes the CLOWN, putting on a funny mask to scare ... I THINK that users appreciated this movie is crazy. .it deserves 1 out of 10, I give 2 for naked boobs, babes and soundtrack ...
