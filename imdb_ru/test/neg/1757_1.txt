Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Rennes Zelwiger. They are all terrible. Especially the star, Jude Law. <br /> <br /> It was shot by the same guy who starred in an English patient, and is based on a best-selling book about a man who risks everything to return to his lover, but unlike a great English patent, this film sucks. badly. <br /> <br /> The worst dialogue. “But we know each other only for a moment” “But these were thousands of moments, like diamonds in a bag” <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> “In some cultures you just have to say, I got married you 3 times, and you marry "lovey-dovey-" I will marry you, I will marry you, I will marry you, I will marry you ... "<br /> <br /> I am ashamed I sat through all this. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was terrible, terrible .... There are no words, I am ill. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (one of them was for really loud bullets, the sound producer did a good work)
