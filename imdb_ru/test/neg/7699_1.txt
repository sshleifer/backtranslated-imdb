This film was one of the worst I've ever seen, there is not a single cliche in it that you can imagine about the so-called Hollywood thriller. The protagonist is a loving father and a private detective who is engaged in a special task: Find out if the suspected “snuff” film is real <br /> <br /> Of course, he gets involved deeper and deeper, SMEARY pornoshops (run by Mexicans), and sex theaters are his area of ​​research, as he is looking for the killers of a woman in the movie "Snuffbox". With the help of the “smart” (he read the book) sex shop employee, he catches up with the murderous producer of the film about captivity and his personal perverts who are responsible for the film ... ... and what do you expect? They are portrayed as a simple evil, not needing explanations, origins, stories: they are bad, and he is a purifier. Boom The killer killers. The end of the film. This is so bad? Yes, I'm afraid so. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the “machine” (the mega-pervert who committed the murder) even points to its ridiculous character: in the last scene our hero makes the “car” take off his leather mask (yes, of course, he wears it) and admits that the “car” looks just like an ordinary guy from the 08/15 street. Then the “machine” says: “Blablabla, I am not a monster, my parents never insulted me, I had a good childhood, I just love to do what I do!” <br /> <br /> I just love to kill people. Yes, of course, "everyone loves to kill people" (Bender). It’s not only the total lack of character that made this film so boring, it’s also the ugly “I have to kill these people” - an attitude that makes you sick. In one scene, our hero tied up one of the killers and tried to shoot him ... but he can't. So what does he do? He calls the mother of the murdered woman, says that her child has been killed, and asks her if she loves her child so much that she wants to see the murderers dead. Mother cries: yes, she will love her child, he returns to the bound murderer and kills him. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film breathes the dirty air of lynchmob supporters (of course, the police play no role in it), moralizes in a ridiculous way against pornography, does not accept this symbol of serious and waste your time with a silly plot. Probably the only good thing about this film is that he is not trying to pseudo-psychoanalyze ... even that would be too much plot. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this. <Br /> <br />
