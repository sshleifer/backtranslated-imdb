This film seems to be well made, and more effort is needed to promote the films of women. In addition, this film also causes deep concern, as it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a character who is deeply concerned. If you have seen any advertising material, you might think that this is a sharp film about relationships that have reached their end, but not one of them talks about how real the central premise is: <br /> <br /> Woman threatens suicide, unless she soon agrees to relive the most cherished memories of their relationship here. When Tessa (the alleged main character) said, how unfair (if not more) what a threat is, she says that “life is unfair”. <br /> <br /> eh? This character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover so that he stays, and pushes him to sexually-oriented behavior (which she initially denies as a motive), all the while reassuring him that "this is not sex." <br /> <br /> Swap floors, let Tracey Gold and Brian Austin-Green play the main role, and this can show the duration in Lifetime with the name “Hostage of Obsession”. There is no medically accepted definition of sound mental and emotional stability that embraces Tessa’s behavior in this film. <br /> <br /> I recommend Kristen Thomson to play the borderline psychotic, manipulative ex in T, perhaps too well because there is no well-adapted man, man or woman, who could watch this and not have a shiver running down their spine.
