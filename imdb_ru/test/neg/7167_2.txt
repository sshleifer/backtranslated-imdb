“Book II” is not a film, but a sermon. This nauseous, painful, and almost unbearably tedious misfire, probably works like religious propaganda, but has no entertainment value, with the exception of a few wise cracks from George Burns. Luanna plays a little girl whom God asked (hm) to organize an advertising campaign that will make people believe in him again. No, really, this is a story. This is the lead load of old shoemakers, in which there are too many self-justified, “explanatory” religious waffles, but there is hardly a decent dialogue and, of course, the complete absence of something even approaching magic or charms. "Miracle on 34th Street" is not. Suzanne Pleschett inhales a little bit of life into this rancid puddle of fast-setting concrete, but the pudding head script and the jaded, tedious Luanna quickly send him to the fire depth you know where.
