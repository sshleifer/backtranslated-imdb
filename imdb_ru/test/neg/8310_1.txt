Gulf dwellers probably remember Paul from the Diamond Center, a scruffy night hackster who in the 80s and early 90s was breaking light loans and cheap stones on nightly television. I mention him only because in “Deadly Machines” there is an actor who looks just like he plays the owner of an Italian restaurant. He appears in the best scene in this positively horrible and almost imperceptible crime drama about the Lady Dragon (Mari Honjo, who cleverly hung up her acting spurs after completing this film), which controls the local syndicate. Our hero (let's call him "Not Paul from the Diamond Center") plays the restaurateur with all the subtlety of Luigi Simpson ("Do you like spaghetti?") And it seems not impressed when one of his patrons complains about the food. No, there is no fly in the soup, no hair in the sauce: there is a Red Buddha in the pasta, the visiting card of the murder boss, who sends a statue to each of his supposed victims. Death machines are bad in any case and rather boring, which is an even worse crime.
