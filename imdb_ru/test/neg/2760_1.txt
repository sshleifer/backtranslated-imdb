I was forced to read this juicy “love story” between a German 24-year-old prisoner of war and a 12-year-old Jew. It says “political correctness”. This is similar to the film “SPIRIT” in which the horse wants to be free, but these “evil” Americans will not allow it, because they need it. Well, I have good news that Americans are "evil" in the German soldier and his summer book. What for!!! Horses were given to us by God, and if the Americans needed a horse, they could use it. In the same sense, the German tried to kill the Americans, but this book / film makes it seem like everything is in order! Casting is absolutely awful !!!!!!!!!!!! The girl is Hispanic, the mother is white, the dad is probably mostly of white origin, and the younger sister is Shirley Temple. Acting is also pretty bad, serious roles become a comedy! Concluson-Bad film, bad book, but both have different endings, don’t read or watch either!
