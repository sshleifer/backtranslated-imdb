Avoid this movie if you are looking for entertainment. <br /> <br /> He is full of imitators trying to be who they are not, and Emraan is simply wasted on the role of a guide who falls in love with a beginner who needs to go to acting school. Seriously, where do they get these people from? The fact that you are beautiful does not mean that you can act or be an actress. <br /> <br /> Asmit Patel should send a letter of apology to anyone who accidentally watches him fooling himself with this bad excuse. for the movie. He plays a tasteless gangster-imitator who stupets girls and makes them fall in love with him, and then sells them at the highest price.
