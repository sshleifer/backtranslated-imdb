On New Year's Eve, a murderous policeman (represented by Lawrence Fishburne) finds himself at the polling station, which is closing due to snow. When people besiege the siege, the police must unite with the minuses in order to survive. This reinterpretation of the classics of John Carpenter simply had to add a few extra silly plot twists, relieve all the tension and add the terrible John Lekisamo to the cast, isn't it? The first film was exciting, sandy and joyful to watch. This one is more hollywood, cliche and painful to watch. The only thing I took from this film is OCD, it can be very annoying ... VERY. The ultimate song is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad. <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> Additional information on DVD: Commentary Richer, Demonaco and Jeffrey Silver; Delete scenes with additional comments; 5-minute "armed and dangerous" function on a weapon expert; 7 and a half minutes "outside the walls"; "Plan of attack"; "Assault Group"; 12 and a half minutes behind the scenes; trailers for the films "Unleashed", "White Noise", "Seed of Chucky" <br /> <br /> Miscelanious: I got it at the best price and got a bonus disc including the first 2 minutes of "Crying Wolf", 10-minute first watching “Unleashed”, the trailer for this film and Fuzion's interview with John Leguizamo
