A strange, often effective film about zombie-hippies, in which an unforgettable team of husband / wife Alan and Ani Ornsby was shot, this film is not as bad as most in its genre, but still high on the cheese factor. Includes several zombies in the basement of the deal, scandalous dialogue, the chewing scene of Alan Ormsby, several robbers of gay / strange robbers and one soundtrack to the film. Anya's wife puts such a strange idea that the question arises: does she really play at all? There are many worse pictures of this kind during the era (look for any Al Adamson film), but this is not the Night of the Living Dead. Director / screenwriter "Benjamin" Clark, in fact, Bob Clark, continued to create the Puril "Porky" in the early 80s, associated with the exploitation of adolescents. He has just now appeared after one inexplicably good film (“The Christmas Story”) to return to his terrible ways with “Little Geniuses”. Monster Alan Ormsby later wrote a strange version of Natsasya Kinsky / Malcolm McDowell's Cat People. Moocow says watch this hippie horror film to have fun, play zombies and engage in dialogue
