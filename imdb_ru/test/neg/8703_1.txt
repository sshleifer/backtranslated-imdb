This movie was terrible. Biblically very inaccurate. Moses was 80 years old when he brought people out of Egypt, in the film he is about forty. Moses was about forty years old when he fled from Egypt, left for forty years and was with them, wandering forty years. Moses was 120 years old when he died, and he was denied the privilege to cross the Promised Land. I understand that there is a lot of “poetic license” in the films, since the biblical story is not so long, but if they still need to reflect known facts and preserve the overall coloring of the main biblical character to create a biblical film and in many others. Although the 1956 version also has its problems, theatrically it was much better.
