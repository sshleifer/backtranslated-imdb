It was painful! Recently released as a free DVD with a British newspaper, this is a British-Belgian co-production of 1977 (it could fool me, it looks ten years older, at least) quite deservedly unclear, and if you do it in half an hour sign, consider yourself a troupe. The combination of animation and live action is, at best, unexpected, and at worst, just awful, which makes one wonder why it was decided to even try to make a film in this way, when there was clearly no technology. Harris is nothing more than a human prop, and the animation is one of the flattest and most lifeless that I have ever seen, with obligatory "tripty" moments (especially where the brainwave character animation Subtrato is involved) that reproduced countless The cartoon features from the late sixties are instantly dated. Don Blackâ€™s screenplay is a convincing argument for the usually lively lyrics that stick to what he does best, and the pace is so slow that even the youngest will be bored. As for adults, stick with Jonathan Swift's original novel.
