I go to a blockbuster, pick a random movie, got it, and yes. <br /> <br /> This ... was good sexy porn .. the quality of the kind sucked, and it kind of gave me a damn Headache. For me, this film was good for his sexual things, but not so much for horror and expectation. It was ... magical ... <br /> <br /> Waiting ... not as good as I expected. I wanted to be on the edge of my seat, hoping to jump in fear, but instead I lay down on the sofa and saw almost nothing. <br /> <br /> Quality ... not at all good. I mean, if you pay close attention when people are in the COLD mountains, they carry almost nothing. It also does not make much sense. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for crap, not too tense and pretty sexy, you have it.
