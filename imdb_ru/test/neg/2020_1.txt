Oh my God. And then I thought that there were no directors worse than Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Imagine how many solutions are needed to create a movie. Conceptual statement. Scripting Editing dialogue. Casting Install and maintain the design. The choice of location. The acting. Timing. Cinematography. Lighting. Music. Sound and video editing. Direction. <br /> <br /> Now imagine that each of these decisions was wrong. <br /> <br /> Result: Dracula 3000. <br /> <br /> For a film supposedly made in the 2900s, this film is surprisingly similar to a cheap gangster movie from the 1970s. The set is funny for the period. The dialogue is terrible. The time of each scene is ridiculous. The game is beyond horror. Everything stinks. <br /> <br /> Let's take, for example, a prop. If you have a movie shot on a cargo ship built in 2900, how likely is it to have open pipelines and hydraulic doors for an oil tanker from the 1960s era? What technology has not changed in 900 years? The “professor” uses a standard keyboard and Radio-Shack switches to “reprogram” the computer. What they have not figured out with voice control? Of course, Prof is wheelchair bound. With wheels. Although, you know, they have an intergalactic hyperdrive ... but, apparently, not even a motorized wheelchair, much less a floating, or bionic legs, or something like that. And, apparently, this freighter was carrying an intergalactic batch of rosewood boxes. How convenient Then there are weapons - the team carries the standard weapons of the end of the 20th century. On the ship In the cosmic vacuum, where one bullet will kill them all. Good planning there, the preaching department. <br /> <br /> Oh, why go.
