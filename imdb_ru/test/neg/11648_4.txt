The plot was not good. <br /> <br /> Special effects were not very. <br /> <br /> The scene was ... not very good. <br /> <br /> others, I felt that there were numerous holes on the site through which one could fly, well, in general, through the space shuttle. <br /> <br /> I thought the final was incredible. <br /> <br /> guys, about the "blown burner in space." <br /> <br /> Blow-off burners have their own oxygen supply (hence the name “Oxy-Acetylene Burner”). From the burner are two hoses: one to the cylinder with acetylene, and the other to the cylinder with oxygen. <br /> <br /> Thus, the "burner" works great in space.
