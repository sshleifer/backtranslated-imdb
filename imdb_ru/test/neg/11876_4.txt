After a secret mission in Bucharest to uncover an international gang of arms dealers, agent Sonny Griffith (Wesley Snipes) is assigned to protect Romanian Nadia Kaminski (Sylvia Kolloka), the widow of the Romanian mafia accountant. However, the attackers broke into the CIA shelter, and Sonny realizes that information has leaked from the Agency. Alone, trusting only his friend Michael Shepard (William Hope), Sonny fights for the survival and protection of Nadia. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes career up the hill. I just saw this movie, and this is another disappointing movie of this actor, whose career is now very similar to that of Steven Seagal. The film has a lot of explosions, shots and car chases associated with a terrible story and terrible game. First, the African American Wesley Snipes is pursued by the Bucharest police, but they never find a black American. I have never been to Romania, but I believe that there are not many African Americans in this country. His hero does not like to swim, wearing the same clothes for many days. There is no chemistry between Sonny and sexual Sylvia Kolloka, but she freely has sex, falls in love with him and shares her condition with him. The boy who performs the son of Nadi is terrible. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “About Detonador” (“Detonator”)
