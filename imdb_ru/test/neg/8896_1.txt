Hey, I know that “Angel” is not a show that gives people a happy ending, and I know that they could not just make everything perfect, but I could not believe the ending of “Angel”. I really love the show, perhaps this is the best show ever. However, I really hated this ending, as well as all the way through the second half of the 5th season of Angel (similar to Buffy's 7th season). The death of my favorite characters was largely meaningless and did nothing for the plot. Cordelia was one of the best characters in the series, and as soon as she and Angel finally got together, she turned all evil into a demon. I wanted so badly to get her back, don't get me wrong, the episode when Cordelia returns is fantastic, but I was still very angry that she was gone. And then when Fred died, right after she finally met Wesley? There was no sacrifice, it was meaningless, it did nothing to plot, and the blue-haired demonic girl was a terrible, useless character. They spent too much time concentrating around her. Another big problem is that they do not bind the elements well enough. I know that these guys in this black thorn wanted to cause an apocalypse, but there wasn’t even a date when this should have happened. The apocalypse should have been carried out and discovered throughout the season, and not just to mention that there are evil guys an hour before the end of the season. One of the biggest problems is that every character who cares about the viewer is either dead or has nothing to live. My three favorite characters died, and Angel, Spike and Gann (who, I am not sure, even survived) do not have positions, did not even return to help the helpless, are at the center of a huge battle and lost everyone they care about Angel and Spike is never redeemed, they lose a girl that they care about, and almost all are dead, and they still have to fight with this strange evil army. I get everything that you never stop fighting, but it was stupid to finish it right in the middle. There could be no atonement, knowing that there will always be many battles. I don’t understand why this episode is so highly regarded, because I think that the final of Buffy was 10 times better, and I wasn’t even his fan. Why they had to slip at the end, season 3 and 4 and the first half of the fifth were so amazing that they went and ruined the show.
