"The Son of the Mask" is a terrible excuse for the film. I went to see this with a friend of mine, and I still wish we had seen "Because of Winn-Dixie." I have to say that this is partly my fault, since I agreed to go see him with him. Being a fan of the first movie “Mask” (Jim Carrey was fun), I hoped that it was not as bad as all the critics said. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes later I knew it. was sent to a disaster. Disgusting and senseless attempts to be ridiculous led to the fact that small seven-year-old and eight-year-old children began to scream with laughter, but all the rest of us remained incredulous looking at the screen. <br /> <br /> To consider the film as disgusting and unfunny as I am. It was amazing even for me, because I loved “Scary Movie” and “Lead,” two films that many people I know found rude and offensive. But the fact is that the “Son of the Mask” is not funny if you are not ten years old. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of computer graphics in the film, but it cannot save this piece of garbage. Whoever allowed this film to go on the big screen, he probably thought he had potential, given the success of his original. Unfortunately, there is no laughter, no fun, no excitement of the first, which creates a mockery of the original film. I recommend renting the original “Mask” to anyone who wants to see this one. 1 star out of 10 is generous to this terrible mess.
