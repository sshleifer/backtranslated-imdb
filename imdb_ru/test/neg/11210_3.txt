This is a great movie for first-time Ninjas. If you are trying to impress any cute little ninja, I highly recommend playing this masterpiece. This is one of those special films that allows you to skip large portions of it without interfering with the plot. <br /> <br /> I was also wondering, where is Ninja Teal hiding? Color coding ninja is? This is normal? If one of these yellow or orange ninjas attacked me, I would have died of laughter before succumbing to his sword. <br /> <br /> And the other day I finished my test for a black ninja star, it was a multiple choice. pretty good. I found that there were a lot of questions about how to “sneak up” and look evil. It's all about eyebrows and attitude. <br /> <br /> In essence, a film could be better if: 1. There were no color-coded ninjas (or color-coded ninjas could be combined into super-ninjas). 2. Joe died in the first two minutes, and Patricia was supposed to avenge him. 3. Different monkeys were scattered around the file. 4. Patricia did not speak, and Patricia was replaced by another character. 6. The French guy was also a black ninja star. 7 Chris Tucker, Whoopi Golderg and Chris Rock were added as a “comic” relief 8. The strengths of the ninja came from the mitricorians.
