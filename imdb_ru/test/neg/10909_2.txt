Being a big fan of Conte d'ete (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115940/), I expected another French beach romance to hit me with great honesty, realism and humor. The same director, the same actress - what could go wrong? Unfortunately, Polina a la Plange is a huge disappointment. He is very slow and talkative, which would be good if the dialogue conveyed the understanding of the characters, was meaningful or original. But it looks like a typical soap opera, alternating with inappropriate chatter and jealous accusations. The only thing that saves this film from a complete catastrophe is a small character development or, at least, a “character change” in relation to Polina. The starting material is the standard fare (sexual awakening during the beach holidays), but, nevertheless, it could be a decent movie if any of the characters were interesting enough. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Although there are other shortcomings with Rohmer's seasonal cycle, most of his later films are definitely a league higher than that.
