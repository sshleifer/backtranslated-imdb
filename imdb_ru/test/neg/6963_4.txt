First of all, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst director ever. Plan 9 from space does not stand. Coleman Francis deserves this title. I present Exhibit B, Glen or Glenda. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film consists of a surprisingly thoughtful study of changing clothes, especially since it was shot in 1953. The last 15 minutes of the film are also quite good as well. <br /> <br /> Not to say that the film has no problems. Bela Lugosi was completely stranger, uttered strange lines. Poor Bela looked so that even he was not sure what was happening from time to time. The action was decidedly wooden, although not worse than in the film of the period "Universal B". The sequence of long dreams, which is the middle of the film, was completely strange; more like a vaguely threatening bachelor party than a dream. The story of Alan / Ann, the alleged original focus of the film, is related to quality. <br /> <br /> No, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst director. He was able, at least for part of this film, to make a serious social statement. When Coleman Francis tried to do it in “Night Train to Beautiful Mundo” (aka “Red Zone Cuba”), it just ended in chaos. Glen or Glenda, at least, can be observed without the help of a robot.
