Perhaps this is the worst thing I've ever seen on TV. First of all, I am sure that this takes itself very seriously, and I am, as a rule, well versed in satire. Secondly, it shows the Aristotelian levels of chauvinism; in one of the commercials, one of the “plays” describes women in terms of “quality”. Thirdly, every participant I saw on him (six, I think) was a dull talker of a sort who probably had Facebook with the words “BONING U” or “WOMEN” entered under “Here for”. Paraphrasing Roger Ebert, it does not scratch the bottom of the barrel and does not deserve mention in the same sentence as the barrel. The closest thing I experienced with Key to VIP was that a friend assured me that the male lineup was really the opposite of the attractive, both physically and mentally.
