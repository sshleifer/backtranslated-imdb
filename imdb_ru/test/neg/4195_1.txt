In addition to comments on the technical merits of production or its absence, the acting is absolutely terrible. What is really scary in this film is that I really OWN its a copy, of course, it was in the shopping basket and was renamed "Dark Harvest 2", and after watching it, I can understand why it was in the trash - they had to pay me for taking him out of my inventory. <br /> <br /> Most of the film, if you want to call it that, is spent by the mad father running around the corn field. Labyrinth is looking for his daughters, because he feels that something will happen to them. I suspect that the camera with which the girls played at the beginning of the film was probably one of the serial cameras for this fiasco. In the maze, he encounters the ghost of some children who are poorly made, and the film goes terribly south from there. <br /> <br /> I can understand why they renamed this film, otherwise they would never get rid of them. Absolutely one of the worst films that I had to watch, and it was not worth the $ 2 I spent on it.
