Oh god why? I am terrified of the sheer incompetence of this delicious talk of nonsense ... as if all this makes sense. Well, like in this movie from the poverty line of the 1940s in Hollywood, nothing in this door slamming with horror — made in three sets — makes little sense ... except for the depravity of Dr. Markoff (Jerkoff?) after some kind of plonial piano player of a player who has big melons and a hairy hairstyle. It's just awful ... and even has a gorilla and a big dog for mindless distractions. More elephant than human elephant, and it’s just 62 minutes! .... THE MONSTER MAKER is a film about children in 2005, which simply screams with disbelief and is surprised that what the hell their grandparents saw in their youth, which made them attractive movies like they are today. I think you just had to be there. In 1944, or whenever the hell this crazy nonsense was shown to impressive 13-year-olds in magnificent velvet cinemas with 3,000 seats on a rainy day. Somehow. This was done for no reason by scammers from Botchville PRC Pictures filmmakers in the war years by fleeing German refugees who knew who to make the film since they left Europe, when the Nazis advanced on UFA studios ... the scientist is actually a nazi nightmare.
