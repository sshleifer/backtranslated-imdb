The main part of this light music story is in the fictional Midwick College, where Peter Kendricks (Peter Lind Hayes) is studying because of the generosity of stage actress Grace Hayes, his real mother, who plays the same role here and who succeeds in transferring his love interest through her Secretary Mary (Healy), who is his real wife. This film, based on a weak script and further limited by over-pruning and poor editing, provides some of the treasures of its eight songs, including the title number, and has good soprano Healey twists as the diner owner and the dynamic cheater Roland Dupree.
