Badly done by a politician. Poorly photographed, acted and directed. Each scene is highlighted, including those that are filmed during the daytime. It doesn't matter what kind of place it is. At an important conference in the White House, not a single light is on, and the only available lighting is gloomy blue, which is filtered through several windows. The Prime Minister of China is having a terrific telephone conversation in the midst of such intense Kyaroskuro that he had to contemplate Homer's bust in Rembrandt’s painting. Honest. As if he had a tiny spotlight on his face, and he was in complete darkness. Delayed deaths are now required in any poorly thought-out film. <br /> <br /> Roy Shader and Maria Conchita Alonzo succeed in their roles, but Scheider rarely appears on the screen. Other speeches are not accepted. There is a beautiful oriental woman in a short tight skirt who wears a gun and is right in the Bond film, the emphasis on which speaks of childhood spent in Basset, Nebraska, and which should have remained a model with which she probably started . The one who plays the surviving secret service agent aboard the cruise ship was probably chosen for the role because he was more like Johnny Depp, and not because of any talent. Chinese villains, representing Taiwan and mainland China, hiss and grin, threatening the heroes. <br /> <br /> The script is pretty awful, reworked from other, best films. On the ship a lot of shooting, and almost everyone starts minced meat. Two thirds of the way the ship explodes into the expected series of fireballs. Then the film falls into two interrelated parts. Part one, another shootout, this time in a warehouse on the embankment. The second part is an exchange of views between the vice-president, now the acting president, and the oil-based Chinese premiere, filmed from both Dr. Strandzhelov and Fail Safe. We unwittingly launch our rockets. They launch them in retaliation. We cannot convince them that our launch was an accident, although we offer them to help destroy our own missiles. There is even General George S. Scott / Walter Mattau, who claims that their “nuclear” arsenal cannot be compared to ours, so we must hit them with all that we have. More fireballs. <br /> <br /> The end is not too early.
