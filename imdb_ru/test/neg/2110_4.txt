So I was energized during my Snakes over the weekend on the plane, after the movie we were craving a little more. Why not snakes on the train? How bad could it be, his snakes probably kill people on trains. Snakes had to be explosive. First of all, my friends and I thought that snakes are harmless garden snakes and domestic snakes with the same cheesy sound. We actually sat down through it all, completely ready to turn it off (we are too lazy to go through and press the eject button). The next thing we knew, we don't know what the hell is happening, but in the end something amazingly funny happens. This is one of those endings that you rewind several times to squeeze out a laugh, because you have suffered so long. <br /> <br /> Last 10 minutes a "8", the rest of the film a 2.
