Perhaps if you smoke enough grass, it will seem ridiculous or make you feel nostalgic about how carefree people allowed themselves to be in the early 70s. There is a strange innocence in this film, and sex is much more awkward and playful than the cool professionals who now do it for cameras. <br /> <br /> The real surprise here — and indeed the only reason to watch this film — is the appearance of Christina Debel in the role of Alice. She was a Ford model and it shows. She has a classic, pleasant appearance - like a very cute girl from the Ivy League women's club. So what the hell is she doing in this cheap, cheesy skin flick? From my point of view, she seems not to be taking drugs at all in this film (which could explain this), and she really seems incredibly loyal to this role. When she sings her first song, she really behaves as if she thinks she is cheating on Julie Andrews or something like that. I just feel that this girl really believed that this would be her big breakthrough or something like that, and not a killer close to her career. In any case, she's a damn cutie, and you can't believe that she will even get naked on the screen, and even more so - a masturbation scene, a couple of oral sex scenes (with men and women), and then a real climax to the film (snark). It is also definitely not a double body at all. This is our little Christina, taking one for the team, or for the greater glory of show business or something else. Watching this is pretty amazing, and it definitely stimulates (hm), but I would like her not to do that. She was a very beautiful, talented young girl who received really bad advice. <br /> <br /> In any case, I suppose that Christine Debell, wherever she is, long ago wanted for a long time for this film to disappear. She was very sweet and attractive in "Meatballs". Almost impossible to believe that this is the same girl - but it is.
