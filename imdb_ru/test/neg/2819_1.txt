This film was absolute rubbish. The director and the stars (?) Must be expelled from the cinema forever. The subtle paper story concerns an ugly director, played by an ugly director (now acting), advertising women on the Internet to star in snuff films. <br /> <br /> There is no horror, girls look shocked and bored, the direction is meaningless, the music is irrelevant (heavy metal on the library scene?), and the lighting is terrible. The director had to cash out a couple more baskets with aluminum cans and get a script, sober actors and a few light bulbs. Like this, this is one disgusting, nasty, useless movie mess.
