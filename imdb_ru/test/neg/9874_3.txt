I am almost two decades old, and I read comics for most of my life. I'm not a big fan of the Fantastic Four, but I’m pretty familiar with them. In 1994, Roger Korman (legend of the B-film) released the first, I think, full-length film “Fantastic Four”. The result was such a pure devil that it was never released. However, copies exist mainly on the web and in conventions. If you are looking for laughter and can find a copy, do yourself a favor and look at it. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the origin of FF and meeting Dr. Doom and a villain named Jeweler. In essence, the Mole Man has a penchant for petty theft. As in the case of these comic films, everything must be connected to everything, so FF plays a vital role in making Dr. Dome, and he and the Jeweler play a vital role in them. <br /> <br /> First, I would like to point out that, despite everything that went wrong in this film, I really liked the guy who played Doom. He doesn't get a lot of decent lines, but when he does that, he hits them. The armor looks good too. <br /> <br /> And the rest ... dirty, dirty mess. Bad scenes, bad game, bad effects, everything is mostly bad. This is especially true of Jay Underwood, giving a new meaning to the word "Johnny Storm." He does not overplay, he subtracts. <br /> <br /> As for the FF, they all look right, and Sue plays a very attractive actress, but they just don’t look like a real team. On the one hand, Sue and Johnny have no reason to go into space. In the early section, Ben and Reed go to see two of them, Johnny is about 8, and Sue is about 12. It is worth making their possible romantic couple damn terrible. The Ting suit looks more reptilian than anything else, not very rocky, and the only time that a Human Torch really is a Human Torch looks like a Silver Surfer painted red. <br /> <br /> I could print for hours, but I think the scene that best sums it up is a catastrophic encounter featuring the aforementioned non-Man Torch. He chases a laser beam, and he eventually destroys it with a blow. Yes, blow. Laser ray. With a beat, then he flies around and says: “Yippeee!” Is a whole series, after which the camera leans in and he flies back to the ground. Obviously, the intellectual Reed forgot to tell Johnny that fire does not exist in a cosmic vacuum. This and many other scenes act like "Loney Towns", if the character does not know that he is over a cliff, he does not fall. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I was glad that he was never released,
