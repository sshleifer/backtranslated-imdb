I performed less painful operations than the time I spent watching this film. <br /> <br /> If you try to think that this will be something in the spirit of the Guy Ritchie film ..... Think again! The production, the dialogue, the acting, the screenplay, the work on the film and the plot were about the worst I've ever seen in the film. My favorite part in all honesty was the closing credits. In the entire history of cinema, there has never been a better excuse for turning off the TV, going out and improving your life. <br /> <br /> Do work with the root canal instead of spending time and money on this one!
