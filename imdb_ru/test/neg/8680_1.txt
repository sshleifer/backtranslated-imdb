The good news for IMDb is that this film was so bad that it made me sign up and make a comment. I must add here that I am a movie buff who rarely makes harsh judgments. But sometimes the film is so badly filmed, poorly thought out, poorly edited, with such a bad storyline, which causes criticism. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by all the statements about how great, brilliant, gloomy and beautifully filmed this movie was. I can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here. The game was very skinny. The pace of the film was painful. I gave him new chances at every step (mainly because I did not want to feel that I was spending Saturday morning in New York), but with each new scene she delayed longer, delivering characters that I was not interested in, and I could not connect to which I could not empathize. <br /> <br /> When I see negative reviews on IMDb about small independent films like this, I sometimes wonder if the author has a personal ax to grind (something like he used to meet with his grandfather, she abandoned him, and now he is going to destroy everything she has ever worked on). But here, no. I don't know anyone who worked on this film. And I wish it was great. But the film was not dark (as some mentioned) or depressing (as others claimed). .., they suggest that I am associated with the film. No, Henry Mae Long was too long, empty and tedious. <br /> <br /> This is Thomas Bury on this.
