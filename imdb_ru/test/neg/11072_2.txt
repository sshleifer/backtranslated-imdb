What a shock. To begin with, I couldnâ€™t tolerate constant shouts and noisy panic all the time. It did not cause me fear, horror, or sympathy for the characters; it was just annoying. Sharp camera movements were also annoying. The plot was the same as any other cheap horror. There were a few pitiful attempts to give the characters some depth, but this did not work in the rest of the plot. And then there is an end. I'm still not quite sure what to do with it. I guess it should have been a smart turn, and then shed some light on the situation, but it was just silly. <br /> <br /> In the case there were several such small symbols of the winner / nomination, so I thought that this could not be too bad. I was wrong. If you see this, you probably should just leave it on the shelf.
