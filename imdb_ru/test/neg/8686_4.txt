Max Cash, the captain of the charter boat operating on the Caribbean island of San Sebastian, is hired by Sarah, who is looking for the legendary boat of El Diablo and her stolen treasure that sank on the reef in the 17th century. But it seems that something is protecting the location of the ship, since people who knew something about it are being killed. <br /> <br /> I have to agree with those who have the impression that this will be a horror feature. Instead, we received a low end of the 80s “b” rent for the 1977 deep-sea adventure film “The Deep”, but with a supernatural origin and a mysterious prick. This story is a tangle of hands (so many conflicting angles make no sense and encourages a spotty pace), and the technical side is awkward. Good exotic place and underwater photography. Although carefree ideas were not so bad. Rude Wayne Crawford is very witty, and June Chadwick is next to him. Sheri Able is pretty much pleasing to the eye. There are some strange events that are fun and one or two creepy sequences. However, in reality there is no cohesion. Most of the deaths from logging occur behind the scenes, with the exception of the bloody, horrific opening murders committed by something invisible. Again, just one more thing that leaves you high and dry. Music is common with its loud signals to warn us of impending danger, and POV shots get good engineering. Plain but watchable
