It was so boring! No plot at all! Mostly diluted version of the Lion King, mixed with Animal Farm. Again, there is no plot at all. Terrible! The worst half hour of my life! Oh my gosh I had to leave the theater for a few minutes to get some relief! I may have smiled twice. All semi-funny parts in the preview. I hate such films. Yes, the film pretty much sucks. I do not know how he received such good grades and reviews. NO PLOT OR STYLINE! If you watch this movie, bring along a pillow or a girlfriend / boyfriend to keep you busy. Awful. I don't think I ever went to the movies and didn't love him so much. It's good that the tickets cost just five dollars, because I would get mad if I paid 7.50 dollars to see this shit.
