Incompetently fun - like "She wore a yellow ribbon," remade by five-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Ahead of spoilers: Despite its name and high strength, Slaughter Trail is actually a musical with the Injun battle instead of dance numbers. <br /> <br /> If you ever wondered what Ed Wood could do with the budget for a B-film, this film should answer your question. Some solutions may have been bad only in retrospect, for example, shooting in a short-lived Cinecolor process, as a result of which people changed their shade within one frame. But it was definitely inappropriate to save on the film’s main film set, the cavalry fort, which seems to be partly a Norman castle. <br /> <br /> Terry Gilkison, who later wrote “Bare needs” for Disney ”The Jungle Book, contains many original songs that would be great for the cartoon, but that fit the Western action, like a fuzzy slipper stuck in stirrup. One song tells how “horse hooves are pounding, and their melody sounds like a hoof serenade” ... during a deadly scene of a cavalry patrol. Other songs literally tell the story, shot the shot, represent the characters, describe their mood and gestures - how they happen on the screen - and even stop to advertise the Cinecolor process (!) <br /> <br /> The script sends the ferocious Navajos on a military path to avenge the murder of two of their group by the criminal trio. By the end of the film, what looks like hundreds of Navajo and cavalrymen bit the dust (thanks to the repeating shots of the same characters dying over and over again). But the boss is satisfied as soon as he sees that the trio of villains was killed. As a singer, he obligingly informs those of us who did not pay attention, the Navajo leave, their battle ends. The captain of the cavalry, surrounded by the corpses of his fallen comrades, happily waving his appreciation to him. <br /> <br /> The direction could be softly described as wooden or, more precisely, Wood-en. Navajo consistently shoot their horses in pairs - never alone. Virtually every red man dies on foot, throwing his arms into the air and turning over. The film also involves the most cautious stuntmen in Hollywood who squat before falling off a single-story roof (and still cannot glue the floor), or turn to look back when they slide, “dead”, on a rocky slope. br /> <br /> Star - Brian Donlevi, who certainly deserves an Oscar for not flushing. After the endless final battle scene - “climax” - hardly a word - he scans the list of dozens of his soldiers killed and shrugs: “It could be VERY worse.” Soldier Andy Devine begins to sing, and burglar / murderer Gig Young laughs at Andy's antics ... which leads the character detained by masked bandits to squeeze out Gig: "I would know that laughing is everywhere!" <br /> <br /> And so that no one can forget what an unpleasant Howard Hughes job can be, remember that being the head of RKO, Hughes was first on the list of Howard Da Silva’s first stars when HUAC condemned him. It would have taken Hughes another six years to complete the launch of this once-famous studio in the ground, but this did not help when he insisted on reshooting every scene from Da Silva for this film, replacing Donlevi. <br /> <br /> It was almost ten years before Da Silva could work again in Hollywood. But, given all the circumstances, in order to get him out of the "Slaughter Path", he had to send a letter of thanks to Hughes.
