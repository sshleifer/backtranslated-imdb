SPOILER WARNING <br /> <br /> A clich√©-rich movie that somehow protests against death with a statement of dignity, although it tries to do the opposite. Washington is a paralyzed forensic expert who suffered and wanted to die in the last four years (although, apparently, he wrote his huge book on sales only a year ago, so not all of this should be despair). He arranges suicide with the help of a doctor, who will return in a week. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, he helps in the case of a serial killer. He hires the fearless, I don't want to do this, but I'm so good at it, policeman Jolie, and they are looking for an impossible clue, rushing to incredible conclusions in moments. Hey, this old bolt means that the killer has the wife of a millionaire in the steam tunnel at the old Woolworth building. Shyeah, right. This is ridiculous. However, he is not smart enough to understand that the doctor who is going to help him is a murderer. <br /> <br /> When he comes to Washington to kill him (ahead of time), he changed his mind and incredibly fights for his life. Let us turn to the obligatory bad guy who was going to shoot the scene of a good guy, when it WAS to shoot a pistol - but the bad guy did not shoot! No woman comes out of the corner, she just shot him in the back.
