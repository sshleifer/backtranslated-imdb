Well, firstly, there may be SPOILER here, since I don't know what it means to give out too much information. My topic says it all, but surely people will want to know WHY this is so stupid. <br /> <br /> Firstly, this film tells about a bunch of yuppies, when they go to a sports game in Chicago, but ultimately accept the Wrong exit and getting into the ghetto. Scary, huh? Well, first of all, Emilio drives everyone to the world's most bloated RV / Winnebago, deceived by satellite dishes and similar crap. So these guys go to a sports game (I forgot which, although probably the bulls or the White Sox, because they are near the terrible ghetto), but they can't even walk along the freeway without having on board a command center watching to shame ESPN. Nevertheless, they are smart enough to make a living to pay for things, but they are such sports fans that they don’t even know which way to go on the way to the game they love so much. <br /> <br /> I gave up the film for half an hour after that, but there were many reasons. They fall into the ghetto, but their main danger to their existence is Denis Leary. WHITE GUY. I'm not racist, but I come. In any memorable reality - and this film tried to be a city nightmare - Denis Leary will not try to kill Emilio Estevez, he will be ready to rise to kill Dodge himself from himself !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the silliest films ever made, although I’m not familiar with most other cinemas in the world. If MST3K were still on, they would probably have dedicated this episode.
