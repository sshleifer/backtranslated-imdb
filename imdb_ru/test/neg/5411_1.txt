To be honest, the film was so HORRIBLE that I liked it. I've never seen such a horrible movie in my life. I was shocked. I mean, I don't even know what to say. <br /> <br /> The characters could not even hold their weapons: in one minute the guy had the M16, and his friend had the MP5, and in the next Scene they changed their weapons. (Do not ask, believe me, I know my weapon) And I never understand how they got from a place that looked like Vietnam, to the highway in Arizona, to my backyard, and then to the chemical plant in California, that's what I took him. <br /> <br /> Why are you afraid of a guy in a Halloween mask who wears a garbage bag for a cape and shoots you with plastic arrows? How does it scare? I wanted to swallow arsenic in the middle of a movie. I like the way the "skeleton man" accidentally decided to kill for that day. But hey, the one who made this film should be shot in the knees and fed with a bunch of fire ants. <br /> <br /> Good afternoon.
