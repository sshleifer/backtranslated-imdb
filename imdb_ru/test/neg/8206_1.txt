If you could give negative stars, I would for this smelly. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I LOOK for a good crappy movie. I'm a big fan of movies like Octoman, The Wizard Of Mars, Queen King, and others. A true classic of B-Cinema. <br /> <br /> But this film actually makes Jack Nicholson and Boris Karloff look like an Academy Award winner in the movie Horror !! The dialogue is so unnecessarily verbose and mostly misused. (i.e., “I'm thickening now (yes, thickening!)” to your desires. Perhaps acting would be much better if they had more logical lines. <br /> <br /> History? What story , And the Earl is expelled because his wife had leprosy? I'm still not sure about that. And (Rich?) Is the fleet alone and the captain of one of his ships crashing on the island? b-A lot of movies, there’s a lot of charm in it, but it was just stupid ... stupid. Salty sea captain that sounds as good as a college officer? A fleet owner who is as ignorant as they are (I felt this guy had no idea how to play, one scene in which he plays in Spanish, the next English / European)? Counting who is not sure reincarnation is he or indeed Desayde (do not ask me how Deside is in this, after 4 beers my wife, friend and I still could not understand it. <br /> <br /> The factor of panic? show this turkey to your little grandchildren and only worry about sleeping through it. I really like the horror films of the early 60s, and some still have good shocks, but this thing ... never had a shock, or even a hint of fright. <br /> <br /> On the back of the information it says, “This film contains scenes that are so bright and humiliating that they will surpass your worst nightmare.” The ONLY degradation - VIEW THIS FILM. It is 90 minutes. (The case says it's 74 minutes.) You will not return to your life. <br /> <br /> I paid only a dollar, but one dollar for this and another film. I still feel that I am owed .50 cents for even sitting here. <br /> <br /> To summarize, we can say that there was not a single named harrow in Dungeon Of Harrow, but there was a beautiful cardboard dungeon in it.
