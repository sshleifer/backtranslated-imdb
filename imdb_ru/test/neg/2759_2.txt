At times I look back at high school, and it amazes me that I never fell lower than Marvin in this BAD film. <br /> <br /> Poor Marv - the main character, who is all lucky, and he is getting worse and worse. Despite his intellect, he manages to intimidate, exploit, support his lousy ruthless father and many other nonsense, including daring robbery, which, let's say, does not go completely according to plan. Of course, the viewer does not feel sympathy for anyone in this film, so all this terrible darkness is reflected like harmless zeta rays. Recommended for those days when you feel depressed, insert this film and you will smile and say: “I am so glad that I am not Marv!”
