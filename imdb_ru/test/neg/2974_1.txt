Football fans everywhere - stay away from this movie. It was so baaaaddd! Loud game, slop scenario, slop football and the lack of direction! I made this film during my time in Asia and was shocked that it is considered one of the best Singapore films. It was just pointless and boring. In Asia, thousands of rich, exciting stories. Why write a bad story about super-typical Singaporeans?
