This film, like no other, illustrates the state of the Australian film industry and all that holds it back. <br /> <br /> Terrific talent, outstanding performances (especially Victoria Hill), but disappointment in almost every other respect. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of “adaptation”, it did not bring anything new to Macbeth (no, this is not enough in modern Australia), and, in fact, could not fully justify its existence, except (let's face it this, completely unnecessarily) paying tribute to the original work. If there is one piece of work that has been done (and done, and done, and done), this is Shakespeare's work. Therefore, any adaptation, if it is not an indulgence of one’s desires and meaningless exercises, should at least introduce a new interpretation to the work. <br /> <br /> And this is what this Macbeth cannot do. Since this was done, this film has no contemporary relevance at all. This is the same play that we have seen countless (too many!) Once before. With the exception of weapons and various outfits. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fundamental mistake (another way of expressing it) in maintaining the original Shakespearean dialogue, one of the more unpleasant moments of the film is a long and incredibly incredible one. Boring slow motion flew to the end, during which I completely disconnected, although I looked at the screen. I never thought I had a short attention span, but here you are. <br /> <br /> I believe that the film will be successful on its own, on a very limited scale. But as Australia continues to produce world-class acting talents, its filmmakers must stop proud of their successes on limited terms and in fact set high enough standards to show that they respect the acting talent they work with. /> <br /> Shame. Absolute shame.
