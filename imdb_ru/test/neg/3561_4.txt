This film is about a grieving wife who lost her husband because of suicide. She is tormented by her son, who refused to speak after that. <br /> <br /> Children's grief is rarely seen in a film, so it's nice to watch a movie like The Addison's Wall. However, because of the very nature of the film, there is no tension or drama. With the exception of a few key emotional moments, everything in the film is very simple. The sharp ending, which does not solve any mysteries, of course, does not help the film to be more watchable. Addison's wall could be much better, for example, examining the contents of the wall, a more intensive assistance program to help Addison survive his injury. Instead, the film seems very unfinished and unappealing.
