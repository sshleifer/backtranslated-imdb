I would give this film a stellar voice if it weren't for the laughter I got from it. Some of the conversations were just so lame that they made you laugh !! How could anyone really say that. Not to mention the fact that the major bodyguard (Antonio Sabato, Jr.) flew 747 like a professional, and the team of whiners Michael Pare was able to dig a trench filled with gasoline and blow a huge boulder in an instant. Someone noticed a lame tribute to "Fantasy Island" with a guy saying: "Boss, airplane !!" Michael Pare, as soon as 747 appears in sight. <br /> <br /> Lovely girls and even kidnappers of women were the only saving grace. Not to mention that the main hijacker deserved to die a lame death, which he did for being such a prankster !! Imagine that you escaped from being tied to just a shot from a "crossbow". Hello. <br /> <br /> The poor pilot probably died on the plane when everyone ate steak and rum! Just for fun, they have to do a sequel to show us how they all spend the night in the midst of hurricane 3 categories on the Neptune Atoll. Have I heard that Michael Pare called it "the best honeymoon in the Pacific". Now it will be an interesting movie!
