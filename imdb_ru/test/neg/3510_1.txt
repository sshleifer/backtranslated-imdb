I get the impression that I watched another movie for most other people I know who saw this movie. This is not exactly what I found the film offensive or something like that - just the script was incredibly amateur for a film in which some money was obviously invested. I really respected Paul Haggis's work on the Million Dollar script and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this script was. It was clear to me that there was a desperate attempt to be a “racist” version of “Traffic,” but I do not think that “Traffic” was really a film that should be frustrated in the first place. <br /> <br /> The worst feature of this film is how he shamelessly feeds his audience. Does Haggisreal really think that we are so stupid that we can demand a space? Was it necessary to see the phone book on the dashboard of Farhad, whose address is circled in black text? Can we not afford to make some gaps in logic? <br /> <br /> I also had a big problem with the dialogue, which was so “on the nose”. I heard one critic say that the quality of dialogue is deceptively high, because, although people may not say so, they certainly think so. It does not matter. The job of a script like this is to use the dialogue in a way that helps add characteristics and plausibility (in this case, extremely unlikely) situations that are established. All these characters speak with one voice, and all they talk about is racism. <br /> <br /> Of course, the goal of a film like this should be to promote the fact that the race should not be a problem in these situations, but making it the sole purpose of each scene, it does not become yourself a racist? Characters walk, expounding their philosophy and comfortably memorizing statistics on race relations, as if they were burping excerpts from a research essay just written. This is completely unconvincing and obvious. <br /> <br /> The film should reveal its value gradually, not slap us in the first scenes, and then never give up. I see that Haggis’s intentions in this film were honest, but I dare to suggest that, managing his own script, he could not identify and, therefore, overcome his shortcomings. I really hope that the writers / directors will be very careful in the future, approaching this "mosaic" style of narration. This was done well several times, but it is very difficult to find a balance between personal and political rights. And Robert Altman will not fall behind in this department.
