Apparently, this series could be done at any time since the mid-forties. Cardboard sets, moon kings with zippers sewn to their aprons, you know the drill. This is the adventure of Rocky Jones, which describes how the space policeman communicates with the unbearable bitch queen of the planet Offekis, a communist planet that does not join the United Planets. When the noble messengers of the intergalactic mind declare that Offeecious is on a collision path with this other, vaguely Slavic planet, Bitch Queen decides to blow up the other guys, not leave her land. This brings morality to the effect of “The greatness of a nation not on its land, but on its people”, which is driven five or six times into a house in a climate conversation. BQ's ongoing “OffEEEEcious” nasal scandal gives relief from some seriously wanting cosmic effects, is this a TV show?
