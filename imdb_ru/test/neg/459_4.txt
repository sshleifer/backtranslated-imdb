Less than two hundred and fifty years ago, the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire in the pages of maritime history. This is the story of the captain-pirate, whose name for one short year caused horror in the hearts of sailors and merchants from the ports of the Caribbean to London’s trading houses ... <br /> <br /> Hmm, this opening film sounds like it is waiting for us hellish crap, robbery, the ripper, right? Well, it is not. That is, it is not quite priceless as a piece of souvenir. "Ann Indie" from "Fox of the 20th century" adapted by Philip Dann and Arthur Caesar from the story of Herbert Ravenel Sass. Direction - Jacques Turner, score - Franz Waxman, and Harry Jackson - Technicolor photographer. Jean Peters starring Anna {AKA Captain Providence}, with support from Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice. <br /> <br /> Initially, it was supposed to be based on the real life of the pirate Ann Bonnie, the film ultimately turns out to be a story about a woman who is looking for a personality and finds herself in a predominantly male world of piracy and sea fraud. Filled with cliché and familiar decorations, the film also suffers from the cast, which largely fails. Peters does an excellent job with this task, and Paget illuminates the screen with effervescent beauty. Although Robertson Justice, while not being used enough, actually looks like a part and does not overplay like other men. Some reviewers desperately tried to delve into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings, simply because it was Turner in the director's chair. But there is no depth here, it’s just a job for the Tourneur, professionally rendered, but its finely drawn and virtually devoid of sense to go with the buckle in the action bets. <br /> <br /> Disposable at best. 4/10
