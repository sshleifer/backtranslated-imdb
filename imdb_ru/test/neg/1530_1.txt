Not for the first time, I'm not in the spirit with the opinion of the majority. Oz is a terrible, pretentious, voyeuristic series. The creators have their cake and have it. Oz, Am City, and so on. D. They are used as crude signals that apparent sandiness is a complete fantasy. This allows viewers, the weakest of intellectual excuses, to watch soap operas flavored with everything that is bad in people. <br /> <br /> When you watch the episode, please remember that although the dirty, brutal, absurdly tangled, flimsy, sick, imaginary drama unfolds before your approving eyes, several hundred babies in poorer parts of the world died from the bad food or water. <br /> <br /> Oz is an exploitative drama at its worst. He appeals to the basest instincts, but pretends to be serious and meaningful. It blows hot and cold and changes from fortissimo to pianissimo more often than Mahler's symphony. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is relentlessly ugly and utilitarian. Freedom, taken with reality, is stupid. Here's a nightclub who owns a dandy, arriving in Oz in his colorful outfit, complete with a ridiculously cloudy contact lens on one eye, waving a cache of drugs that no one has discovered. Here is a bloody wimp, bleating about the thermal death of the universe, imploring to be killed, but, of course, he was rejected by the cattle to which he was approaching, and doing an incredible cutting of the throat. <br /> <br /> The action goes on at a pace sufficient to ensure that the voyeur, the blunt viewer, is always thinking about what happens next, and not about the garbage that has just been shown. Do not worry, betrayal, murder, sex scene will occur within a minute or two. <br /> <br /> Finally, Oz is clearly pretentious. You should not feel embarrassed that you are carried away by his flow. You can look at it and tell yourself that producers, writers and actors do everything with a huge wink (or the same word, but for a change of public) to the audience. <br /> <br /> Yes, you can be a vicious spectator and apologize for the mind, postmodern and other skills of the Oz production team. They turn to the lowest common denominator, pretending to act on a higher plane. <br /> <br /> Indeed, despicable series. And every hour it shows, rewarding its creators and actors, and generating advertising revenue for channels that show it to people who have nothing better than to watch something so ugly and unnecessary, even a few hundred children die whose lives could save dollars spent on this terrible, successful, widely commendable series.
