A decent but overpriced drama thriller, the film attempts to portray the growing uncontrollable inner demons of an exhausted artist. The problem is that no relationship shown on the screen is believable, and the credibility seems to have been thrown out of the window. The title character is so difficult to associate with the creation that it is even impossible to imagine the characters emotionally embedded in it on the screen. The conclusion is also quite predictable; From the very beginning, there are enough clues to pinpoint exactly where the story is going. By choosing to completely suspend his faith in a situation or relationship, the film itself plays well (especially in the main roles), and he manages to create some pleasant tension as the plot develops. As a metaphorical feature, there is some food for thought, and if the scenario were stronger, there would certainly be potential that could be used better.
