And believe me, this is quite an amazing achievement. Take the Jolly Roger: Massacre at Rezakov Bay, change the killer from pirate to scout, change his obsession from buried treasure to old gold, and his color from gag to dark blue. Now you have "Miner's massacre." The problem is that, at least, the Jolly Roger was quite interesting, although so bad that it was good for you to watch it for two hours. There is no murder scene in the dressing room or any strange murders. I cannot tell you how many times I have lost interest in the Miners' Massacre and have begun to wash the dishes or clean the apartment. And the ending is absolutely stupid. The 49er dude just casually appears out of nowhere to kill the local sheriff, while the lead actor and actress are sitting in the sheriff's cruiser, screaming. Really horrible movie.
