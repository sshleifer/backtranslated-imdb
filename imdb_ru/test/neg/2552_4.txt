First of all, Mexican Werewolf in Texas is not a movie about werewolves. This headline is a bullcrap. In fact, the story of Chupacabra, which kills all the locals in the small town of Farlow, Texas. I suppose distributors renamed the original name to get extra money or something like that. And I think it really works, because that's why I bought this piece of shit, it sounded so stupid. In any case, the film is not very good. Actually it's damn awful. But I did not expect anything else when I bought it. This is a low-budget horror movie with Chupacabra's monster. If you like low budget horror with bad dialogue, actors and blood, you should watch this movie. But I have to warn you, this film is really baaaaaaad. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst acts I've ever seen. Actors try their best, and it becomes completely ridiculous. They almost never utter strings in a normal way. They always have this completely wrong tone about everything they say. It's so stupid that it almost looks like parody nonsense. As if they were shooting each scene only once and were happy about it. The worst of them is a blond girl who should play prank. She is the worst of all. I have never seen such a bad actor as she (and I saw Pteraactacty). Even when her boyfriend dies, she can't stop talking about it. I hate her. <br /> <br /> Some of the shots from this film were actually quite good. Those who were shot in the daytime are pretty decent for a low-budget project. But most of the film was shot at night when the chupacabra beats, and the lighting is too dark. Bloody scenes are few and short, but really grizzly and cruel. The effects are actually quite funny, but I like it. The chupacabra looks pretty spoiled, and it's easy to see that this is a guy in a suit. <br /> <br /> In general, this film should be watched only by extreme fans of low-budget films, and it is very important not to watch it alone. because you will probably be bored to death. I recommend watching this movie with your friends and some beer.
