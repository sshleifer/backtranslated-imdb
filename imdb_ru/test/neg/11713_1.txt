I saw this movie on the show, which showed bad B-movies and tried to get them to buy them. It was basically a long trailer, but it gave you a really good idea of ​​what the film is about. After watching the trailer, I thought I would rent this movie because it looked silly and unique, but it can still be funny in a perverted sense. It is not interesting in any sense of the word. There are two (or should I say four) things in the film, and this is not the number of deaths, it is women. They are hot and naked, and Miss Lovell could be a legitimate actress, but not in the film, where the focus is on T & A and banal dialogues. It's not even a horror movie and not scary, unless you talk about how actors are trying to act. The production value is pathetic, the game is worse, and the spelling is worse. What is the point of making this film? To scare people? Breaking the Texas Chainsaw Massacre? To try to be funny? To show off female breasts? Put some guy's head in a backward outfit, with fake arms and legs? To make the character just say the word "Snow" again and again? Have no real violence, but have enough nudity in an attempt to hide the fact that there is no real conspiracy? To be able to make a sequel to the film no one has seen or will never watch? I made a mistake when shooting this movie, do not make this mistake too. <br /> <br /> STAY FROM THIS FILM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
