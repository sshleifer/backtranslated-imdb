Sorry, but for a film that was marked as semi-classic and scary, but seriously, I think that when the director makes me laugh unintentionally, this is not a good thing. The characters in this film were incredible and unbelievable. I just could not help laughing at the voice of Issak, it was like the British voice of a pompous, tearful girl. Not to mention the fact that Malikai is too dramatic in his ass. <br /> <br /> “Children of Corn” is a city in which all children kill adults and worship God, who commands them to sacrifice any 20+ years. people. When a couple gets into a car accident, they come to the city for help, but, of course, they fall into the trap of the child and are sacrificed! But Malikai has other intentions when he is tired of following Issak’s orders. <br /> <br /> “Children of Corn” could be something great, but turn into a bad movie that you could laugh about easily. As much as I love Stephen King, I am sure that this is not what he intended, and it was a rather unfortunate story, or at least the actors destroyed it. As I said, to laugh, look at him, but I warn you, this is pretty pitiful. <br /> <br /> 3/10
