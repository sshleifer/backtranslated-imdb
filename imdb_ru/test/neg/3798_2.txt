This film is in dead connection with the original for the worst film ever made. I think this one might be a little worse, anyway. CAUTION, SPOILERS !!! These are the survivors on a ship that has long been turned upside down. Incredible? No impossible. The whole package is so funny that it is not funny. There are some pretty big names in the film, and even they could not save this pathetic thing. I believe that this is really a waste of good celluloid. Seeing this, I also, unfortunately, decided that it was a waste of my time. Do not worry about that. Or the original in this regard! I gave him 2, mostly because they throw out the voices 1.
