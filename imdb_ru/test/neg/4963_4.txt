Think of this movie as a fan service, a wet dream of a slasher fan. We will start with a bloody prologue, which is largely unrelated to the rest of the film. Fast forward to nine months, and the real essence of the story begins: the virgin Mandy Lane craves every athlete and student in her school, and she is invited to spend a weekend at the ranch by three guys who think they are lucky and with two bimbos are obsessed with their weight and size of boobs. So ... you have a bunch of young students in the house among nowhere on a dark night who want to do nothing other than sex, use drugs and drink alcohol. The only other company is a hefty ranch that may or may not suffer from Gulf War Syndrome. Hmm ... maybe a future suspect in the future? <br /> <br /> So, as you have already figured out, all guests at home are eventually killed in various bloody ways, and for a change, a black man is not the first to die. There are some conventions that still persist, such as, for example, a poorly dressed infant, pursued by a car in the field. Or in the evening the light goes mysteriously, when our “heroes” unreasonably part to solve the problem. Even down to the so-called shocking turn at the end, the film is similar to the horror of the old 80s, updated for beginners, and on this score he succeeds. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he also inherits many of the problems of films of that era, namely, the subtle characters and the predictability of the entire enterprise. People are beaten, shot, beaten in the fists, etc. But, because of their innate hatred of the audience and the stupidity of getting into such situations, it is difficult to take care when bodies are formed. Someone is killed, one of their friends comes out to find them alone, The explosion, they are black bread. Rinse, then repeat. Perhaps one day we will get a scenario with believable, clever, likeable characters who make rational decisions, but still ultimately outwit the ingenious killer. Until then, we have to tolerate teens with IQ life in the pond, who are crazy with a hoodie. Oh well .. 4/10
