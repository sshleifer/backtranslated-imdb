Ugly, heartless Hollywood shit that doesnâ€™t expect anything but deformity and heartlessness from its audience. Scenes WITHOUT Spacey show how awful the movie really is. But scenes WITH Spacey are just so interesting that you stick there until the very end. Yes, he could play this role in a dream, but he does it so well, it is so pleasant to look at him, so believable and monstrously monstrous. Enjoy his game, but expect nothing more from this movie. If you want to watch a great film about the evils of modern Hollywood, check out Robert Altman's Player. This sad little potboiler is not remote in the same league.
