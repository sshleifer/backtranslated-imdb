This movie is bad. Not so bad, it's good. Just bad This, however, is ridiculously bad. I watched him out of some kind of painful curiosity and never again am I going to watch any other Chuck Norris film. If you need to choose between this film and death, you should be happy to choose this film, as this is a master class on horrible filmmaking (hence the fun). <br /> <br /> This is a permanent depression. I, as I try my best at my work in the office, that some people are involved in making films and decided to produce things like this. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10. Still, better than the Star Troop, however.
