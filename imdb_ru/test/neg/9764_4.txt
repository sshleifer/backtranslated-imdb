Since MAGUS is a tangled puzzle that really has no solution, you need to sit back and enjoy the scenery. Located on a “remote Greek island,” he plays a very excited Michael Caine as a teacher working in a boys' school who enjoys playing games with the local eccentric / mysterious man Anthony Quinn and his insane girlfriend Candace Bergen. Quinn, similar to Pablo Picasso with white hair and a striped sailor suit, is actually pretty good, but Kane seems ready to explode. Bergen, although stunning, should not put a British accent NEVER. She is not very good at such things. Guy Green's direction is good, but if you do not have infinite patience with the circular logic of the film, you will not enjoy it. The real sour note is the role of the bubbly Anna Carina in the completely dismal role of Kane's girlfriend. After she saw her in WOMEN - WOMEN and BAND-APARTHES, her presence here is quite dramatic.
