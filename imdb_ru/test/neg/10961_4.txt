Well, here we have a zombie movie, which may not even be something like a zombie movie. The whole film takes place in a tortured zombie near future, but a film with this concept does little. Instead, he focuses on a zombie hunter who is trying to get revenge and get his money back to a group of other bounty hunters. What good is money anyway, when almost the whole world is in hell, and the cities are mostly deserted. And why pay people for killing zombies. As if people would not kill these dangerous threatening monsters when they are not paid. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the story of the "Fast and the Undead" is far from being rigid. Of course, it is also not filled with the most logical and interesting moments, characters or dialogues. <br /> <br /> However, this is not an absolutely horrible movie. This, of course, is not as bad as some people try to make you believe it. It looks pretty good, or rather, said that the film, at least, does not look cheap. The effects can be a little overwhelmed, but, nevertheless, they look pretty good, like makeup effects. <br /> <br /> However, the film was not what I was hoping for. His name may indicate that the film is being unfolded in the wild, wild west, at the time of the cowboys, but its name is simply misleading, no doubt chosen to earn on it. I fell in love with it, expecting this film to be a combination of a western and bloody zombie horror movie. <br /> <br /> For fans of zombie movies, this movie will mostly disappoint. Of course, there is nothing new in this genre, but the genre itself is not enough to be considered good for viewing. <br /> <br /> Not completely unnoticed, but far from recommended. . <br /> <br /> 4/10
