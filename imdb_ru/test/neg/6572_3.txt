The journey here is a search for God, a big guy in the sky, a big cheese with a beard. Cleverly disguised as the thirst for ultimate knowledge. From the director Leonard Nimoy, Shat himself, Captain Tiberius William Shatner Kirk, takes the floor. Trying to mix the funny, banal aspects of the science fiction series {the Klingon dialogue consultant, right?}, Shatner and his co-authors only achieved what is an almost embarrassing parody of the parody. Where is the danger? Where are the brothers in arms? in fact, where is our badly protected team? The Star Trek humor is a wonderful thing when it's in the right places and done with straight lace, which corresponds to what it was before The Final Frontier. There are some easy moments, but they do not compensate for the absence of serious moments. While we really need another revelation of Spock? true? <br /> <br /> Some nice scenery and small moments of “Trek” aside, “The Last Frontier” is just a bad movie experience. 3/10
