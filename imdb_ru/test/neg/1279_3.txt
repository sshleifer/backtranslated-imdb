Some people think of Sweden negatively: too neat, too clean, too serious, too organized and too north. People tortured by their own religious destiny and history, sometimes leading to depression and obsessive power. This should not be a problem for the director, as, for example, the late Bergman showed us what can be cinematically possible under these conditions. Bergman used his personality as a starting point and did not explicitly comment on this personality as such. <br /> <br /> Andersson, however, does the opposite: he comments only on this person, thereby scrying his people to the bone: in his world, Sweden is equivalent to hell on earth. But he does not go further, and for me it is not art, but simply an abstract. Despite the extraordinary amount of time it took for this director to have serious limitations from which he clearly cannot get out. <br /> <br /> Compared to his previous film “Sånger från andra våningen / Songs from the second floor” also no great progress will be observed. It was supposed to be more accessible, but the difference is minimal, and a few scenes that try to please a wide audience are not the best in the film. The same absurdism and minimalism also still apply, there is a one-shot camera position and (lack of) action before this shot. Yes, the shots are made well, some scenes really work, and the coloring and layout are amazing. But does it make an interesting movie? Thinking negatively, this movie took a step back. <br /> <br /> The story of Andersson as the creator of commercials shines through in a complex situation, but I believe that his films are just as empty as these commercials. There is a message about humanity, but it is trivial and without much depth.
