I loved all the other Don Notts films, but I never heard much about “How to crop rice”, and now I know why: I can't think of anyone who would consider it pleasant. This film seems to be about 9 or 10 years old, but even most of them would approve. At best, there are short moments of easy fun, mainly from the fact that Don Notts plays the same nervous, deprived character that made him famous. <br /> <br /> After the movie finally ended, I was curious if my teenager could catch it? fatal lack of film. We were in complete agreement: Prentiss Gates, the assistant character, was dumber than the character of Don Notts. <br /> <br /> Be happy that films about Mr. Limpet, the reluctant astronaut, Shakist Gan and Mr. Chikene are here.
