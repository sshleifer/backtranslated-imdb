"The Vindicator" is a weird little Canadian B-movie. At first glance, this may seem like another cheap (extremely cheap) fake Terminator, but, oddly enough, it also shares some qualities with the original Robocop, which was not even released when the Vindicator appeared (1986) . Conjuncture? Who knows? In any case, the story is this: Karl Lehmann, a scientist, seems to be a pretty good guy who works in a state-of-the-art secret high-tech technology research lab and reports to a dull boss named White, with whom he invigorates about financing the project at the beginning of the movie. Karl has a loving wife and a small child at home, which makes him even more tragic when he is suddenly killed in an "accident in the laboratory." But wait! Karl is not really dead! White extracted Karl's brain and inserted it into his favorite project, a kind of experimental biomechanical spacesuit. When Karl wakes up inside his new body, he, of course, goes crazy, breaks the laboratory and runs away. This is a problem, because White (for reasons known only to him) has programmed a mechanical suit using the Rage Reaction program, which will force Karl to kill anyone who touches him for any reason. Looking back, this small addition to Karl’s psyche was probably not the best idea. <br /> <br /> So Robo-Karl wanders aimlessly through the film for a while, killing a couple of random robbers and other background characters, until he returns to his home and contacts his wife (I think this scene should be heartbreaking touching, but it turns out to be comical, because the voice of the robot Karl is so strongly synthesized that you barely understand the word he says). He, of course, tells her to leave the city and never return, because she is in danger, but she wants to stay and help him, Yadda Yadda Yadda. In the end, White hires a gang of commando bandits led by Hunter, an obvious ninja killer played by Pam Greer (!), To track down and destroy his escaped creation, using Karl's wife as bait, and followed the predictable (but ridiculously cheap) mayhem. . <br /> <br /> I'm a guy from B-Movie, but "The Vindicator" was so narrow-minded that it quickly turned into a comedy. I assume that a large part of the budget was spent on the design of the Rob-Karl Stan Winston costume, because it actually looks pretty cool, but the rest of the film suffers from a cheap look made for television. The script could use VERY more work, but then, perhaps, the filmmakers found out that RoboCop was put into production and hurried to release Vindicator so that they could not be blamed for their failure. In any case, judging by the other comments on IMDb, I'm not the only one who noticed the parallels between “Vindicator” and “RoboCop”, and obviously “Robo” is an excellent film, so there’s no need to waste your time. If you don’t want to see a film that can best be described as a draft of Robocop, if it was made by the 8th class, then you can just sit in that nonsense.
