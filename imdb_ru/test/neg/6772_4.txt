Danny is very sorry. <br /> <br /> He continues to repeat the same mistakes, and it is no longer interesting to look at him. At first I felt like an addict myself. At the beginning my heart turned to him, and somewhere along the line he crossed the line. It is as if he continues this behavior to support the show, while at the same time seriously risking his life and the welfare of his family, especially his children. It's hard to even pity the poor boy. I think he needs to watch this show, maybe then he will have a chance to save this marriage. I can't understand how Gretchen stays with him, and I keep wondering how much it costs only for a show, and how much love costs. Danny, take a life - a new one that is! ... and don't get me to Dr. Gary. What is with him and his face? His skin looks like it's stretched to the maximum. In addition, the appearance does not mean anything, but he does not seem to be particularly impartial. I think that he, too, continues this for his own monetary gain and is often not in the best interests of either Gretchen or Danny. These people are a bit confused, and everyone reminds me of a dog stalking its tail. sad, very sad. Let's pull yourself together.
