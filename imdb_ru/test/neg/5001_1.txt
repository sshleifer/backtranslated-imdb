I'm not sure what the appeal of this film is, but I couldn't find it. This is a really long, hardly trustworthy, barely clear conversation between three guys on the same set. <br /> <br /> He is not moving anywhere, the characters are just bizarre, and the plot is the same. This is lost to me, definitely a weekend movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps you from leaving is the unconscious probability that he may have some point or significant climax, and the fact that, apart from any irritation from banal personalities, they act quite reasonable. But you have to prepare for endless dialogue, in many cases wishing the Master to turn off% * & * for a moment.
