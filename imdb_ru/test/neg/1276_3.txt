If you like the fabulous “real life” adventures, take a look. If you like children's films for young people, why not watch them? :) If you and your parent are going to watch a movie with your children, you had better choose a squirrel! <br /> <br /> The start of this movie was a bit funny and did some good. rooms for events. But after a funny introduction of characters, settings, and potential conflicts, the story turned out to be pretty boring. When more or less the same things happen for the third and fourth time, the word “predictable” constantly comes to mind as parts of a battered LP or an advertisement that you really hate. And the climax of the plot ... * oh sigh * ... poor, poor, poor!
