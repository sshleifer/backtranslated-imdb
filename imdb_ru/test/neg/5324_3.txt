I actually saw the movie before I read the book. When I watched the movie, I was upset because I was surprised why Dean Kunz made such a bad book / movie. The film was confusing and had no flow, it was changeable and made me want to throw a stone at the TV. I couldn’t contact the characters at all, so I didn’t care what happened to them (I usually like characters because I can relate to their personalities or problems) Then I read the book and loved it. I often re-read the book, and the film is gathering dust. I would like someone to make a film of Kunz, who repeats the plot of his books, then the films will not be so bad. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM IF YOU DO NOT NEED TO SPEND MONEY!
