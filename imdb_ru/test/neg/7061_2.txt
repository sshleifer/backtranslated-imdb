In a happy family comes a gypsy, played by Myrna Loy. With her amazingly wild hair and a voice that sounds very piercing and strange, it's hard to believe that this is Loy !! She has no resemblance to the sophisticated and funny character Norah Charles, whom she played in the films “The Thin Man”. Instead, she replays so much that you almost expect her to be in Ed Wood's movie. What a huge difference in several years in the quality films that she received, as well as in her acting ability !! In addition to the terribly stupid character, the film also fails because it is simply not interesting and not entertaining - just very, very entertaining and stupid. The only thing that is good about this is the Vitaphone sound system - the sound quality of these turkeys is the best I've heard in 1929. Hell, it was even better than in most of the 1930 films, so the sound engineer should at least do something. Proud - everyone else, forget about it. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that even the owner of Turner Classic Movies called “guilty pleasure” because the movie is very bad! And, seeing this, I disagree ... slightly. The film is just bad.
