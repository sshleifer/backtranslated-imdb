A bunch of young bikers in the forest rolls around. They are having fun; few know that the emo-refugee can unleash nature from the movie "Liberation" or "The hills have eyes." He is armed with matches and fireproof. And he has a bleeding eye or something. Why set the park on fire? I dont know. Maybe he doesnâ€™t like Smokey Bear or something like that. But he wears an army / naval shop uniform, if that helps. <br /> <br /> Rangers send one single helicopter to fight the resulting flame; that's all you've ever seen, except for a group of people at the base who talk a lot about fire but do nothing. Some kind of policeman, ranger, police officer or someone else who he is falls from a helicopter onto a faulty cable. <br /> <br /> Everyone now rides their dirty motorcycles, as if they were trying motocross. They are always spinning, doing jumps with Evel Nivel, spinning around, etc. They argue constantly. Fire shots are as fake as a $ 3 bill; they are the same shots from a dozen different angles, and the flame never grows or moves. And you still have never seen fire-fighting equipment. <br /> <br /> A film on the SyFy channel to which about 0% of science fiction is attached. What can you expect from this: a bad game, cheap effects and a story that does not go anywhere (for example, bikes and fire do not go anywhere). A ridiculous cure for insomnia.
