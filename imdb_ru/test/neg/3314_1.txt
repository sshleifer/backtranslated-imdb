It's nice that these three young directors produced films with good performance and decent acting. There is a good job here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they suffer from the fact that they hit most of the modern gay cinema; reworked plots, too familiar devices (I saw how “gameplay” was too often established in gay films for men) and hackneyed scripts. The most egregious of all is “Dorothy”, whose ridiculous premise is that it will be difficult for a nice young guy to get to New York due to the lack of recognizable accessible gay guys in his neighborhood. <br /> <br /> In terms of movies, these shorts play like sticky little gay special schools. Not a lot of imagination in their writing or performance; they basically follow the “point and shoot” principle, “shot / reaction to a shot / master shot”, which after five minutes becomes painfully boring. Hope for a strange movie is in the works of Todd Haynes, Sadie Benning and the late great Marlon Riggs ... but not here. These films are incredibly mediocre, unusually white, and their values ​​mostly condone the feelings of the gay bourgeois. That's probably why they play so well at gay film festivals.
