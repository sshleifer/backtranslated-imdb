This film was a big disappointment. The plot sounded great, about half a man, half a leopard, a creature in Africa that becomes the subject of a documentary by young American adults. When many of the crew members were found dead, 2 survivors are interrogated. I would not even call it a horror film, since most of the film is actually about the (wrong) adventures of the above mentioned, narcissistic 20-year-olds, which include sex and smoking animal dung, to rise (not as interesting as it sounds - believe to me). You rarely see a creature, and the main actor (who is also the director, screenwriter, editor, and producer!) Is incredibly annoying. <br /> <br /> I am finally so annoyed by the fact that I never completed the dialogue, which I quickly advanced to the end. I guessed the ending less than 10 minutes after the film began ... and I was right. Thus, this horrible film is also quite predictable - as if it was not bad enough. Moral of the story: avoid films that are shot, directed, edited, produced and written by the same nobody. And avoid this movie, unless under the gun.
