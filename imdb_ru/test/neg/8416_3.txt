This is a stupid parody of thrillers with eyes closed, as the novelist (Michael Kane) is called upon to “write” the autobiography of the colorful dying Hollywood star (Mickey Rooney). Sometimes nonsense becomes unpleasant. This is not Cain at its best. Rooney is too much. Significant support was provided by Lizabeth Scott, Lionel Stander and the pretty Nadia Cassini. Not easy to watch.
