Let's be realistic here. This is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. “My wife and children” showed real promise in the first season and only after that they went up the hill. It is so bad that words do not describe. Acting and writing is so terrible on an ongoing basis that I wonder if Damon Wayans really produced such a horrible show on purpose. From top to bottom, every performance is ridiculous. Damon Wayans is on the phone, and George Gore II is so terrible that I shrink in every overly active line. Can anyone really watch this show and find it interesting, not to mention funny? Please, I beg you. Do not watch this show. As soon as the broadcasters stop perceiving this in syndication, we can finally get rid of this absolute rubbish.
