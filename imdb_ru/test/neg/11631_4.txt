OH MY GOD! After such a promising start, Critters 2 repeated the karmic rule of what was happening around. It is clear that very little was thought out when this film was made, and what happened to Scott Grimes in the ears! It was supposed to be the last expedition in the Nibblers saga, but there was more trash on the way. This was the main reason I didnâ€™t watch Critters 3, and why should every bad movie have an episode in space? (Nibblers, Friday the 13th, Leprechaun in space, Hellraiser, etc.)
