Little is happening in this movie. There are a few key points, and everything else speaks of the decisive moment that occurs before the beginning of the film. The main mechanism used in history is memory. Memories can be used very well, but they are not here. When flashing backward or forward, a zero indication appears, and there are only weeks dividing events, so context as the scene progresses is the only way to know when something happens. Perhaps this was done to add a sense of mystery in some places, but it was pretty annoying. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in seeing the 100-minute discussion on the screen of the causes and things, as well as unconvincing questions good against evil, enjoy. If you're watching a close-up look of Ryan Gosling's almost blank look, and you like most of the film, you're in luck. Unfortunately, I can not find a reason to recommend this film. Yes, and, as indicated in another review, Spacey actually plays here only a cameo role and plays with a disinterested squad, which you have probably already seen. <br /> <br /> *** The rest contains spoilers, although a few big glasses are held back *** <br /> <br /> First, the killing of the so-called mentally retarded boy occurs before the opening of the film, and we never We do not know what exactly happened. The implication is that he was killed to stop the deep sadness that was transmitted by the eyes of the boy. There are not many other unanswered questions, as the characters, in addition to the boy and the hero, are very one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> As for the hero ... Another review showed that he is crazy. I agree that he is not “right”, but I don’t know what I would call madness. It seems that the film struggled to convey that he was either autistic or retarded in some way, because he certainly seemed slow and unable to understand the obvious. Either this, or they were going for the abandoned youth with some disorder of detachment and / or with heavy medications. As always, Ryan Gosling knows how to convey something to the audience, but it seems that this was deliberately left in the air. This film does not give answers, only questions, but it was a bad enough film that didn’t really bother me.
