The odious Chuck Norris decided to make the final nail in the coffin, <br /> <br />, which was his film career before heading to the safe world of CBS. <br /> <br /> Saturday night massacre with this hysterically bad supernatural. /> <br /> actioner. <br /> <br /> For such a stupid movie, this thing is probably a conspirator. Norris - Chicago police officer Frank Shutter. First, what is the surname "Shatter"? <br /> <br /> Have you ever met Shatters? Genforum.com does not have a listing for <br /> <br /> the names of Shatter, which allows any half-smart viewer <br /> <br /> to replace “a” in Shatter with “i”. He and his partner, Calvin <br /> <br /> Jackson, perform the same old procedure with the bridesmaids that you saw <br /> <br /> before: make fun of the pimps and scatter their captain. <Br /> <br /> Jackson, similar to the theoretical child of love, Whoopi Goldberg and <br /> <br /> and Rick James, quickly wears nerves because of his constant complaint <br /> <br /> and Eddie Murphy. patented facial expressions. <br /> <br /> Shatter and Calvin associate with the emissary of Satan, <br /> <br /> whom we introduce in too long introductory scenes. <br /> <br /> Prosatano - a demon locked in a crypt by King Richard <br /> <br /> Lionheart. The demon's scepter, from which it derives its power, is broken into nine parts and hidden in nine different parts of the world by the holy people. In 1951, some grave robbers accidentally released <br /> <br /> Prosatano, and he began to collect nine items. He <br /> <br /> disguises himself as a professor of antiquities named Locley and <br /> <br /> always gives a lecture in which the holy man is killed. <br /> <br /> Scepter is taken. <br /> <br /> Norris brought his cohort "Walker: Texas slip" Sherry Wilson, <br /> <br /> who plays assistant Lockley. She helps Norris in his <br /> <br /> investigation, they stare at each other, and our fearless investigators go to Israel after the murder of a rabbi in <br /> <Chicago. While in Israel, Calvin is given even more complaints: <br /> <br /> about heat, lack of restaurants, lousy drivers, and the fact that he misses Chicago Bulls playoffs <br /> <br /> games. Norris even manages to turn a cute Israeli guy into this <br /> <br /> nightmare. Bezi steals Calvin's wallet and wraps himself around men, <br /> <br /> leading them across Israel and without causing any suspicion. <br /> <br /> In the end, Lockley gathers all the pieces of the scepter <br /> <br />, but he needs the blood of the royals to complete the ceremony <br /> <br /> and call the devil . Where to find royal blood? Well, Cherie's father <br /> <br /> is a duke! She has an American accent, but she is a convenient way for screenwriters <br /> <br /> to make this monster <br /> <br /> come to its inevitable conclusion. Surely this Satan minion may have killed <br /> <br /> countless hundreds of people over the years, but how can he do with a good old-fashioned American ass? <Br /> <br /> After Prosatano was defeated, killed by his own scepter (I envied him, he didn’t have to watch Bezi steal Calvin’s purse again <br /> <br />), we are treated to a terrible code with with the participation of a bearded man <br /> <br /> who watched Shutter, I mean Shutter and Calvin, in their search. You see, it was predicted ... somewhere ... that two warriors from the west would win Prosatano. The quiet <br /> <br /> bearded man who watched the couple was none other than Jesus <br /> <br /> ... I am not joking. He is listed as a “Prophet” in the final credits, <br /> <br /> but you and even your pets will recognize the subtle Christian link <br /> <br /> that directors are trying to show here. <br /> As in "I use Walker: Texas Ranger", Norris is aging and can no longer <br /> <br /> get involved in his battle scenes. He kicks a lot, and <br /> <br /> people fly over the furniture in slow motion, and then Norris recites all his lowercase readings in that monotonous voice. Oh, what a real <br /> <br /> director can mold out of him! His brother Aaron, <br /> <br />, who shot him in other films, has no meaning in the story. <br /> <br /> Scenes are added for the sake of the ego, not to entertain <br /> <br />. Scenes when a dynamic duo meets Bezi for the first time, drag <br /> <br />, and then Bezi is not so important for the rest of the movie <br /> <br />. <br /> The film was shot on location in Israel, which means that <br /> <br /> Americans can insult Israelis personally. There is not a single cute Israeli character here. The captain of the Israeli police is a jerk. <br /> <br /> The cop driver does not know English, and Calvin convinces him <br /> <br /> that the word "sh * tty" is a compliment. There is nothing funnier than <br /> <br /> to mock the stupid foreigners in their homeland, especially <br /> <br /> when all this racist humor comes from the American minority more offended if the tables were turned over <br /> <br /> and an Israeli policeman mocked an African-American policeman in Chicago. <br /> <br /> This film is poorly written, poorly received and poorly directed. It does not work as an action, a police drama, or even horror. This simply shows that <br /> <br /> the now defunct Cannon Studios was ready to throw their money <br /> <br /> at any cost, no matter how badly it was planned. “Hellbound” is by far the most appropriate headline. I really did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a rating (R) for physical abuse, gun abuse, strong profanity, some sexual references and some situations for adults. <Br /> <br />
