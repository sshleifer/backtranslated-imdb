"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" is always exhibited as a masterpiece of Australian cinema. I found this rather disappointing. The main actors are great - Terence Stamp is getting old, Guy Pierce has to play more comedies than the harsh roles he chooses, and I was a fan of Hugo Weaving since I saw him play Oberon many years ago. The cinematography is great, but if you were ever in the Australian outback, you would know that the air is so clean and the light is so bright that they could shoot it on Box Brownie's cinematic equivalent, and it still looked impressive. <br /> <br /> What is my problem? Well, three things. First, there is no pretty female character in the whole film. A woman who has to earn a living by shooting ping-pong balls from her rank and file at a roadside pub deserves our sympathy. Tika's wife doesn't get much better treatment. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the scene when they sing “I will survive” to a group of Aboriginal people is insulting. An attempt to draw any parallel between the struggle of transvestites and transgender people and the almost complete destruction of Aboriginal culture, which, I believe, should make the scene, shows the level of historical understanding worthy of Paris Hilton. /> <br /> And finally, the biggest drawback of the film is that it’s just not funny enough. Did Stephen Elliott talk about transvestites while writing a movie? Anyone who knows a transvestite (or three or four) knows that most of them have a wit that looks like a rapier, and they are not afraid to use them. Now I can understand that many of them would probably have refused the classification of the film, but Elliot had to collect enough “suitable for the kids” material to complete his film. <br /> <br /> In general, a waste of a good idea and a great cast.
