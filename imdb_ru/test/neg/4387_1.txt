It was the worst movie my wife and I had ever seen. The only concessions are that we did not pay to watch it in the cinema, since we rented it on DVD in the video store. Simply - you should not mention the plot (I watched it just 5 minutes ago and already forgot), annoying characters, poorly played by two-bit actors, and if it was a comedy, I'm still waiting for laughter. In fact, the only laughter we got from the film was that we were joking with each other, that we agreed that it was really terrible. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this film was completely pathetic, and I warn others not to waste them. time. Parody of the name of the National Lantern, rating 0/10.
