"Paranoid Park" tells about Alex, a 16-year-old skater who became the cause of death, even if by chance he was a guard. In the continuation of the film, Alex deals with minor issues such as the divorce of his parents and the sexual warmth of his girlfriend Jennifer (played by Taylor Momsen, which you can see in Gossip Girl) while he is absorbed in guilt. So far, I have only seen one film by Gus Van Sant, “The Elephant,” and I can assure you that he retained all his manners by doing this. shots of people walking ... maybe you like these filming techniques, I know not. The plot seems to me unsatisfactory ... it is almost so easy to explore for such a long time. I have a feeling (like Elephant’s) that Gus Van Sant is trying too hard to make an “artistic” film, because of which the film itself loses its meaning. Also, Gabe Nevins was pretty bad, like Alex, there is a difference between looking alienated or detached and looking like a robot. If you are a fan of Mr.Van Sant, then watch this, otherwise skip it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
