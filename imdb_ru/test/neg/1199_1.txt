Well, the idea is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 1. Children do not own planes 2. Children do not drive planes on dirty motorcycles 3. This made the Air Force look like complete idiots 4. The children's father would not jeopardize his entire career to allow his boy to have fun with him 5. Not one spare colonel <br /> <br /> Sequels, I am sure, were worse than this prank. The soundtrack is the only redeeming quality of this celluloid waste. Sorry, but I just do not understand why in the world someone would write directly and produce such incredible garbage. The Iranian air force was lucky to filter a couple of parts for an aging F-14, and this child is struggling not with 1, but with 2 fully loaded and filled F-16? Let me rest.
