This film is so boring that I spent half of it on IMDb while it was open in another tab on Netflix, trying to find out if anyone thought it was one of the most boring, cumbersome, useless films they ever have seen. Warning: I really couldn't finish it, so these are my impressions up to minute 54. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley gets a lot of screen time. As others have mentioned, her mother composed the script (perhaps during some kind of narcotic stupor, when total meaninglessness and insensitive statements about emotions sounded like an interesting dialogue), and it seems that the film is a showcase for Knightley. Unfortunately! Although I agree that she is beautiful (her teeth are not exposed ... her stabbed teeth cause me anxiety and fear), I found that her reactions were forced and poorly calculated. For example, William or Dylan are doing something nice ... a pause ... HAHAHA of K with dimples and a playful punch. Like a minute, too late. What kind? And she can't compare to the intensity of Killian Murphy. He somehow manages to really look at her and look as if he is fascinated by her and falls in love with her, while she seems completely disconnected, almost as she interacts with the mirror. It must be torture, act against someone who does not give the same level of energy as you. Do you know what else is torture? This movie. <br /> <br /> The knight looks amazing during her cyclical "I have curls of the 1940s and a hot dress. Watch me sing!" shots, but what's the point? Is she an altar or an actress? When she speaks, it is strange: “Oh, Mechster Dylan. Where are you going? ”It confuses me because the accent is so confused and unreal, but sometimes so thick that I don’t understand what she is saying (or maybe fell asleep). If no one knows who Vera was, or who cares, or few know if it was so important to give her this supposed Welsh accent? It distracts from the rest of the action (just joking). <br /> <br /> This film is similar to the fact that someone dreamed about the film, perhaps after reading Dylan Thomas before bedtime. But instead of adapting to the waking world, I thought: “Man, this dream was so interesting” and tried to repeat it. Then someone else warned: “Your script needs work. Nothing that happens does not contribute to the story or creates a need, ”and the author is everything:“ But I dreamed so much! ”This is like a child’s disjointed imagination, one of those wild and tortuous threads that they twist to get your attention. And then William went to war, and then Vera had a baby, and then some blond chick drank too much, and there were so many planes and curls, and all had ruby-red lips and ... <br /> < br /> As for the character of Dylan Thomas (so soft, that's all I can call him), why didn't he have any lines in this silly biography? All he does is drink beer and smoke cigarettes and ride with Sienna Miller, who is so wild and artistic that he will make a public appearance! Get out of here, crazy poets! (I understand that she is not a poet, but she and Thomas look like this sickening unit of crazy guys going through crazy times, like the warm Sailor and Lula of Wild at Heart.) I say do it. Leave it on the shelf and use it only as a weapon for the anesthesia of children, old people or guests at home. <br /> <br /> P.S. to hero Murphy ... when someone asks if you were "in the shit," you can say yes, because your fighting scenes seem to be filmed at the dump.
