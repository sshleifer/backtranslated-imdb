Back in the dark days of 1990, it was mistakenly believed that Spielberg’s heir to the throne (after the failure of the supposedly gifted Phil Joan) was Spielberg's pretentious imitator David Mickey Evans. Evans managed to save the studio for more than a million dollars, forcing baby-boomers to believe in his script — a combination of nostalgic references from the 1960s and an alarming drama about child abuse — is tantamount to a good story-telling and a decent movie. <br /> <br /> As Rod Stewart once sang: "Look how wrong you are." <br /> <br /> But the newcomer fanciful scenario, inspired by “ET”, convinced enough people that he was the Next Chosen One - New Spielberg - and therefore it was agreed not only to buy a script for more money than 99 percent of the world's population will ever be seen in his life, but also that Evans will be the director of the film - although he never directed anything in his life. <br /> <br /> Hey, how hard is it to be another genius in a movie, after all? <br /> <br /> Two weeks after the shoot, Columbia found out. The studios called its daily newspapers “absolutely unsuitable for use” - or, at least, so balanced that they do not fall under E.N.C. (Emperor's new clothes) spell. All his frames were recorded and reworked into guitar pictures. <br /> <br /> So what did the studios do after they spent $ 10 or $ 20 million on what they still believed to represent the resurrection of Steven Spielberg? Hire Spielberg to save the day? Colombia probably tried it. <br /> <br /> Enter the old professional Richard Donner. Hey, he may not be a cinematic genius, but he does his job. In the end, "Superman" was not so bad - and the first "Lethal Weapon" turned out to be pretty good. <br /> <br /> So Donner enters and takes the reins. Fortunately, he manages to convince Colombia that the worst of the tasteless fantasy episodes of the film, which would have been played out like an acidic journey of a ten year old child, should have been gone. Unfortunately, he goes to the Crying Buffalo (oh, how poetic) and to the ridiculous pseudospilberg fantasy finale, complete with which Clueless Mom is perfectly content for the rest of his life to receive postcards from his missing son while he circles the world in his red car. Right. <br /> <br /> But Donner managed to achieve a decent performance by Elijah Wood. And Lorraine Bracco, like an idiot mom, was also not bad. Perhaps Donner should be overrated. Maybe he is not such a fake Hollywood hack, as everyone always believed. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this broken misfire is 2 points is that someone was smart enough to play the great John Hurd (but not in that part, of course). The children are all right ... although the horrible, overly explanatory narrative of Tom Hanks almost destroys every scene he invades. <br /> <br /> You might think that after David Mickey Evans, Phil Joan, and Troy Duffy from the world, studios can finally gain wisdom. One would hope that these provocative action films could prevent the Emperor's New Clothing Syndrome from ever again raising its ugly head. <br /> <br /> Doubtful!
