The Heart of Darkness, a short novel by Joseph Conrad about greed, corruption, and travels in Africa, was at least a tedious reading. The narrator follows Marlowe, a sailor who travels deep into Africa to save Kurtz, a kind of ivory wunderkind trader who allegedly lost his mind, this conclusion came when the Cat stopped entering the main port. The basis of this story is that Konrad generously writes about the environment, he miraculously sets the scene, but perhaps a little broadly. This story was more like a watercolor painting, as opposed to the slow creeping soft story that Conrad might have intended to reveal. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it happens that after reading a book, perhaps when viewing this function, the film can help to relate some thoughts to those in the book, or vice versa. As for Heart of Darkness, this is not so, even in the role of the main character actor John Malkovich, the film only embarrassed me more. It seemed that in the film there were no real main characters, no one stood out among the others, not counting the extensive symbolism. explained. It was rather soft and hard, to say the least. <br /> <br /> With respect to the author, “The Heart of Darkness” - a real masterpiece of a short novel, touching on very serious topics - Marlowe's lies. and Kurtz's greed. This is not a book that needs to be taken lightly, and it will put you in a rather gloomy mood. It seems to me that such a book may be too heavy for many people. However, I would recommend this book to those who crave a sad pseudo-action movie without the happy end of the textbook.
