Let's see: what are the advantages of viewing Piranha, Piranha? Well, if you have never seen anything in common with Venezuela, there are a lot of videos about events in Caracas and the countryside (and in the jungle), as well as about various indigenous people working and playing, as well as many indigenous people. Wild life. If you like William Smith, he plays a bit of a fool (as he always did). <br /> <br /> And that's it. If it were not for William Smith, this could be a film to raise funds for Save the Children or some other organization that benefits the Third World. The only time you really see a title fish is during the opening credits. No mutant murderer fish, as in Roger Korman’s piranha of the same name. You would think that there would be twice as much fish in the name, there would be twice as many monster fish on the characters, but, alas, that is not the point. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a photojournalist and her brother. to come to Venezuela to make history in one of the last untouched places on the planet, but their motivation quickly changes to the desire to find diamonds, of which, apparently, quite a lot. <br /> <br /> There is not much real action or danger in this film. What could be a thrilling motorcycle race is blunted by a mass of landscapes and shots of animals that are inserted into it to stretch the time for showing films. Until the last fifteen minutes or so, the film will not have much more action (which is probably about how long the film will last without any travels). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the only ways that a movie can really be BAD, the movie should be boring or incredibly stupid. Piranha, Piranha, of course, has the right to this former badge, and damn close to the second. The only reason I will not rate it as “1” is because the added frames are more interesting than the rest of the film.
