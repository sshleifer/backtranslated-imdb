David Bryce's comments, written nearby, are exceptionally well written and informative, as they almost say everything that I feel about Darling Lily. This massive musical is so unusual and burned out, resold and must have caused breaks in Paramount in 1970. It cost 22 million dollars! This is simply irresponsible. DARLING LILI must have been flooded with green light at a board meeting that said, “Hey, we have this guy from Pink Panther and this Sound of Music ... let's get it, too,” and handed the check. The result is a hybrid of GIGI, ZEPPELIN, HALF A SIXPENCE, several songs and MGM dance numbers of 40s style (daisies and boatmen!), So hopelessly old-fashioned, that they resembled musical porridge, and dramaturgy MATA HARI. The performance is colossal, magnificent, breathtaking, but the rest: a ridiculous romance, Julie looks confused, Hudson is already dead, an unsuccessful comedy and amazingly boring songs turn this exciting film into an annoying one. LILI is like a 1940s mega-musical with some vulgar pieces to liven up. STAR! released the year before, unfortunately, it crashed and now, finally, it is appreciated for the great film that really exists ... and Andrews looks sublime, mature, especially in the last half hour ... but Lily - Poppins and Dolly and I fanciful I guess it really killed the 60s mega musical break ... and made Andrews look like Poppins again ... which I think was not Edwards' intention. Paramount must have collectively lost consciousness when he saw this: with another 20 million dollars in the 22nd CATCH, and 12 million dollars in CLEAR DAY and 25 million dollars in PAINT YOUR WAGON .... they had a financial abyss in The proportions of CLEOPATRA with 77 million dollars are linked in 4 films with a very uncertain future. Perhaps they should have asked the visionary Daisy Gamble from “CLEARING DAY” ... LILI was very popular right after the first release in Australia and worked in 70-mm theaters for several months, but once failed in subwoofers and sticks, and only surfaced after that, it stays with CLEANED DAY for one night like a Sunday night take. Thank God, Paramount had their simple film worth $ 1 million (yes, ONE MILLION DOLLAR), and this gangster picture for $ 4 million THE GODFATHER is also ready to return all $ 77 million in just the next two years ... for only 5 million dollars. ... incredible!
