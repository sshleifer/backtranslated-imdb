I can appreciate the satire that contradicts my own views, but it must be witty and successful. This movie ... how can I explain it. This does not make the slightest attempt at refinement, much less intelligence. In fact, it is not even terrible. Dead soldiers come to life, but they are not interested in brains, only voting booths. What for? Pick up an endless stream of the most idiotic, banal, bloated crazy nonsense "bad president, bad conservatives, poor Republicans." What a smug, fucking piece of corn manure was. <br /> <br /> Even if they agree with the "points" of the episode, only the most stupid liberals will say that they liked watching it. Again, assigning the degree of stupidity to a mad, evil, hostile, anti-social and anti-halfway-normal liberal spectrum is in itself a challenge. <br /> <br /> Avoid as a liberal convention.
