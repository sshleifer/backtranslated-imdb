Unhappy movie. Do not even compare in the same breath with "Kill a Mockingbird" or "In the heat of the night." <br /> <br /> Yes, there are racial prejudices, but the film is mostly funny. <br /> <br /> Come now. Would you really like Elizabeth Patterson to guard the prison of all people in order to avoid lynching? Patterson once played the mother of everyone and was the hostess in the movie "I Love Lucy" before Fred and Ethel Mertz bought the building. <br /> <br /> Imagine that the body is removed so that a black man killed a white man from a pistol? <br /> <br /> Claude Jarman Jr., who was so incredible in 1946, “The One Year Old” appears in this mess. He still had those sad eyes. My eyes would also be sad if I appeared in this horrible film. <br /> <br /> For me, it was just a folkner flop.
