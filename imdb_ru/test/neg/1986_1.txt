This is one of the worst films I have seen lately. <br /> <br /> The problem is that he doesn’t know if he wants to be an intellectual political film, an “art” film or an erotic activity. As a result, he fails in all respects. <br /> <br /> The game is brutal, the narration is inappropriate and the alleged symbolism is meaningless. <br /> <br /> Klaus Kinski is probably the best thing in this film, but it’s not a good thing. Of course, he looks intense and “unique”, but ultimately he cannot act. Just see how he reacts when his lover goes away .... <br /> <br /> Do not really watch this film, some say that he needs repeat viewing. I say that one is too much.
