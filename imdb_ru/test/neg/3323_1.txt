Why did they release this film on us? It seems that they intended to make this film a complete slap in the face of Anne Rice and every self-respecting fan of Vampire Chronicles. He ignores the main work outlined in The Interview with the Vampire, distorts the plot of the novel and makes Stuart Townsend stumble. <br /> <br /> Stuart is NOT our Lestat! Our brother prince, our adventurous rebel with the damnest sense of humor. Stewart is a second-rate, boring rip off Dracula in black leather. He did not read books or did not know the character ... is he illiterate? Tom Cruise suffers from dyslexia, and yet he decided to read books, as well as to know and love Lestat. <br /> <br /> Don't fool yourself, this is not a “lonely” vampire film, but just rubbish.
