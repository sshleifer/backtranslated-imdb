Some spoilers **** Soap has some great moments to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica are getting closer to intimacy, this is a beautiful, restrained, truly erotic scene. I also loved music and soft muted cinematography. I'm not sure if the strange structure of the stop and the beginning of the film occurs because it is digested initially in a serialized form (the announcer describing the action in sections is rather annoying). My biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd image of a trans woman and her life. Of course, she needs to be shown as a sex worker (what else), scattered over the head, impractical, ridiculously pretentious / girlish, completely hopeless when it comes to dressing, and unable to make any interpersonal affections in the world. Moreover, she always demonstrates a two-day beard growth (for some bizarre reason) to emphasize how tasteless her life is. And she is waiting for her to have a sex change operation, when she seems to have done nothing more to promote her transition. In truth, the character resembles a transvestite, and not someone who is in the process of transition. <br /> <br /> These are typical fantasies of people from the outside who are not really connected with people. Fetching a film about surgery GRS is a way to objectify people who are experiencing a transitional period. Not impressed by this aspect of the film in the least. At least, why not play the character of someone who is really a transgender ... I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was fine, but not better than that. Much better was a woman depicting Charlotte, a very complex character, full of energy, self-loathing, desire and contradiction. If she was so fascinated by someone with feminine energy, Charlotte could go to the women's bar and find him in two seconds. Yes, she was attracted to Veronica, but rather as an abstract idea of ​​someone with male / female characteristics (gentle touch, but with a good blow), and not as a unique person. Yes, what A Soap says about love is often beautiful and touching, but this does not mean that a stereotypical minority should be stereotyped even in the process. <br /> <br /> This film also proves that Danes are lousy dancers. For such a promising premise (better made in a film like “Miscellaneous for Girls”), the final film is a disappointment.
