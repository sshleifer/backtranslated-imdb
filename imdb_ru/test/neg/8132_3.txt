I really wanted this movie to be liked, but he barely scored 3 points. It's amazing that an equal number of votes was 10, the other half 1. All the characters were interesting and even talented, but on the whole the film did not pay off, Sebastian Hernandez is attractive; charismatic and pleasant (he even looks like Mark Anthony in a more accessible, but ultimately conscious way ...), but even he could not save this film mess. The scenes dragged on for too long, and the glasses were eventually scored to death. The banana scene bordered on self-absorption, apparently showing how much movement his boxers had. But in his defense, this was his first film as a director (of which I know), and I appreciate his work of love. It just left me empty, despite what I was trying to say. Ultimately, I think the story would have been better handled by a more experienced director. From what I saw in the “add-ons”, there is a real story behind this, and maybe when I finish watching them, I will be more grateful for this attempt.
