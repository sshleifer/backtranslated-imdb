This television show is stereotyped and contrived in many aspects. <br /> <br /> First of all, the setting. All characters attend PCA, this incredible boarding school with painted, stylish dormitories. There are no reasonable rules on campus, for example, boys are often seen in girls' hostels and vice versa. But this may simply be because the hostel adviser, a stupid character who mostly misses the viewer instead of amusing them, as I suppose her goal should be, is idle and does nothing. I have friends in boarding schools, and they laugh at many aspects of the school on this show. <br /> <br /> Further heroes. I was so disappointed to find that Nickelodeon was not at all creative with the personalities on this show. All of them reflect traits that are exaggerated to the extreme: supposedly Zoe is perfect in everything she does (looks, grades, sports, guys, judgments, creativity, etc.), Michael is an athlete, Logan is an arrogant jerk who basically does nothing but irritate all the characters, as well as poor viewers, Nicole is a neat idiot who knows nothing but somehow maintains straightforwardness, Dana was a cool girl, Quinn was an unrealistic “smart kid” over whom they chuckle all the time, chase is a guy to She is afraid to admit her “true feelings”, which really sharpens me when the show goes on, and this new girl - Lola or something like that - is just another clone of Nicole. <br /> <br /> The two main characters that annoy me the most are Zoe and Quinn. First of all, I just do not understand the character of Zoe. Obviously, she was created to be a “perfect” character, as I said above, but she seems to be the most flawed of all - in most episodes she creates a problem and then has to fix it. What is frustrating is that we have to love her and think that she is amazing when they have not even created a very realistic character to begin with. <br /> <br /> Quinn, on the other hand, worries me because she is exaggerated to such an extent that her character is absolutely offensive. From Nick, I get the impression of her character, that “geeks” and “nerds” are people you can laugh at, criticize, scoff at. In the spring break episode, which they did a year ago, they introduced two more “nerds”, whom the characters had to be made “cool”. I found this very offensive and stereotypical. What message does Nick send these children? Is it so: do not succeed in school, do not get good grades, do not study hard - you will become a fan, and we will mock your profession in future TV series! Because this is definitely a message I get from these poorly designed characters, and this is a terrible message through and through. <br /> <br /> All I can do is hope that Nick will understand this one day by suppressing smart people. in our world they are of no use to anyone.
