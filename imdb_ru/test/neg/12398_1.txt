Imagine the worst horror story in a b-movie that you can find. Add more holes than the plot. The script should be at the 10-year-old. Ask A-Level dramaturgy actors to fake really bad American accents (on the Isle of Man!) Add monster-special effects that B & W Dr Who fans will appreciate. The result: a muffled movie. Add Samantha Janus, who removes her clothes (put it on the cover), and you will probably sell enough copies to make a profit in any case!
