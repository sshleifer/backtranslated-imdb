I usually love the teen / school genres, but this film really lacked originality. The only assumption is that this film has four friends who cheat on their way to high school and how it affects their friendship. There is not enough depth in the plot or characters to attract viewers to the entire movie. Acting is not so bad, although the actors really have nothing to work on, because the dialogue is jokes and cliches ”... After watching this movie, you need to wonder how the producer could come across such a project, as well as think:“ I MUST make this movie. ” Not surprisingly, it could not get a theatrical release. Andrew Gurland is a hack, escape or burn.
