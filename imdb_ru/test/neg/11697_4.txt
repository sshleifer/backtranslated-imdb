No serious spoilers, but some very minor. <br /> <br /> Acacia, a Korean contribution to the ever-popular wave of Asian horror, concerns husband and wife, who decide that they get along a bit and decide to adopt a child. A child who is usually obsessed with a dead tree in a family garden eventually disappears when a couple eventually has their own child, and the above-mentioned tree seems to be displeased against the family itself. <br /> <br /> And this is about it. The film moves at a snail's speed in more than 100 minutes with an 80-minute material. In fact, this is a fine family drama with a creepy tree, and on the way scares very little, only shots of the tree with strange mumbling sounds playing from above. Nevertheless, the idea that the tree is the mother of a child is quite original, but it is not fully used to the full. This view separates "Akatsia" from most of the new wave that it belongs to: films such as Ju-On and Ring tend to do the opposite, and ideas with a milky taste, until they turn red on the face. <br /> <br /> The film is starting to end; However, the awareness of the child’s fate and the actions of the parent not only weakens the former curiosity of this story, but also is revealed through the editing of a machine gun that is difficult to perceive at once. The final sequence is undoubtedly creepy, but it seems too late and late. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is not very similar to the “Ring”, but with the “renaissance of the film”, in which Korea is now experiencing, I could not help but feel that this film could be much larger.
