The Toothpick Mill was one of Mary Ann Evans' smaller novels, written under the pseudonym of the man George Eliot. I tried to read this boring and very rude novel many years ago, but I could not finish it. I will consider this version of the film only essentially, because I do not know how accurately it follows the original novel. <br /> <br /> The opening credits of the film are printed in Old English, which suggests the Middle Ages. period, and therefore it is a very bad choice for a 19th century setting film. (On the other hand, about halfway through the film, we see a close-up of the flyer advertising the real estate auction. This flyer is framed in genuine Victorian type fonts and looks * very * convincing.) Most of this film is extremely convincing in its description of architecture and clothing England early 19th century. The exact location of the plot of this film is never revealed, but - judging by the actors' accents - I would put it as somewhere in the Cotswolds, perhaps in Warwickshire. <br /> <br /> The plot that it contains includes a mill, which several times (in a couple of decades) changes hands between two competing families, one rich and one working. I disagree with another IMDb reviewer who claims that James Mason plays only a small role in this film. Mason plays the biggest and most important role in this drama, as the heir to a richer family. Like the spoiled and irritable Tom Tulliver, Mason is darkly thoughtful and impulsive. His performance here belongs to the best film: it made me want to see “Wuthering Heights” with Mason in the role of Heathcliff. <br /> <br /> Since this is a multi-generational saga (what George Eliot did a lot better than Middlemarch), several major roles in this film are divided between two actors in each: children-actors in the prologue, adults in main narrative. The prologue of this film is a very well written scene in which Tom Tulliver is considered to be deliberate and ruffian from an early age, and the young Philip Wakeham is decent and thoughtful. Due to hard work, Philip earned a halfpenny: Tom tries to drive him away from himself, but does not want to take the coin with brute force: he wants Philip * to give it to him. All the child actors in this film, men and women, are talented and attractive. Unfortunately, all children speak in their dialogue with chic accents that are very different from the accents of actors and actresses who play the same roles as adults. This discrepancy draws attention to the entertainment of the material. Unfortunately, none of the later scenes are as good as this prologue. <br /> <br /> The culmination is a crowd of workers during a rainstorm, much better shot and photographed than previous scenes. But modern viewers (at least in Britain) can no longer take this material seriously. To date, almost every British comedian has performed the comedy program “Trouble in the Mill, Squire”, parodying this particular topic, so it was difficult for me to watch this film with an imperturbable face. <br /> <br /> Character Actress Martita Hunt is good in a small role, but the opening credits (in that Old English font) are a typo in her name “Marita”. I rate this boring movie 3 points out of 10: one point for a play by James Mason, an early scene with children, and genuine Victorian typing on this auctioneer.
