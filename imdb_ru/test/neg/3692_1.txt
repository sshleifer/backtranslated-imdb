In Moscow, priest Owen (Vincent Gallo) hires a team that leads him to the underworld to find his friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzia) missing, exploring the legend of the existence of demons and entering hell under the city. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD based on the name of Kilmer and interesting cover photos. I’m completely disappointed, since this film is one of the worst films I’ve ever seen. I do not understand how Val Kilmer took part in this performance. There are two shameful comments in IMDb advertising this film, and they are usually fake, written by users who have only one review on this site. There are two possible ways to watch this boring and horrible movie: my wife and I dozed many times due to the monotony of this meaningless story, and we used the DVD rewind button to repeat every lost scene. However, the correct way was to use fast-forward or stop buttons to complete this shit faster. My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Cidade Sombria" ("Dark City")
