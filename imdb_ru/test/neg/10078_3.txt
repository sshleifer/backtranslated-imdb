It is clear that for this film they wanted the storyline to move in characters. But immediately the storyline makes you not to love the new main characters. The span over the island and the dinosaurs below had no effect at all and looked almost like a cartoon. Entering all of the actions on the island is just a search of parts from JP 1 and 2. The storyline is predictable to irritation, and its completely unsatisfactory end left me feeling deceived. I had no choice but to award a 3/10 movie!
