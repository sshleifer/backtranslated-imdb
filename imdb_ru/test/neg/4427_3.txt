Jackie Chan's early film, where there are no signs of the Chan person we know. This is Chen in a full historical story of revenge that has been cloned and re-cloned by countless producers and studios throughout Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China. This is a very serious story, in which there is not a single humor and warmth that would lead Jackie Chan to a superstar. It also shows that if he hadn’t reinvented himself, we would never have recognized him, because his career would have been painfully short. Like a film, it is a beautiful, but rather unremarkable film. I watched him in the midst of a daily marathon of martial arts films, and he would have mixed with any other film I watched that day if I hadn’t noticed Jackie in the film. Honestly, I don’t think the film is really worth worrying about (there are too many other best options), unless you’re curious to see how Jackie Chan started.
