Reading the book, I again felt embroiled in Castle Rock (“Essential Things” are the last part of the “Rock” trilogy), and the plot was a version of a “demon comes to a small village” story that King loves to tell. All characters were described with love, and this caused both psychological and terrible horror. The film on the other hand is terrible. The interactions of characters and the cunning plot are gone, and they were replaced by a story that tries to be exciting, but misses a mile. If you have not read the book, you may like it, otherwise avoid at all costs, as with most films from King’s books.
