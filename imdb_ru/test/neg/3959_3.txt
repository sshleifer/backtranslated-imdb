The word "honor" should be erased from the dictionaries of all nations. This aggravates male dumbness and is responsible for the deaths of millions of innocent people. Anyone who disagrees should not continue to read this comment. <br /> <br /> As you can expect from these writers, Yakuza is a fascinating crime thriller with great respect for the ethnic background on which it is located. played out. Friends of blood and violence, too, will not be disappointed, but especially towards the end, violence becomes somewhat meaningless, redundant, and utterly stupid. Unlike other reviewers, I found that Robert Mitchum’s performance was not very good. This is an actor who has definitely not improved with age. He looks like a tired janitor (this doesn’t fit very well with this detail), and his detachment, which in such early years made him such an impressive presence on the screen, manifests itself either in confusion or lack of interest. Ken Takakura and Richard Jordan are very good as a man of honor and young, intelligent, feeling goons, respectively. <br /> <br /> The best way to endure this film is to see it as a tragic comedy. Things are set in motion by the fact that the character Mitchum asks the character of Takakura for a favor based on incorrect assumptions. The mistake quickly becomes apparent, but a sense of honor requires that they not retreat. So they start sneaking around, shooting in all directions, owning swords and destroying their friend's artistic apartment (although the guy begs them to stop it, please, "during the appropriate battle.) The bodies start to accumulate and the story ends with Mitchum the character makes his point of view: if you give him your little finger, I'll give you mine. Well, that's the least he can do, isn't it? So he pulls out a knife, sighs and starts sawing off the specified limb (behind the scenes, fortunately). moment which is probably dol I was really solemn. It just made me laugh. <br /> <br /> The use of the seats in this film is very good. I especially liked the scenes in the International Conference Hall on Lake Takaragayke and around it, the interesting futuristic building of the architect Sachio Otani (The Kyoto Protocol was signed there.) which is about architecture and nothing else.
