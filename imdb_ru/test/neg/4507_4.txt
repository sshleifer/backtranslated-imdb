This is a horror movie based on numbers with Richard Crenna and Joanna Pett as a duet of a psychologist who buys an old mansion and invites a small team of friends and patients to help clean up the place. Unbeknownst to them, the mansion harbors a cellar door - the gate to hell. If you're in the mood for a horror movie clich√©, look no further, but if you want something ingenious, then you won't like this little movie. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (Rather muffled, although the scene where the guy cuts his hand with a saw is a rather awful mind. Fans of inventive death scenes will not like it, because every character seems to be electrocuted in some sort of). <br /> <br /> NYUDITI: $ (Needless to say. Mary Louise Weller adds a beautiful appearance, but her character was not sufficiently developed). <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ (Highlighted, but nevertheless worthy of sight. There is nothing new in this genre, but the cast of Victor Buono, who is about as threatening as Santa's, seems to be , attracted several viewers). <br /> <br /> ACTION: $$ (Best performances - Krenna and Pett with other actors just ring up their roles. The writer cannot develop any characters other than the character Pett, and he seems to have forgotten about Mary Louise Weller (Animal House), which disappears for about twenty minutes and appears only in the electric chair, like everyone else in a boring manner).
