SPOILER!! Awful camera work, terrible writing, non-existent plot and many whole plots. Great game! With the exception of Julia Roberts. Someone who plays poorly someone who claims to be Julia Roberts is bad. In this film, Catherine Zeta-Jones is charming. <br /> <br /> During the film, we repeatedly scale up each of the twelve (!) Characters. Twelve is too much, even for classics like 12 Angry Men. And the problem is that we tediously increase the characters when they are all in the same room and do the same thing. <br /> <br /> Yes, Clooney is eating. Yes, Pitt eats. Yes, the "Jew" is eating. Yes, the geek is eating. Yes, the bodybuilder is eating. Yes, Mr. Sensitive is eating. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes Yes. Yeah. Phew! This happens at least three times in the film. Yes, they are all sitting in cars, boring. Yes, they are all arrested, scared. Yes, they are all taken out of prison in depression. <br /> <br /> But only when I was at home did I understand how much they “caught” me on this. This is a movie heist, right? That's what I went to see, right? But when I entered and installed the keys to the car in the bank, I realized that in this film, nothing will be stolen! Like this. This is a robbery of a film where nothing is stolen. Oh, they are trying. They are trying to steal some boring document or something from some guy's house (whatever), and it turns out that it has already been stolen. 20 minutes of my life wasted. Then they try to steal some egg from some museum (YAWN!), And they screw it up and arrest it. <br /> <br /> Then we see how some fabulous French guy stole an egg before they did it, and we Get all the joy of the "Capture", except that this time the person is in a narrow overalls, dancing around fake lasers, ... an ugly skinny Frenchman. Um <br /> <br /> But it turns out that he didn’t actually steal the egg either. In fact, our heroes stole a LOOOONG egg back, in another movie, which would be a BIG movie if they made this movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, we see a 30-second clip in black and white. and white about how they robbed a college student from his backpack. You heard that I ... daring caper, the final heist - the accumulation of these two and a half hours of absolutely boring shit - they steal a backpack from a college student, creatively engaging in the fight for the baseball team and distracting him, and replacing his backpack with an identical backpack? What kind?? <br /> <br /> Ugh. I tell you, it was so bad, I didn’t even realize how bad it was - how much I was robbed - until I returned home.
