The discussion took place a thousand times. Is the Venetian merchant an anti-Semite? (I think this is so.) Is it not unfair to always point to this little piece of anti-Semitism in another great work of art? (I think it is not.) Does this play color Shakespeare's reputation as the greatest playwright in the world? (I think this is so.) Does this role play if he did not do it with a specific racist goal? (I think not.) Michael Radford knew all this, and that is why he added in his film a prologue about the plight of the Jews in Venice in the Renaissance. <br /> <br /> In vain; since the game remains what it always was, and the new cosmetics only gives the first (but vain) hope that someone dared to correct something that remains a constant outrage, not because his degree of anti-Semitism would be particularly shocking, but because the play goes under the name of William Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Why waste so much time depicting hatred of a person - Shylock? Why hire such a great and serious actor like Al Pacino if at the end everything collapses in this outrageous (but hey, I am not responsible — Shakespeare-wrote-it) scene of the courtroom. And now I would like to be very precise, like Shylock himself. <br /> <br /> He claims his right, according to the contract, which is - not very responsible - Christian Antonio, who always looked down on him, signed in full understanding of the consequences. Of course, what Shylock requires is cruel and useless, but this is not the main thing. What we see (or should see) is the person who has been humiliated all his life to such an extent that all that remains on him is his hatred. I think, of course, it is a little inappropriate to lecture such a person about such things as compassion. <br /> <br /> But what makes the play / movie (they are now the same thing) is ... become a soap opera! A cruel madman with his knife, a frightened (but rather narrow-minded) public, a poor “victim” tied to his chair. True, Antonio accepts his fate, but why can't he just say one word “forgive”? I think we don’t need to lose a lot of words about the ridiculous sentence of the young Dottor from Padua; this is indeed a “popular verdict,” not much different from what would have been seen 400 years later in the Nazi demonstration process. From minute to minute, this Jew is deprived of everything he owns, sentenced to baptism and expelled. <br /> <br /> Isn't it outrageous ??? Obviously not. The story goes to the romantic subtleties of the rings and their happy ending. <br /> <br /> In the Libeskind Jewish Museum in Berlin and other similar places of the world one can learn that anti-Semitism often goes unnoticed by the masses. because what is so destructive for a minority or some people is inherent in the supposedly greater blessing for the majority. The task of each of us should be aimed at developing sensitivity, to identify and expose such trends. <br /> <br /> I do not accept the excuse that this film was created in order to evoke sympathy for a poorly crafted Shylock (it just does not work). I do not think anyone can be forced into mercy. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie; in particular, not for Oscar.
