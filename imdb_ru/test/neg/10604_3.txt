This is surprisingly bad fighter. I would say that its main disadvantage is that it is boring. Arghh! Cool cabinets, retro-chic design scenery and decent cinematography can not prevent this film from becoming a fool. The second (main) drawback of Mod Squad is the lack of character development, which is emphasized by the lack of talent among actors. I like the work of Claire Danes, so I was quite surprised by her non-existent performance in this film. Giovanni Ribisi is terribly mistaken: how can his clumsy, awkward acting style fit into an ACTION movie? As for Omar Epps, well, he needs to take some acting lessons to learn emotions. The man had the same facial expression for the whole movie! My suggestion is to save a few dollars and wait to see this turkey on the cable.
