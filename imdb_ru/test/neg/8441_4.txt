Piranha begins, as expected, stupid white people are going to discover new lands and exploit them. For a while, I thought it might be a film about cannibalism. It begins, like many others, showing only shots of the untouched Amazon rain forest. As far as I know, it could be Florida. At this point, you believe that animal injuries or local residents will appear. Instead, you get the acting talents of William Smith, who played the main role in the movie â€œLA Weiss "and" Angels will die. " He plays Caribe, a famous hunter whom I would call Jack Palans Light. He is more tall, but not quite the perfection of Jack Palance. As for the Aborigines, you really are not so many. Where is piranha? Should I even ask this question? Probably now Karibe is hunting people. He really does not pursue anyone until the end of the film, just looks at them. Caribe makes a race on one of the motorcycle riders in an overly dramatic Smokey and Bandit style. Calling a motorcycle is not for any real reason, but the sequence of actions. I can not tell you how many times I have seen a tourist challenge a stranger in a motorcycle race in the jungle. Never really. Do they live, do they die? Will you take care? Anyone want to ride a motorcycle? Caution: this film contains a very dry look. My advice is to rent a classic Jack Palance, for example Craze.
