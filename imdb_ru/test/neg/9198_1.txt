If you collect all the cliches about city firefighters in 105 minutes; you have Staircase 49. <br /> <br /> She has a story, but sheâ€™s very clouded. It turns into a film that is with every event; it becomes so predictable that you should not look. There is no depth in this story, and even acting is superficial. <br /> <br /> It seemed that she wanted to be a tribute to the firefighter, but in the end it turned out to be boring and pretentious. The parallel between Jack Morrison, mortally trapped under the inaccessible part of the building, and firefighters trapped under the rubble of the Twin Towers was too obvious. <br /> <br /> This is not comparable with films such as Backdraft and, of course, does not set an example for future films about firefighters.
