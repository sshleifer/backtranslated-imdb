For a while, when I was between jobs, I had a habit of watching all the evening talk shows. For a while I had a good choice: Conan, Leno, Letterman, Ferguson, Kimmel ... <br /> <br /> Until I reached the time interval of 1:30 am. The time between Conan and the X-Files, on SciFi. And the only show at the time was (and, oddly enough, still) Carson Daly. <br /> <br /> His show first intrigued me. Young, casually dressed and with a trendy pedigree of an MTV presenter, I thought Carson would bring aesthetics younger until late at night. I could not be more wrong. <br /> <br /> He has no comedy time. His jokes are obviously unfunny, and his monologue is a painful occupation with self-confident babble. I began to think that he was simply not capable of putting on a comedy (and I’m right, he is not capable), but over time it became obvious that the writers on the show must have understood this for him. The letter was idiotic and overloaded, and the parody screamed terribly. And closer to the end of the show, while in the studio, the authors forced Carson to drink alcohol on the set with pleasure at every show, forgetting that Carson was smiling from an exhausted cheek to an exhausted cheek, wading through an interview. <br /> <Zero interview skills. No one. He tries to be friendly / talkative, but eventually he’s getting rude and rude. He talks too much. He cuts off his guests. He asks them rude or embarrassing questions - can he find a question to ask them at all. And, as someone has already pointed out, the guests literally look at him or writhe in their places, clearly uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Now the show has left the studio and looks as if it was shot on one convenient camera. Even still, Carson refuses to accept a hint from NBC. At some point, Carson did not even have an operator, he had to be shot for an episode! Wake up, Carson ... this handwriting all over the wall. <br /> <br /> I see that the series is produced by Carson. I can only assume that for this reason he is still on the air, he pays for it himself.
