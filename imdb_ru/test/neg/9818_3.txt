In essence, an unremarkable B-film that was mysteriously shot by one of the main talents of the golden era, Fritz Lang. Even with the stellar names of Lang, Walter Pijon, Joan Bennett and George Sanders, be prepared for a ridiculous storyline, bad actions, obviously fake sets and errors. For the sake of transparency, I have to admit that I am not a passionate fan of Walter Pijon, who was fortunate enough to find a niche in the MGM artificial dream factory, and somehow he worked in supporting roles, supporting Greer Garcon and others. He is wildly mistaken, acting in the cheerful tone of the comedy of the 30s Ray Milland extravagant, in the role where his life is in danger, and he is hiding. Joan Bennettâ€™s emphasis on the Cockney is excessive, but her lacquered hair, perfect makeup and stylish outfit contradict the street girl Cockney from the slums. George Sanders is incapable of doing bad things, but disappears after the ridiculous discovery finds that Pijon somehow pretends to shoot Adolf Hitler. Surprisingly for Fritz Lang is the uneven tone. I found the film hesitantly hesitated between random moments of an unknown thriller surrounded by carefree comedy interaction. Hitchcock reversed the ratio, using comic relief to step on hold from time to time. There is a reason why this film is unknown. He did not serve and did not contribute to anyone's career or reputation, and they forget about him, because this is an amazingly bad film from such a purebred group.
