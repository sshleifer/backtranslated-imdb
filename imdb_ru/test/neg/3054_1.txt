Dear friends, I have never seen such a trash movie like "NIGHT OF DEMONS" (1988). It seems that director Kevin Tenney intended to copy a classic similar to Sam Raimi's Evil Death (1978) or The Return of the Living Dead by George Romero of the same year. The cinematography was bad, the film was very dark, so I had to turn the dimmer to maximum. Indeed, horror paintings should be dark, but not like “NIGHT OF DEMONS”. The whole film was ridiculous, without expectation, the worst actors, except Alvin Alexis as Roger, and the terrible makeup effects. The average voice of 5 stars for this movie? I can not believe this. Perhaps the users were happy with actresses' boobs, asses and pussies, they were really worth 5 stars. Regards, Hans-Dieter
