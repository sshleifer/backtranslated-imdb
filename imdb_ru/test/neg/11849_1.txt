<br /> <br /> ********** SPOILER WARNING *************** <br /> <br /> If you like JURASSIC PARK 1, 2 or 3: <br /> <br /> If you really like really bad movies for their true entertainment value, if not for their quality (John Carpenterâ€™s DARK STAR is especially recommended) <br /> <br /> If you like films about dinosaurs in general, <br /> <br /> DON'T STOP FROM THIS KINEMATIC SERVICE! <br /> <br /> Shameless use of video from CARNOSAUR 1 & 2 Make the most of this pitiful attempt to throw a Dinosaur / Slasher. Take, for example, the scene where the guard meets his doom on the jaws of Alpha T-Rex. For some reason, he falls about 50 pounds and seems 10 years younger. Why? Just because this scene was filmed directly from CARNOSAUR, which was a crazy flick to begin with. <br /> <br /> The ending was an exact copy of CARNOSAUR 2, for those who were not lucky to get through this direct video loser. Again, we see Mr. Rex battling a bulldozer - which alternates like a forklift - through a miracle-ta-da! - frames from the above CARNOSAUR 1 and 2. Of course, the ending is exactly the same, the beast dies just as the complex lights up. <br /> <br /> A real insult to one's mind. <br /> <br /> But it's still better than watching the ROSIE O 'DONNEL SHOW show. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * of ***** <br /> <br />
