Well, I agree with all the Barney haters on this site. I think Barney and his friends are all ugly and nasty, and the show is very one-sided and unreal. <br /> <br /> But what impressed me most was how Barney introduced gays, lesbians and bisexuals to his show when talking about same-sex parents and relatives. It would not be a big problem if the creators of this show did not use so many derogatory stereotypes of homosexuals. I mean, not all gay men wear mascara and love the colors purple and pink, and not all lesbians look ugly and courageously with a bosom that goes down on their stomachs. As a bisexual woman, I just think it's terrible for a children's show. If it was South Park, I would not mind, because South Park is designed for people who can distinguish fantasy from reality. Many people who watch Barney are small children or people with disabilities who usually cannot tell the difference between fantasy and reality. <br /> <br /> And now, when I think about it, Barney himself looks like an ugly gay stereotype. Let's see, he has no girl, he is pink and wears sequined clothes (yes, thatâ€™s true) on him. If you say you are advocating for gay and bisexual rights, stop mocking them in front of people who know nothing better. If Barney went crazy and ate fried chicken and watermelon at the same time, the show would be off the air before you knew it. <br /> <br /> I give this show a negative of five. Do not show your children such hateful nonsense. There are children's shows that are less offensive.
