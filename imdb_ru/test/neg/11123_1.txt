"Chupacabra: Dark Waters" is considered one of the most tasteless retarded films in history. I was expecting at least some bearable entertainment, because John Rhys Davies participated in it, and, having watched this film, I can honestly say that I have significantly reduced my opinion about Mr. Davis. <br /> <br /> Why? The game is incredibly poor. A great actor, such as Davis, had to demand more from the actors and the director. It was painfully obvious that Mr. Davis was just watching the clock and hoping that the check would not bounce. To say that he had just appeared would be an understatement. But at least he appeared. The rest of the cast looks as if they sent it by mail from work in various restaurants in Los Angeles, where they work as waiters. Talk about throwing unknowns! This is such a cast that never appears in the movies again. They behave as if they were bugged while waiting in an unemployment office. <br /> <br /> How about special effects? The store bought fireworks, styrofoam, a cheap rubber suit, and CGI effects that look like they came from my 1980 Atari game. I saw some terrible special effects used in the movies of the Sci-Fi Channel, but this material looked like a clipping and insert made in kindergarten by someone elseâ€™s child. I expected Mr. Krabs and Sponge-Bob to appear at the end to fight the Chupacabra. Not to mention that all creature descriptions describe it as a small gremlin-like creature. It would be a good movie for a character like Leprechaun. Instead, we get a giant sluggish creature that is depicted walking with accelerated action stopping effects that are ridiculous. The chupacabra is in one place, and then shuffles along the corridor at super speed, and one has only to laugh to see it.
