Are we serious? I mean, wow ... just wow. I think I saw this click in the old issue of War Journal. It's a pity, originality is completely dead, instead of trying to formulate a new idea, we get a soft remake of the old storyline, and in order to "switch it", we simply change the gender or race of the original character. idiots and everyone should be tired of looking at it ... but I think it's just a rant, and most likely it will fall with a deaf ear to absorb the sound of another poop hitting toilet water like the best western from 3:10 Yume ... (wait) ... 3:10 Yume! Thank you, Hollywood, for killing the film as an art form and turning it into a commercial pen from neo-pop-junk and a glaring delay ... great !!!
