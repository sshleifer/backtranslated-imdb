you are likely to be very disappointed with this sequel, which is not a sequel. FULLY is a classic. But this film is not as classic as you can imagine. What a joke. inactive. and funny funny story, quickly and unconvincingly (not to mention fleeting), filmed with about one third of the film left. I mentioned that the story is less than lame. the film, yet stupid to be funny in any good way. the rating he currently has (4.8 / 10) is too generous if you ask me. My rating for American werewolf in Paris: 3.5 / 10
