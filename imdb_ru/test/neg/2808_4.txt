I did not expect too much from this film, but I was still disappointed. It should be a comedy, but there are only four or five scenes where I really laughed, and I think this is pretty bad. There is no real plot either, I always had the feeling that most of the scenes could have been put anywhere in the film, because there is no connection between them. But worst of all was the “game” of Kim Franke. He has ONE facial expression throughout the entire film, as if he were supposed to play some kind of mentally retarded guy, but I think it is not. In general, I rate this four out of ten, I have seen worse films than this one, but I would no longer spend money on this film.
