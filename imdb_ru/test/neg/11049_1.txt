This comment is intended primarily as a warning to people who may be attracted to the name of his (temporarily) high user rating, which I find frankly mysterious. The reasons why I didn’t like this headline were as follows: <br /> <br /> 1. The director must have had some doubts whether to make a film like Jackie Chan or a dark Oedipus tragedy. As a result, from the point of view of the genre, the film falls between two stools, since the tragic and comic elements collide and mutually destroy, rather than form a harmonious whole. <br /> <br /> 2. The motives and behavior of the characters are incoherent and unconvincing. Unfortunately, the psychological truth and logic are absent. <br /> <br /> 3. Absurd casting. I do not blame the actors, because it is difficult to create a convincing character, acting alone, if the script has scant logic. However, why between the two leading actors the difference in the age of about 15 years is obvious, whose age in the film can not differ by more than 3-4? <br /> <br /> 4. For me, the film was a bad entertainment, primarily because of point 2. If you cannot find a character you can sympathize with, it is difficult to follow the story with interest. When you finally find out the cause of the incident with the main character, it does not make sense. <br /> <br /> 5. Some films, besides being interesting, also make you think. After watching this film, I began to wonder if the thought that the director was trying to provoke was not the idea that incestuous relationships could be completely useful and delightful. I can not put any other design for the final. <br /> <br /> 6. The film is replete with completely unnecessary violence. Violence in a film (and elsewhere) is good if it serves an important and worthy goal. The goals may be different, and I do not want to go into this broad topic. Let me just say that I don’t mind violence in films like Salvation of Private Ryan, Passion of the Christ, or Pulp Fiction. In Oldboy, scenes of torture and suffering are long and graphic (or aural). What for? I dont know. Personally, I do not feel any pleasure from what I watch as teeth are removed with a hammer, or I hear people cut off the tongue with scissors, and then he sees how he suffocates from his own blood, etc. D. And so on. The film reminds me a bit Japanese porn manga in fixation on incest and panties of young Asian girls, urinating and the like. There seems to be a minority that really enjoys such things. If you are one of them, you might like this movie. <br /> <br /> In short, I do not recommend this film either as entertainment or as food for thought. Where it is not stupid, it is disgusting. Do not waste your time.
