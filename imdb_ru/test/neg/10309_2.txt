Do not worry, looking at the cover of the DVD, Sandra Bullock just in this iconic classic appears only 5 minutes. The value of entertainment here is very high. <br /> <br /> What are some of the many highlights you should pay attention to: <br /> <br /> - Doubled angry voices of the main bad guys - Special camera for the gun - Strange Masks and killer killer outfits - Spectacular ways to catch a bullet and hit the ground - Abundance of shots from the bottom up - Spatial scene in which Bullock falls unconscious on the street - Italian mafiosi due to the clichÃ© Mo (LaMotta) - Cheap synthesizer background music - fascinating overworking weapon fetishism > <br /> Last but not least important: super banal scene fistfight. I wish there were more of them ... <br /> <br /> An additional remark for the successful attempt to make me laugh out loud.
