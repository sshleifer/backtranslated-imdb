My name is Earl (2005). <br /> <br /> Review: ...... I saw it. <br /> <br /> This is something else. First, how is it rated so highly? I can not understand this. This “show” is filled with either annoying people, or stupid, or just incredible. "Fun" disgusting. <br /> <br /> I saw one episode when Brother Earl’s wife wrapped herself up and washed herself in a dead fish. No kidding. It was not funny, it is disgusting. Then she and Earl's very stupid brother (and I mean nonsense) had sex. I almost felt sick. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the most desperate comedy attempts in a long time. Jason Lee - a talented actor, but he was in a helpless role in this terrible "comedy." <br /> <br /> Earl is in jail this season. Hopefully, he will get an armchair only so that this show will relieve from suffering. <br /> <br /> Last word: this show would be fun for people who think Larry Cable is a funny guy. For the rest of the world is NOT a CHANCE. Avoid the plague.
