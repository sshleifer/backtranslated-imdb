What are Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. doing in this? Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic article about problems in low-income schools. While the topic is a topic that needs to be addressed, the film uses all the cliches in the genre and looks like a popcorn click from the textbook. Characters are clippings from the city version of the Breakfast Club or even the faculty. Watch this with your children when they turn 13 or 14 years old. With them, this can be a lesson on current social issues. For those who are older, it will be nothing more than something that you can look at and give a damn at 4 am, as I recently did on Bravo. In fact, what did it do for Bravo?
