If it is true that the film was worth only 150 thousand, then this explains a lot. But this does not explain why he does not have a real plot. In the middle of the film, to be honest, I didnâ€™t care whether they came out or not. I just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed. The ending was very stupid and made me wish that I just turned off the film and went to bed early. Pretty good acting, considering that there was nothing special. If you like really bad movies with terrible lighting (even for a cave) and poor camera work (even for a cave) ... then you will really like this movie. By the way, if the boy's plane crashed in 1980, when he was about 10 years or so, how could he forget how to speak and cause so much anger? Wouldn't he like to get help from the first people he saw, even if it were 14 years later?
