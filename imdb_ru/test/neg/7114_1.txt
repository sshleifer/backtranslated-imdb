When you first sit down to watch this movie, keep in mind that you are going to see something that you probably never saw before. Keep in mind that this is a film in which they obviously spent MUCH money on explosions and not enough on actions or anything else for that matter. The crazy thing I noticed is that each character is portrayed too much, and it seems (in any case, in most cases) that the film was “sped up” to get the characters to move faster! (I wonder if the Hong Kong version was also dubbed?) I understand that the cartoon had this, but it does not work for live action. It looks strange ... as if the film crew decided to act, because they could not afford real actors. <br /> <br /> The English version is terribly duplicated, and the words of the character do not correspond to the mouth at all. I would prefer subtitles, but since this is a children's film, and some children do not read well, I will let it go. But there is something very strange about this movie. This is supposedly a children's film, but there is a lot of material about SEX, RAPE and STRIPPING, which is not quite suitable for a young western audience. (In the East, they have different laws and sexuality in children's films is much more accepted). But parents warn! There is a scene where two characters talk about rape, several scenes where people say "sex maniac" and a scene where this insanely young Japanese girl performs a sexy dance for one of the "sex maniacs" and shows him his chest! Who was this film for? <br /> <br /> Yes, and the special effects are ridiculous. You can say that the spaceships that bombed the village are cardboard cutouts (or animation, I was not sure) that look unconvincing even to a child. The creators of this film missed a lot of interesting things from the cartoon just because they could not allocate the money that they need. I didn’t like how the names of all the characters changed ... I was surprised that this movie was made by the same people as Dragon Ball Z. <br /> <br /> I don’t really recommend this movie for everyone. Kids, adults or Dragon Ball Z fans. This is just a bad representation of the cartoon, and you can obviously be told that this film was hastily and there was no concern for it. I will not even go into the shooting ... just wait until the end credits on a still image that sits there for 2 minutes ... most of the pictures are in the correct frame, EVERYTHING, and the film seems to be made by amateurs. The quality of the granular film too. <br /> <br /> Just awful around !!!! <br /> <br />
