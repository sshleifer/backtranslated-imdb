MirrorMask was a terribly disappointing film for me. I expected a lot from the production of Jim Henson and found favorable reviews comparing it with the Labyrinth and Alice in Wonderland. Unfortunately, the film got into one of these “content films”. <br /> <br /> Most children dream of escaping from home to go to a circus, Elena is a child who grew up in a circus (child labor, anyone?) who wants to escape in order to join real life. Helen wants her mother to fall dead, which is a bad move for a spoiled boy with a princess complex in a children's fantasy movie. The next thing you know, Helena's mother turns upside down, and for some reason she is suddenly transferred to another world. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I felt as if I had been taken to the Museum of Modern Art with a pair of Misty glasses with shades of sepia. <br /> <br /> At first, there was an interesting showcase of CGI creatures and backgrounds, and I liked Orbital Giants. However, after a few minutes, he became a bit tedious, and I felt my mind wandering ... <br /> <br /> Without a sense of narration, clips and soundtracks in the style of MTV (the sphinxes reminded me of Jackson's Basement) ? “I didn’t feel involved in the plight of the protagonist, and was also upset when we waited for the film to lead us anywhere, I hope, to the theater’s exit signs ...
