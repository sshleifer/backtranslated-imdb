The only reason I know that this film exists is because I wanted to see what Nancy McKeon has been doing since the Facts of Life ended. When I was looking for her name, this relatively new TV movie appeared. After long investigations, I managed to find a copy, and I was completely disappointed that I looked. D Cool game, bad script, terrible FX - it looked like watching a softer, more stunned version of Day After Tomorrow, which lasted 3 hours. Despite the long time the characters remain underdeveloped, we do not care for them in the slightest degree and in most cases we long for their death. Combine this with terrible lighting and cinematography, and you get a real disaster of the film. The way they convinced so many “named” actors (that is, Dianne Weist, Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy) to appear in such garbage is simply amazing. To summarize - I want to return these 3 hours of my life !!!
