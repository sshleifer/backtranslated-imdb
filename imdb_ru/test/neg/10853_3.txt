A very bad movie, a mixture of clichés and historical inaccuracies. Some examples: at an early stage, the Soviet infantry was attacked by the Germans; instead of staying in their trenches to shoot at them, they move into open ground to fight them, in spite of all the infantry tactics; Kate, one of the main characters, is supposedly the daughter of a white Russian and is obsessed with her Russianness, but she does not speak Russian; The German pilot, struck with guilt, attacks an anti-aircraft gun - a weapon, however, does not shoot fragmentation shells, but directs his own “aircraft that is not very similar to the German” aircraft of World War II. In fairness, when they could avoid a ridiculous conspiracy and, consequently, absurdity, there are some really powerful moments - the image of people slowly dying of hunger, convincingly done and moving, but they only show the rest of this even more film that should be avoided.
