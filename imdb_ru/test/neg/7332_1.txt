This guy is a real job. An angry, immature boy in the body of an adult man who has collected all the charisma of the stone, he goes to places that most people would like to visit, and does his best to be as miserable as possible. <br /> <br /> Give this job to someone else who really appreciates it. <br /> <br /> I could go on an endless list of all the nonsense that this guy does in his "episodes", although I just highlight the worst: Crete, While the locals arrange seaside picnics in his "honor “This clown has a desire to act like an annoyed, spoiled child. He complains about everything, including the fashion sense of the people who live there. What a fool. <br /> <br /> When he left for Sweden, he spent at least five minutes pretending to disbelieve a group of cooks (who probably had better things to do than talking to some dumb American, for example, working) because they did not think that Abba was terrible. Wherever he went, he raised Abba. This kind of talk can be heard from 13-year-olds who watch MTV too much. <br /> <br /> When he was in New Orleans, he was upset that in one restaurant there were fries with better taste than his, so he “accidentally” spilled some wine on them to spoil them. What a strange, emotionally unstable person. <br /> <br /> The worst of all of this is his awkward behind-the-scenes, in which he tries in vain to add some perspective to a situation that he was too thick and ignorant to appreciate, He tries to use all these “big” words to sound like an author, but in fact he is just an ambitious hack, whose ignorance has convinced him that he has something to say. By the way, this is probably one good thing in this prankster’s TV show. This shows that no matter how inept you are, as long as you take yourself seriously enough, the world will also be in this case. <br /> <br /> Then he will speak with local guides, whose English is obviously only in its infancy. He will use the vocabulary of any writer - as he himself believes - will instinctively know that these people most likely will not understand him. Does he care? Not. Important jesters like this clown Burden do not use language to communicate; they use it to look important. <br /> <br /> The Mcg13jthm review on the same page is a great example of what looks like Burdane - a bad social IQ. Observe how the reviewer tries to justify the sociopathic nature of Burden with simple childish excuses that hardly make sense. "Bourdane can complain, but he goes through a lot, and, not only, he was" forced "to do this show, but he is trying to redeem himself." Dude attracts fools, and reading the review of Mcg13jthm should give you the opportunity to perfectly understand whether you really are the person who would have liked this completely useless, meaningless show. <br /> <br /> Finally, add a bit of “honesty” to my diatribe, I admit that Bourdin would have been funny for a moment if he had met him at the bar. But as a TV host for a tourist show, whose goal is to show the viewer the beauty of other places and cultures, Burdine is a miserable, despicable, hopeless, gloomy and depressing failure. <br /> <br /> Failure.
