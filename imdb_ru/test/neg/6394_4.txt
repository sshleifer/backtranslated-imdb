I saw it in the theater a couple of decades ago, and vague memories speak of what I liked. However, seeing it a second time, two things stand out: (1) a very bad game from Michelle Johnson, and (2) very bad music everywhere. <br /> <br /> The point is not that all the music was bad. Some of the Brazilian music was good, but the main and other ringing songs resembled the worst pop music of the 80s. <br /> <br /> Johnson's voice seemed completely wrong, perhaps dubbed. It was distracting. <br /> <br /> On the positive side: (1) the story is not bad, (2) itâ€™s interesting to look at such a young Demi Moore, (3) Valerie Harper never looked better, and (4) Johnson looked quite attractive different stages of frustration.
