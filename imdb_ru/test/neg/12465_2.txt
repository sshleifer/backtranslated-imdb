The box for this film completely distorts itself. On the cover are visible legs and panties in a short skirt. The name "Pie". Because of the synopsis on the back of the box, it seemed that Kat’s main character was an outcast who had become one of the most popular students, but this popularity leads to a strange way of life from which she cannot escape. Everything that was made in this film was a terrible lie. I was expecting some kind of crap version of Heather, designed for videos designed for today's teenagers. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you what Pie is. Yes, it really is a plot; so if you don't want to know what's going on, stop reading. We have one nasty, boring rich girl. This unsightly girl's best friend is naughty. The skin is excluded from school, so the unsightly girlfriend made friends with some British girl. This leads to the fact that the unsightly girl meets with this boring guy, who on the box is called "the most popular boy in school." If this guy was the most popular guy in their school, I would like to go to this high school, because I could throw him out of my mind. In any case, as any film will tell you, the most popular guy in school is a killer, a drug addict or a thief, or, in this case, all of the above. Be that as it may, everyone ultimately does not like the unpleasant protagonist, because she is Jewish. Then the most popular boy in school beats his best friend, a skunk, to death with a stone, because the skunk caught the most popular boy in a homosexual act. The standing mother of an unsightly girl and the hypochondriac's younger brother is there for her at the end. Oh, and the whole film about snotty rich children and their terrible parents. Gee, what's wrong with that? It sounds like a fantastic movie! Well, this is what I thought. But you see, in this film there are NO cute characters. The main character is boring. The filmmakers made her average, while during the film she continues to talk about what a freak she is. Skunk is not terrible enough, and he has little time on the screen. A popular guy has nothing to write. Popular girls are just your ordinary rich girls. No moral lessons. The cat, the boring main character, not a freak, never becomes one of the really popular girls, and (worst of all) after all the shit she passes, she thinks she is still too good to be friends with the only cute girl honestly, I have no idea why the movie is called “Pie”. I kept asking who the pie is? Is she a pie? Are they all pies? At 94 minutes, theoretically, this is not a long movie. But after I really watched this terrible waste of VHS tapes and not knowing who it was, I was surprised that the film lasted only an hour and a half. The film had two hours and some changes. After a while, I hoped the film would be about pop cakes. At least when you look at a box of cakes, you know what to expect.
