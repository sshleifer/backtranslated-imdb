Rita Hayworth plays a Brooklyn dancer at a nightclub named Rusty, who specializes in reviews of the chorus of the cheesecake; she manages to get on the cover of a national fashion magazine, but her looming success as a solo (with romantic suggestions around) beat the amazing boss Gene Kelly. A terribly tired piece of Technicolor cotton candy with non-memorable musical sketches (the two worst of which are inappropriate memories of the 1890s, when Hayworth portrayed his own grandmother). Kelly, as always, dances well, but acts with false sincerity; when he is serious, he is unbearable, and the rest of the time he flies on adrenaline. The scenario is very important, even without giving players support to Phil Silvers and Eva Arden of good lines. * 1/2 of ****
