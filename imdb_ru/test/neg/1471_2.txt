This film has been rated ridiculously. “American Film” is a boring documentary about a boring person so ordinary that you will find equivalents on almost every corner in America. It takes a long, close look at a guy who failed in almost everything to create an independent film ... or two. If his failures were not related to his own selfish pursuits, or if they were in the name of real art, the film could have a chance. America has lots of better stories to tell. This one should be reddened, and many critics have good reasons for shame. Indeed, two thumbs up!
