and I saw a lot of movies. I saw it at the theater in 1989, and to this day I remember the nauseous desire to leave. If you like John Belushi, respect his talent or even the integrity of the cinema - this film has nothing to offer you. Basically, this is a pathetic showcase for the author of the biography of Belushi Bob Woodward. As we see on the screen, as the life process of Belushi goes on, Woodward actually appears in the film as a ghostly character. The most offensive scene occurs when Belushi dies, raises his head from his deathbed to see the author standing over him, and he says weakly, “Breathe for me, Woodward.” There are too many terrible things to mention all of them, the smallest of which is the discovery in which Belushi jumps out of his body bag in the morgue and gets into a taxi run by a guy named Angel. I'll leave it at that.
