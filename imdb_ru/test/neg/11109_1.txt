This is one of the most terrible "scary" films that I've seen for a while. I had to wonder if John Rice-Davis was bored and whether he wanted to distract himself to make this film. The Chupacabra looked like a cross between Slietax from the Land of the Lost and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. In addition, they had to use someone who was a little smaller, since the Chupacabra legends are much smaller. Overall, however, the film was so bad, it was funny. Why can't bullets and electric shocks stop Chupacabra, but is the kickboxing captain's daughter all right ?? See if you are sick at home or feeling depressed and need a good laugh.
