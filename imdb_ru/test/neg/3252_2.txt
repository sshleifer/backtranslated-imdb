This film should never have been made! It stinks, it's terrible, it's not good, it's bad, it's terrible. Are you starting to see a sample here? Jackie Mason, of course, not Rodney Dangerfield. Ted Knight and Bill Murray are gone, who, along with Dangerfield, were important to the first movie. It seems that all three (stars) knew the ominous scenario when they saw one. The one who had no reason to go out of this was Chevy Chase, who, in my opinion, was an outsider for both films. This film is quite simply NOT FUN. Nor does it have any other charming qualities. This thing is highly dependent on anti-Semitism in the work, and it works to the detriment. I hated that thing. A waste of everyone's time.
