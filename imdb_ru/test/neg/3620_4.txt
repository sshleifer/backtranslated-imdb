I'm not going to lie and say that I do not watch the show - I do. BUT this one has many, many disadvantages. 1) The boarding school is beautiful. Drama at least. You know, everyone is so kind to each other. Let's check the reality. It is IMPOSSIBLE that ANY school is perfect as a PCA. Free laptops for everyone. Large dorm rooms. Mini fridges. If in real life there was such a school, almost no one would be a virgin. Secondly, everyone there is so rich, and it’s strange that no one has stolen anything yet. 2) Characters are really unreal. First things first, who in their right mind says how they are. They speak like a perfect teenager. Secondly, Logan Reese (Matthew Underwood) is an extremely rich boy, a “hot” teenager. My question is: why girls are almost never in his school? Now he is rich and "hot", and all these girls will pursue him, even if he is a jerk. Besides, Chase is the stupidest person in the world. This is the shy teenager who claims to dislike Zoe and reacts excessively to everything related to Zoe. She must be blind so as not to see him in love with her. <br /> <br /> Come on, Nick. I know you can do better than that. You are welcome..
