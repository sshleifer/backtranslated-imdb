Among the many awards here for this performance was one person whose comments asked if he / she was the only one (who was not passionate about it) - that is, they gave this film 3 stars. However, the commentary continued to indicate a general sympathy for the story, and other productions of the same. Well, this man is not the only one who didn’t like this production (including me!), But I’m parting with him even with him. If you had put a gun to my head and asked me to make a choice between shooting me or watching this film again, I would watch it, of course, but I would probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it. I would prefer to be locked in solitary confinement or watch the paint dry on the wall. In addition, I would not like to see this story again, anytime, anywhere, or in any alternative presentation. Sometimes you feel like a pair of brown shoes by comedian George Gobel, when the rest of the world is a tuxedo, and this is one of those for me. I liked Angela Lansbury in my favorite movie “Long Hot Summer”, and although I was not a big fan of the show, she enjoyed “Murder, she wrote.” But HERE - I not only did not care about history or other aspects, but I found that Angela was screaming, screaming, singing and everything else in her unsurpassed performance, perhaps the most annoying presence in any film (or presentation in any other media) I ever experienced. It was like the endless continuation of the equally "excessive" Cockney Audrey Hepburn to Rex Harrison - in the earlier parts of "My Fair Lady." But it was a random plot, presented for lighting, comedy effect and (fortunately) brevity. Unfortunately, this was not at all brief, and it seemed to me that it lasted about 10 hours (Einstein's explanation of relativity at work). If I had not been with friends, with the need to stay, MY viewing would be brief. I, however, laughed at the Seinfeld episode, where Elaine is pissed off because she tells them how much she didn’t like The English Patient. My friends treated me to some extent as well when I interrupted their ecstatic ascent about this film. Instead, at any time, give me some loud drag and drop across the board.
