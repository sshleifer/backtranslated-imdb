Dr. Markoff is a mad scientist who is experimenting, trying to find a cure for the viral cause of acromegaly. When he attends a piano concerto, he is amazed at the beautiful daughter of the pianist and intends to care for her. But when she does not want to have anything to do with him, he infects her father with the acromegaly virus, trying to extort money, and his daughter in exchange for medicine. <br /> <br /> This is the basic premise for this B-class low-budget thriller. I have to say that I was delighted with this movie. Not that it was terrible - it was not, but there was nothing particularly remarkable about that either. It was interesting enough to watch, but it’s not something that remains in my memory. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the dialogues are a little trivial, and the game is just mediocre. The story is quite predictable and gives us nothing new. Of course, I can’t complain too much about a film that has a guy in a gorilla suit who practically doesn’t pursue any goal, and the doctor with a look like svengali who doesn’t hypnotize his victims. > It may be worth seeing if you like such a movie, but don't get too carried away with it.
