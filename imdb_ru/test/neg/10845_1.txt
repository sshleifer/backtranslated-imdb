I rented this movie for about $ 1.50 - the most complete waste of money (and time) I have ever spent. This is LAME! I could not believe how they could come up with something like that. <br /> <br /> The plot ... no plot. Everything that you expect will happen, only worse. The game was terrible. My dog ​​could be better. Special effects have no effect but to cause complete disbelief. And cheese lines .... I mean, why bother? <br /> <br /> The only merit I can give this piece of shit is the opening scenes. They were actually quite beautiful. And one of the reasons why I decided to rent it. The graphics shown there are probably the best and most realistic computer graphics of the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Total Reality gets 1 out of 10 for not being able to tag it below.
