The notorious horror films rarely measure the excitement that surrounds them, and I have yet to face a worse offender than Wes Craven's “The hills have eyes”. Having refrained from watching this for years, I was very pleased when I received it for Christmas, and waited for the evening when my girlfriend went out to calm down and watch her - knowing her extreme dislike for something really terrifying. I didn't have to worry. <br /> <br /> After a promising — if familiar — start that firmly puts the film into the horror of survival horror, “Desolution USA,” everything quickly falls apart when the main characters and antagonists meet in the desert wasteland. <br /> <br /> It seems that it was removed with a budget of $ 5. Cannibal clan costumes hire dodgy costumes from the store, which specializes in artificial cavemen and Red Indians. An annoying bunch of unsympathetic WASPs who go on a journey down the road to California to find a silver mine in the nuclear test zone (!). When they break, they are attacked by a local family of meat eaters, and they have to fight to survive. <br /> <br /> Hoping for another Liberation, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Wrong Turning or Devil Deviation, I really understood, I came across something that should have remained dusty and unattended in a shopping basket in the backroom video. <br /> <br /> With gallons of tomato ketchup for blood and a couple of terrible wounded close-ups, I can look at how justified a certificate is 18 (in the UK), but with such reduced close-ups, it would not look out of place on an ITV Saturday . <br /> <br /> The whole silver mine / The plot of the nuclear test site is just McGuffin, justifying the “civilized” family colliding with primitives, but considering how easy the savages get their ass, it increases the credibility of what they survived a generation that hunted by passersby. <br /> <br /> And then there is the end ... or lack thereof. The Hills have eyes, there seems to be no third act, or at least a satisfactory outcome. Instead, I was just surprised: “Aha, and ...?”
