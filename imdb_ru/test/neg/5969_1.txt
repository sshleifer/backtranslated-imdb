I think the film was one-sided, I recently watched it and found a documentary typical of Western filmmakers that was biased. The fact is that prostitution exists everywhere in the world, not only in Tanzania, and not because of this fish business, there were prostitutes even before Russian and other businessmen arrived in Mwanza. Poverty is indeed endemic in Africa, not to mention Tanzania, and this is not because of fish fillets; in fact, the fish industry has helped millions to support their families in their daily lives. This film just casts a shadow on the good image of this peaceful country. As for the arms trade, the film could not prove whether there is any truth in the fact that, indeed, critically looking at films, someone doubts the director’s authenticity, it seems that they are trying to prove their point by using several characters that can be made for everything really. Yes, Tanzania is a poor country. Yes, there are prostitutes and street children, but they are not the product of this business, it’s just a common scenario in most poor countries, even around the world, even in the western world ... What a rubbish. <br /> <br /> The pilot himself talks about sending weapons to Angola, which is more than 2000 km south of Tanzania, and the war was in DRC, also a few miles from Mwanza, the director was unable to provide evidence of how This weapon was delivered from Mwanza to the DRC! <br /> <br /> In short, films lack focus and respectability, it’s pretty easy to find a character anywhere in Africa and has nothing to do with Darwin’s nightmare or fish fillets ... What a load of rubbish! <br /> <br /> The truth is that Nile perch did not destroy all other species in the lake, unlike what is shown in the film, and less than 25% of all catches from Lake Victoria are exported, the rest is consumed locally, so let's do it right.
