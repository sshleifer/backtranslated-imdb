I met him in the early 90s on TV, and I liked it ... <br /> <br /> What did you like about it? Moody drawing style? Impeccable art action? Absurd and deadpan communication between characters? The whole layout of the surrounding future world? It doesn't matter what you like about it ... <br /> <br /> In the Aeon Flux film of the end of 2005, there is nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Karin Kusama, the so-called film director, was hopelessly overwhelmed by the transfer of the original content to the new film. If you are not familiar with the original series, you will not understand anything during the first 60 minutes of the film. The story is incomprehensible, and the characters do not develop during the film. <br /> <br /> Kusama Trying to improve the storyline by implementing rather weak explanatory conversations between the protagonists is not only an unsuccessful attempt to hide his narrator’s shortcomings, but simply unworthy of the original “ON” concept. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron may be an attractive woman, but she cannot impersonate her character. Despite the fact that she was tied to the strings in the battle scenes, her lack of talent for physical movement simply destroys the sequence of actions in the film. The result is a huge amount of restless shots to hide the rudeness of her physique. <br /> <br /> Forget about everything else, don't talk about it ... <br /> <br /> I give 1 point for Miss Theron showing her boobs and 1 point for a beautiful architectural photo in the film . That's all.
