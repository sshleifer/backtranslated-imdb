I can not believe that they even released such a film. The only good game came out of the water in the film. It must be one of the worst (if not the worst) film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only scary part of the movie is a bad game, I give this movie 1 - this is me good. This film deserves a 0. <br /> <br /> Storyline, and if you can call it the plot of the film, it seems, was written by a schoolboy. Of course, you have to ask yourself, perhaps it was better with better actors. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, wait until it is shown on TV. <br /> <br /> AND EVEN AFTER LOOKING, WILL BE WASTE TIME.
