For the hold there should be an option 0/10. <br /> <br /> It was painful to watch, but still weirdly irresistible. Incredibly, because it seemed incredible that a film could actually suck so much. I kept thinking, "this should get better." It got worse. And worse. <br /> <br /> How the hell were people deceived by creating such categorical things that I would never know. But the most amazing thing is that all these reviews that I see about people who really love the movie. Yes, the acting was good, but the film was very, very, very bad. Worst movie ever!
