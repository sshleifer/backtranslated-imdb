It does not surprise me that the creators of this hopeless film could not find a British distributor, and then had to release it in the form of a free DVD with a Sunday newspaper. Distributors could clearly see what the filmmakers and the Sunday newspaper could not, that it was one film that simply wasn't going to pay back the costs. <br /> <br /> Since this is a mystery thriller, it would help if they chose a lead actor who could spell out correctly, rather than the mumbling of Vinnie Jones, who seems to have uttered a "riddle" as a "rill." And it would help if the dialogue was not overwhelmed with noisy places or scenes flooded with distracting and inappropriate music. The plot is ridiculous: the lost story of Charles Dickens supposedly helps our hero to uncover a series of modern murders, as well as a copy of Gerg's Tintin's Adventures, since the connection between Dickens and Jones is more likely than not to be unreliable. And we have a ridiculous premise that a potential investigative journalist who would take Dickens’s previously unknown manuscript into his hands would take several days to read it, just so that Dickens’s memories could continue to play throughout the film. that relation to this. What they do not do. I mean, if you found a new manuscript of Dickens, wouldn't you go to some quiet place and read it? The film ends with one of those unexpected revelations that became mandatory after the Sixth Sense, but in this case it doesn’t surprise you so much as insulting your intellect. If the film suddenly turns into a supernatural at the twelfth hour, then revealing that Vinnie Jones is a robot could be more acceptable. If the film were stylish, it might not seem so sharp, but it is not. And in some places it looks obviously amateur: there is a scene where a table is laid with the technique of 60th jump jumps, but they are not sure that the person who actually sets the table is completely out of frame between cuts. Therefore, you can see how everything changes at the edge of the frame, when you really have to watch how everything changes in the center of the frame. A good rule in making movies: if you don’t understand how to make a technique, try something else. <br /> <br /> The real mystery is why someone would think that it would be nice to make this film in the first place.
