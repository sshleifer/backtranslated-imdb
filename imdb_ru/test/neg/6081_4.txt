As usual, leader Leo Gorsy (like Slip Mahoney) and "The Bowery Boys" are having trouble with cash. After an unsuccessful attempt to sell their old Ylop, the guys are looking for help at a local bank. There, the unfortunate Hantz Hall (as Sakha) was photographed by the pretty photographer Tila Loring (as Katie Smith). But since the shot was made during the robbery, this makes Mr. Hall look like the main suspect. With friends Bobby Jordan (like Bobby), William "Billy" Benedict (like Whitey) and David Gorsi (like Chuck); Mr. Gorsy wants to clear the Hall and collect a reward of $ 1,000. "Bowery Bombshell" passes through the movement with the main force of Miss Loring. <br /> <br /> **** Bowery Bombshell (07.20.46) Phil Carlson ~ Leo Gorsy, Hantz Hall, Teala Loring, Bobby Jordan
