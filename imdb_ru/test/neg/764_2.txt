My God, the things that are considered for entertainment in this country ... <br /> <br /> This is * not * Tom and Jerry, which you may have enjoyed on Saturday morning, with a miserable cat and a smart mouse, This is a much earlier animated series that shows a pair of Mutt and Jeff clones that fall into various scratches that lead to any of the typical jokes like the dancing skeleton that made up so much in the early animations. /> <br /> This particularly nasty walk, apparently originally intended as a vehicle for a pair of true black comedians of the time, causes the couple to fall into the ocean during a flight to Africa, which requires exaggerated black makeup the face. Dialects of "blacks" and "Legs, do not let me down now." <br /> <br /> This only shows that in 70 years between emancipation and this film, American views on Africans have not changed much. On the other hand, at least one of them apparently had a pilot's license.
