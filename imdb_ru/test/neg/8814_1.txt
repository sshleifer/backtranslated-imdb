I am a big fan of horror films, especially in the genres of the 1980s. Name one ?? I probably saw it. Last year, a new small horror film that seemed to have slipped under the mainstream radar called “Saw” was about to hit theaters. I was moderately excited. Not hearing anything about it, I thought it looked quite promising, judging by the previews and posters (well, except for the back and the white ones with severed arms and legs ... they just looked awful!) I saw the movie at the premiere, It was one of the worst events in my life. This film was literally mentally and mentally painful to watch. Because it was scary? ... NOT! Because it was one of the worst films I've ever experienced displeasure! Firstly, scripting and editing was absolutely horrible, even by horror movie standards. Starting the sequence in the interrogation room with the victim (Shawnee Smith), who recently survived the assassination of a serial killer, then revealing the memory of what she endured? NOT SCARY! It was impossible to feel any type of tension, EVER knowing that the above sacrifice was perfectly in order. Of course, this reverse bear trap was creepy ... but WHY should I feel a little scared when it was CLEAR, did you just show me that she had survived the ordeal? Unfortunately, the whole movie was built in this way. It starts with two guys in the basement. Then they show the memories of how they were kidnapped ... IT IS NOT SCARY! What for? Because we already know what will happen to them, seeing how we JUST SEEN the result of the attack. THEY ARE ALLRIGHT! Continue the story! Unfortunately, the real story was poor at best. I could not care less about these annoying, pitiful excuses for the "characters", and the game did not help. Carey Elvis was hard for the most part, and then suddenly towards the end he started crying like a lost baby, straining to keep his American accent in tact (it didn't work - the audience I saw it was in stitches). This led him to a rash and idiotic decision that even the most ordinary people would not take. He had other options. It is better. SMART. Even considering his intense emotional state (terribly reported through a terrible game), it was still irrational. I have not bought it. Bad letter! In addition, even when certain sequences were reproduced without interruption and without feedback, they were painfully predictable. I constantly discovered that my foot was tapping impatiently, waiting for the end of the blunt sequence. It happened for the whole movie. I saw every turn coming. Twenty minutes after the beginning of the film, I already named the killer’s identity, not to mention his connection with his “accomplice (s)” in SOON as they appeared on the screen. The best acting game could outshine the horrible script. Instead, the actors might as well have had “RED HERE” or “SERVICE” tattoos on their foreheads. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, I was completely outraged by the fact that I wasted even part of my life in this film, and the whole theater was laughing hysterically at a completely terrible ending. Seriously, you might think that they were watching a Monty Python movie. I would have laughed too if I had not been so angry with the whole movie and could not accomplish ANYTHING that he intended to do. When we left, there was (no kidding) a line to talk with the manager of the theater to get their money back (did not happen). I was absolutely sure that the film would become a box office bomb. The following week, you couldn't imagine how shocked I was when you found out that Saw hit number one at the box office, and ALL talked about it (mostly people who found Napoleon Dynamite as an epic story and Thought "satire" was some kind of rubber). I am so sick of hearing people praise this film, that I often feel sick. This is entertainment for the weakest and most distant people. Those who find strange puppet clown puzzles threatening a tricycle (this is a doll, toss and leave, what is so terrible about it?). <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I own every Friday of the 13th, I love my sprinkled movies, I thought that Napoleon Dynamite was funny, I miss Freddie, Michael, Pinhead or Leather Face , I appreciate the fonts for the unknown gems of horror and the title of “Sniper Camp II”: Unhappy Campers "among my 10 favorite slashers. However, I understand that these films are not the most complex American cinemas to offer ?? I appreciate them what they have is fast, easy fun. "Saw" is cinematic trash. The film tries to be a nasty and half-complicated, disgusting little exciting journey, and tiring up to an annoying, annoying waste of time, money, energy and celluloid. Atrocious on all accounts. Each copy should be burned along with its feeble-minded fans. Shame on all of you /> Will I see “Saw II?” Maybe after I make a double shot from “Liquid Drano”, before you poke out your own eyes and pierce the kaboos in your ears and large intestine with hot white skewers. My rating: 0/10. Avoid at all costs.
