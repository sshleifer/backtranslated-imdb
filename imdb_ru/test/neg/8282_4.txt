First of all, I want to aim the thumb and middle finger at the Troma DVD distribution team, which in fact was so stupid that it revealed the identity of the main killer of this film on the back cover! The synopsis just casually mentions who is the person responsible for the slaughter on the day of graduation, for Christ's sake! I don't care how horrible or predictable a slasher of the 80s can be; just mentioning who did it destroys the whole point! So, advice, if you also acquire the dual function of Troma, which contains “Graduation Day” and “Barbarian nymph in hell of dinosaurs,” is not worth it ?? repeat NOT ?? flip the box and read it back! Watching a movie is already a painful experience, but reading the back would really ruin everything. <br /> <br /> Now, what about the movie itself? Oh, man! Personally, I'm a fan of cinematic "work" Herb Fried. Well, in fact, I do not know whether I should admire him or pity him! All the films of Herb are rather bad and amateurish, but at the same time you can say that his direction is energetic and full of good intentions! Unlike Haunts and Beyond Evil, he followed the current trend of the popular genre and tried to make money on typical school slasher films. Just to offer a minimum of originality, all the victims on “Graduate Day” are promising athletes and members of the same track coach George Michaels (amazing name! I think Herb Fried is a Wham! Fan). During the opening credits, we see a young girl die abruptly on the field, a few minutes after winning a 30-second race. The discussion about whether her coach and other team members are not too keen on her physical limitations rises, but one particular person goes a step further and starts to sadistically kill everyone whom he / she considers responsible for Laura’s death. What a crazy little movie! The script should be one of the most inconsistent I've ever seen, with lots of red herring and plots that lead to nothing, and deadly episodes that are almost too stupid for words! There is a guy pierced with a soccer ball attached to a dart, others are beheaded by an absurdly big sword, and the most unfortunate bastard of all of them even dies on a masked thorny bed! Herb concentrates on the ingenuity and fast pace of the killings so much that he completely forgets about the plots he presented earlier in the film! For example, Laura’s sister returns home from military training and appears to be investigating the circumstances of her death. However, halfway through the film, her character almost does not appear in the film. In addition, the girls' stepfather is called a cruel drunkard, but this interesting information is immediately ignored. Instead of setting the wait carefully and misleading the red herring, are we given sequences of disco and roller skates and ?? of course ?? Numerous images of unattractive 80s chicks who shoot tops. Despite the fact that “Graduate's Day” is really bad, he can count on a solid cast of actors! Christopher George ("Grizzly", "City of the Living Dead") plays a major role in the role of demanding coach, Carmen Arjanziano ("When a Stranger Calls", "Accused") briefly appears in the role of a police detective investigating the growth in the number of missing teenagers and Michael Pataki ( “Dead and buried”, “Dracula’s Dog”) plays a very funny role, as the school’s director emphasized. Teen Duty Beauties - Lynn Quigley and Bath White. Damn it, for some horror fans, the presence of these two ladies is already reason enough to consider The Graduation Day to be one of the most typical killers of the early 80s. This is a stupid movie, but entertainment and chuckle are guaranteed!
