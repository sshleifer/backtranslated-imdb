Comparisons with the original series are inevitable. It is a pity that Diana Rigg left the original show in the 1960s because of the mistreatment of the producers, and McNee probably regretted it just like any fan - it’s impossible to say how long the show could have lasted otherwise. Linda Thorson was in order of substitution, and her episodes still retained almost all the quality and aspects of Rigg episodes — all that was missing was Rigg / McNie's chemistry. The new Avengers should have been left on the shelf - the falling McNee, the annoying Purdy, and who the hell is this guy Gambit. In addition, humor was forced and bad - provided that I watched only a few episodes, because that was all I CAN watch, but I think I have an idea. Try as much as possible, and it’s almost impossible to resurrect an old show like a new format or movie.
