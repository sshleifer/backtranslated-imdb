Worst movie ever !! This is not smart, not funny and does not make you think. 84 minutes of bad actors did their best with a terrible script. <br /> <br /> Acting was so bad that you could see the dead breathing. <br /> <br /> It was possible that the screenwriter and director thought that they were Quentin Tarantino or something like that (you know, make a film about which nothing is cool yet), but failed miserably. <br /> <br /> I hope that the writer never makes another film NEVER !! not everyone is born a writer, sometimes we need to calculate our losses and return to being an orderly or something similar. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie, even in silent mode, when the stereo continues to work painful 84 min.
