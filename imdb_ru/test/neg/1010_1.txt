This is a little less disgusting than in the first two films, but otherwise it is a normal business: a dirty, sloppy and unbalanced piece of a sick movie. Charles Bronson returned, exploding when his friend was killed by mobs terrorizing the neighborhood. You see, crime has grown by 11% in the South Belmont area ... so what to do? Stronger police presence? Tighter prisons? More harsh suggestions? No, the only solution is to send a free gun like Bronson to satisfy the bloodthirsty revenge ?? or, as the authors would have written, justice: this time he is the personal car of the murder of police chief Ed Lauter. <br /> <br /> Screenwriters lean back to make Kersey a hero, sending useless cops to the area. only to confiscate a weapon from an elderly resident who is keeping it for protection, and to provide a scene in which a camera was stolen from Kearsey and shoots a thief right in the back to applaud from the watching crowd. The death penalty for theft? Okay. The position of everyone in the film is such that it is a decision, and the dishonest twisting of characters into ciphers, which exist only to cheer Quersey or support him, is terrible. <br /> <br /> Of course, these villains are a scumbag, but shouldn't the film leave the audience to make a decision, instead of tilting it all to Quersey and his thoughtless response? Strangely enough, the besieged residents are not afraid of repression of the gang or accuse Kersi of any violence, which is strange, since one character was killed precisely because of the involvement of Kersi. At the end of the film, they all take weapons from boxes of socks and joyfully join the slaughter, never stopping to think things over or fight the thought of having to kill another person. <br /> <br /> The terribly petty performances don't help ?? Bronson has literally one facial expression, and he cannot even kill the right words. New tops of nonsense achieved here ?? machine gun? Rocket launcher ?! ?? and new lows of misogyny: the film plans to desecrate all the female characters in sight, be it rape, explosion or cutting the throat; and he sets them up utterly stupid, like one victim who goes to a criminal, gang-controlled area to invite a stranger, or another who goes shopping one night. This disgusting, clean and simple, meaningless garbage collected without style and meaning.
