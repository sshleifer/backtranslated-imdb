In my local video rental store, they have a special place for two girls and a guy. This is a long joke in fact. The clerk allows people to rent it for free. They value their customers too much to allow them to spend their hard-earned money on it. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised to see that people gave this film a good overview. Maybe someone can explain it to me. (or maybe the positive comments were jokes? Did the people associated with the film write them? Maybe the director / screenwriter's mother?) This film failed in comparison.
