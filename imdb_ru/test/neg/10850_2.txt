Rigoletto - Verdi's masterpiece, full of drama, emotion and powerful, memorable music. The maestro must have collapsed into the grave when this obscene parody of his work was released with its useless nudity and cheap copulation and the depiction of the naive but principled Gilda as a horny chip. Opera, of course, can be adapted to the cinema - take a look at the magnificent "Traviata" of Zeferelli - but when the piece is as great as Rigoletto, he does not need cheap tricks. Perhaps it would even be acceptable if the duplication in the music was good, but it is a mediocre transfer of the libretto with excellent sound quality.
