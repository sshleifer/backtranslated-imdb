Almodovar film - every time I get a tingling sensation. The printed font, which opens the latest trait of the Spanish author, instantly evokes memories of obscene nuns, gentle necrophilia, crazy transsexuals - and I did not even reach the critically offended early work of the terrible child. And after a wonderful introductory montage, when the camera wandered through a windy cemetery, animated by a bunch of widows, feverishly scrubbing tombstones, I thought Pedro was holding me back under his evil spell again. <br /> <br /> Even once, my nostalgia calmed down, there was very little to fill his place. For a director who enjoys bringing humanity to murderers and rapists, he is very poor at finding any emotional depth or exquisite quality in his women. Penelope Cruz - Raymund, a stubborn housewife, whose life is complicated by the accidental murder of her daughter by her abusive husband. Fortunately, she lives in Spain Almodovar, where your friends will be happy to help dispose of the corpse to offer cocktails. Add to the melting pot ghost mother Raimund and many other eccentrically cordial matriarchs. Volver literally means return, and Pedro seems to recycle old material. The incest subplot is felt as if it were attached as a mandatory “taboo”. Instead of commenting or undermining the problem, as is the case with pedophilia in Poor Education, he feels compelled and unconvincing because of the sentimentality of the film. I suggest Almodovaru to name his next film Salir (to move on).
