This is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. I say this without hyperbole and believe me, I have seen a lot of bad movies. It is embarrassing and annoying that millions of dollars were invested in this film, and that hundreds (thousands?) Of the Masters spent so much time working on what the scriptwriters and producers had to know would be a huge failure. A 90-minute film seems so long, stretched, boring and incomprehensible, you know that somewhere something went wrong. In addition, Jamie Kennedy (whose work I liked elsewhere) is just awful in this role; Obviously, he was never given a screen test, because no producer in his right mind would have considered him any entertainment, especially in a mask. Just awful. <br /> <br /> Personally, I can't wait to see the reviews of the main film critics, because I know that they are doing better than me, they are tearing apart this fragment of the train to shreds. /> <br /> The producers of this film should be embarrassed, and more importantly, NEVER be allowed to make theatrical films again.
