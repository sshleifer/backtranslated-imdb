Did the writers pay people to come here and write positive reviews? I mean, in fact, it's a bit beaten, and Spike is not that funny. He looks more like a serious guy who is trying too hard to be funny. There are so many mediocre performances in this show; as once, the initial sketch was “Talk Show, apply directly to the forehead” again and again. And one more, which featured Spike and another dude, and it was not even funny. They even did nothing, but sat and laughed again and again. Ha ha! And another in which Spike talked to a Korean guy who ate a duck and told him that he had a domestic duck. Ha ha! I mean, really, Spike just gets funny guests on his show, so people like this show.
