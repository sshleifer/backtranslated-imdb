There are good-bad movies and bad-bad movies and nice bad movies ... this is not one of them. This is a film that does not understand how bad it is. <br /> <br /> I saw it at a show on November 14, 2006 at the New Beverly Theater in Los Angeles as part of "Grindhouse Cinema". this theater puts on every month. We hope that the leading Eric Kayden and Co. Think twice before letting writer / director Lawrence Falls be back with them again. What a cheater. The guy got up to make a speech before the film - one might think that he was Orson Wells, who was talking about “Touching Evil” or some other lost classics. Barely It is good that he took 20 minutes of his audience time with his rambling tramp. <br /> <br /> “Young Warriors” are described as a cross between the “House of Animals” and the “Wish for Death”, but if you expect something like imitations, such as “Revenge of the nerds” or “Fighter” “You waiting for one sad disappointment. The script does not make sense. The direction is so bad that the actors looked confused, and what can you say when the best thing in the film is to watch the car explode? <br /> <br /> Poor Richard, “shaft”, “Roundtree” In this film, he plays another character named “John,” but this is the only similarity of his character to the above-mentioned classics. I hope this film allowed him to pay the rent for another month. Other actors who look like they would like to be anywhere else were Ernest Borgnine and Linda Day George. <br /> <br /> This is a waste of time. It didn’t even seem to viewers that this was the case (except for one guy-spasm sitting behind, who shouted “Wow” every five minutes and his girlfriend, who giggled with Barbie’s passionate voice every time she opened her mouth). <br /> <br /> For real films about warriors, I would suggest the following: <br /> <br /> Death Wish I, II, III, Fighter I, Vigilance Force, 45th Ms. Rolling Thunder, Man without mercy (the last two are a couple of films presented in this theater a couple of years ago — probably the same budget as Young Warriors, but both were a million times better!)
