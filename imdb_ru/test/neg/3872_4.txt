B. Kennedy tried to make a sequel, exaggerating and amplifying the giant left western (not as left as the sequel of G. Kennedy that followed this). <br /> <br /> This is the ugliest movie; two sequels look very ugly. This is a slap in the face. B. Kennedy did this by reinforcing, but not having a genius for this. Hundreds of peonies, hundreds of Mexican companions, hundreds of women, desert, barren landscapes, storm - the largest scale. <br /> <br /> Everything about this clumsy sequel, which is only oddly pretty, is fake. <br /> <br /> The movie itself looks terrible. Brynner, who played the best part in the first film, does not look very good in this film. <br /> <br /> Rei plays the priest; he will be the political leader, Quintero, in the next continuation of the franchise. <br /> <br /> It is true that when you have so many characters, you may not need a very interesting storyline; sometimes. For example, Brynner meets McQueen; then they choose other "comrades"; or B. Spencer meets Coburn; etc. It is interesting to see where and how they will meet with the rest of the crew, etc. But you need at least these few characters. Unfortunately, Bert Kennedy's contribution is not very good at this. <br /> <br /> The return of the Seven (1966) begins with a bullfight. Win and Chris meet there; they decide to save the third survivor from the original “Magnificent” Chico, who belongs to a huge group of 300 people abducted by Mexican gangsters. We find out Chico's attractive wife's name is Petra. Chris should make up a small army again, and here we have the treats of the Dirty Dozen. Chris chooses his people from the convicts. Another member of the commando is a womanizer who will take care of wives left without husbands. In this film, sexual humor is especially unpleasant and unpleasant. He tends to appear smart and sharp; he's just boorish, stupid and rude. <br /> <br /> The selection of members of a small army was one of the greatest joys in the McQueen film. Unfortunately, in the first sequel, the most memorable of the three teams assembled under the name of the Magnificent Seven. <br /> <br /> Robert Fuller makes a lousy “Wine”; Oates is a smiley womanizer. <br /> <In this feigned attempt by the giant revolutionary leader of Mexico there is a gigantic plan: he kidnaps 300 people and uses them to build a village and a church in memory of his lost sons. (It’s no use saying that this insane Mexican revolutionary doesn’t compare with the role of Wallach in the first film.) B. Kennedy stakes exclusively on the camp and on the most important things: ugly landscapes, thunderstorm, giant lightning, desert. A huge battle between emancipated pions and revolutionary vakkers. Of course, The Return of the Seven (1966) completely abandoned the common sense of the McQueen movie. <br /> <br /> What is especially shocking is that this sequel came out pretty quickly after the original movie? way to create westerns. <br /> <br /> Both sequels look weird.
