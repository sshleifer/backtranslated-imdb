There are really no ransom factors on this show. Simply put, it is just awful. Absolutely awful. This is just a terrible reality show. And not only that, this is a terrible invention. <br /> <br /> Imagine: once a bunch of overly creative teenagers get together and say, “Hey! Let's do a paranormal show like “Ghost Hunters” and whatnot! ”So they grab the camera, bother the locals and shoot random landscapes for the painfully“ monologue that is trying to be dramatic, but still failing. ” This show is basically a group of teenagers running around with a movie camera trying to make a really terrible horror documentary. The only difference is that this show actually has a budget and script writers. Wasted budget and horrible writers. <br /> <br /> Oh, the problems, how do I think of you? Well, first, let's talk about it from a personal level. I am not a complete skeptic when it comes to paranormal phenomena. I am ready to believe in what is paranormal and what is not, and I am sure that there are many people who feel the same. So, if you are going to make a paranormal show, you should do a good job to convince the viewer that what he sees is either paranormal or not, because the viewer can easily believe the opposite. I hate to compare, but I do not understand why not at this moment. Take, for example, Ghostbusters. In Ghostbusters you can say that the actors are aligned with the audience. They are not completely skeptical, but still want to remember any paranormal anomalies. They have to look at something and be ready to say "it is possible, that it is just nothing." And, with this in mind, they intended to try to prove their wrongfulness. They use technology and several other gadgets along with constant moderation to determine what is paranormal, as well as the fact that what they can monitor may not be meant. They not only try to convince themselves of what is real and what is not, in the process they are trying to convince you. This element of doubt is not in the "Paranormal". Hit one. <br /> <br /> In “Paranormal”, the actors simply say: “This is an eerie place, and it is being pursued, so we are going to find SPIRITS!” And immediately you know and say to yourself: “All right, convince me of the opposite” . Actors are not professional in their interviews. In fact, sometimes it seems that they just bother the locals of these so-called "ghosts." They have no real evidence to support their claims, except for assumptions and theories, and the best that they can confirm is someone who "declares" that they can contact the dead, and no one will ever confirm who this person is and how he really is valid. They could just pick a random person from the street and say: "Pretend you can contact the spirits for our show" and go for it. In the episode "Mothman" it just happens. Without any convincing evidence near the end of the show, they bring out such a person, where he randomly painfully “reads” the intended area of ​​how something “chases” to convince his audience. Very, very bad effort. I feel that one of the main problems of the show is the script. During one of the episodes, the cast is sometimes attacked by one of these “paranormal anomalies” in an attempt to be dramatic. This kind of dramatic sequence will make any skeptic laugh, and even those who are on the fence will understand what they are watching - just a bunch of tabloid Esquirer garbage. If the goal of the show was to try to convince its audience that these “paranormal” events are real, they are doing terribly bad work. Hit two. <br /> <br /> However, there is always a counter. Only one last point of view to see if the show is really worth something. What if the show is not trying to convince you that these paranormal events are real and are just trying to entertain you with a good fiction? It even fails at this level as well. If the creators of the show create fiction to entertain their audience, the script is too meager and even at a fictional level, it cannot convince viewers that its actors really experience obscurity in all its full, terrifying glory. The letter is simply not convincing, and even, I dare say, boring. Hit three. <br /> <br /> What is left of this show is just a group of teenagers who are too willing or too gullible to believe in paranormal phenomena simply because it is simply much more surprising than the reality that are sent with the camera . bad script and bad actors to make a really horrible horror documentary in general. That's all the show at this moment. There is no reason to see it, even for the entertainment factor, and there is no reason to take care of it. To be blunt, his lame. There are absolutely no redemptive factors in this show.
