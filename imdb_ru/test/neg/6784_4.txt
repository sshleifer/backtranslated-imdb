Visually beautiful with good music, this film has a rather banal quality for television. The romance between the two characters, which covers the cultural and educational gap, is simply NOT believable. Of course, from the very beginning we knew that our fastidious heroine would lighten up, win the local people and find true love, but this does not make it any less sad that the film should have taken such completely expected turns. This film had many promises, which makes it more shameful that the promise was not realized. Maybe a good one under a blanket on a cold night for free on cable, but I certainly would not recommend a paid rental or purchase. I'm sure the soundtrack is wonderful though.
