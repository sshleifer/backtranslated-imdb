The peace and beauty of Koyaanisqatsi were powerful confirmation of the natural world. In Nakoykatsi, we are being attacked by images of synthetic, competitive, violent and digital â€” the destructive constructs of our culture. <br /> <br /> Some freedoms are perceived with images, posterization, chagrin and very slow movement. Connections between sequences are incomprehensible, if any. Naqoyqatsi is defined at the end of the film, the missed opportunity to put images into context. <br /> <br /> The film is difficult to watch, the quality of archival materials is uneven, and his most atoning qualities are his subject and Philip Glass's hypnotic evaluation.
