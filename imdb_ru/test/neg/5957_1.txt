SPOILERS <br /> <br /> This movie was rented as a joke, and what a joke it was. The film is based on a dog catcher who is looking for El Chupacabra. Clothes for dog catchers are so funny. It seems that he sewed a patch on his hat and for some reason shows his “muscles” by rolling up his sleeves. Throughout the film, mostly at night, you can see how bad the lighting was. They are in a brightly lit car and ride in a completely black color. Often you can see the human camera shade on the ground. The costumes are terrible, the lighting is terrible, and the action is terrible. This is a good movie for a laugh ... maybe.
