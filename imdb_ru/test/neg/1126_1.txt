OK ... it may contain spoilers ... but who cares? Not worth it, if you value the seconds of your life, waste your time on this pile of garbage. There is not one redemptive quality in this film ... and I say this as a full fan of vacation movie shows. I loved cousin Eddie from other vacation movies ... but he only works well as an auxiliary character. I blame Randy Quaid for the failure of this film? It's my pleasure. I think he is a great actor ... but this film lacks cohesion ... the rhythm is turned off ... it's just not funny. And the actor playing "The Third" ... Jake Thomas ... was just terrible, most likely due to a lack of direction. I don't know why ... but his whole character frightened me. <br /> <br /> Some people say it's a terrible movie, because Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are not in it ... it has nothing to do with it. Scenario, directing, acting ... special effects ... it's all a train wreck. With orphans. And kittens. Oh ... and the train moved some old men. <br /> <br /> Please, whatever you do ... stay away from this mud! I call it mud because it pollutes the name of the Holiday franchise.
