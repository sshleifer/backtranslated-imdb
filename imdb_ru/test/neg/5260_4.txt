Drug Runner Archie Moses introduces his friend Rock Keats to his boss, drug lord Frank Colton. Unknown to Moses, Keats is actually an undercover cop. During the slump in the Colton factory, Moses accidentally shoots Keats in the head. He survived the wound and later arrested Moses. Dodging Colton's hired assassins, the duo must overcome their mutual hatred in order to survive. <br /> <br /> Adam Sandlerâ€™s films are usually a hit when his comedies are either loved by his fans or everyone hates him. This is not as stupid as his other films, but still can not overcome the lazy script. The direction is incredibly ambiguous, with fast-paced sequences of actions giving way to the slow exchange of comics between Sandler and Damon Wayans. Some of the fighting scenes ?? flying an airplane without engines, chasing the car at night through the woods ?? pretty ridiculous invented. Acting is the standard for this genre, with Sandler & Wayans creating a good mix. In short, the film is stupid, but interesting to watch. <br /> <br /> Rating: C + Review by M.K. Geist
