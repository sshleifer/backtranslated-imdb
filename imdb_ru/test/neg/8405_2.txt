I think Rosemary's Baby is the most overrated horror movie. Not scary, interesting or much more. This is well directed, and Ruth Gordon was wonderful, but that was all. But because of this continuation, it looks like Gone With the Wind! <br /> <br /> I caught it on TV when I was 14 years old. Unfortunately, I still remember it. From what I remember, Rosemary's baby, Andrew, grew up, and the coven wants him to start capturing (the world that is). But there are forces trying to stop it ... and Andrew doubts himself ... <br /> <br /> I give it 2 for several reasons: Gordon is in this (and still very good); Stephen McHetty was actually quite good, like Andrew, and at the beginning there was one creepy moment when Rosemary (Patty Duke) was “kidnapped” on the bus ... without a driver. <br /> <br /> Also, this is boring, stupid and unnecessary. The original did not need to be continued! The continuation of Ira Levin’s book in 1999 was not much better. <br /> <br /> Tune in to the beginning with the Duke ... then disconnect. Not worth the effort.
