I was very concerned about this film, it was planned to play at the Jewish Film Festival, and, as reported, he was very hostile to Israel, using clever humor and irony. <br /> <br /> I was relieved to find out that the film was not a diatribe, however, as a work on the film, it was deeply disappointing. The film was full of random events, some of which are ultimately related, most of which are not. Some of them were very clever and funny, but some were just random and meaningless. <br /> <br /> Between two lovers there are repeated scenes where they sit without words in the car and play some kind of game on their hands. It may be erotic in some cultures, but it looks like a thumb fight. After the third time, it really became tedious. <br /> <br /> I have always found David Lynch unreasonably strange, using strange stories and images to make viewers think that he is so sophisticated that they do not understand his work; really nothing to understand. The same is true in this case: the stories do not summarize, and the political point of view is not particularly important (in one scene, a noisy Israeli soldier humiliates Palestinian drivers at the checkpoint. Is this news?) why this film caused controversy and why it attracted attention. This is a bad job, and seeing it was a waste of time.
