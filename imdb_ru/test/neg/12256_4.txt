PREY <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: mono <br /> <br /> Lesbian couple (Sally Faulkner and Glory Annan) living in a remote country House destroyed by the arrival of a young man (Barry Stokes), who turns out to be an alien, the vanguard of a mass invasion ... <br /> <br /> Despite the meager budget and lead rhythm Norman J. Warren sequence to SATAN'S SLAVE (1976) is much larger than the sum of its meager parts, thanks to Max Caff’s surprisingly complex scenario (apparently his only merit in the letter): Faulkner and Annan obsessive relationships live in isolated splendor in the English countryside (visually presented alternately beautiful and sinister due to Derek W. Brown's attractive cinematography), although Annan’s discovery of bloodied clothes in the room above marks one (or both) of these cross-eyed Lovelies as mentally disturbed, which can explain the absence of their respective families, some of which seem to have lived in the house at one time or another and “left” under mysterious circumstances. Stokes' unexpected arrival disordered relationships, partly because Faulkner has a pathological hatred of men, and partly because Annan is attracted to him, which creates tension that leads to a climatic vortex of violence. There is an unusual, multi-layered sequence in which Faulkner tries to “emasculate” his ignorant visitor by dressing him in women's clothes, although Stokes' alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery. <br /> <br /> In the early scenes, at least, the relationship between Faulkner and Annan is portrayed with extraordinary grace and dignity, but this sincere sapphic link quickly turns into pleasant crowd mob episodes of sex and frivolity, ending in an explosion of horror Annan allows himself to be raped by Stokes after a violent dispute with Faulkner. The final sequences (literally) are painful, especially the last scene of Annan, which seems to have been cut out due to censorship in 1977 and has never been fully restored (what remains is still quite bright, so get ready!). An excellent three leading game, backed by the unobtrusive guidance of Warren, who makes full use of stunning forest locations, thereby compensating for the film's budget shortcomings. Originally released in the USA as ALIEN PREY.
