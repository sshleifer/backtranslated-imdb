Perhaps this is the worst documentary I've ever seen. It looked so amateur. Chris Hegedus was one of the directors of the War Room, which was a great movie (albeit a bit one-sided), but it looked great. Startup.com looked like it was shot in the basement of some guy. The quality was so miserable that I could not look at it. I saw about 30 minutes or so, and I had to return him to the blockbuster and get something else. I can't understand how something so amateur from someone like Chris Hegedus. How the hell does this win any rewards for a start ??? War Room definitely deserved an award, as did another great documentary called Ameragosa (both received awards). This documentary looked like it was made by Uncle Joe, who also holds weddings on weekends. Shaky, dimly lit, unflattering lighting, bad sound, a 10-year-old could make a movie better than that guy.
