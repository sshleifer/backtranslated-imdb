CHE! This is a bad film that deserves the reputation of an unintentionally funny film. He takes a serious topic and presents it as a version of Cliff Notes or Classic Comics, because there is not so much emotion or proper narration in it - only episodic segments, stitched together, mostly with stupid "truthful stories" transmitted by various yuttsy /> <br /> This is a deservedly ridiculed film, as it is poorly written and shot. However, what seemed most interesting to me in the film was his obvious gay overtones. Instead of Che Guevarra and Fidel Castro working on Communist Cuba, they seem more like a gay couple - Che behaves modestly and aloof, and Fidel is a passionate fan! Again and again, the film is replete with remarkable lines, for example, when Fidel implores Che “Cuba needs you .... I NEED YOU !! ” I'm not sure if the studio intended this homosexual hidden current, but it is not required for the brain surgeon to know it! I am very surprised that other reviewers did not point this out. However, if you remember this when you watch a movie, the view will become even more exciting and even more fun. <br /> <br /> Last remark. In recent years, Che was very chic - even a fashionable statement with heaps of teenage dead who have no idea who he was in shirts adorned with his face. Considering that he was a cold-blooded killer and a nihilist (a strange combination for the doctor), this new reverence for the man is rude. What will they do next, put Hitler or Dr. Mengele on t-shirts and posters? !! Even communists with a conscience must be shocked by the bloodshed for which Guevara was responsible, and I find it ironic that people with computers defend a person who would probably kill them, giving half a chance! <br /> <br /> Given how stupid and inadvertently ridiculous this film was, it does not contribute to the assertion that Guevara was not a hero. I would really like to see a realistic film about his life - with good and bad, but also with dialogue and plot, which chimpanzees clearly were not made!
