I agree that Mary Voronova (secretary of Murdoch) is one of the few good things in this film. She is my favorite actress, every role she plays always turns out so well. Her character is cunning, sarcastic, intelligent, carefree, cheerful and cunning. She really does a good job with this role, and you understand perfectly well what her character is. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is pretty bad. Music is the most interesting thing left over. One of the characters has this really weird round radio, which she brings with her when she puts on her narrow jersey in a strip of zebra. <br /> <br /> One thing that intrigued a little in this story was the idea that someone hires these three college children to decorate an old abandoned theater. He gives them the keys and says - go for it. It would be a lot of fun, and I would like someone to give me such a chance! Imagine that you go to an old abandoned theater with two other people, and you decide how to decorate and fix it. You have full control over the whole building. That would be so much fun! Unfortunately, the characters do not think of this as an exciting adventure, they think of it as a great routine. They walk with long faces and fight with each other all the time. This is partly a bummer. But it is interesting to think about the opportunities that these people do not even like. <br /> <br /> The film rather well helps you to feel helpless or a little scared by the theater itself. However, acting (apart from Voronov ... and, perhaps, Murdoch, the boss - simply because he earns good money from a hungry fake smiley businessman who never gets lucky) is really terrible, and in the end you feel dissatisfied. Plus, a random farce is a bit sticky and kind of destroys the reality that the film is trying to create. <br /> <br /> Look at this if you are digging for Mary Voronov, the frightened 80s-inspired Casio electronic beats, and if you think that the giant, creepy, abandoned theater is intriguing for you.
