A television ad for this film showed how warlocks hit the truck with a frontal blow, then smashed to pieces and transformed on the other side of the truck. I thought the special effects were good, but the overall style of the film was weak. This is the series "Charmed", in which three boys instead of three girls. <br /> <br /> A big surprise for three teenagers who are going to become adults is that there is an unknown fourth member of the clan, who to get them and unite all their power. In addition to driving in trucks, these children can fly up around the edges of houses, crawl out of windows, push each other into garbage heaps and force veins around their necks to bulge. But if they use their strength too often, they become prematurely old and weak. Evidence of this is the father of one of the boys, who sits in an attic similar to a mummy, but he is only 45 years old. <br /> <br /> Each of the three good warlockers is dirty rich in his own right, completely spoiled, unpleasant and annoying. In any public school these children would be beaten every day. Their highlights and mites do not cut the mustard from the hood. Unfortunately for all the good people, these Charmed Boys were sent to the Hogwarts Reform School for sorcerers who could not get into the Harry Potter class. <br /> <br /> So what was the film about? Three teenagers are playing each other and their girlfriends. Another teenager who envies their power and money and turns out to be a lost relative. After a few scenes where Charmed Guys show off their strength and have sex with their girlfriends; the film falls into the plot of an unknown teenage warlock. Predictable things happen. A bad warlock ambushes various friends of other warlocks and eventually starts attacking them. There is a final confrontation, and thatâ€™s all. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not bad, but nothing special. If you like to see fireballs, spiders and blue veins, then this is a good movie to watch.
