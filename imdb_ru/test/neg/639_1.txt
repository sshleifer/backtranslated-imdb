I'm a big fan of sci-fi movies. So, when I saw this movie in the EPG, I thought that I would have a nice evening. What a disappointment ! I could not have imagined such a bad display of “special effects” in 1980, but in 2005? Come on, why do you need to do special effects of a helicopter flying in the desert when you can shoot a real one at a much lower price (I guess)? And these killer "dolls" ... well, I could have done it better than a couple of hours in the garage. You can expect a low budget for a movie, but I do not think it is wise to have a low movie for any budget. As for the “star” of the film (today I use many quotes ...), Lou Diamond Phillips, the guy is not even remotely an actor. Perhaps he should have stayed in a martial arts movie. In general, a terrible movie. Maybe I have a bad mood tonight. On the other hand, maybe not. Sincere 1 out of 10.
