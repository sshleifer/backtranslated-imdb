This is a bad movie. It certainly falls into the category “Do not make a feature film”. The plot, direction, acting and style - all like a pancake History consists of five and five ?? football matches have spread throughout the film, each of which was filmed more boring than the previous one, as the non-functional amateur football team is gaining momentum. That's it, this is the plot. It's hard to understand who this movie is for. This is too banal for football fans, and there is nothing in it either for teenagers or for adults. There is nothing in this for women, not even one female character. This longing bothers you when a team game is game by game by game by game by game. The story, as it is, the dialogue and manners, seems to be taken from long gone Ireland, when all the actors mock theatrical accents of Dublin. It does not need to be seen to be believed. Avoid at all costs. Can anyone give me back my 90 minutes. A high point of credits at the end, a low point is too much to mention. Brendan Gleason in this film.
