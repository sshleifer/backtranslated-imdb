I do not know about what movement hasidic was this film? I saw this movie a year ago. I am an Orthodox woman, I live in an Orthodox Hasidic? Community And I can tell you that I was offended by this movie! This is so far from reality, this is scary! The director could at least hire Rabbi Hassidik for a brief consultation before making a realistic ultra-orthodox movie! For example, David Meira (Morning Prayers)! Or a Jewish wedding, or the customs of Mikve (ritual bath). <br /> <br /> There are technical inaccuracies in the film, but they don’t bother me. This is the spiritual side. Orthodox are depicted near the Taliban. Women are powerless, and men - the main rulers! You are welcome! No one can force a Jewish girl to go to Chuppa against her will! We, Orthodox, also live according to the law (Halacha), which clearly defines the duties of a man towards his wife. Do not hit or rape, either! And no man (not even a rabbi) is allowed to rush at a woman in Mikve. it's not about putting your hand on a woman's head while she is taking a ritual bath, the idea is to sink the whole body in one go! The director obviously tried to beat the ultra-Orthodox! But could he do it, at least, in a good and educated way? <br /> <br /> Love story? Sweet ! But not credible. Dialogues are long and boring. The end sucks. For all this drama, I at least hoped for a good ending, for all this sitting that I felt, I deserved it! Obviously, someone tried to make a good, soothing conscious film for less observant Jews or, perhaps, for non-Jews ... (look at these fundamentalists, they are so evil and evil ...), and they succeed! In short: hoping for a good film “Europien” (Kane's level), instead he got a truly immoral, unrealistic, mistakenly guiding nonsense. I mean, today we live in times of free will like never before. Everyone has the right to choose. Malka chose a rock singer. Rivka made her choice. Meir made his. Nowadays, many non-traditional people choose Orthodox Judaism. Because in this crazy world, religion can be a wonderful gateway!
