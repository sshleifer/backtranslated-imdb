This film was a Mexican horror film from the late 60s. This is not so good, but in fact is not so bad. There is a lot of choke, and he is pretty naked with nudity and violence, but he had a conspiracy and, at least, he tried to stick to it (even if the plot was the same devilishly inspired Frankenstein "do not interfere in God's possession" -Kino-passage. . Several pads were added to the women's wrestling, but this was done in Mexico, and the wrestling seems to be popular in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The plot is that the doctor wants to save his son, who is dying from leukemia. Other doctors did not give hope to the poor guy, but dad has an idea to transplant the gorilla’s heart to his son in order to save his life (I don’t know, I’m a lawyer, not a doctor). The graft works, but the son-boy becomes a man who terrorizes naked women and kills anyone who stands in his way. There is also a plot involving a policeman and his girlfriend, who is a wrestler (it really didn’t add too much, but if they want to add some female masked wrestlers, this is a good reason for this). <br /> <br /> The film was partly cheap, but not too bad for the b-movie of the day. The plot was basically just reworked, and there were a few things that were not so well connected. However, this film is funny in its own way (I don’t know why, maybe because it is a Mexican horror film that falls out of my usual bad diet movie). I think it may be because it is a mix and a mixture of very strange things. <br /> <br /> See if you like funny foreign films, nudity and female wrestlers.
