OUR GANGA got one chance for a feature film in its 22-year history, and was it the best thing to do? This is boring, forced and meaningless, and I must respectfully disagree with another poster of this film; The 1994 remake of LITTLE RASCALS was better than this. Almost everything is there. Children are subject to a civil war process; this is not at all like the film “OUR GANG”, but it looks like the second-rate clone of Shirley Temple is no joke.
