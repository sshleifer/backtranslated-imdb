I think this program is rubbish. All they do is argue and beat each other in the face, and they call it an action ?! These people are paid a lot of money for this, and most of them cannot even save their lives. In addition, the storylines are terrible, and after a few minutes of viewing, I was sick of it. I like the way Harry Hill removes mickey from him in his TV show 'TV Burp', for example. weak joke "The Princess and the Pea Is Not Shakespeare?" Sonya and Naomi were in the seams. I do not see how ridiculous it is. I think itâ€™s a waste of money for a TV license, so it can be shown 4/5 days a week. Is there nothing better than this?
