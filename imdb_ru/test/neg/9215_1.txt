In my opinion, the ending is what completely destroyed all this. The initial idea was that someone suddenly realized that they were the son of God, and the second coming was somewhat clever. People began to believe him, and his friends became new students. People went crazy, the demons had people, all kinds of entertainment. Of course, then everything went wrong. It's bad enough that they had to take on the impossible task of viewing a huge number of works to find the “third testament” in five days, but in the end it became a ridiculous humanistic fantasy. I will not spoil it, but I will simply say that it comes off as if it were written by a teenager with very limited knowledge of theology. I heard that they are making an American full-length version of this story, I just hope they change the sensational finale.
