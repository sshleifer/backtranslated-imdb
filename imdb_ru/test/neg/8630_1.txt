Man, what a horrible movie. As in many horrible films, the structure of his horror lies in the script. This is such a pitiful attempt at a psychological thriller that it gives notoriety to the whole genre. Well, here is one of the main problems: the character of Sandra Bullock is kidnapped by Jeff Bridges in his car in a busy shop in broad daylight. Somehow, her boyfriend Kiefer Sutherland does not find a single witness to this act and subsequently spends most of the film completely unaware of where she is. Come on! Personally, I find it completely offensive to even the most daring viewers. And yet we are forced to buy this nonsense. Equally disappointed is the poorly explained motive for Jeff Bridges' actions. Of course, his character is a bit eccentric academician, but far from a sociopath who would do this. It takes about ten minutes, come on or take it, spilling the beans into Sutherland to see why he did his cruel actions. But the explanation itself lacks even the most elementary sense of logic. Therefore, no intelligent audience member can truly believe in the possibility of their own evil. And if you subtract this element from the story, it will all collapse. <br /> <br /> Also a serious problem: -Jeff Bridges uses a strange pseudo-French accent for no reason. <br /> <br /> - All the boring story with Nancy Travis, especially in that she saved the day by turning the tables on the Bridges. <br /> <br /> - A crazy woman who somehow manages to memorize Jeff Bridges' license plate, despite the fact that she thought that the dwarf Lucky Charms is real. <br /> <br /> - Sandra Bullock's character name, Diane Shaver, is conveniently redrawn to form the word "disappeared." Are you joking? - The logistical impossibility of poisoning, abduction and burial (in a very remote place) of a person for forty minutes (as Bridges specifically mentions). <br /> <br /> This is the movie that made me remember the fictional, incredibly stupid (but very successful) character of Donald Kaufman in the film “Adaptation”. Many scriptwriters are great, inspired artists. Some are just assholes who convince assholes who run studios to fool around. This particular scenario is so stunning that Donald Kaufman himself would be able to sell it. Unfortunately for all of us in the real world, Todd Graff really did.
