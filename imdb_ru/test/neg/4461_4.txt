The idea of ​​moving Dracula into modern times is not bad - after all, it can liven up the series a little by adding a new plot element to the series, which Hammer has practically exhausted in a long series of great films. However, since the present day turned out to be cheesy in the early 1970s, the results were pretty dumb and looked like LOVE ON THE FIRST BITE (deliberate comedy). Seeing Christopher Lee in a movie filled with 70s hip linguists, electric guitar chords and ridiculous rock music seemed incredible. Worse yet, acting is much higher here - with the intense and stupid performance of “Johnny Alucard”. I also thought that it was really funny that Van Helsing’s grandson noticed that “Alucard” is “Dracula” written backwards — no one else understood this for himself! Wow, what a trick !! <br /> <br /> So much of the film was bad, why did he still earn an almost decent score of 4? Well, when the story came to the expected clash between Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) and Drake (Christopher Lee), it was exciting and ended very well. In addition, and I know that it will sound very sexist, but if I had to watch a bad movie, then at least the character Stephanie Bicham wore really good outfits that revealed her enough ... "talents", so to speak. So at least watching this movie was very nice. <br /> <br /> By the way, the film ends with the phrase “may he rest in the FINAL world” at the end, although this was not the last film of Hammer Dracula. with Lee. He returned to Dracula's Satanic Rites only a short time later, and in many ways he was even worse than this stupid monster movie.
