It is hard to imagine that two actors of such a class and experience as Michael Kane and Michael Gambon be involved in such an embarrassing film. Responsibility for this thoughtless production should be borne by writer Neil Jordan and director Conor McPherson. I doubt I have seen such a bad movie with such good credits a long time ago. Comedian Dylan Moran, who has noted himself as an irritable and incompetent owner of a bookstore in the Black Books television comedy program, turns into the same routine, with the exception of such an excess and lack of comedy control, which makes it pace. It is easy to see how this story could work, because the situation is interesting and full of comic potential. The classic actor (Kane) tries to disrupt the crowd (Gambon and Co.) with an assistant clumsy copycat (Moran), with predictable results. It could and should have been good. Unfortunately, it should not have been.
