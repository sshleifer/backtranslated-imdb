I'm not sure I've ever seen such a bad movie. Awful game, ubiquitous plot, terrible special effects. There are a few points “so bad, this is good,” but not enough to maintain interest. The woman who plays Tracy looks disgusting. There are some pretty disturbing scenes with gnomes that make you feel slightly disturbed. On the other hand, the scene of special operations is quite funny for special effects, like the chase after the car, when one car “tries to force us out of the way” without making contact. I think the budget did not stretch to smash cars. Yes, and what looks like a Taj Mahal postcard is shown every time they are cut in a fictional foreign country.
