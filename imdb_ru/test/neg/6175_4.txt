There are many different problems with the movie "KillShot". For example, there are too many matches. The husband is a hunter and just hunts on the day when the main killer appears, with someone whom the killer knows. Ok, I'll take it. The guy calls the real estate agency for which his wife works, and asks for money to be ready when he comes for him. Ok, I'll take it as well. Before he went to get cash, he decided to rob our killer, who does not kill him, but decided to go to work with him. It starts to become very weak. Then they appear on the same day when the husband conducts an interview with the boss of the wife. There is no one there except for his wife and husband, who decided to get into an empty office. They sneak into the office, and the professional killer simply assumes that he is talking to the right guy. This is only the first 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are a lot more holes in this movie than I want to talk about. Why the killer did not just kill everyone at a real estate agency, I do not know. Why he did not shoot a woman on her porch, I do not know. Why he continued to allow this stupid child to do all these silly movements and spoil a lot of shit, I don't know. Why the girl was even in the film, I do not know. Why he decided not to put the gun in his pocket and just leave it on the counter, I do not know. Why they even went to the witness protection program, I do not know. What I really know is that the casting director did an excellent job, the photography director did a very good job, the scout from the locations chose excellent locations, and the production designer cost everyone. Therefore, my advice is for anyone who chooses a script that will be worked out so well by the team to make sure that every attempt to kill someone from the killer will not be torn off through the open window.
