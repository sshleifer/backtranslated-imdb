The film takes place in Newcastle-on-Tyne in the north-east of England, in the city where I was born and raised. The film is also generally dishonest - the way it represents the city, the children, but above all the men of the city. In this film, they are all stupid, cruel, thieves, thugs. <br /> <br /> I suppose I could comment on the plot (predictable), actions (competently unattractive), direction (lazy and unimaginable), but for me it does not matter compared to insulting the director of the city and its residents. <br /> <br /> Thus, the invitation in my resume to director and writer Mark Herman to leave the northeast.
