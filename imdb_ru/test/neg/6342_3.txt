But to be more precise, I do not think it is as bad as it could be. Despite the fact that the actors (from famous to semi-famous) did not do a good job. Guilty of directors? Is it hard for me to tell the script? In any case, if you need a lot of cool weapons and actions, this is not a movie for you, but they run around with lots of vintage ww2 shotguns. It seems fun :) Well, I guess I could say more, but it just does not seem to be worth it. If you are desperate enough or a freak Hackman, look at it differently, do not! <br /> <br /> Live well and prosper
