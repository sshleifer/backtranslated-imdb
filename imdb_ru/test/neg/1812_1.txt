The Heart of Darkness film is an insult to the book of Joseph Conrad! Honestly, the movie made me want to sleep. On the other hand, the book was definitely unusual. I feel that the film missed several key elements and missed some highlights from the book. In addition, the actors were boring, they lacked originality and enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> The book, although not an adventure or easy to understand, is full of hidden meaning and interesting plot twists. The book, albeit very confusing and complex, is amazing. When you finally understand this, you feel as if you have really learned something. The short story, or short story, had several key ideas, such as futility and madness, that the film missed. In addition, several key scenes were changed, which in turn affected the whole plot. Many scenes seemed very "changeable" in the sense that they did not fit each other. Thus, the film seemed a poor interpretation of the book. <br /> <br /> I would recommend to watch this film only if you cannot depict or understand the book, but otherwise I would have missed this one. It was terrible and in total disarray. If you have never read a book, then definitely donâ€™t watch the movie, because you need the basic information from the book to understand the movie. The film was a terrible result of an outstanding and detailed book.
