... but not this one! I always wanted to know what happened next. We will never know for sure what happened, because GWTW was a child of Margaret. I am a longtime fan of Gone with the Wind, and I could not be more repulsive to the film. I compared Scarlett with the original GWTW, because any film worthy of GWTW must be of the same quality as the first. Rhett was played beautifully, although no one compares to Mr. Gable. I am also a strict fan of Vivien Leigh! She was Scarlett. She meets all the requirements. No actress in this life or in another life will ever wear the same shoes, but with Scarlett the work could be better. There were not enough thoughts to find a suitable Scarlett, it was obvious. <br /> <br /> In general, there is something to see, but if you want to know what happened to Scarlett and Ratt, I suggest writing it yourself or finding a fan of fiction. This film is not worth the time.
