Starting with the first shot of a meteor falling to Earth, you know that something special is waiting for you. <br /> <br /> This is an ultra-low budget video about a group of teenagers stranded on a lighthouse island. with some monsters. The story is unremarkable and nothing that you have not seen a thousand times before. Acting is not great, but not quite terrible, but the special effects, of which there are many, are ridiculous at best. In fact, if you can read this sentence, the likelihood that you can do a more decent job of creating the effect of the explosion and the composition of the video in this film than that of directors is above 50%. <br /> <br /> The saving grace of the film - if you are in the mood for a turkey class Z movie - this is something that always happens and it never gets boring. And if you like to laugh at bad movies with your friends, you can simply find this rent for dollars. <br /> <br /> And I have to say that I appreciated the introductory joke: "This is the stupidest island name I've ever heard." Probably the best moment in the film.
