I was stuck in traffic (I live in Sicily) on my way to the theater (at the military base) to see Superman Returning, I was 15 minutes late, and the only other game of the film was “See No Evil,” there was no poster for it, and just a brief description of the movie in the schedule ... but my friend and I decided to check it out ... As soon as I saw that it was done in WWE, I just knew that it would be awful. A few people in the theater laughed most of the time, and this was the first film that I honestly thought of going out, and I saw The Ringer ... well, I would come out of it, but I was too busy to sleep. The death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good, but other than that, it was just silly.
