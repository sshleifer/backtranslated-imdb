I was involved in this film early, much to my surprise, because I was not going to watch it at all. Now I would not want to. Waiting begins well, with a run-in leading to death, and the question of whether the guilty character is recognized, or will be discovered, or (doable now, although not in the old days of filmmaking) to leave with him. The plot was made earlier - something that does not have a plot - but the tension inherent in it, with additional complications and motivations arising from the illegal love affair, makes for an exciting first half. Then the film refuses to hit and run, to begin the misty exposure of two undivided, suffering from love. The two tracks of the plot — hit-run and unreasonable love — simply do not have enough in common with each other, and the fact that the same characters participate in them does not bind them enough to justify the departure from the original story line. The writer had to choose one plot or another. At the end of the film, at the height of the second funeral of the film, I found myself thinking: “Now, what does this have to do with this run?” The filmmakers might think that the answer is obvious, but I think the film was prepared and seemed flabby.
