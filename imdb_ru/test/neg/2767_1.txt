This movie really sucks. <br /> <br /> Just try not to sleep for 5 minutes, watching this nonsense about a pretty girl (Joan Woodbury), who is connected with the “underworld” because she needs money (and because she is too lazy to work with friends after they offer her to her). Alan Ladd was supposed to be the star of this thing, but he was nowhere to be found in the first half hour, and when he appears, he stands like a constipated dummy. A real brat with quite talkative scenes and incredible (as well as stupid) characters, so that you want someone to shoot someone, for example, very quickly. <br /> <br /> Bring a pillow.
