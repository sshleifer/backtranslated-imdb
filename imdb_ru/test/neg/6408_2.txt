Not only because of this theme in the film. Which was one of the weak excuses for something resembling a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> I watched it, knowing that I did not like it. I hate numerology. Whenever someone starts walking on patterns with numbers, I feel the urge to hit them. My own brain starts to hurt from sympathy. And fully aware that this is a film on this subject, I could not resist the desire to watch it and, possibly, laugh. But it was not funny. Just a stupid look: “Isn't it scary and yet amazingly cool ?! I can turn any nonsense into 23! ”Dialogue I was afraid of. As soon as the son began to interfere, I realized that this film was a shit, no matter what happened. But I almost never stop watching the movie I started. I sat through it. I enjoy pain. <br /> <br /> The film pretends to ridicule numerology in the guise of how obsession can end badly. But he moves on this wave as much as he should crush. I do not see this message. I see only characters raving about a stupid number with a small plot to justify. <br /> <br /> Finish it with the usual “surprises” - trying to come up with another twist, it doesn't make sense, and you almost believe it because of the quality of the story there - and you get one empty part of the filmmaking. It just happens around a topic that I despise. If he had not tried to be serious, rather it was some kind of funny movie with actors that I don’t care about. But I was starting to like Kerry ... although he is not to blame, he is trying. It's not even good to view with a bunch of friends and mst3k, damn, out of this. <br /> <br /> My expectations were low enough that someone stumbled on them, but this film was able to meet the expectations of the worst that I have ever seen.
