This movie just does not work. There are no two ways about this. I first saw him in 1998, when he was released, and I did not like it. I just bought it for sale a couple of days ago, because I thought, "What the hell, I will try." I don’t regret the money I spent on Hamilton, but the fact remains the same ... this film is meaningless, boring and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Stormare is usually admired, but it is then that he earns films in the United States. At home he does not do the trick. Of course, the film is well shot (if you forget the odd shots here and here), but in the end, the only thing that REALLY raises Hamilton over one stellar garbage, it's Hamill's turn as the bad guy Hawkins. He is seriously having fun with the character, and is also responsible for only two good moments in the film ... “Swedish intelligence, yes? Now there is a contradiction in terms and when he lets Hamilton talk a few words with his wife about the telephone by the end of the film. And indeed it is. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
