This is a film about a dark-skinned man who buys an airline and turns it into an African, oriented to the topmost airliner. They even portray the owner as not only controlling the airline, but also controlling the terminal at the airport. One day this guy wins $ 100 million the next time you see him, he walks around the airport, acting as the owner of the airport. Everyone calls this film a parody, but nothing in this film screams a parody! This film is a failure, and it will forever remain in the basket for $ 4.95 at Wal-Mart. <br /> <br /> I can't even understand why MGM spent $ 16 million on this film. This movie does not even guarantee the status of the video. Authors (one black and one white) must be forever from Hollywood. Not only do they overly stereotype blacks, they portray them as ignorant people. I would be ashamed to go to the cinema, which constantly humiliates me. Do not waste your time in the video store, in the window, pay-per-view, or on Sunday afternoon, when the film will be shown on TBS.
