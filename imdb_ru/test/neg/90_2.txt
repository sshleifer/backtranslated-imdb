The only reason this film was not given a 1 (horrible) voice is because Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan's play is great. Ida Lupino, who, as usual, is sweet, is becoming increasingly distraught, trying to get rid of the madman in various ways. Robert Ryan is terrible as a formidable stranger, whose character, guided only by his restless mind, changes from one minute to another. It would seem simple and obedient, suddenly he becomes intelligent and threatening. Mrs. Lupino’s character was more at risk from the house in which she lived and her own stupidity than anyone else. She could not get out of her house: the windows did not open, the entrance and rear doors were locked and opened from the inside with a key. You could not think of a worse fire trap if you tried. She did not take precautions to have at least one additional key. She also could not figure out how to get help from her neighbors or get out of her own basement when she was locked up and hidden from her captor's eyes. I don’t know in which war her husband was killed, but if it was World War II, the situation in her house, the styles of clothing, especially children, and the telephone company repairman’s car are clearly anachronistic. I recommend watching this movie to see what oddities you can find.
