A real insult to the original "Spullos", which is one of the most truly disturbing films (and I intend to do this as a compliment!), Which I have seen in recent years. <br /> <br /> Where the original is frightening and brilliant, the remake is flat and even boring, especially the ending of the “happy end” selects that there was little expectation in this film in the first place. <br /> <br /> Although such a distortion (especially the vaccine) “happy ending”, which was not there before) is quite often found in “Hollywood” remakes of European films about art house, it could be expected that that this senseless mess was created by the same film director who made the original Spullos ... <br /> <br /> Why Mr. Sluizer decided to spoil his masterpiece in such a way I don’t know. <br /> <br /> Avoid this abomination at all costs, as this may spoil the original, even if you look * after * this, not to mention the opposite ...
