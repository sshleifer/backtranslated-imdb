This film begins with an interesting stage design and a promising premise, but does not provide products for the cult film. Being in a parallel sandy universe, where everything belongs to the corporation "Blump", this concerns a terrible comedian who succeeds when a third hand grows out of his back. <br /> <br /> The full potential is because the good cheese here is the washed star of the 80s Judd Nelson, Wayne Newton, unusual visual effects and strange plot digressions, full women in poor underwear, necrophilia - but it never pays off. <br /> <br /> Tempo is the main problem. Every scene is painfully slow. Nelson's props must be funny, because they are not very funny. But each performance stretches until it becomes even funny, just boring. <br /> <br /> Imagine someone telling you the longest and strangest joke that he can imagine, full of smirks and arrogance for how ridiculous and strange he thinks. Imagine that after two hours of this impasse you have never had a zest. You just saved yourself from having to watch The Dark Backward.
