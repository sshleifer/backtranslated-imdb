I think I remember a lot of hype about this film when it came out, but for many years I have not seen it. I would like to wait longer. Maybe this movie was funny in 1988, I don't know. I was younger then, but it seemed that the world was not so different. Michelle Pfeiffer, no matter how good she is, is never convincing. Mercedes Rühl not only chews landscapes, but also stuffs them in the cheeks, like a gerbil, to save for later. Dean Stockwell is as convincing as the Mafia boss, since James Gandolfini would be the main dancer of the Bolshoi Theater. And Matthew Modin demonstrated the clearest case of delayed puberty that I have ever seen. In general, it’s not so bad to make you want to snatch your eyes with a melon, but it’s not far off.
