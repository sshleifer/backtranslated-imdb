It's just another one of those "Americans who find romance with a charming foreigner in an exotic European region." This genre has cinematically gone bankrupt since the 1950s, but they continue to release them. I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing it — a bad idea, we both hated it. If all you want to see is Tuscany, try watching “Stealing Beauty” with Liv Tyler - the movie is a little better. <br /> <br /> This type of genre films is very remarkable.
