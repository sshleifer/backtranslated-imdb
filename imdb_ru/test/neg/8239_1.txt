As I sat and watched this episode, I continued to look at my watch, expecting something to happen. When the hour was over, I thought that they were really going to give us more popularity at the end, and then nothing. The whole family is wrapped around the New Year tree, like something from the Hallmark Channel, then disappear to black. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the poorest seasons I've ever seen. Nothing can cause excitement next season. The only incentive to watch the next season was that Agent Harris was offering an ambiguous nugget throwing up the sandwich guys in New York were looking for to get one of the guys in New Jersey. Wow, really? I would never expect something like this from thugs, I am on the edge of my place. <br /> <br /> They seem to be trying to make everyone lose interest. They start more storylines that end up simply disappearing than any show I've ever seen. They tease and hint, but rarely deliver more. <br /> <br /> What about the Arabs who hang out at Bing? They continue to throw them in front of us, and nothing magically happens. <br /> <br /> Pauli's knee-caps are some kind of child after Tony promised his mother that nothing would happen to her son and the devil would be blown away by the wind. /> <br /> And how long do we still have to endure pervert addicts with Christopher? Please let him be arrested or overdose, or something interesting. <br /> <br /> It was one of the few shows that I was looking forward to, but now Iâ€™ll forget about it.
