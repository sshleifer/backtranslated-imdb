This film was given to me by my uncle, who received it for free with a DVD magazine. It is easy to understand why he so wanted to get rid of him. Now I understand that this is the “B” film, and it does not have the same budget size as the larger films, but, undoubtedly, they could spend their money better than make this garbage. There are some pretty good performances, namely Jack, Beth and Hawks, but others are ridiculously bad (for example, droid assassin). This film also contains the worst fight scene I've ever seen. The amount of nudity in the film made it seem more like a porn movie than in Sci-Fi movies at times <br /> <br /> In conclusion. - Awful movie
