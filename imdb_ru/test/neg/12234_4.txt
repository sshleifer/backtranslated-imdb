1st commentary on the film! I'll start by saying: “Come on! Isn't that bad ... isn't it? ”... No, in fact, it wasn't all that bad. I laughed and giggled quite a few times in the film, so I can’t say with my hand on my heart that it’s rubbish. <br /> <br /> This is completely different, this is also an Epic film (The epic film sucked badly ... Doh!) "How so?" people will ask. I'll tell you how. This film is not so senseless, not to mention that nonsense (and I say nonsense, because it is so, but nonsense makes them ridiculous) occurring around and with the characters are really pleasant in this film. Not the best, but hey ... what would you expect - look at the poster! Some people said it was stupid, I think that when writing a comment you need to be more objective (my own opinion), but yes, of course, it was stupid, this is a film about "stupidity"! Listen, I'm not telling you to go and watch a movie now, otherwise you missed the event of the century. What I want to say is that if you happen to watch a movie somewhere, please do not look at the opening credits. See what all this is for — who knows, you might like it a little. <br /> <br /> I give 4/10 for the fact that I am not so bad and do not dare me, and some unexpectedly good jokes related to sex.
