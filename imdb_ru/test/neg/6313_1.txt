This film easily falls into the category of ridiculous, if not to say that it is really offensive. I mean, in what alternative universe did the filmmakers and studios think that this film would play? From the beginning to the end, we were bombarded with Quaid's replay and ridiculous facial expressions, lying on “they have a free gun,” a little bit thick. Another feature that I encountered in the film is the lack of a realistic story that would make you grow to connect with the character. I mean one scene where Lewis plays in a bar before making it big is absolutely unbelievable, just an absurd fight in a bar, of which every resident is a part. Then Lewis begins to play his version of “Many Shocks”, and everyone immediately forget about their differences and start dancing wildly, as if this is the most common thing in the world. Similar scenes, of which there are many, combined with the lack of depth in any of the characters, led me to a real laugh. So in general, this film is not worth watching to anyone who is not interested in mocking the creator of the film and his acting decisions for one and a half hours.
