I watched this movie quite embarrassed. I’m not sure if he was trying to be a horror festival in Rob Zombie’s novel or research into real events. <br /> <br /> In any case, he did not reach his goal. This is not particularly historically accurate with characters that are hacked and changed for the sake of history. <br /> <br /> The performances were neither convincing nor bad. <br /> <br /> I would prefer a more psychological approach, and this film could easily go this way without compromising the overall effect. ,
