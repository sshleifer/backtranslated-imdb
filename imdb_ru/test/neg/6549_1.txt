The only positive thing I can think of regarding this piece of garbage is that I now finally have a good answer if someone asks me what the worst movie Iâ€™ve ever seen was called. it took so little effort to make it more watchable ... a lot more effort, and it could even be brilliant. <br /> <br /> Why does anyone want to produce such waste? <br /> <br /> I refuse to believe that a director can be so reckless and mediocre. <br /> <br /> Making an absolutely unbearable film must have been just that. <br /> <br /> Everything else just does not make sense.
