This is a movie that was supposed to be a mini-series because it tries to get too much information in too small a space. The whole story is constantly bombarded by minor plots, the introduction of characters and meaningless information about the fragments that are not going anywhere. There is a main plot where a boy meets a girl, she has doubts, but she still gets married, and then she has doubts, and she goes to see if they are real. They turn out to be wrong, but her husband will not believe that she was not wrong, and her boyfriend almost did not want her, because she was not wrong with her husband. With that said, there are at least 1000 auxiliary plots and characters that make this plot almost incomprehensible. In the first 15 minutes, you are inundated with so many things and situations that you just stop caring. You do not care about some tangled and spoiled cast, like vultures that feed on a corpse. Everyone comes and takes away some interest from the viewer. After half an hour, completely uninterested, I stayed and watched the remaining two and a half hours out of pure painful curiosity. I could not imagine where it was going, but, looking at the fire, I simply could not get up and turn it off. Production figures are excellent, but the resulting film is a waste of time; wash your socks instead.
