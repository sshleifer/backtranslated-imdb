I was very impressed with this movie when I was eight or nine years old. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could understand why people were afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing him as an adult, it seemed almost comical because of overzealous narrative and harsh details, like the gangsters of the thirties, driving cars that looked like they were from the fifties. There is a certain rough, untidy reality in the way criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny episode that remains with me is the scene in which Ma Barker and her sons shoot her with the FBI, and her sons die. The narrator says something like: "Perhaps at that moment, once in a lifetime, Ma Barker became a real mother." This should be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, when mom finally understands how she ruined her family because of her greed, but instead it causes laughter. A very strange film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. Fans of gangster cinema may like this, but this is more curiosity than real cinema.
