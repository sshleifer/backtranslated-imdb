I have never seen such a horrible film that I’ve lost my mind. It was a HUGE waste of watching this crappy movie. There are a lot of things that I hate in this film: the songs are so awful (albeit a bit catchy), I hit my head on the wall (especially from the song “Grandpa is going to sue Santa pants”, which I hit) 10 times * shrugs *) character design, and this evil, greedy and cousin Mel. <br /> <br /> I can’t tolerate her for a second, she must be one of the most severe people I have seen. Although I like her southern voice. <br /> <br /> The only bright side is that Austin Bucks is played by someone who is the voice of Liquid Snake from Metal Gear Solid. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend people to look at the holidays, as it was a HUGE shame for Christmas.
