I could not help but look at the time every 5-10 minutes, because I found this film a complete brake. Children's humor, cheap scenery, cheap effects, the plot, because of which “Legally blonde” looks like “Ordinary suspects”, and so many coincidences that now I can officially say that Robert Rodriguez had surgery on the brain somewhere after 1996 some cool camera movements are left as its trademark, but that’s what it ends up with. So, the guy decided to do something new for a change, a children's spy movie. Well, if I was 12 years old, I would feel offended. The best thing about this film is absolutely amazing Karla Gugino, who simply stole all the scenes she was in. Unfortunately, they were few. 4/10
