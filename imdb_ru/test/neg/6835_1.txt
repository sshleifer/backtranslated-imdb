The Day of the Jackal of 1973, directed by Fred Zinnemann from the novel by Frederick Forsythe, although not a masterpiece in the general scheme of things, nevertheless was a rather high thriller, written and performed with considerable bombast, wit and style. With pleasure to shoot and watch from time to time. <br /> <br /> Adapting him to the 1997 Jackal, it seems that at every step the writers and directors chose the worst possible option by doing all this. rather leaden, overdone, unsatisfactory, unsurprising, arrogant and disappointing. If we collected a catalog of all the details that were included in this film, large and small, I could give you a mini-essay for each topic about how the adaptation of 1997 adapted. <br /> <br /> Item: weapon. <br /> <br /> In the original, there is considerable intrigue about how the assassin is going to transport him to the scene, how he intends to disguise him, and why this requires non-standard work from his underground masters. In the remake, they apparently thought that today's audience, removing the militants, would not tolerate a small gun, the purpose of which was accuracy, and would require a tiring shelf machine gun, which is needed for a minivan. to transport him, and whose meaning scream macho. The whole complex and interesting business associated with disguising its components comes down to showing us (repeatedly how difficult it is to understand?) That the joystick for his ridiculous high-tech remote control system was in his pocket like a pen. <br /> <br /> Item: conspirators and motives. <br /> <br /> Without resorting to a dry lecture, the original still manages to give us a good understanding of the historical position of the pedi noirs [black legs] of the Franco-Algerian irredentists who could not accept the fact that the century was leaving from colonialism, and formed the opinion that de Gaulle betrayed them. This gives the whole story historical weight. It seems that the remake left it as a story about a gangster shootout, with minimal seasonings, making them Russian gangsters. Please note that I do not mind updating: they could do it wisely and come up with something more modern, but not trivial. Of course, lately, Russia and the rest of the former USSR have undergone tremendous changes, and an updated story could appear there so that we feel that it * matters *. <br /> <br /> Item: killer relationship on the run and police tracking him down; and the complex management of the viewer's sympathies from the bad guy to the good guy. <br /> <br /> Above, I hesitated a little, calling the original a masterpiece in general; but in this aspect it really was one. We follow the assassin for most of the first parts of the film, and, seeing his ingenuity and resourcefulness, we begin to admire him and don’t want to see his plan foiled, or see him caught - at least not too soon! Then we meet with the policeman, who are pushed to lead the investigation / defense efforts, and bit by bit we turn to him, and we see that he is not the sad bag that his internal problems could offer. By the time it matters, we have gone over to his side. <br /> <br /> In the remake, perhaps Poitiers could cope with this kind of development, but Gere, of course, cannot. And the absurd trick with the “48 hours” of the fraudster, who was supposed to help the police, had to stay in those comedies where he came from. <br /> <br /> In the remake, the assassin and the killer hunter * talk * about how they look like players over a chessboard, indirectly communicate through their moves and can only * draw a conclusion * about what the other looks like. This was accomplished superbly in the original. But in fact, in the remake, they too confront face-to-face too early, so they can grimace with each other, bloody the place and go through fairly standard chase scenes. <br /> <br /> Subject: photography and “scenery.” <br /> <br /> The remake does have some good images, especially in snowy Finland, in the initial part. But the Washington, DC, Metro cannot really compete with the streets of Paris for interesting perspectives and faces of witnesses.
