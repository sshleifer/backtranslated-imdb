With Al Jolson at the peak of his popularity, and Warner Brothers Jazz Singer was the highest grossing film of 1927, it was inevitable that other studios produced several cars for their own characters Jolson-esquire. But while Jazz Singer was the sensation that he was the first partial speaker, Morning Idol lacks the singing voice of his star (now little-known Johnny Walker), and he has to do only with his visual antics. <br /> <br /> Matinée Idol was an early directorial assignment for the famous Frank Capra. The first pair of Capra's full-length functions for "Harry Langdon" reveals a very showy, excessive style, due to which it was almost impossible to discern the already mediocre farce of Langdon. A few snapshots later, and Capra learned to relax a little, with some fairly regular and decent camera work. However, he still shows no inclination to shoot a physical comedy. The longest comic routine - the stage presentation - seems to have some good jokes, but all of this is divided into many different camera angles, and the comedy has no chance to come naturally from the performances. Theoretically, a significant part of the jokes is in intertitles, but there are too many of them, and none of them is particularly funny. <br /> <br /> Of course, Capra will eventually turn into a beautiful, dramatic and romantic director, and you can see how he is starting to develop in this regard. He cuts the line, approaching Walker's and Bessie's love in a scene where she first looks at him in his rise of Don Wilson, neatly establishing a wordless connection between them. In addition, the masquerade has some beautiful and tender couples in their scene that very much resemble the love scenes in the Capra film in the early 30s. <br /> <br /> Johnny Walker, Colombia’s answer to Al-Jolson. Not an exceptional talent. His comic time is good, but nothing makes it stand out. Bessie Love, on the other hand, is also a pretty good actress with a very expressive face. Glory to her for participating in the physical comedy and the loss of her dignity with the boys. There is also a good role for Lionel Belmore, this round and funny character who seems to appear in absolutely everything in the late 20s and early 30s. <br /> <br /> Matinée Idol is one of those paintings that received more than its fair share of attention thanks to its director, who later made a handful of masterpieces. In itself, this is a very uninteresting work, and, like most of the works of Capra, before meeting with Robert Riskin, frustration.
