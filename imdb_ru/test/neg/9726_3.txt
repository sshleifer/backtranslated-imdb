If I gave the idea of ​​this film to some Hollywood pranksters, I am sure that it would sound like this: <br /> <br /> I: “Four boys in a private school are good friends, And they are witches. "<br /> <br /> Hollywood:" It sounds like "Craft." <br /> <br /> I: "No, no, I said four boys, not four girls." <br /> Hollywood: "It still sounds like Craft, only with boys, not girls." <br /> <br /> I: “Ok, but the fifth unknown boy appears in the picture, and he wants more power. "<br /> <br /> Hollywood:" Still not many differences, because one of the girls in the "Craft" also wanted more power. <br /> <br /> I: "Good, good" ... I will make these boys part "in the crowd", they will be rich, And the school is on the east coast. <br /> <br /> Hollywood: “Now it sounds original. It’s nothing more than Craft, that's a billion dollars.” <br /> <br /> This movie was so cliché and boring. Even the drama created between Chase and the Ipswich brothers was incredible. A bunch of rich children, whose biggest problem is what color Bentley they want on their 18th birthday (and 18th car), I don’t care at all, even if they have abilities. Each child in this film looked like it had left the magazine and, of course, there had to be useless male nudity and 80% nudity, just to show how out of shape you are. I wanted to rename this movie to “Witches from OK”. Oooh, rich kids and their problems .. Let me pretend to care. <br /> <br /> This film was completely unimaginable and predictable. The final battle was unsuccessful and tight, and the final was very anti-climatic. This was the film that is best left in the cutting room. floor.
