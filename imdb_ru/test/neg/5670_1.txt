I ... No words. No words can describe it. I will try for the sake of those few courageous people who stick knives in toasters ... after watching this show. <br /> <br /> This is ... Cosgrove Man ... Its action is like watching a female gorilla dance on a nest of very excited insects. Perhaps I exaggerate. However, I have a feeling that the description is appropriate for the usual day of writing this show. <br /> <br /> Characters in this disgusting pile of untreated sewage are useless, like a small piece of cosmic stone flying in the sun on any day of the week. Although heart attacks were not observed, when they looked at how they behave like fools on cheap builds, I have no doubt that this will happen in the end. <br /> <br /> The main plot of this * belches loudly into the faces of the actors * - these are stupid girls who broadcast weekly online broadcast on iCarly.com with the creative name iCarly.com with their brainless friends, one of whom owns the equipment, which the producers of this show probably could not afford. Her legal guardian is some jerk who seems to be her elder brother. <br /> <br /> I didnâ€™t watch the whole show because of fear of getting cancer or colds, but some of the plots indicate that I saw my brother stuck in the elevator, the apartment porter almost died, and the fattest priest in the world came to visit. No, really. <br /> <br /> Avoid this if you are older than the unborn, or if you have a history of participation in mysterious cults due to trauma. If you decide to watch it, laugh when the track of laughter tells you about it, as this will drown out the repeated noise that will eventually lead you into a coma if you listen to it for too long. <br /> <br /> The show gets a one-star rating because IMDb does not use negative numbers for unknown reasons.
