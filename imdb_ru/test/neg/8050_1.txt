"Son, you have to stop the experiments that I started !!" It is a pity that no one said so no matter who shone this project! I was almost literally dragged to this film by my friend for the midnight show when we were in high school. Now, at midnight cinema in high school on Friday night, you don't expect much, but come on! And, having seen it again years later, I, undoubtedly, will adhere to the initial opinion on it. Excellent special effects, but so what !! Quite possibly one of the worst films ever made. If you don’t enjoy blood and guts and don’t see some Hollywood vets (Steiger & Hunter) fooling themselves. YUCK !!!
