This film must have succeeded in the box office to give Gator the budget he deserves. This film did not have a budget, it was necessary to rewrite the script and better finish it. There are flashes of brilliance in this film. The scene of a boat ride, Bert driving the middle car and his conversation with his parents. You can say that Bert is a southerner, not an actor. This film shows what will be Gator, the best film by Bert. It is a pity that this film did not have the same funding and was made at Rush. 4/10
