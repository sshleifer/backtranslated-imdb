This is a male bonana. I saw it on Sci-Fi a while ago, and the idea seemed interesting to me. It could be a good movie, and I don’t see the plot itself as beating up men, but some specific references to men become really annoying. I could still watch the movie again, though, because he is at least trying to ransom himself, hinting that maybe the women in the film are not really as non-violent as they claim, but this still does not compensate for the really tiresome men. -bashing I mean, I can understand a little, this is part of the plot of the film, but come on, after a while it becomes really tedious. Not only that, but also to assume that the majority of women in the world will so easily agree to become homosexuals and that the few remaining heterosexuals will be such a minority that they will go "into the closet." This is just incredible. Too many women with cultural or religious restrictions who can opt out of this are completely implausible. I mean, I know its sci-fi, and I love sci-fi, but the best sci-fi has at least a hint that this is possible, and that is too implausible. The phrase “truth is stranger than fiction” arose because fiction should at least seem plausible to be welcomed, but the truth is not always. This film is not the one. Besides this, the film does have a good acting and possible moral of the story, that something like what happened was wrong, buy it back a little, but not enough.
