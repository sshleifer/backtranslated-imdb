Hi guys, this is my first review, and I would choose the worst movie to review. Since I watched only 5 minutes, but believe me, you could see that this film is not going anywhere. The acting game was deplorable, the camera work and the lighting looked as if it had been shot for decades. Do not be offended by a 10-year-old. I just couldn't take it anymore. I got up from the couch, took out the Adam House DVD player and threw it in the trash. Perhaps if you are a fan of Colin Farrell, this film may interest you, because the character in Anthony's film is similar to Colin Farrell. But this is so far, he certainly will never have the acting skills of col. I gave this film a rating of 1 (terrible) just because there were no minuses in the drop-down list.
