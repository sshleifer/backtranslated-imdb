Due to the fact that he was shot in 1979, due to the fact that he was shot, you can slightly weaken this film. It's really pretty scary. <br /> <br /> Never mind the ridiculous rear projection or the terrible, terrible camera. tracking the alleged in-flight objects, the tricks that Concord performs, will make you blink at a loss for absurdity. Barrel trunks, loopbacks and brutal “evasive” maneuvers made me wonder why the air forces of the world do not just fly Concordes as their main fighters. <br /> <br /> So, here are the important lessons that I learned from this celluloid cheese festival: <br /> <br /> 1. Concorde is at least as agile as the Phantom 4 fighter. <br /> <br /> 2. You can fire a flare gun on Mach 2 by simply opening the cockpit window and sticking your hand out. <br /> <br /> 3. If the flare gun does not discharge, do not drop it, as it may shoot. <br /> <br /> 4. Concorde can evade two Sidewinder missiles fired at him simultaneously. <br /> <br /> 5. The flash will distract the rocket, which is looking for heat, every time. <br /> <br /> 6. Switching off jet engines is a sure way to throw away rockets looking for heat from a track if 5 (above) does not work. <br /> <br /> 7. When performing an emergency landing in Concord, it is obviously impossible to throw fuel in advance. <br /> <br /> 8. All Concorde pilots are combat training veterans. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, this film is not very realistic. The effects are primitive by today's standards, and this, combined with the senseless acrobatics performed by Concorde, makes this film worthy of a small but contemptuous one. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Not recommended at all!
