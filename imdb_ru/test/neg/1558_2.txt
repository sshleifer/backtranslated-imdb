Zarkorr is one bad movie. It's not even that bad in its good category. This is just bad. Everything from this film stinks (from the lack of scenery to acting and special effects). To begin with, the film looks like it was shot in empty rooms with a couple of details so that it looks good. Then we get an acting game so bad that playing in high school looks like it was an Oscar candidate. And to top it all, there are special effects that are so bad that they look like the lovers who shot them in the garage. Cities that the monster allegedly crushes are like my nephew's train. So obvious is a fake that they scream at the viewer. The only good thing about the movie is the monster costume. It is a pity that they spent their entire budget on this and left nothing for the rest of the film. And maybe a decent script would help too.
