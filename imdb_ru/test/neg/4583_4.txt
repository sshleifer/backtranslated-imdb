But, like the Disney film two generations ago, this film also failed in the accuracy department. But at least Disney used the Skye Terrier. <br /> <br /> Is the true story common to film producers? I do not think so. There are many documents that allow you to accurately portray a true story, and not fictional stories that we had to go through. <br /> <br /> Sometime in the film, the owner of Bobby, John Gray, will be correctly depicted as the Edinburgh policeman he was, and the license of Bobby, for which the pro-Lord rector paid, will be correctly depicted. When this happens, I will be in theaters.
