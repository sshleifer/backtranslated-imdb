Joe Cool Review - Hellraiser: Pedigree <br /> <br /> Starring: Bruce Ramsay as Philip L'Mergent / John Merchant / Dr. Paul Merchant, Valentina Vargas as Angelica and Doug Bradley as Pinhead. <br /> <br /> Plot: This follows the timeline of the Merchant lineage line that began with Philip L'Merchenta, who created the box that opens the doorway to hell. Starting from the 18th century to the present, when Pinhead first meets the Merchant and tries to break the lineage ... (you see, he is the only one who can stop Pinhead) and, finally, in the future, in space, where Paul Merchant finally I figured out how to send Pinhead to hell forever. <br /> <br /> Newcomers: This is a movie that people who filmed it hate so much, they announced that fictional director Alan Smithy will be an honored director. They get Smithy out of woodwork when they really think they shot a horrible film, such as a classic, such as Birds II: The End of the Earth or Blood Sucking Pharaohs in Pittsburgh. No, I did not invent it. How did I like it? You are reading this, so I'm sure this is what you want to know. <br /> <br /> The Good: This film is not as bad as you were told. Oh, I'm not gonna embellish this. This film was filled with so much potential and in the end it turned out to be a disaster, but there are some advantages in it. Colder senobits this time for beginners such as twins and demon Angelica. Pinhead is still in the lead, and still has good features (“Pain has a face, let me show it to you”), and this is somewhat funny everywhere. Gorehounds will love the movie because of its endless supply. There is also some continuity with the rest of the series, although you will have to look carefully to see this. A dog talker is cool. <br /> <br /> Bad: But if you tell a story about hell against a damned pedigree of merchants that could close the gate forever, it was really complicated and taped. Nothing was fully explored, and some really stupid things were included. Pinhead kidnaps the child and holds him for ransom! Accidental deaths, just to show more blood (not always bad, but not for the sake of history). Here Pinhead is in a worse position, he fusses, even when he dies! For the very intelligent demon he used to be, he at best turned into nothing more than a villain Bond. If HellRaisers have ever needed a reason for bringing him back to a cameo role, then this is it. The pedigree destroyed it for all of us. <br /> <br /> Ugly: Gore is always mentioned here. It has skin ripping, drilling, hook piercing, beheading and other goodies. The dog chatterbox, although amazing, smells like bad special effects during chase scenes. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: this film had the potential for something great, even a hell of greatness. But it was all wasted. Who knows exactly what went into creating this shit, but we can only blame Alan Smith. <br /> <br /> Compared to the others: this film is the worst of HellRaiser's series. Only for trailers. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * of *****
