Despite the fact that I show great interest in biblical films, I was bored to death every minute of the film. Everything is bad. The film is too long, the acting is in most cases a joke, and the script is terrible. I had no reason to mix the story of Abraham and Noah together. So, if you value your time and sanity, stay away from this horror.
