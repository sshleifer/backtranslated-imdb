The film is based on the bestseller Jacqueline Suzanne. This is about Robin Stone (John Phillip Lowe), a ruthless TV presenter who is scratching his way to the top. It details his personal life with Amanda (Jodie Wexler) and Judith (Diane Cannon). It also demonstrates his complete inability to obey and sleeps with any woman he can receive instead. <br /> <br /> A novel is not a work of art (it’s not even good literature), but it’s a quick, dumb, dirty read. But this film is reminiscent of Gone with the Wind! This is an example from a tutorial on how NOT to make an adaptation of a film. At first they horribly seal the novel. The book describes the inability of Stone to commit and reveals the reason. Here it is brought up ... and ignored. There is also a really disgusting scene in which a woman is severely beaten. This is in the book - but there is a reason completely excluded from the film. And the book talks about three women, not two. Don't even get me on homophobia. <br /> <br /> Adaptation aside from the game is pretty awful. The law is terrible because Stone - VERY wooden and boring - you are seriously surprised why all these women pursue him. To be fair to Lo - another actor was played, but he had a very bad accident before the shooting started, and Lo intervened at the last minute. Wexler is as terrible as Amanda; Maureen Arthur is truly strikingly bad, like Ethel Evans; Shekki Green is unbearable as Christy Lane. Only three performances stand out: David Hemmings (having a great time) suits him as a gay photographer; Cannon is really very good, and Robert Ryan is great. Also Dion Warwick sings a memorable introductory song ("He Moves"). <br /> <br /> This is bad, but I watched it all, and this (stupid) is very fun. I give him 3. <br /> <br /> Also, Jacqueline Susanna has a cameo as a narrator.
