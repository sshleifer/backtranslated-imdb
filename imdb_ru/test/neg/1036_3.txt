No matter how hard you try, I just couldn't get into it. Perhaps it was a blurry tone; perhaps it was a protracted approach - I'm not quite sure, but although this was by no means a “bad” film, I really did not find that it was a very “effective” film (words that I understand that they are much more arbitrary than their usual use. <br /> <br /> In general, the point here is that the series of teenage boys dying causes an investigation and excitement in a small provincial town that causes a witch hunt What does the death of boys have to do with the mysterious sexy woman who appeared in the city? It's crazy Is this a voodoo? This story is a mixture of criminal drama and horror, as all citizens suspect everything, and the corpses continue to appear until bloody violence begins. <br /> <br /> Good enough, but for me most of them fell a little. Oh, he had moments ... one boy who walked into a beautiful naked seductress was pretty good, and the scene where the fathers beat the hermit was a bitter comment (even if the effects themselves failed, given that her skin seemed to exfoliate like a boo Dto they beat her with hot irons). <br /> <br /> My biggest problem was the ending. I already put spoiler tags on this review, but be careful, here’s a big spoiler: I don’t believe it. I do not believe that the priest could convince himself to kill the little boys for having become sexually aware, without any hint of the psychosis that had appeared before, with other boys, with a story or some other personal affect. The film does not really deserve the end. END SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Fulci is a big name, and I am more than sure that there is an audience for this. I definitely need to check out more that he did, because it could have been a bad introduction. In most cases, Italian hyallo is a blow or a miss, so I’m waiting for what else this guy can do before writing it off. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
