The recent documentary film "The Adventures of Errol Flynn" is a comprehensive look at the Ultimate Hollywood Hero. Bogart, Cagney, Wayne and the like were mostly blue-collar on their images on the screen, but Flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner, the younger son tried to create his own patrimony for the analogy with the sword, thunder and romance he found Ironically. himself trapped. If he had not been contracted with Warner Bros., he would have been perfect in the role of Cary Grant in Suspicions: a handsome spellcaster whose smile is 1000 watts blinds a person by being a predator. And he could play a major role with his best leading female sister, Joan Fontaine. It was Flynn's problem, he was the protagonist of the screen until his own habits and bad time caught up with him. Grant and Flynn are somewhat similar, but Flynn was more of a macho of two: Grant can be seen as Captain Blood, but Flynn in “Philadelphia Story” Mr. Blanding builds his dream home, or “Monkey Business”, or “Operation Petticoat” We turned these roles into his collective ears, because he had a damn sure leg, and the sexual tension that he would have led, naturally, would have made the plot lines wobbly. But this shaky biography is just a plasticized look at Flynn and his era. There are moments when I almost expected that at some point the track of laughter or the audience would say "Aaaa." It does not go deep into Flynn's life only by looking at the screen of the magazine. It also does not enter into his struggle to be considered something more than a doer. Like the purified biographies of Lon Cheney (father, not Wolfman or Lenny “Mice and People”) and Buster Keaton, made in the 1950s, this is just a piece of fluff that kills time.
