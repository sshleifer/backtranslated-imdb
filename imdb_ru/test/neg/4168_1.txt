An interesting concept that just doesn't do it. I watched the whole movie, but I had to read the IMDb comments to find out what Code 46 means. If / when it was explained in the film, I must have been in a coma or maybe dead by then I only watched Tim Robbins. The fact that I did not know the other actors was supposed to be a warning. We all need to start somewhere, but this film should not be. As for the "antivirus virus of empathy" - the belt of holiness, Batman! Where were the Joker, Riddler, etc.? Besides, why are women all so ugly? If I want to see less simple shapes, I'll just go along the street. The best part of the film is a car accident. It was absolutely believable, and not like most movies.
