The title pretty much lets you know what you get. This is a class C howler, but not as blatantly funny as I had hoped. This low-cost action movie of 1972, filmed by operating director Eddie Romero from the story of Jonathan Demme (long before “Silence of the Lambs” and “Philadelphia”), was clearly filmed in the Philippines, but filmed in some kind of anonymous film. Third world country. Playing prostitute and petty trafficker Lee Daniels, blastploating superstar Pam Greer plays the first half of the lead role, while Margaret Markov, the long-forgotten one, is the second half, Karen Brent, an unlikely political revolutionist like Patty Hearst, who is looking for a partner with her comrades to overthrow the local government. Naturally hostile to each other, they are in the women's prison camp, where they wear inexplicably bright yellow miniskirts in uniform. Ruled by a closed warden and a depraved mother, the prison is only a pretext for a long shower scene and some indecisive scuffle with cats when Lee and Karen face each other. Of course, they run away, but are shackled with each other in the spirit of “The Recalcitrant” and continue to fight with cats until they attack a couple of nuns in order to steal their habits. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, various groups of dubious men are in pursuit - the Lord drug lord is looking for Lee, who stole 40 thousand dollars from him, rather passive revolutionaries are looking for Karen and the incompetent police (who suffer humiliation by exposing their rank and file drug baron) . Needless to say, in the end, everything comes to a conclusion, but not before gratuitous nudity from a number of Filipino women, the dog wears Karen's panties and part of the worst male fashion of the 1970s (one big-bellied revolutionary wears a leather top with straight hair). face). There is a rather sad ending, but what’s really sad is how much of the potential black comedy is completely missed in this ridiculous absurd exercise. Unfortunately, Greer is disappointing in this campaign, because her hero is not allowed to do much except to cope with all the "jive", while Markov is an Amazonian blonde, who, I am convinced, is desperately trying to gain confidence. Since no one shows any talent for acting, the rest of the cast should not be noted, except for the balding one, with the cross-eyed Sid Haig, who uses his standard psycho as a drug baron. DVD 2003 contains only the original trailer as a supplement.
