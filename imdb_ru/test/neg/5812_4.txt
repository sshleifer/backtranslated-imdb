Hedy Lamarr, who may have been screened by more men than any other actress, is again the lover of Kent Taylor, the playboy of society and the general rats. On a boat from Yucatan after Taylor gave her a brush, she tries to commit suicide. But Dr. Spencer Tracy rescues her from drowning in the Caribbean. <br /> <br /> Tracy is pretty much a medical professional. I think he never heard the words of a specialist. He runs a clinic in Manhattan for the poor, and his trip was secondary to medical research. Lamarr and he are getting married, and she is trying to introduce him into her world, and he even becomes a partner of the Dr. Louis Calerne society. Of course, Kent Taylor returns to the picture, and Hollywood inevitably happens. <br /> <br /> Watching “I'm taking this woman,” it seemed to me that the writers were greatly influenced by the victory of Tracy, who received the Oscar, the City of the Boys. Unfortunately, his role of Dr. Carl Decker is not a sign that he did like father Flanagan. Perhaps they tried to give Father Flanagan some romance in his life in this film, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Tracy and Lamarr didn't get along very well. In fact, this film was named “I Take That Woman”, because the original director Joseph von Sternberg left the film, presumably because Lamarr did not work for him like Marlene Dietrich. She starred in The Lady of the Tropics, and then MGM returned to filming this film with their contract director, Woody Van Dyke, who was known for the speed of his production. And a completely new cast was presented. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Spence and Khedi had the best roles in the reserves for both of them.
