Tycoon will never be included in the list of the best films of John Wayne after "Stagecoach". It is good in places, has some beautiful cave action sequences, as well as during high water flooding. But the plot leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> We have two people in Tycoon who strongly dislike each other and who do not allow them to work in a team. Multimillionaire Cedric Hardwicke hired John Wayne and James Gleason to build the railway. But then he refuses to provide them with the necessary means to do the job properly. <br /> <br /> The situation is really complicated when Wayne falls in love with Hardwick's daughter, Larain Day. After the night, when they have to spend time alone in the Inca ruins, by agreement in South America, Wayne and Day arrange a wedding with a shotgun, although nothing happened. <br /> <br /> What was going to happen was that they were locked in a room for 24 hours together to find out their differences one way or another. Their petty malice leads to the death of Wayne crew members. <br /> <br /> But the magnate is best known for his pettiness. Larain Day was married to Leo Durocher, manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, when it was filmed. He was constantly present on the set, madly jealous of John Wayne, who, in his opinion, could have an affair with his wife. It's okay, but he made his wife’s life miserable. <br /> <br /> Not one of the Duke’s best attempts.
