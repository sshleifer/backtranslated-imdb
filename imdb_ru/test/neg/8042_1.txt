Schieder acts as president of the United States with a semi-believable role, and politically correct Maria Conchita Alonzo is the vice-president. The film just stinks. With so many holes in the plot, it's amazing that they made him stick to the movie on which he was filmed. This film is reserved for late night HBO graphics. After 10 minutes you ask yourself why it was written. After 40 minutes, you wonder why you are watching this. Save effort and watch Hee Hou's replay or something. Everything is better than this clanker.
