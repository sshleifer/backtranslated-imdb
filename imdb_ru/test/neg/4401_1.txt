<br /> <br /> Not long over this movie. The first half hour was one of the most boring ones I had to deal with since I started watching movies. The story has not advanced, nothing has been explained to any of the characters. It was not like a movie. (Many people have already left the audience). <br /> <br /> Many scenes were completely unjustified and inexplicable. <br /> <br /> The director had to study the film a little more to know that every sequence, every scene should advance the story. He never did that. <br /> <br /> Allegedly funny moments were invented, and only a few laughed (probably, people with a strange sense of humor). <br /> <br /> The 2002 Cannes Jury Prize ..... I don’t know what the jury was thinking ... probably a “politically correct effect”. <br /> <br /> I would love to love him, so there was even more disappointment. <br /> <br /> You have to see it in order to believe it. But wait for the video.
