I had high hopes for this film, but, alas, I feel depressed. I bought it for 5 bucks in a second-hand VHS place, and the version I bought was the English dubbed version. Overwriting is terrible, so be careful. Lola was simply not as good in this film as in Run, Lola, Run, and the bad guy just seemed to come out of nowhere. And Lola begins to understand what is happening as soon as she enters the university. It seems unreal to me. I was also wondering if the original version had American songs on the soundtrack ... they seemed extremely inappropriate. Too bad for this movie, I really thought it would be rock.
