This may be all you need to know to decide if you want to see it. <br /> <br /> The film is bad. Very bad indeed. And sometimes it seems that he is aware of this and makes fun of how bad it is. He evens out cliches for cliches and even manages to get worse, because he is accompanied by some moments that are bad enough to be funny. <br /> <br /> If you can laugh at really low quality in scripting and production, you could enjoy it. If not, prepare for serious brain damage. <br /> <br /> 3/10
