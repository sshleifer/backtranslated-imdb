This stupid, environmentally alien "Jaw" is sad, pitiful, boring, poorly duplicated and stupid. There is nothing atoning about it. <br /> <br /> The plot is followed by some shark creatures / octopuses who appear off the coast of Florida and kill some people (including a boring, stupid couple with a tearful wife and a quiet husband). who for some reason stabs himself with a fork). His ascent to the surface is always represented by an indefinite side shot of something uneven again and again. It makes no sense, it's terribly boring, and this conspiracy plot sucks. <br /> <br /> There are moments of camp that cannot be ignored: the same shot of a boat from a pair of opening sequences THREE TIMES; the doctor slapped the dying patient with a donator twenty times, not stopping, although he was clearly dead; porno esque soundtrack; a snapshot of a couple making love on the beach, with three different themes (“It is ahead of us!”), doing it; an ancient computer like Kermit the frog; a scientist, greedy for beer, screaming "I know!" a la Dr. Smith; This list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Oh, and everyone drinks at least thirty bears during the film (this is noticed by Mike and Bots). . <br /> <br /> The MST3K version is their best episode, but it’s definitely better than the movie itself. “That's how I love to fish, guys ... with a flashlight and a flamethrower ...” - Raven <br /> <br /> One star for Devil Fish; seven for MST3K version <br /> <br />
