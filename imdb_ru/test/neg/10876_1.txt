Or, in any case, filmmakers would like you to believe. <br /> <br /> This film is trying hard to be cool, it's funny. Everything, from the look of the film, cinematography, editing, dialogue and acting, is set up in a very cool mode from the very beginning. Just to make sure no one misses how cool this film is, there is a soundtrack of really cool rock and roll tunes and a terrific western-surf-tex Mexican guitar that plays all the time throughout the movie. As a final reminder of how damn cool this film is, all the actors were ordered to speak in a hoarse voice, because, as we all know, this is cool. <br /> <br /> The plot (if it is) alone seems rather simple. But, as someone else noted, the filmâ€™s director and star seems determined not to tell the story, instead focusing on the many nude babies and dialogues that need to be cool, but surprisingly quickly tired of the competition to see could they have crammed the words pussy and f * ck and their derivatives in an 80-minute movie?). <br /> <br /> This movie was absolutely terrible.
