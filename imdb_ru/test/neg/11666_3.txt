Without a doubt, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. However, it is also one of the most unintentionally funny. I like to compare it with Plan 9, because it can be so bad, so terrible, so stupid and such a waste of time that I laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> One of my biggest problems with this is that this is a complete robber, Robin Hood, and, frankly, I’ll say that I love Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and Robin Hood: Men in tights. But let's face it, because of the forbidden love between Peck (who definitely slumbers it. Although in fairness it was still good years to the Kill Mockingbird masterpiece) and a female character (who, apparently, is so forgetful that I forgot her name.) Until the final scene, where the good guys dress like monks to fool the bad guys, the cries of "Robin Hood" are everywhere. <br /> <br /> However, I don’t think that the film should not be watched. On the contrary, I think that this is one of the funniest films that I have seen in recent years, even if it was unintentional.
