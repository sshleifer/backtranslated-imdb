Being (to some extent) an independent director, I really understand what these guys were trying to do, and that sounds like a good idea. On paper. However, on the 16 mm film it is terrible. I did not understand what was done in the mid-90s, because the film was so grainy and bad, I would swear it was one of those 30-year-old clicks where the porn producer tried to go mainstream. And the sound! Ugh, I don't know which microphone they used to record, but it sounds like someone is walking through the dead leaves throughout this. I think I should not judge too harshly, after all, how many feature films have MY company produced? No, but I would like to think that we will at least have good image and sound quality if we play badly, write and direct. + For the idea, F-- for the execution.
