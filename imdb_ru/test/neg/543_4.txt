I'm struggling to see the meaning of this film. It should be a comedy, but I did not laugh even once. The storyline is one that could be interesting in a well-made film, but since it happens in comics, the result is absolutely incredible (as it should be in comedies). The comic book series was very popular, even during the episodes, and it would be fair to say that all the people involved began to do great things. One to avoid. I also just learned that comments should be 10 lines long. The whole point of these comments is to give an idea of ​​whether to watch a movie: do not write an essay combining it or taking it apart. If you like: Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, Young, Alan Partridge, Arrested Development, Curb, Red Dwarf, then you can skip this. On the other hand, if you like inappropriate jokes that can be found in Friends and Dodgeball, enjoy the show!
