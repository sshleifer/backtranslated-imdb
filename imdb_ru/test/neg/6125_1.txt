The French either make pro-Marxist films, or anti-Marxist films - with several intermediate ones. "Merci pour le chocolat" is the latest of this genre. From the introductory titles, telling the viewer what music she would play and who she was, who composed it, you know that you will be embraced by the pretense of the middle class. This is a film for the elderly, in which more than 40-odd people. It is also directed by the old man along with the old team, which has nothing to say about the life of the viewer. The plot is not only banal, but also ridiculous. How many films reveal the plot in the dialogue, only to repeat the same message through memory in five minutes? Could the director and actors have a low hold ability? In truth, they cannot be called a rational plot. This is a puzzle with holes, like a good piece of French cheese. <br /> <br /> This is intentional or not, this is a film about the bourgeoisie. At least the third part of the film is devoted to piano and pretentious chatter in every scene. I admit that it has some well-made shots, although they could not use the steady camera in this film — it would wake them all! Besides the fact that it is a meaningless story, the film allows the upper middle class to demonstrate their values ​​and vanity in a very convenient Swiss place. The highlight of the film is that Rodolphe Pauley tells Anna Muglalis that she does not need to lock her car at the resort! Oh dear. <br /> <br /> On the DVD, Miss Happert commented on the shedding of false tears on the stage. Grinning, she says: “Like an American acting studio!” I think that Miss Huppert and the rest of the actors could have learned well from the acting studio. <br /> <br /> If I recall one statement, when Huppert says, "We have friends for the weekend and all the servants have left." There is no doubt that they all escaped from stupor so that they would not be tied to such a terrible film. <br /> <br /> Security note. In the film, they show scalding with hot water, covered with ointment and a bandage. This should never be done. Use only cold water. <br /> <br /> Minus 10 points.
