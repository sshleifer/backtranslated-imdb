This is not a movie. This is a collection of random photos taken in a fascinating part of the world, voiced by random text. Video recording is not so good, and the text is also not very. The end product is painfully boring. <br /> <br /> On DVD, the inclusion of a comment can provide some entertaining value, since the director cites a rather crazy argument that this is a science fiction film. It is also interesting to read about the extraordinary risks and difficulties that the team went through in order to collect these frames. It is a pity that it is rubbish. But I think that Making a Fata Morgana would be a fascinating film, like Ed Wood.
