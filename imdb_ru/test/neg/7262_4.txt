The giant mantis awakens from its sleep in the arctic region and heads south, causing chaos. Boats, airplanes and trains meet with a flying creature. Before bringing down his full anger on New York, the mantis meets the deaths of the armed forces in the New York tunnel. The special effects are, of course, crude by today's standards, but for a ten-year-old boy in 1957 it was very memorable. <br /> <br /> Starring William Hopper, Craig Stevens, Alix Talton and Pat Conway.
