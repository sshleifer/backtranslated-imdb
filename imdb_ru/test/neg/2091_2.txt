This train wreck begins with Brukho and Alma crossing the Mexican border. Alma suffers from some terrible curse that causes her to tear garden snakes and Nickelodeon Hook every few minutes, as well as clench her teeth and mumble nonsense. So obviously, Alma has an uncle in Los Angeles who knows about her treatment. They take the train to get there, and, fortunately, their friend pays their way. Alma and Brukho remain in the entire baggage cart because they cannot afford the top class seats. Meanwhile, in the upper class, for whatever reasons, we see a group of no one heading for Los Angeles. A balding guy on a business trip, two girls, one of whom carries $ 5, a pack of cocaine, three stoners and a few Mexicans. Mexicans incite it with Brucho and try to remove his "weed", which, obviously, is a sedative for the Alma snakes gliding in it. They understand that snakes do not attack, they penetrate your body through your veins! Very Twisted and B-Movie. Brukho rescues the boy by tearing out his heart (Temple of Destiny style) and getting a snake. For some reason, he cannot harm the snakes, otherwise it will damage Alma. While this happens, a drug expert tries to ruin one of the girls and gets a little action (topless) in exchange for not telling about her drug delivery. A mysterious guy appears and leads a shootout with him. When the grand finale, Alma turns into a vampire, bites her man, and then becomes a huge miserable excuse for a CG snake the size of a train, eats up the train and turns into a hurricane of a nuclear bomb and disappears. Then everyone goes to Los Angeles on foot. <br /> <br /> At the end, the captions say: “Any resemblance to real people, alive or dead, or to real events is purely random and very strange. We propose to move and / or on an airplane. ”Strange, because the film has a line from a bald guy,“ Yes, I hate airplanes! ” "In fact, the film used a lot of real snakes, and they are all very tame. In fact, there is no scene of a CG snake attack on anyone except for a big one, but then it just eats the train, and the other false snake just head and looks like a mappet. Snakes are really nothing ata forge, they are just ... there. In fact, someone crawls out of toilet paper! <br /> <br /> The film is not funny, not terrible (since there is no real snake attack here), but simply "quick getting money, when a low-budget film company hears about the large budget of a Hollywood release, then rushes to release a similar film or even a parodic version for release shortly before or simultaneously with a loud film. The result is that many people confuse a joke than a biggie, or they will want to see both for any reason ... like me. Avoid at all costs.
