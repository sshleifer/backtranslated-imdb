If you really REALLY enjoy films in which ants build dirty mirrors, eat not ants and conquer the world with an off-screen story, then this film is for you. In fact, a couple of scientists working on a bio-dome communicate with very intelligent ants (the smartest actors in this film), trying to thwart their plans for conquest and extermination. Throughout the film, the two scientists (and the girl they rescued from the ants) use everything they have at their disposal (computers, green paint and terrible actions), but to no avail. I think they simply could not afford pesticides, because the film would have ended too quickly. <br /> <br /> The name of the film “Phase IV” is something mysterious. This is not a spoiler, but “Phase I” begins immediately after the opening credits, whereas you do not reach “Phase IV” until the credits end. Apparently, the director knew that the film would be tedious, and therefore placed phases 1–3 throughout the entire film in the form of a kind of progress report: “Hold on, buddy! Only one more phase, until the final credits appear! ”As an episode of MST3K, this one was not very good for two reasons: 1) This is an episode from season 0 on KTMA, when they started, so the riff is not as good as late seasons; and 2) this film is so bad that even J & TB cannot light it. There are one or two references to Gamera, since they have just finished riffing 5 Gamera films. <br /> <br /> The film does have a trick / unexpected ending, but I was so glad to have an end when the effect was lost to me,
