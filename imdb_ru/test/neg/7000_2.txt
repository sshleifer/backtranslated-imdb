First preview 21.06.2001 - 2 out of 10 (directed by Emmanuel Itier): a rather useless supposed thriller that spends more time attracting us to have sex with and without Amber Smith. He is trying to wrap the story around sex scenes, but, as usual, with these types of films, this is not very good. I was so bored with this movie that I quickly went through the final to end it. The video version that I watched was called "Tell me that there is no lie."
