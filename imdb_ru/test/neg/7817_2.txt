This is the first time I comment on a movie that hasn’t been seen before the credits. The reason for this is simple: people must be warned: this is one of the worst comedies of the new millennium. I usually avoid a lot of comedies that have bad taste, but I expected it to be watchable. A regrettable decision that was based on Ashton Kutcher's other comedies that were (semi) pleasant, such as "Much Like Love" and "Guess Who". <br /> <br /> Where these two films had their charms and laughter, it wasn’t (and I don’t mean any !!) Tara Reid was not surprised how she dares to call herself an actress ?! The room is thin and the plot is not condensed at all. It’s not a problem if you manage to make it funny and / or sweet ... but, as you probably guessed, it wasn’t the cast as a whole! The script did not seem to me completely finished, and I would not even lose my head if the director rewrote a little while shooting. My dog ​​could write a more consistent script, seriously. And he is also not quite Lassie :-). <br /> <br /> Stay away from this prank, even if you sometimes like silly stupid comedies (like me). This low-quality film will not please many ... <br /> <br /> I (almost) never give such a film, so ... a 2.
