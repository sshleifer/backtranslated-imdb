When I found out that Disney has rights to Underdog, I decided that it would be a cool Pixar affiliate program and we would get an excellent movie for adults and children, such as Incredible. Alas ... I forgot how Disney should invent classic material for today's stupid youth. What were they thinking about? “Underdog” was a product of the 60s, your Prime Fanbase is from the 40s to the 50s, why should you reorient it to 5-year-olds? This had to be done ala "Rabbit Roger", half animated, half real. Instead, we get characters like Riff Ruff (Wolf !!) falling into a foreign dog. The "Lost" cannot have the "energy pill", since we are now so "enlightened" that, obviously, it will be a steroid or a drug. The only good casting was Patrick Warburton in the role of “Cad”, because he actually resembles a cartoon version. Otherwise, fans of the old school "Underdog" should avoid it like the plague. What's next? A live version of "Go-Go Gophers" disguised as a lesson in revisionist history? (My additional apologies if Disney jumps on this!)
