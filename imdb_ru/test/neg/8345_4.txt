The volcano is located in Los Angeles, where a minor earthquake has just occurred, the resting boss O.E.M. (Emergency Management) Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones) decides to interrupt his vacation and leave as soon as he sees that everything is in order, but then leaves for the epicenter of an earthquake, where seven underground workers were killed by fire Mike is not sure what to think, so he leads geologist Dr. Amy Barnes (Anne Heche) to try to explain this, unfortunately, a huge underground river of molten lava was released after an earthquake and eruption erupted in the career of La Brea Tar Pits Lava, pouring onto the streets of the city, oschaet everything and everyone it touches, in the fire. Mike, his people and emergency services stop their work, trying to stop the river of lava and save as many lives as possible ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Mick Jackson, it was the second major budget disaster film revolving around the idea of ​​a volcano eruption In 1997, Dante Peak (1997) was released just two months before the volcano appeared, and Dante Peak is hardly a masterpiece, at least a little better and more believable than a volcano. The scenario here is complete nonsense and not at all based on reality: underground rivers of lava, which seem to appear and then disappear just as quickly, standing inches of various characters from the river of lava, but not exposed to heat (when this guy in the train metal seats around him begin to melt, but it remains in full order, as far as I know, human skin is not as heat resistant as metal, is it?) and this happens all the time, flying helicopters are clouds of ash (in fact it would be impossible) one simple blockade at the end of the street You’ll stop the current lava (what about other streets and other directions?), able to blow up the perfect trench outside and then blow up a huge building to make a massive dam, and when Kelly sees the lava heading towards her car, she goes out, like everyone else, but then for some reason just stands there and watches as two firefighters burned to death, and waits for her dad to save her, although at this stage her foot caught fire, despite the fact that all these concrete blocks were assembled, to create a barrier in less than twenty minutes arena is doing such a great job that no single piece of molten lava can not leak out and download more, in addition, as a massive building falling on Tommy Lee and his daughter even then they were both okay then. The characters are terrible as well, although they were not as clichéd as usual, without the heyday of the novel between Tommy Lee and Anne Heche and the official from the minimal city who are trying to silence Tommy Lee and Anne Heche before the event, marking them with alarmists. There are some poorly written and sometimes embarrassing moral moments when Los Angeles is rallying, a black guy and that half-racist policeman who warm each other and finally wish each other well and this little child at the end when he says: everyone looks the same "decent extra attention ”and, of course, is an attempt with incredible force and trying to say whatever color we are, we are still people, and we can all get along during a crisis, as it unites people. Having said that I think “Volcano” is one of those bad ones that are good films, it entertains and moves at a decent pace, but just don’t expect anything based on reality or human drama. <br /> <br /> I suppose that such a film as “Volcano” could be seen as an update of the disaster film of the 70s, such as “The Adventure of Poseidon” (1972) or “Earthquake” (1974) but with a huge budget using modern effects. Speaking of effects, everything is fine with them, but no one really stands out, and the sets are also surprisingly forgotten, of course, there are some impressive explosions and some good lava rivers flowing through the effects of Los Angeles, but little else. In general, Volcano is simply not very exciting, and although sometimes unintentionally ridiculous and completely ridiculous, it actually does not work as the creators intended. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 90,000,000, it opened a little less than $ 15,000,000 at the box office, everything looks good, a lot of fire, but nothing stands out, and the film “Vulcan” is generally quite memorable. Filmed in Los Angeles, I think most of the places shown here were shot in their real places. The cast goes through horrible dialogues and funny scenery with which Tommy Lee Jones deserves better. <br /> <br /> Volcano is a catastrophe in both senses, a catastrophe themed film that ended in a small catastrophe. It is worth it to make some unintended laughter and the absurdity of all this, but this is nothing special, and I doubt that I will ever want to see it again.
