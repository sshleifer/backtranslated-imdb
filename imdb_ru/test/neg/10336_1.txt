I will not go into details about why this film deserves a terrible rating, many others have already done so. Suffice it to say that of the more than 400 films I own on DVD, this is the only one I got rid of - it was so useless that I could not even see that I want to watch ANY of that again. <br /> However, I have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of 2.9 (as of 3-15-06). Looking through the 4 pages of reviews, I did not see ratings above 3 stars. Looking at the voting history, 78% of users rated the movie as 4 stars or less. It seems to me that several people fill out a ballot box so that this film does not make it to the list of the "bottom 100" IMDb. It would be interesting to know how many of the 30 users who rated this film as 10 stars (none of those who wrote the film review) are actual active users. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled, this film is not worth your time.
