I really do not know why I agreed to watch this film, but, as a complete fool, I did it and deserve to be shot for it! I saw the original Killjoy, well, I say I saw it .... I started watching it, but I found it so bad that I finished watching it at 4x speed to end it and get rid of the pesky dialogue, but I said I would see him and did, even if he were at 4x. <br /> <br /> In short, Killjoy 2 started from where Killjoy stopped. By this I do not mean the plot, I mean the full package of dirt, known as acting and cheapness. I have nothing against low-budget films, in fact, I like them, they are somehow different from megbudgetary blockbusters, but this film is just awful! The action is devilish and the script ... well, I think you could give Stevie Wander a pen and paper, and he would do something much better! This film is just annoying, not to mention the annoying laughter of a clown who is so clearly called! Anyway, I didn’t go through this movie, about three-quarters of the way, it’s time to turn it off and throw it out the window. It may have been a robbery to buy as a DVD, but as a frisbee it was a mega deal! <br /> <br /> Please, for the sake of the love of humanity itself, DO NOT LOOK at this dirt, perhaps this is the worst thing I've ever seen, and considering some of the dirt I've seen, it says a lot! <br /> <br /> My rating for this film would be .... Gun in the head / 10
