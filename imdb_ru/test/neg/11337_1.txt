After the Surprise Traumschiff, did you think that German comedy could not get worse? It can. This comedy is another attempt to perpetuate the stereotypes of gays disguised as good comedy. The original concept (openly homosexuals in football sports) would be an excellent opportunity to erase some stereotypes, but ... Apparently, the real intention of the film is how gays differ from ordinary men, Absolutely stupid, of course. Even gay sex is considered less valuable than direct sex. This film is only trying to serve a direct audience who wants to laugh at stereotypical gays. Well, do not waste your time on German comedy movies!
