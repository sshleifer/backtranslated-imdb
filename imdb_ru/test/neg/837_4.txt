The film begins with a dandy shootout, where three thugs are quickly shot by a bounty hunter - a bounty hunter who has more than just a shallow Man from the Clint Eastwood Trilogy (FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, FOR FEW DOLLARS MORE, GOOD, LESS AND MUCH). <br /> <br /> Immediately after this, you see this man in a golden train filled with Union soldiers. Naturally, the load is attacked, and all the soldiers fight like blind, so they are quickly neutralized. However, ironically, one of the bandits is deceiving the leader of the gang (Gilbert Roland) and leaving with gold. Soon, Roland is catching up and is going to find out where the gold is hidden. But at this moment an army appears and kills a traitor ... a bummer. However, a man without a name thinks that Roland knows about the treasure, and perhaps the medallion given to Rolan by the traitor holds the key. A strange banker, also thrown into the mix. All three want gold, and all three seem to be pretty macho. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not a particularly distinguished western. This is largely a plot, including the fact that George Hilton (a Uruguayan, despite the name in America) is not as interesting as Eastwood or some of the other leading western stars of spaghetti, but mostly because the soundtrack just sucks. So often the music does not even closely correspond to the acting action, and it seems almost accidentally added. Plus, this is not very good stuff. This is clearly not the work of Ennio Morricone, the master of music from the spaghetti genre. <br /> <br /> In general, just a pastime - and not particularly good for download.
