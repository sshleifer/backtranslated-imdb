I really looked forward to this film, but unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. <br /> <br /> In a good movie, viewers identify / sympathize / sympathize with the main actor. Unfortunately, it was very difficult to do with Samantha Morton. <br /> <br /> The plot line seemed very fragmented and did not develop as it should / could. <br /> <br /> Keifer Sutherland seemed to be a little more than window dressing and made me wonder why he agreed to play what seemed insignificant. The beautiful scenery and the play of Tam Morrison and Cliff Curtis were almost the only advantage. <br /> <br /> Perhaps becoming a Qiwi, I raised the bar for local films. Maybe changing the director / supposedly hard work with the main actor is biased for my opinion. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just trying to find excuses for a movie that could be great. <br /> <br /> A lot of maybans who still donâ€™t explain why there was nothing special about this movie. <br /> <br /> This could be great, not true.
