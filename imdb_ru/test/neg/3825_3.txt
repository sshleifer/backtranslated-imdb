This film was one of the first in the genre of the film "Woman in Prison" of the 70s. This film was incredibly brutal, with many sadistic tortures with prisoners. The film takes place in the Philippines, which looks like a terrible ugly country. No doubt, the producers took advantage of this factor to highlight the terrible situation in which the prisoners were. <br /> <br /> Blacksploit film queen Pam Greer plays a major role in this film. She plays Blossom, a renegade who is thrown into a vile women's prison on trumped-up charges. Her boyfriend, played by Sid Haig, is trying to save Blossom. He and Blossom are part of the political partisan faction, and the imprisonment by Bloss was organized by the corrupt Filipino government. <br /> <br /> Pam Greer and Sid Haig stand out among other, generally boring, shots. In the film itself, too much attention is paid to violence against prisoners. Their captors used them exclusively as objects of their sadism. It got boring very quickly. This film could use more interesting plot lines and subtleties. This is not one of the best paintings by Roger Korman. Many films about women in prison who followed this were much better around. I would recommend The Big Bird Cage to Pam Grier fans only.
