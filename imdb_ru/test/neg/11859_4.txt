I'm going to this game, and that's fine, I think. I was just expecting a little more. The main problem with this is that hacking is extremely complicated, even if you read the instructions, you cannot get it. Also, the graphics are not as good as the Pandora Tomorrow and Double Agent. This game can make some improvements, it says that if the guards roam the water and you shoot a sticky shocker in the water, the guard breaks out, but nothing happens. In my opinion, this is the worst of the three. I didn’t play first, but tomorrow I played Pandora, that’s Double Agent. This game deserves 4/10 though. Could do with some improvements.
