Mel Wells, you may remember that he is Mr. Mushnik in Roger Corman's Little Horror Shop. He leads this somewhat interesting, but completely perverted story about the daughter of Dr. Frankenstein, who continues his fatherâ€™s work after his death and creates a creature not for his intellectual abilities or the likelihood of being / doing good, but rather because of his sexual attractiveness. You see, Tanya Frankenstein, although the doctor and the scientist herself, is concerned with nothing more than satisfying her primary desires for a stable boy and turning some super-sexy slave into using her body with the excellent mind of a man she loves and dislikes. The story here is subtle, and everyone gets what one could expect: a lot of mocking and promising comments (surprisingly most of all from the female hero), special effects that are not so special, actions that lack the depth of the characteristic, and not very much action or suspense. And although this film is almost fruitless in terms of good story-telling, Lady Frankenstein has some strange aspects that make him watchable - not very watchable, but nonetheless watchable. Italian actress Rosalba Neri AKA Sara Bay / Bey plays the daughter of Baron with some aplomb and many sexual attractions. She oozes with desire and seduction quite well. Her performance is rather one-dimensional, but she is pretty sweet and plays too well. She is also very frank with her performance if you understand my drift. Poor Joseph Cotten, now governed by European horror films for money, plays his father in a short but competent production. He is a star attraction, but left before the film really worked. As for the rest of the cast, Paul Muller is somewhat effective as Dr. Charles Marshall, assistant baron and daughter admirer for some time. When crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village, the policeman (I did not buy it) Mickey Hargitay starts to swing Tanya for the answers - despite what you think, not to her satisfaction. Where the film really loses its credibility is in the last third of the film, where the suspicious scenario, weak performances and sloppy guidance all head further south. The creature is revealed and looks pretty ridiculous. The film unexpectedly ends with one of the hasty decisions that were very common in the 1970s. Although Lady Frankenstein is not at all as bad and disgusting as you would like you to think, she is indeed a very vicious film with some perverted, albeit intriguing overtones.
