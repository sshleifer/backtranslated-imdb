I saw a bunch of garbage, in every language, on every topic and on every direction of film production. From every period, every director and every kind of budget. However, I really have to state: <br /> <br /> This is one of the three worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> This is terribly bad. This is pompous. It is bleak. It's incomprehensible. It is annoying. This is a really bad mess. This is a piece of "you know what." <br /> <br /> And more importantly: it makes no sense. And even if he were alone, the characters are so unreal and annoying that it is impossible not to notice the lack of unity of all this. <br /> <br /> This is just weird for weirdness. <br /> <br /> I really felt bad to look at this garbage. The theater where I saw him (Lincoln Center in New York) was full when it began. By the end of this, half the audience was gone. In the end, Q & A was programmed, but no one remained. Except for about two patients, everyone else ran to the door, including me. <br /> <br /> Save 2 hours of your life. This is probably one of the worst ever. <br /> <br /> If there is a cinema in hell, this movie will play 24 hours a day, for ages ...
