When I first became a father 5.5 years ago, I was ready for the many sacrifices I would have had to make. I knew that I would have to change the diapers and take them with me to swimming lessons and attend the many chilling parades of Santa Claus, but I was not ready for the sacrifice that I brought last night. This, in my humble opinion, is a cruel and unusual punishment. <br /> <br /> Underdog is bad. This is not really a bad karate dog, but it makes a shaggy dog ​​feel like fiction. If Underdog were a television show, I would recommend turning them on. Even the presence of Paddy and the voice of Bankie Edwards cannot save him. Bow. Wow. <br /> <br /> These were the best 80 minutes I have ever enjoyed. James sat to my right, Michelle to my left, and I spent more time watching their reaction to this conversation, flying a fool than looking at the screen. At 5 and 3, they were the target audience, and this film nailed the target. There is a scene where Underdog belches loudly in the face of another dog, and Michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever filmed in a movie. When Underdog flew into space, James was literally hypnotized at the edge of his seat. The kids absolutely loved the Underdog, which is why I was there. This is what was last night. <br /> <br /> If you don’t accompany someone under the age of ten, you won’t waste a second of your life watching this brutal movie. But if you want to kill 80 minutes with your four-year-old child, I will not judge. I had a blast.
