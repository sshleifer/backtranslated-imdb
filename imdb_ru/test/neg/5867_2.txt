I bought this DVD for my little son who loves ToyStory movies. I never expected him to be in the same league as Toystory films, but what I got was just another lazy Disney cartoon, much lower than I expected from Disney / Pixar. The story is unoriginal, the characters are boring and two-dimensional, the animation is below par, even Buzz is not so good. The film could be much better. I especially hated to paint by the numbers of the storyline. I know that this is intended for children, but even children know when something stinks of this limp. <br /> <br /> Although I liked some aspects of the film, I really liked the initial part of the film with the slag monster mutant, it just went down from there.
