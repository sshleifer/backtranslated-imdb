[possible spoilers] <br /> <br /> The sixth film “Halloween” is an extremely depressing event, but, unfortunately, not in the way that the filmmakers envisaged. To date, everyone knows the story of how he was killed and released in such a sloppy, incoherent manner. In particular, the second half does not make much sense, since the elements of the plot are introduced and removed, seemingly at random. The very ending made me scratch my head. What the hell happened? Is Dr. Loomis dead or what? This is what you get when you put a shameless cracker in charge of the movie. This is not a pretty sight. <br /> <br /> In the corresponding note this is the most graphically cruel entry in the series. I have no problems with blood if it is in the right place, but this film raises it to absurd levels. The infamous exploding head should be the new low for the series. Even Michael himself seems to enjoy the act of killing another person, which is incompatible with his effective, methodical approach in the original of John Carpenter. <br /> <br /> I'm not quite sure who was in charge; directed by Joe Chapel or producers, probably a combination of both. I would be perfectly happy to forgive all those concerned, if only they had released the legendary "Production Breakthrough," a more complete version of the film, which is a huge improvement with each account. As I understand it, this is a completely different movie. I propose to pay full price for the purchase of the DVD, if Miramax comes around and releases it. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good elements. The idea that Michael is controlled by the druids is intriguing. Paul Rudd is as solid as Tommy Doyle, whose appearance is a neat link with the original. Smooth visual effects help make the hearing process more watchable. But these meager offers are overshadowed by the overload that we have to put up with. <br /> <br /> Finally, The Curse of Michael Myers is known as the last film by Donald Pleasans. Many of his scenes were excluded from the final version, and when he appears, he seems weak and unhappy. The film is dedicated to his memory, crying (if he was deliberately insulted), if there was one. The fact that a talented performer must end his career in this way is too depressing to even think about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of ****) <br /> <br /> Issued by Dimension Films
