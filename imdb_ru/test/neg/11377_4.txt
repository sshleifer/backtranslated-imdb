I was hoping that I would like this film to have an evening of silly fun. I like Judy Davis and Juliette Lewis, and the room seemed unusual enough to entertain him. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I dozed again and again. Judy Davis performed well, but there was very little work with her. Juliette Lewis was gorgeous, as expected, but could do little. The plot was full of "perversions" that were just stupid, and, as often happens in films of this type, no one acted like a real person. And personally, I thought that Marcia Gay Harden was completely mistaken. <br /> <br /> It seemed as if the film had gone halfway from a black comedy with a touch of farce to a full farce with a touch of black comedy. One reviewer here notes that other reviews seem to want this film to be something else, and therefore condemned it. All I can say is that I would agree that the film * is * something * and sticks to it. It’s like the director had great ideas, but he couldn’t carry them all out. I give him 4 out of 10.
