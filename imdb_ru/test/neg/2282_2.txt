I was utterly disappointed with this. After reading the wonderful story about Oscar Wilde, I was hoping that at least a little magic will translate to the screen. Well, there was not one. This version played like a compressed, dumb film Reader's Digest. Not only did it feel rushing, it was cheap and overly rewritten. The main characters and storylines were either modified or completely removed. I appreciate the difficulties of trying to display a novel, especially with regard to what may well be a limited (television) budget, but there is no excuse for disfiguring a great story in this way. I highly recommend reading Wilde's tale of depravity, which exists even in the most beautiful exteriors. But I can not advise anyone to remove this parody.
