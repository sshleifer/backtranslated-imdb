One day in the life of a weak-minded taxi driver, sometime around Christmas: a taxi driver takes a fare ... they have a “really insightful” break ... he throws a fare ... he takes another fare .. one interlude ... and so it goes for 90 minutes, damn it ... nothing convincing (or interesting) even for one minute ... MISS IT!
