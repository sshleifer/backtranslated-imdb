I think "Bone Snatcher" should go after anyone associated with this film. Watching this will seem like the longest 90 minutes or so in your life. The plot is boring and stupid. There were no horrific scenes, even remote. If you manage to survive this wonderful cinema art to the very end, you will either be very disappointed or die laughing hysterically. I bought this movie based on other reviews I read. I would like my money back. What a schooner. If you are looking for a horror movie that will interest you, watch “U-turn”. It may be based on a strange plot, but it is full of those creepy scenes that make you jump from beginning to end.
