Sammy Cheng and Andy Lau are again paired in their 3rd film, YESTERDAY ONCE MORE, directed by HK action movie Johnny To ... action movie fans will be disappointed to find that no pistol was used in the shooting .. Also fans of the previous films of Cheng and Lau, “YOU NEED AND LOVE ON A DIET,” will also be disappointed to find that YESTERDAY is not that funny ... <br /> <br /> Mr. & Mrs To (Lau and Cheng) - a divorced couple ... both wealthy citizens of Hong Kong ... both incredibly harmful ... both turned out to be professional thieves - "two birds of one feather" .... A couple of years ago they divorced because the inability to find a middle ground in the division of prey ... Now she remarries ... with the son of a rich heiress - a boy of the common mother (Karl Ng) through ... The future mother-in-law (Jenny Wu) is suspicious of the past Mrs. To and thinks that she marries only her son because of family jewels - a priceless ruby Vågå necklace heiress ... <br /> <br /> The necklace is stolen ... materialistic eye Mrs. That takes precedence over her? ... or is it her ex-husband, Mr. Toe's way to sabotage a marriage in order to steal jewelry for yourself? .. <br /> <br /> This is not a film about two lovers or stirring up love ... about two lovers who have always been in love, but somehow were stupid to understand it ... they allow pride and greed crush them ... <br /> In general: YESTERDAY is one of the parts of the caper / robbery film and one part of respect for classic Hollywood glamor from his golden years - for example, Cary Grant and Grace Kelly "Catch a Thief "... Johnny That too rides on Chenge / Chemistry Lau from their previous films ... hope that Cheng / Huge popularity and worship Lau Kee will be sufficient justification for this third film .... I think Sammy Cheng - one of the prettiest / charming artists working today. . & Lau is definitely an Asian cinema Tom Cruise ... <br /> <br /> I really liked their first two films, and I think that the combination of Cheng-Lau is comparable to the classic Hollywood couples of the 40s and 50s. .. but yesterday did not live up to expectations ... horrible scenarios, ridiculous situations, an abundance of product placements and all supporting plots and secondary characters were unnecessary ... if you think ... this film was unnecessary ... if only you just like to watch celebrities ...
