RATING STARS: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> As a boy, Marc Goddard (Thomas Howell) sat as powerless as the family, including his hero father (Jeff Fahey), was brutally murdered by the cruel criminals he tried to shoot down. With an inner desire to punish the villains, festering in him when he grew up as a result of this, Mark uses hard means to attract suspects, in which he chases, and because of this he has a lot of trouble with his superiors. But then he learns about Justice Incorporated, a secret group of men and women headed by a mysterious man (Ed Lauter), who serves to impose a punishment that goes beyond the law. But then everything gets out of control and becoming Survive alive can be harder than he thought. <br /> <br /> The Sweeper had problems from the very beginning, because we saw the exact same story that was made earlier (and better) in films such as “Star Chamber” with Michael Douglas and Magnum Fors with Clint Eastwood. The name also does not make any sense. But we also have to contend with the complete absurdity of the film, including the scene where her daughter’s headphones can drown out the sound of her family’s murder, the final chase with the bad guy that starts on the freeway and ends on Wright Brothers Aircraft, as well as some of the most ridiculous acting, ever shown on the screen, and very cliché, pretentious scenario. But there are some cool action sequences here and there, and the factor of the film’s unintentional laughter certainly supports his pulse. **
