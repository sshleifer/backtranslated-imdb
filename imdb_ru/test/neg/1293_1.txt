I really tried to give this film a chance, but when I realized that most of the film was told by a bunch of boring officials who walk and talk on the phone, I realized that it was all over. Many of this film also looked like stock footage. It just sucks. <br /> <br /> The camera operator continued to do these quick short increases without CAUSES! It bothered me a lot, but I was just wondering why the hell they think this is a good idea. This adds nothing to the static scene when two people are talking. This is not NYPD Blue or some kind of police show or something. <br /> <br /> How could they not understand what to tell this type of story from people talking in conference rooms, and what is not, is it BORING? !! Didn't they watch this mess? Anyway, it was just a boring movie, and because of this, it looked as if the one who did it does not understand how well to tell stories in the film. <br /> <br /> Gosh, this is just wrong.
