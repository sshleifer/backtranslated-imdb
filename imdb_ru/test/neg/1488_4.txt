Like many history buffs in western Pennsylvania, I was looking forward to this promising PBS program, which was developed by WQED in Pittsburgh. However, I must now say that I was somewhat disappointed. On the other hand, I believe that in general this film did a good job, explaining the main problems and describing the events of the so-called French and Indian War. In particular, his idea of ​​the point of view of the Indians was somewhat new and quite interesting, although at the same time it was certainly overrated. Also on the positive side, a mixture of narrative and action scenes was well done and somewhat better than many of these typical documentaries, consisting of “expert” interviews and photographs (a la Ken Burns). On the negative side, many battles were somewhat "phased" in appearance, and many important aspects of the war were overlooked. Most of all, I was very disappointed and upset by how little attention was paid to the importance of the successful Forbes campaign of 1758 against Fort Duquesne compared to earlier failures of 1754 by Washington and 1755 by Braddock. In particular, I was somewhat mistrustful that NO ONE had mentioned Colonel Henry Boucke, a Swiss mercenary in the British service who was most responsible for the success of Forbes. Finally, I could not believe the complete omission of the Battle of the Thick Race of 1763, which began as a repetition of Braddock's defeat, but ended in victory, deciding the outcome of the Pontiac War thanks to the tricks of the same Colonel Bouquet, who certainly should of war.
