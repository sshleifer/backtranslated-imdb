This film was very boring. I just laughed a few times. I decided to rent it when I noticed William Shatnerâ€™s name on the cover. It's all about this little kid, who is always chosen by classmates. Wandering the streets looking for old women to help, he meets a prostitute. She takes him to a club called Playground, where he has made friends with several pimps. When Mayor Tony Gold (Shatner) decides to go into business for pimps, Lil Pimp should lay down his friends. <br /> <br /> Animation is not very good at it. It looks like it was done with Macromedia, which I am sure it was. It doesn't suck, it's just a kind of changeable flash animation that people have become accustomed to in recent years. The humor in this is not very good, I do not think it was all funny.
