The name does not make much sense to me. I'm not sure which door in the film should have been opened. <br /> <br /> The film begins without incident, when a man and a woman are talking in a room that looks like a richly furnished car. , complete with sound train train. In fact, the man’s house is a wagon and he has a cassette with train sounds. A woman leaves and calls a young woman. A young woman tells her boyfriend, a doctor, that she was told that her grandmother was sick, and she needed to return to her hometown. She was not thirteen years old. <br /> <br /> Remember thirteen years ago. A dark figure enters the house. He caresses a sleeping young girl, then goes to another room and stabs his mother. The girl wakes up and enters her mother's room and finds her dead with a knife in her. She screams, and a hand appears out of nowhere and puts a hand on her mouth. She looks in awe. This early scene in the killer movie muffles her scream, and the girl’s gaze is one of the few effective shots in the film. <br /> <br /> In the visual effects department this is not so important. Sometimes there is some kind of weird sound use, and in the attic, where many glass panels are red and blue, there is some kind of strange lighting. <br /> <br /> Back to today. A young woman arrives at her grandmother’s house. There is an old doctor whom she does not trust, as well as a man from the debut scene “Judge” and Kirn, the operator of the city museum. She does not trust any of them, and it is true that they do not inspire any confidence. She's pretty annoying throughout the film. She wants to check her grandmother to the hospital. People in the city want her house, and the museum worker wants things in it (his museum is already filled with many grandmother's things). It is inexplicable that a woman wants to save the house. <br /> <br /> A young woman begins to receive phone calls from a man speaking in an ominous whisper. He makes various threats and wants her to awaken something from him. Such scenes are repeated often. Unfortunately, there are so few characters in the film that the possibilities of who he may be are limited. Worse, we can see from the outset who is calling. Thus, although the young woman does not know (although the caller sometimes falls into her normal voice), the audience always knows: there is no waiting. Every call worries her more and more. <br /> <br /> The ending was unexpected for me, so maybe I get points for not agreeing with the obvious, but I'm not sure that it worried me.
