I live in Rome, where the Turkish director of this film lives and works. From my Italian friends, I heard a lot of good things about his films ... so after watching the preview, I really wanted to watch Cuore Sacro. I am deeply disappointed, one of the most pompous, pseudo-religious, incredible and naive films. I love the movie, but this one is really heavy and bad. The main character is really crazy, and he needs to be locked up in an insane asylum ... made me sympathize with the negative character of the aunt who runs a dirty company that wants to earn only money ... and I consider myself anti-capitalist ... it's bad !!!
