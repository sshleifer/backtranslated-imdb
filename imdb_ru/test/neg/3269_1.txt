I saw Caddyshack II when I was ten years old, and I mostly laughed because of the scene with the horses. I should have realized that the film was empty, like ... I can't think of a good comparison. This is stupid and not even very funny. The actors from the original who decided not to act in this film made probably the best choice they ever made, rejecting it; why oh why is the Chevy Chase back ?! And how the hell did Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Diane Cannon and Dan Aykroyd get involved in this excitement ?! I can argue that every person whose name is even remotely attached to this junk (for example, a pharmacist) is ashamed of redemption. So, in general, it is terrible, terrible and all that. Avoid this as if you were an Ebola virus.
