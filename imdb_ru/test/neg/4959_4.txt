From a budget standpoint, 2.5 million CAD is not very much, if you look at animatronics, the puppet theater in this film, which in itself is the cause of a 9-week shoot. I really wanted to watch this movie and hoped to see it when it came out, instead I recently received it on DVD. My main problem is that it is not funny at all, it is better than Tenacious D, which has no amusing bone in the body. But it was a really disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> Trevor Mathews is a very physically strong performer, but his acting is sucks! Rachel Skarsten gives what is arguably one of the most annoying and not a single funny presentation I've ever seen. The only really BIG star in this is David Scott, whose works for monsters are amazing! His work with special effects is the main reason why this film is worth seeing, he loved Cyclops and Troll, and Professor Monster was straight from the Henson Library. <br /> <br /> If you watch it, it won't be the biggest waste of time, but if you want to see it for a great comedy horror movie ... Do not worry.
