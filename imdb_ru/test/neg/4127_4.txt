How much do I love this movie ?! Now I'm not a fan of bad movies, but I like a movie that is so bad that it’s good. This is one of those. Juan Pablo Di Pace has a great ass, he looks amazing on screen and definitely doesn’t make a bad turn in his acting debut (I guess). Billy Zane, respectively, is mean-spirited and capricious, although I still constantly feel that there is something more in him. I felt it on Titanic, on his face, when La Winslet spat on him, for example, completely broken, shocked and depressed ... ferocious! Kelly Brooke has a beautiful face ... not serious, I think that is all! It is worth catching this to see one really hot guy, a few big bras from Brooke, a nasty growl from Billy, laugh at the dialogue, enjoy the scenery and the madness of this whole thing ... - yes, I bought it !!!
