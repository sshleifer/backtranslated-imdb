Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but this ... uh ... "movie" just shames space films. Every sci-fi film I've seen in the past YEAR has been somewhat disappointing, and now I am seriously reviewing which genre of films I really like in the future !! (Maybe now I will watch romantic films!) <br /> <br /> WARNING ABOUT SPOILERS! (And it doesnâ€™t mean much!) <br /> <br /> This film is so tastelessly stupid that it rivals Battlefield Earth and Baby Geniuses in absolute malice. The special effects are obviously faked, the Big Mac Truck looked stupid with its rollercoaster seats, the killer robots looked like a more idiotic version of the Power Rangers, the huge fat guy first sucked out of the window. .. Space truck school ??? WTF? <br /> <br /> Mr. Hopper can handle it better. What really smelled were two cute young things that accompany him and run only in shorts (??) as much as two thirds of the movie! Mandatory "sex scene" (sniker!) Between our young heroes was so poorly executed that I almost choked on my tonsils, laughing at the TV screen. <br /> <br /> The only character worth mentioning is the captain of a pirate ship / cyborg / evil scientist. He uttered the word "grotesque" and was predictably sloppy, but I suppose he could be much more threatening. He does and says rather funny things (all the best scenes are connected with him!) Therefore, for the captain, I give this film an extra point. <br /> <br /> But this film is so bad that you want to throw insults at the TV or maybe throw the TV out the window! It can even kill several brain cells and lead you to a catatonic state <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION? I like the way the captain struggles to walk on his leg when this is clearly a fake leg !! I would give 0 out of 10, but since he shakes me up with his silly tricks ... this film gets 1/10!
