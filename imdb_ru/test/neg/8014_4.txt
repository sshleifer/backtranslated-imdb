I saw this Hallmark TV movie when it was originally aired. I lost interest in the story because the character was said to be a witch. I was just not in the mood to watch this movie. But Hallmark stands for the best, high-quality films. Now there is a reason to give this film a second look. Clive Owen, who plays Damon Wildev, may have a chance to be chosen as the next James Bond 007 when Pierce Brosnan passes it. Clive Owen may have to wait until 2008. Another reason is that Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is currently a celebrity (at that time she was unknown), plays the leading role and won the Oscar for an outstanding second-actress in 2003. Plowright as "Mrs. Yeobright" is also in this film. I like the opening line in this film: â€œRid my heart from this terrible, lonely place. Send me a great love from somewhere, otherwise I will die, really die. "
