I found this film extremely disturbing. Tredwell is delirious and worried to such an extent that he may suffer from a mental illness. The footage shown is he, not the actor, but, nevertheless, he shows the behavior that ended in death. Is it appropriate to show real suicide shots? Let's not chop words. The film shows shots of behavior that directly led to his death. <br /> <br /> For those who think that Treadwell is a kind of hero, think again. The shots that he shot, tell about him, and not about the bears and foxes, which he stated that it helps. He did not conduct meaningful research on their habits or numbers and did nothing to really protect them. All he did was run in the bushes and convince himself that he was the best. The reality is that by helping to reduce the sensitivity of animals to people, he put them at great risk. His condescending behavior did not entail his own death, but the death of his companion, Amy Plus, caused his favorite bears and foxes more harm. <br /> <br /> But I'm also concerned about the actions of Werner Herzog in drafting this shoot like he did. <br /> <br /> My friend and I have been arguing for a long time about this film that loved this film. He believes that people with serious problems are interested in interesting subjects, and cites as an example the film “Fall”. But in Downfall they use actors. We have not seen the real Madga Gobells put cyanide capsules in the mouth of their children. <br /> <br /> There was something in the real shots from Grizzly Maine that reminded me of this terrible tragedy at the football stadium where people were. Frustrated to death and the photographers who could help, decided to just continue to record the horror. <br /> <br /> Herzog's film shows us that Tredwell’s frames are more concerned with Tredwell. But the Duke did the same. His personality and opinions are conveyed in this documentary, which is supposedly about someone else. Scenes such as the one where he listens to the tape are not needed. We already knew what was on the tape, because the coroner told us. We do not need Herzog to shed a tear from one of Tredwell’s ex-girlfriends. It did not add to the film. <br /> <br /> The film showed us that Tredwell was very indulgent, but also showed that Herzog too.
