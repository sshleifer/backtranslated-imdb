I watch all the good reviews about this film and start thinking about myself ... I'm going crazy ..? Can't I see the beauty from a movie like this ..? I'm just dumb enough to NOT understand the message this movie is trying to show? I don't know ... maybe one of these lizards came into my head and ate all my brains. The idea of ​​the film has not gone away ... I was sure that she would have a foggy end, and, of course ... it was! Nothing special ... Even landscapes (I jumped that, being placed in a mountain village, at least the landscapes would be good .. but no). Just a bad story about a crazy teacher and, of course, about her crazy students ... now they all grew up, each of them ... with their own fixed ideas. And some of these ideas were stupid, for example, the story of lizards. At some point, it seemed to me that I was watching “x files” with a lizard entering the ear and all that. No .. from my point of view, this film is a waste of time (not to mention money, if you pay for the ticket). The only role I liked was the game of a young blue-eyed “German” child ... He played very well and convincingly for his age ... the rest ... nothing! I read the previous review, and I think the scriptwriter and the director were on drugs when they put forward these ideas. Well, considering that there are a lot of people who liked this movie ... I think about myself again ... Maybe I'm crazy. Advice .. Do not waste your time on it!
