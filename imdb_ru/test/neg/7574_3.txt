Amando De Ossorio never let a budget shortfall prevent him from telling one of his stories. His series The Blind Dead began great, but there were some really ludicrous moments in it, such as pictures of a small model of a boat in a water tank for Phantom Galleon. In Sea Snake, he reaches the bottom and takes with him some famous actors, telling the story of the stupid sock monster that terrifies Google’s eyes at several water tanks and miniature aquariums. <br /> <br /> The indefinite opening sequence sets the scene and demonstrates an interrupted military mission, where American pilots, for some unknown reason, drop an atomic bomb (brazenly depicted in the frame of the film) somewhere in the ocean off the coast of Spain. The military commander gives this order from the office with an outstanding American flag and a portrait of the deranged Ronald Reagan - one of the few things that make this film really look like the eighties. The other two are a funny, inept subtitle that announces the year "1.985", and a hairstyle from Tyria Power by Sheena Easton that would look very cool next to torn neon sweats. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest monsters you will ever see come up from the depths, disturbed by an explosion caused by a bomb. We learn that a strange atomic bomb killed most of the local fish. Unfortunately for our composition, this does not affect the Sea Serpent, which quickly descends to the coast of Spain for some miniature lawlessness. <br /> <br /> Now that I say that a monster is unrealistic, I’m not exaggerating. This is not just a “look” of a fake. I’m sure the filmmakers did everything they could with ten dollars that they seemed to have been allocated, but in most cases it looks like they were made from Crayola markers, a ping-pong ball and an old sock. Moreover, he has this ominous music that accompanies him, wherever she goes, music that is so similar to the theme of "Jaws" that it is surprising that no one was brought to justice. <br /> <br /> Along with Tyria Power, Timothy Bottoms and Ray Milland got into the slums, and the dialogue could not be more dismal. Thanks to a series of plot tricks, our lead actors get together in search ... well, I'm not sure what the goal is. Bottom and Power must prove that the snake is real in order to save its butts (it is accused of shipwreck caused by a snake, it is locked in an insane asylum after the sight). None of this matters, because by the end of the film nothing was decided. No one recognizes that the serpent is real, and he is not even dead. In addition, the power and the bottom are still in a quandary from the law. <br /> <br /> No matter how illogical, no one but our heroes knows that snakes exist (despite numerous disappearances, a broken lighthouse and a destroyed railway bridge), and they set off on a long non-adventure to track Down and drive the monster away ... don't kill him, because they know that he has no equal. Their big plan is to use rockets to scare them away. Although their scheme is not true, the snake causes a big explosion in the water after it attacks the bridge support (don't ask), and the giant sea snake is so scared that it floats away. The critical viewer wonders why the snake wasn't scared earlier in the film when it caused a couple of big explosions after falling on the dock. But never mind. He swims away, and our heroes are sure that he is gone forever. The end. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine the horror that the stars experienced when they saw the finished film they were working on. A scenario with a lame brain and a pair of dull reaction shots could never prepare them for embarrassment when they share time on the screen with a puppet / animal inserted into the sock with motion stopping. At the very least, the secondary characters were supposed to cheer and shout and pretend that they were swallowed by a giant snake head. I'm not sure what happened when they made this film; The monster is cheap, but there are some fairly complex miniature sets, so someone spent some time creating them, not to mention the animation of the stop motion. It would seem that it is played directly, although perhaps the sense of humor of this film passed through my head. After all, a movie is no more than an easy target for drunken comments. Watch it at a party for better results.
