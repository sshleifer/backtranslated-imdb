This is a bad, bad movie. Full of clich√©, unrealistic moments: vigor in celebrating after putting out a fire, not to mention the fact that someone lost his home and property !!, announcing pregnancy in a bar with all your buddies before telling you in private, first go to the roof of a burning building for no apparent reason, stereotypical funerals and tensions, very quirky, trashy music at the end, unreal treatment of the girl who was rescued from her apartment, a very unrealistic explosion from the same apartment! ! Did they have a pair of oxygen tanks in the attic or something? Anyone who has a share of mind can see that this film was a joke. It's a pity, because firefighters do an amazing job and they deserve a good movie about what they do, but not at the expense of common sense.
