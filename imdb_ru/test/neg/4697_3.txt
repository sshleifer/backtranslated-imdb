I just returned from watching "Comic." All was good. It made me look at the screen. It's just not the kind of thing I like to pay to see 7 dollars. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, this is a great opportunity for HBO. If this were something that I watched on TV, I would be hooked. It gives you a stunning look at what comics go through before and after entering the stage. It will interest anyone who likes to watch comics. <br /> <br /> But when I go to the movies, I like to have fun. I'm not here to get an education. Now I know what it is for Jerry Seinfeld, before he steps on stage ... well. But to be honest, I'd rather just laugh at his jokes than worry about it. <br /> <br /> One more thing: with the bad attitude that Onri Adams has; I expect him to take my order from Burger King before I see his HBO feature. He was not funny. He is the kind of person you love to hate.
