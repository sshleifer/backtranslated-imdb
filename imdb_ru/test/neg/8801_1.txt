I donâ€™t understand how some people can play Half-Life: Counter-Strike when there are so many better first-person shooter games. <br /> <br /> Counter-Strike is a game that does not use any creative ideas in its weapons. All the weapons in the game are real weapons, but there could be at least a cheat that would allow players to have access to "supernatural" weapons, like the all-powerful BFG in Quake & Doom games. <Br /> <br /> Another problem is that the player must reload the weapon manually. This can be very annoying, especially when you are in the middle of a shootout, when you are so close to killing an enemy. Delay recharging also creates the feeling that the gun is slowly performing its task. <br /> <br /> The selection of characters is small. If I remember correctly, there are four types of characters for terrorist and counter-terrorist forces. This means that many characters look the same, which really reduces the realism of the game. <br /> <br /> The game is quite sexist when it comes to choosing characters. In the early version of Counter-Strike, there was a woman available to choose (in the selection of the Terrorist Forces), which was good for female gamers. However, in recent versions, the female character has been removed and replaced by another male character. I wonder if the women who played the game were disappointed in the new versions? <br /> <br /> Finally, the cards in the game are very small. The largest map seems to be a desert map, but it has standard details. In fact, all the cards in the game have standard graphics. In other words, nothing new. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I think Half-Life: Counter-Strike is the most extraordinary first-person shooter game of all time. There are many better and more original shooting games, so why waste your time on this boring game? You better play games Unreal Tournament, Quake and Doom. Avoid this overpriced game and overpriced advertising. <br /> <br /> I give the game 1/10.
