Well, I like to watch awful B-Movies, because I think it's interesting to see the folly and inability of the creators to make a seriously good movie. (I always compare these films, for example, with some of Spielberg’s works, and again and again I don’t understand the huge difference in what I see.) I like Ed Wood films because they are so inept, they are very funny. But people !!! "Cooling" is not funny and not even "interesting." This is a terribly boring horror movie without ANYTHING, which makes even bad movies watchable. There is no acting, script, directing, thrill or even blood. This is an extremely inept amateur film. This is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot of “worst films” - trust me). I warned you !!! 1/10
