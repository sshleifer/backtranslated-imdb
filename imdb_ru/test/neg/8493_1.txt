I can just imagine how this movie appeared: <br /> <br /> "So how else can we ruin our career?" <br /> <br /> “I know! Let's take a film that was incredibly successful and make a sequel! <br /> <br />“ Great! We get B-class actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Kerry's initial salary. We will save millions and make huge profits, not to mention that no one wants to see the continuation of the second grade, in which none of the original actors made it popular! We, as leaders, still sincerely believe that the film was popular based on the title and the story, and not the actors who did it in the first place! "<br /> <br />" Great! Let's invest a huge budget and find the cheapest actors we can find! "<br /> <br /> And really, this is something that can be described as“ Son of the Mask. ”Just a simple B-grade film that tries to suck life out of its original classics. <br /> <br /> However however, if the film did not contain the words “mask” or anything related to the mask, it would be a good children's film. Despite the huge flaws and terrible game, children will really like it. It is a good-natured film that really wants to scream “like I! ", but only those 8 and younger will really enjoy. <br /> <br /> Jamie Kennedy is the only thing worth mentioning in tom movie. He is obviously trying to get stuff to work, playing a desperate dad, but the script is so bad that the only thing that spits out is worth it, it's my drink, having seen it, to mention, since he was the most pleasant character and really by which older people could watch this movie. In this movie is lost for nothing, I would really like the character to take on a real mask. Instead, we are reduced to chilling jokes and toilet humor near the end. <br /> <br /> The plot is so big on the books that I will not mention it here. Obviously, even the Disney executive will be green with envy. <br /> <br /> Save your money, this movie will be released on DVD in three months. Shame on studios to once again lubricate a decent movie with a horrible sequel. Didn’t the dumb and clever man teach them anything?
