My friends and I are always on the lookout for Chuck Norris films to just shake and make fun. So far, one of our favorites is Lonewolf. I went to Wal-Mart's Christmas shopping and came across this movie in 5.99 bin. I had to get it. I had high hopes for this film, and although from time to time it was absolutely hilarious, we agreed that “The Bells of Innocence” is the worst film we have ever seen, filmed, filmed, invented, etc. damn, this is a great idea. Not only is it sometimes confusing, but it's just hard to watch an acting game. the man who plays Oren, plays the part, I can compare him to my own vomit, and Chuck dove with it, he's not the best actor, but it was awful. and what names are Oren, Konrad and Yux ........ Eux. come on people if you honestly thought that this film can be watched at all, it is good for you, because it was hard for me, and after watching, my head and stomach seriously hurt. I tell you now if you have not seen this movie, not !! For the love of God, please do not expose yourself to such a horrible 90 minutes of your life.
