Bean, Kevin and Perry, British television creations that made successful transitions to the BIG screen. Now it's Ali Ji's turn, and I'm afraid to say that this is not one of them! <br /> <br /> Ali was always obscene, but ridiculous. This film was extremely sick and not at all funny. Scenes involving bestiality, gay sex and pedophilia should not be portrayed for fun. <br /> <br /> Ali G In Da House is rubbish and deserves very little money. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
