Specks of white and different forms, beautiful nudes, random images. That's what a little experimental short film is. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to think how in the first days of the film such images could be transferred to the film, but, despite my love for many surreal images and films, and my fascination with strange things, this film simply did not do it for me. <br /> <br /> I don’t feel sorry that I watched it, but if there is some basic meaning in it, I don’t understand Visually, this is not so outstanding, in my humble opinion. As an example of Dadaism, I believe that it would fit perfectly, since it seems to reject any semblance of logic or reason, although I would prefer that he do it in a more visually interesting way. <br /> <br /> But to each his own.
