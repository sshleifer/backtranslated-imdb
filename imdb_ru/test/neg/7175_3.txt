This is the bottom of a barrel-shaped B-film from one of the poor studios, Monogram, in the mid-40s, the type that filled the double bill. <br /> <br /> The only reason I looked was to see what JACKIE MORAN was playing in the leading role of a radio station on a radio station that was trying to solve a murder. He played Phil Mead in Gone With the Wind only two years ago, and this was one of his last roles as a teenager. He is not Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> The scenario is as unhappy as the production values, and full of clichés in which there are people with equally incompetent people. WANDA McKAY is a girl from a switchboard that the radio producer “discovered”, and SIDNEY MILLER is a boring friend of the hero who is afraid of his own shadow. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it's all over in an hour, when the murder is decided after a search of all the suspects. Terribly overzealous, the only quiet performance of any interest is given by John Gilbrit as the cowboy Tex, but he bites the dust after a too short performance. <br /> <br /> There are a few songs, but they are all forgotten, as are slop jokes and dialogues.
