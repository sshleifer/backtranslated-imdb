If a film has ever existed that can be considered a missed opportunity, then this film is Galaxina. What could be wrong in making a sci-fi movie about a sexy stately female android? Of course, such a movie will never be a waste of time? Well, unfortunately, this film is pretty close to useless. I must say that in this production there are a number of shortcomings, but there are two main problems that completely destroy the entire enterprise. Firstly, it is a comedy with no fun details, or at least a movie in which potentially funny aspects are presented in an incredibly unappealing way. Secondly, the title character is extremely undervalued. This may be because Dorothy Stratten was not really an actress, but if so, it was a terrible decision, as she is still the best thing in the film. I don't think she really needs to be a great talker in order to cope with the role of the sexual android in order to be completely honest. In any case, what we have left is a huge stunning comedic relief, which often consists of hopeless jokes from the big science fiction hits of the time, such as Alien, Star Wars and 2001. It’s poorly written and not funny at all and it doesn't even have a plot to push things forward. Basically the story of the police space cruiser, which is sent for stone. This is it! Steven Spielberg once said that a film with a high concept is a film whose plot can be described in one sentence. What he didn’t define was what you call a film that can be described in less than a sentence — maybe meaningless? <br /> <br /> It seemed to me an unconditional winner, but failed miserably. It seems that it was an attempt to fake "Star Wars" and combine it with comedic situations for adults. All he really wants is to leave you cold and a little irritated, because it’s not close to what it should have been. Barbarella for the 80s is not. <br /> <br /> Shortly after this movie was finished, Dorothy Stratten was murdered in a terribly cruel and terrible way. And for this reason, Galaksina aroused a large part of her cult interest. I just wish Dorothy had a better movie to perpetuate.
