I have seen some bad action movies, but this one is just awful. I feel that even writing it is a waste of time, but I will do it shortly. Why does this film suck? Here are 10 reasons: 1. Very amateur directorial work. 2. Bad bad bad bad play of the whole cast. 3. Silly dialogues and too many cliches. 4. Too many plot holes, a lot of scenes do not add up. 5. Bad photography (and many problems with continuity). 6. Ridiculously bad performance of the leading female actress. 7. Unreliable fighters (and also not too good). 8. Even for the movie "Snipe", he demonstrates a big lack of acting materials. 9. Outrageous accents (total cast). 10. Last but not least, there are too many implausible facts, such as a football tournament in the USA, the CIA, which needs to be checked in order to get new information about its employees, a mattress that is explosion-proof, and so on. In fact, it is a waste of time, itâ€™s not funny, not interesting, not even a joke - DO NOT LOOK THIS !!! Seriously, just not necessary.
