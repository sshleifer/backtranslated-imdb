If you want to truly experience the magic (?) Of Don Dohler, look at Alien Factor or Fiend, but not this. Alien Factor is actually quite resourceful, considering the low budget, and it’s rather creepy, but “Nightbeast”, which I think is a kind of update to Alien Factor, is just dumb. The actors moan in their roles, especially the sheriff, Mr. Monoton, and the monster is some kind of silly Halloween-style mask instead of the wild-looking (but somewhat silly) creatures from the Alien Factor. The spacecraft falls to Earth, and inside, of course, there are creatures that run, evaporating people. And taking off his hands, and so on. D. And he has a cool ray gun, which he also uses to evaporate people until he shoots his hand. And this is really about it. “Alien Factor” wins this mess, if you really want to watch a good Don Dowler movie, check it out instead. And RIP Don Dowler, 12/2/06.
