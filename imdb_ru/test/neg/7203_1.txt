I made this movie under the impression that this is “Scarecrow 3: Dark Harvest”, thinking that this is a continuation of the Scarecrow Slayer series (another extremely funny and horrible series of films). I was not disappointed though. It was just as awful, if not worse than I expected. I laughed throughout the film. Each episode of bad acting, poorly filmed and cut shots, as well as terrible special effects - this is what makes this film worthy of hire. <br /> <br /> Among the special features is a pitiful look at the film crew and six months of the film crew. <br /> Favorite line: "The sins of my ancestors! They leaked at this very moment! ”
