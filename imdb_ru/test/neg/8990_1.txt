This fantasy was complete rubbish. I thought Michael Moore had driven the market to a standstill on anti-government films, but this one was much worse than everything he had ever done. It is not surprising that critics of the British media complain that they are driven by tabloid journalism. This film - the greatest fantasy of the left psycho, brought to life on the big screen. Anyone who is even a little to the right of such rabid killers of Bush, should be shocked when he gets funding. I am sure it will be good in Syria, Iran, Pakistan and North Korea, though. It is hard to believe that in these days of insane Muslims blowing up innocent passengers in the UK there is someone who thinks that Britain should surrender in the war on terrorism. I think this is no longer the country I admired for standing alone against the Nazis almost 70 years ago. Hail Neville Chamberlain and the pitiful policy of appeasement!
