Although I watched Salo, I do not know whether excrement is tart. If so, this “film” is exactly titled. So much roughage, so little substance, it is the celluloid equivalent of celery - only it doesn’t purify the taste. It leaves a taste of lost time in the mouth of the mind, and if I could wrest this film and return that space / expense, I would do it. Detention was more exciting. The director must be forced to wear a cap, and the Spirit of Ed Wood, Jr. could not save this semi-professional prediction from a certain setback. A waste of time, a waste of mind. ** Do not be deceived by the tedious Dominic Swain: she was a talented lover of the eyes in a Lolita remake, less tragic and cunning than Sue Lyon, but not at all better However, the earlier competent turning of the screw does not make her an experienced craftsman. For this you need a craft, not shit, which is this film. The drums are in the girls' bathroom until the pipes burst, and the director / without director Christine Wayne should do 5-10 in the classroom. See something else and go through this class, (for now), forever!
