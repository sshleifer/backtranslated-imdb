It was one of the biggest crap I've ever watched. I mean, seriously. What would anyone else feel if they were in the shoes of Woody Harrelson, and your wife even LEARNED that it would be nice to have sex with another guy for even a million bucks. In the end, it was she who talked about it in bed and said how good it would be for them, since he could build his house or something else with that money. Woody never fully agreed with this until she convinced him of that. How can you trust her? Who the hell really even think about it if they were married? I don't care how desperate they were. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life. Then he rushes at her. Apparently, he had no right to not trust her, except for the fact that his wife had just slept with another dude who is extremely rich and beautiful. Well, wait, then he must apologize to her after she filed for divorce so that she could be with the guy she was sleeping with. Of course, Woody has no right to say anything to her or not to trust her, especially after Roy Hobb's card is still in her wallet. Then, at the end of the film, she seems to be still so in love with Woody and misses him so much that she was not going to part with Hobbs until he came up with an absurdly stupid story to try to leave her to leave, and she was Bloody thanks, Hobbs ???? Are you kidding me, kidding? Was she under contract, like his sex slave or something ?? I mean, what a bleep ?? Oh, and wait until it gets better. She passionately kisses him before getting out of the car. Yes, she is not a whore. Oh, thank you for letting me go, let me talk to you for the last time for God's sake. Smooch Smooch, Smooch, although I'm still married to the guy I left for the rich guy. I have never seen such a piece of shit in my life. How the hell should we feel good after that horrible end? What was supposed to represent this film? Nothing has come from it! It was the most meaningless film I've ever seen in my life. Two miserable desperate man. If I were Woody, I would tell her to drown in the reservoir where they were. Apparently, he did not experience self-esteem. What the hell, Roy Hobbs thought, taking on that horrible role. I feel vomiting after seeing this. This film was so bad that it was really funny. I want to return the two hours of my life I wasted watching this piece ****.
