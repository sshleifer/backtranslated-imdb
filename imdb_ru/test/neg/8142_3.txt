The film is a pitiful attempt to remake the "Autumn Sonata" by Ingmar Bergman (1978) with Ingrid Bergman, Liv Ulman and Erland Josephson. It didn't take me more than 5 minutes to figure it out. <br /> <br /> This is the time. Journalists like Khalid Mohammed spent their time on creative thinking. Iâ€™m sad when potentially good directors spend their talents doing poor quality remakes of Hollywood and European films. <br /> <br /> Although you have to give the director something. The film, which he chose to copy, is one of the classic works of Bergman and, of course, one of the best examples of the image of tense human relations in European cinema.
