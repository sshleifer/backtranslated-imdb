Alexandra Ripley wrote a terrible continuation of the book of Margaret Mitchell's masterpiece, published in the 1930s. The heirs of Margaret Mitchell sold their rights and for big money allowed Alexander Ripley to write a piece of garbage book even worse than the romantic novels of Barbara Cortland. I was a big fan of the book Margaret Mitchells, and the fake sequel to Alexandra Ripley was written just to make money. <br /> <br /> Although I have always admired the acting talent of Joan Kilmer and Timothy Dalton, this is truly a horrible movie. The script is terrible and full of cliches. Cameo Ann Margaret as Belle Watling is so terrible that I wanted to slap her. <br /> <br /> The only decent thing in the film is Sean Bean, who masterfully plays the role of bravura in the role of the sexy wild villain - Lord Fenton. The performance of Sean Bean in the spirit of “The Man You Love to Hate” portrays an unsafe sex symbol. <br /> <br /> But Sean Bean is only in the first half of the film, so you have to suffer with watching an incredibly long 6-hour movie with an unbearably boring script. <br /> <br /> Don’t waste your money on this film if you’re not a fan of Sean Bean, but just watch it on his wonderful performance.
