There are films that are leaders, and films that are followers. <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" were the leader. And here is one of his followers. <br /> <br /> “Camp Party” is about as interchangeable as any of his brothers who lay the depth that “Meatballs” (original) so successfully mined. Of course, this was Bill Murray. So what is there in Party Camp? <br /> <br /> I'm glad you asked this question. <br /> <br /> Jewel Shepherd made her own bread and butter from this movie, and what side? She provides a dish! Even being an innocent girlfriend (winking, winking) to a rich guy (Cribb), she provides the sultry couple she gives to all her parts. And yes, guys, it shows (if you know what I mean, and I think what you are doing). God, that smile could melt through the titan. <br /> <br /> What? Oh yes, the movie. Nothing special, as I said; every cheap joke is aimed and amazed (at crotch level). And the eternal teenager Jane is good for a laugh or two. But instead of a sense of humor, there is only nudity, obscene sexual jokes, even more, nudity, a soft sequence of dreams, a nurse with sex symbols just for (CLOTHING!) Mocking purposes, even more nudity > Hmmm ... Maybe this is a good idea, Bill Murray was not in it. <br /> <br /> Two stars. For Jewel, naturally. A lot of "camp", but not a lot of "party".
