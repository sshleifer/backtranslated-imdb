If Corky St. Clair in the movie “Waiting for Hoffman” directed the residents of Blaine in a horror movie with comic overtones, the result would be very similar to MONSTER MILPITAS. <br /> <br /> To be generous, this would be the longest hour and twenty minutes of the movie I've ever seen. To call a tempo ice is to be kind. <br /> <br /> Almost no one associated with this project has ever shot another film, with the exception of Ben Burtt, who did some really great (budgetary) special effects. He continued to make sound for films such as MUNICH and several other major budget projects. The narration is written by veteran announcer Paul Fries, who probably sacrificed his efforts. <br /> <br /> When you watch the opening titles and see the Milpitas Unified School District, listed as one of the producers you know, you are going on a long, strange journey. <br /> <br /> Pollution at a landfill in Milpitas, California, becomes so toxic that it creates a monster. Remember, this is 1975, and ecology has been a hot topic. Just a few years ago, movie lovers received treatment from GODZILLA VS. SMOG MONSTER. <br /> <br /> So far so good. The monster is a winged creature at least fifty feet tall, capable of tearing the city apart. Instead, he steals trash cans. <br /> <br /> The central condition is the idea that this monster can roam around a small town and leave traces eight feet long, but no one will notice it. There is a well thought out scene where it takes place at night in the middle of a carnival, but for some reason no one notices. <br /> <br /> The only person who sees the monster before the final scenes is George, the drunken city. Throughout the film, I was hoping, hoping, hoping that George would rip to shreds in front of the camera, but this did not happen. Get out In fact, no one dies. George allegedly sacrifices himself to save Priscilla (he is tied to a helicopter to lure the creature - George smells worse than trash, and the monster is attracted by the smell). <br /> <br /> Nominee Leaders - High School Group. students. There is a cute Priscilla and her nondescript guy, as well as a few “bad” guys who (surprise, surprise) turn themselves into shape to help defeat the monster in the final scenes. <br /> <br /> The monster is involved in four main scenery; He attacks Browning-Ferris garbage truck and leaves it next to a raised highway, but no one notices. He goes through the carnival, again imperceptibly. He breaks the building (good miniature work), and no one sees him, except George. Then he attacks the high school while dancing and grabs Priscilla and carries her away like some very tall monkey that did this several times, quite recently this winter. <br /> <br /> There are conspiracy ideas that come from nowhere and have not fallen. Locals hold a picket at the city hall, because they want to return their garbage cans. Sophisticated secret weapons for tracking monsters flew in on a private jet, checked and forgotten. <br /> <br /> So why did I look at all this? Because these people had so much fun. I had an idea that firefighters were firefighters, businessmen were filmed in their own offices, Priscilla could easily live in this house in a suburban tract, and the scenes of people in their courtyards could well be in their own courtyards. <br /> <br /> They may not be good actors, but they are real people. No one looks amazing good. In fact, I would appreciate that four out of five adults on the screen wear glasses. Since this is the mid-seventies, we see really bad clothes, and some men have very bad facial hair. One dignitary who is being interviewed before the meeting at Zirle Hall has such a loud tie and a sports coat that you think he is going to play Marcellus in “MUSIC MUSIC”. <br /> <br /> And the film has two additional stars. Zero for the story. Two points for sometimes decent special effects. And two points for the fact that people in the community really got together and did it. They can actually say they played the movie; Despite the great experience of working on the stage and working behind the scenes on the air, I cannot say this, and I am happy for them. <br /> <br /> Remember those wonderful old movies with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland? At some point, someone will say: “Let's make a show! Edna's aunt has all this old clothes in the attic, and we can use Uncle Ned's barn! ”Then they organized a“ show next door ”with decorations and costumes that would cost up to seven figures if they were duplicated today. <br /> <br /> It was this kind of spirit that good people of Milpitas had for this project, and blessed them for that.
