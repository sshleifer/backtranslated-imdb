Surprisingly, this Kislovsky film disappoints me because of the sometimes strange and sometimes cliche scenario, which sometimes seems like a bad observation. There is an isolated young boy. He lives with one of his relatives, but he is lonely and watches every night for the woman who lives through their building. Looks like it! that he wants her. He is one of those who can communicate badly with the opposite sex. However, he likes this woman, when a woman comes to his house with a man, Tomek is in pain. Then we understand that Kieslowski tells us the story of an isolated young boy who needs a woman to flirt or who falls in love with a mature woman. He does not do anything else, because perhaps he knows that this is his salvation. Once he stops this woman, suddenly he seems to be a shy boy, but he proves that it is not so, so he explains almost everything to her. She lectures and refuses him. Everything is as realistic as in other Kislovsky films, no problem. Problems begin when Tomek visits her, the story of a lonely young boy who falls in love with a mature woman (but unrequited love) turns into a story of a lonely young boy falling in love with a mature woman, from the very beginning the woman refuses, but after a short time she begins to change her mind. This reversal makes the movie a clich√© first. Is Tomek's personality strange? or the result of poor observation? I am disappointed with this character, this is my opinion, and I will try to explain why. When he goes to her house, Magda treats him very friendly. She asks what do you want from me? Kiss Me? make love to me? to go with me? At the moment I remember people who say that she is a femme fatale. See? Returning to the scene, Tomek rejects all offers. What for? Because he is shy? I do not think so, but his communication is stupid, good. After the scene at home, some events make the film not reach its goal. I think that the purpose of the film is (must be, according to the plot) to show us that there are some people who suffer from a lack of love, and it is not easy to save from this situation due to the lack of communication and special attitude of people. I mean, at the moment, what does the film say? It is blurry and frustrating. It is evident that he does not crave love or a woman or sex. What then? And the scene of the suicide attempt supports this weakness. To he touched her legs, he wants to commit suicide! By the way, as I mentioned earlier, some say that Magda is a femme fatale. Not at all. She tries to make Tomek happy. Does she avoid contact with him? No, she insults him? Not. Does she entertain him? Not. And is she cheating on him? Not. She has problems with her (former) lover, so she is not O.K. However, she does not take revenge on Tomek. She is not an angel, but not a femme fatale.
