This cheap movie is based on a true story. I do not doubt it. This does not mean that it is especially interesting (unless you are one of the main characters who actually lived through this experience). A young woman named Angela is buying a big, big country house, really very cheap. Well, as we all know from horror movies, when you buy a big house cheaply, it usually means that it is pursued in some way, in one form or another. In fact, the second time, when the house is handed over to Angela, the son of a wise man, who still lived in the house, it takes time to “present” Angela to one of the ghosts! Good guy, huh? Angela contacts a psychic and a paranormalist and tells them that they often visit her house, and invites them to come and see ghosts for themselves. They come to a party and, of course, ghosts sit around, sit on the couch, hang in the garage and try to seduce people in the bathroom. Several friends sleep all night at a party, see ghosts and swear never to return to the house again. (Look at the girl who is choking "I am so scared. I am so scared." Totally insensitive. If she is so scared, why didn't she get up, turn the knob and go?) they are neither blurred nor aura. They look like ordinary people). They steal celery from the kitchen, move chairs around POLTERGEIST, and one bisexual female ghost seduces Angela, who, understand this, does not seem to mind! This scene plays like the kind of soft core porn you see on the SPICE channel. (Mmm ... not that I KNOW! Hahaha). Actresses are not your typical porn stars, though. They should visit the beach and the gym more. When Angela does NOT make love to the dead, she is angry at them and stands alone in the room, shouting "Why won't you leave? This is MY home! Leave!" They do not leave. I could not help but think of those cases where I heard psychic Sylvia Brown on TV say that if you have a ghost in your house, you should calmly explain this ghost and say, “Look, you're dead. go to the other side. In other words, get out! According to Sylvia Brown, as long as you are not hostile and disgusting about this, they will leave! Looks like this movie costs about $ 50. He has a really cheap feeling and a bad game. I could make this movie with 5 friends and a video camera.
