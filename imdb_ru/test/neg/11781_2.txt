This is one of the most stupid movies ever, not the most stupid, but one of the most stupid. This is 96 1/2 minutes of sleep causing material. Probably the worst movie of Jim Varney. The last 30 seconds of the film is the best and fun part, but it's hardly worth watching the whole movie. On the other hand, if you are a Jim Varney / Ernest fan, then, like me, you must add this film to your collection. It has short, rare moments of humor, although they are few and far between. The fact that this film is so hard to find makes it collectable and must-have for your collection. I was lucky to find this movie online at a very low price a couple of years ago. I believe I paid 1.99 plus shipping for that. And it was the only copy I could find anywhere. Despite the fact that this is really a terrible film, it must be if you are a Jim Varney fan and a collector of Ernest films, for example, me. On a scale from 1 to 10, I give this movie 2, but only because I have never seen 1 before;)
