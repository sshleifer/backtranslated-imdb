Jumpin 'Butterballs, this film stinks! This is a boring and sluggish resistance that never gives up. It's amazing that someone even bothered to portray Groucho in his fancy branded eyebrows and mustaches, since throughout this bore he has nothing witty or outrageous. Chico must have been so indifferent that he forgot to use his Italian accent. <br /> <br /> Only Harpo gives a smile or two, and in any case, it is very small. The figure in the loud hotel manager and another unpleasant comic by Frank Albertson, and the road becomes even more bumpy. <br /> <br /> This misfire.
