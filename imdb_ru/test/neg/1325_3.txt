I don't know, maybe I just wasn't in the mood for such a film, but it was full of a banal melodrama. It was too long and it seemed, at least, slightly disconnected (of course, I did not pay attention ...). For a more entertaining description of the Battle of Stalingrad, see Enemy at the Gates. True, some pretentious people will scoff, because this is a Hollywood film, and does not show the “harsh reality of war”, like this “wonderful foreign film,” but it has the best flow and is just more fun to watch around. In addition, there are already quite skillfully "sand" films about the war, and this one seemed to be just an amateur one. But hey, you might like it, so go straight; it's just not for me.
