In general, this is a film for children. We saw it tonight, and my child loved it. At some point, the excitement of my child was so strong that it was impossible to sit. However, I'm a big fan of A.A. Milne's books, which are very thin and hide artificial intelligence behind the children's qualities of their main characters. This film was not thin. It seems a shame that Disney cannot see the benefits of making films from the more stories contained on those pages, although he may not have permission to use them. I found myself wishing the theater to replay Winnie the Pooh and the Tiger too. The voices of the characters were very good. I was really worried about Kang. The music, however, was twice as loud as dialogue, and did not fit the film. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it was a bit preaching and belligerent in tone. Overall, I was disappointed, but I will go again to see the same excitement on the face of my child. <br /> <br /> I liked Lumpy's laughter ....
