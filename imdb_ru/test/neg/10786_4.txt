Jeremy Irons and Forrest Whitaker are good actors. But this film was poorly written. First, during the hijacking scene, Irons is sitting too comfortably in his chair ... he seems to READ something, and pretty calm too! Perhaps the director shot the actor between takes? In addition, the hijacking violence was a big disappointment. Slowly, the bullets fly - the way his wife and daughter are killed is simply not interesting, and the tension is lost. His grief later spent another 10 minutes. Then he decided to "take revenge" and talk to all his friends and ambassadors from the industry journalist (he is a journalist for the stifling rag "The Economist"), and now they really give him advice on where to find the bad guys! How do they know? But what really made me turn off the movie halfway is that Irons finds his way to the warehouse where the villains hang out - BUT NOT FUTURE THAT KILLED HIS WIFE - and still blows them away. so he's just a killer. he leaves and, well ... I turned it off. I mean, I could not understand how his friends knew something, and also I thought that he was after the two remaining imprisoned guys who were the original hijackers. Instead, he pursues his friends, I think, or anyone who hangs out in warehouses and leaves automatic weapons lying around. The wait was just completely normal, and the dialogue was unconvincing ("everything is all right, son, crying, helps," he says to his son. The son says: "No, this is not so," and the father says: "You're right ... it's not like that. ‚Äù") Irons plays dubious roles - like that dragon film he made. He was excellent in Return to Brideshead, which is a completely different animal than this warm thriller.
