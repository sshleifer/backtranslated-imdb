Some describe CALIGULIA as the “most” scandalous film of its era. Although this is controversial, it is certainly one of the most embarrassing: almost every big name associated with the film made an attempt to distance itself from it. Author Gore Vidal actually sued (with mixed results) to remove his name from the film, and when the stars saw the film, their reactions ranged from loudly disgusted to strategic silence. Of course, they wanted him to leave. <br /> <br /> For a while it seemed that it was possible. CALIGULA was the main box office and a critical failure (producer Guccione was forced to rent cinemas to show it at all), and although the film was released on the VHS for the domestic market, there were so many questions about censorship that it was re-edited and the edited version was the only one widely available for more than a decade. But now CALIGULIA is on DVD, which is available in both the edited version of the "R" and the original version of the "Unrated" And, no doubt, John Gilgud is glad that he did not live to see this happen. <br /> <br /> The only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say that something like DEEP MOUNTAIN meets David Lynch's DUN when Fellini is off. The Vidal script fell into the hands of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, who used Vidal's reputation to fund the project and attract the big stars to the name - and then threw out most of Vidal’s script and brought in soft porn by director Tinto Brass. Then, when Guccione felt that the work of Brass was not clear enough, he and Giancarlo Louis slowly photographed hardcore material. <br /> <br /> Viewers watching the edited version may wonder what all the noise is about, but those who watch the original cut will quickly realize that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. There are a huge number of naked people, and it remains in the edited version, but the original comes with XXX scenes: very obvious gay, lesbian and direct sex, weird sex and a grandiose orgy with dancing abandoned Roman guards. in a good measure. The film is also incredibly brutal and bloody, with rape, torture and mutilation. In one particularly disturbing scene, a man slowly slaughters, a woman urinates on his dead body, and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs. <br /> <br /> In a documentary film accompanying the DVD release, Guccione states that he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome. If so, then he missed the mark. We know very little about Caligula - and what we know is doubtful at best. In addition, orgies and casual sex were not commonplace in Roman society, where adultery was a crime punishable by death. And, of course, ancient Rome NEVER looked like strange, slightly oriental, strange-cosmic scenery and costumes offered by designers. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, these sets and costumes are often fantastically beautiful, and although cinematography is common, at least it makes them fair; The rating is also very, very good. The most successful cast member is Helen Mirren, who manages to engage our interests and sympathies as Empress Caesonia; Gilgud and O'Toole also run away in fairly good shape. The same cannot be said about McDowell, but, in his opinion, he has nothing to work with. <br /> <br /> The film has a dark charm, but in the end it is an oddity, more interesting to him. design and weirdness than for content. Some of the bodies on display (including McDowell and Mirren) are extremely beautiful, and some sex scenes work very well, like pornography ... but again, some of them are so unpleasant they can reduce you to abstinence, and the bloody and grotesque nature the film undermines his eroticism. If you are ready, it’s worth seeing once, but most likely it will be enough. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
