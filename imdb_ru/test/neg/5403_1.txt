As a useful warning to others, I believe that Skeleton is actually worse than Raptor Island. I used RI as an example of the worst original film featured on a science fiction channel, but SM is the funniest and most incoherent movie I've ever seen. Yes, I watched almost all of this by entering it after about 35 minutes. He attracted me with his sheer incompetence. What was science fiction thinking about? As soon as Skeleton and the surviving platoon commander (or whoever he was, I donâ€™t understand the terminology of the military unit) reached the chemical plant, the film turned into an impossible nonsense zone that almost bewitched. I had the same idea as another viewer, who wondered if more than one film had been edited to create one horrible whole.
