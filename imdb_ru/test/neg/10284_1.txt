I am not disturbed by slovenly owners, and I am not disturbed by the cynical, self-satisfied position that the creators of this shit take. <br /> <br /> What worries me is that the vast majority of episodes are fake. I would not even be surprised if ALL the episodes were delivered. Consequently, this is not a reality show, but something much worse than Oprah: a trash TV with a zero comma, zero appeal. As well as a daily television soap opera, but with a large number of actions, fights and less plot. <br /> <br /> The premise would be magnificent - if it were performed without deceiving the viewer. If only this idea were free from all legal complications / attributes that would most likely arise from what happens to real people and what will eventually be aired. Consequently, the only way to create this reality reality show is to get fairly desperate actors and make them improvise (and what a wretched and unconvincing improvisation is most of the time!). Shouldn't it be obvious to those who graduated from primary school? Most of the reviews I read here do not even mention that all this is fake, not to mention that all this can be. Wishful thinking or just limitless naivety? <br /> <br /> The actors hired in this pathetic show are those unemployed actors who are waiting with horror on the tables, looking forward to calling from a talk show (or this shit) when they finally get a chance to make money a few hundred dollars. I even recognized one actress (in the role of a “fraudster”) who I saw many years ago in The Jerry Springer Show. And I saw only 6-7 episodes of the Scam. How many more such unlucky actors have appeared in Springer and “Scammers” that I don’t even know about? <br /> <br /> However, comparing “Scammers” with Springer is unfair to the latter. The Springer Show is not all fake; most of the episodes are uninstalled - so often very interesting. There is no value in “Scammers” if you are not struggling with an actor and do not want advice on how to NOT act in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers use different (very cheap Transparent tricks to create the illusion of reality, to give their frames an elusive documentary look. But it's all in the spirit. In the end, the smarter spectator who is looking for a train wreck remains absolutely squat “Professional wrestling” deserves more confidence than this.
