It’s unbelievable to me that the cartoon embodied by Walt Disney in the 1940s remains the best incarnation of this amazing story, but it’s true. Here, another clumsy attempt to confuse confuses and repels viewers with remarkable efficiency, while at the same time successfully counteracting those of us who actually read the story. Irving's original work is short on any indicators, and making a full-length film is sure to become a problem. You can either completely rewrite the story a la Tim Burton, which is being discussed another time, or supplement the bust line of the old girl with unintended details. The last is that what is being undertaken here, and, if I may say so, is so sad. Incredible and completely modern new facets of characters, such as religious fanaticism in Zhuravle or a passion for traveling in good old Bram Bones, destroy the plot and betray a serious lack of talent by directors. By the time the famous story approached, I had completely lost interest. This is a movie in which you expect to see a smoking scene in the background.
