Step Up is an honest dance film about some children who have a big break from work. The film is average in all respects, and a bit more for the viewer. Jock struggles with external prejudices to become a dancer with an experienced partner and teacher who sees something special. The game was good, but dialogue and direction could add little to overcoming a predictable story. However, you still feel pretty good about the results of the film. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers who were a little overboard. This is a B + class movie with moderate continuity errors and dialogue failures. The scenery was good, and the heroes were true to life. Worth seeing if you like such a movie.
