This is supposed to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The cast is an international, Australian, pretending to be British, stage American and a character with an English name with an unrecognizable European accent. What a tolerable effort in action from this motley team is completely undermined by the plot and the scenario of particular folly. So short were the budget budgets of this film, and the total production figures are so low that it would be no problem to win the cinematographic competition. For the past twenty or so years, we have seen horror films and thrillers of “stalk'n slash” of extraordinary (though not necessarily “high”) quality that were made without any budget at all. Recent examples include the poorly made, but absolutely terrible “Project Blair Witch” and, of course, the most recent of them - this low-budget winner, SAW, with almost unknown leaders (Gary Elvis is just one you do not remember have seen it before). DARKHUNTERS is shocked by the fact that the famous actor, Dominic Pinon and Hollywood - Jeff Feyi, valiantly fights to save the film. It is a shame to see the once beautiful lead man (Fahi) in banal makeup, which pronounces strangely bad lines. I would rate this movie 0 out of 10 if it were possible!
