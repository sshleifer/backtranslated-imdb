The film is good, well depicted, but not original ... <br /> <br /> This film is directly copied from the movie “Bitch”, where Salman plays like a date with a doctor, like Will Smith, and Govinda like some kind of fat the moron Who desperately tries to fall in love with his boss by the end, the film comes to the old Indian style of Flimi, the father of the bride does not love the bride's lover and gets another groom, and the bride's lover Govinda comes at the end and saves her from the new bridegroom and fashion dance and so on. <br /> <br /> the comedy was really good, no doubt, when the hitch meets Hindi, it would be more ridiculous .... <br /> <br /> In the end, it’s worth watching, but when it appears on television after a few months ...
