Mr. Seagal has noticeably lowered his (already low) standards and has now surpassed himself in making bad films. A foreigner makes no sense in this scenario. His director did an even worse job, and the music and the score are so raw and inappropriate that you just don't know whether to laugh or cry. Already 10 minutes of the movie, you just want to turn it off. However, considering the past Steven Seagal films, you think: “Hey, maybe there are some cool action movies that are at least worth seeing ...” ... you are WRONG! It only gets worse as the movie progresses. Everyone (with some exceptions) seems to kill every person he speaks with, good or bad, innocent or not. The only good thing about a movie is that it has an end, and that it has a fairly short time. To sum up the film in two words: STAY!
