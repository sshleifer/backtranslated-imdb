Yes, I bought camp blood, and it spent about 86 minutes of my life and 5 pounds of my money for this shit, I mean, I did not expect an amazing film, judging by the cover, I did not expect anything great except at least no boobs in the first 3 seconds (i'm not complaining about boobs ..) i'm complaining that, what the hell does this have to do with anything? this film should have been kept on hand, like at home, jokingly ... they suck ... why was the blood more brown and poop like real blood? ... cheaply I say, I mean, that everyone wasnâ€™t the color they were just painted yellow. And one more thing that made me die of laughter over this sad excuse of the film was that they tried to pretend all the time that the clown was a woman, although it was clearly a black-haired man with a flat chest. ... someone else noticed that the only particular effect in this film was the slow jump ... which was also weak, and the dissolving effect that you can find in many basic PC programs, such as ... powerpoint .. .. this film is blowing
