I rarely turned off the film after the first 10 minutes, but this is what I did with it. It struck me that it was so obvious that the sole purpose of this film was to show as many skins as possible of as many actresses B as possible, and nothing else really matters. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong; I like beautiful actresses and sex scenes, and films about sexual activity have their own merits scale, but this director doesnâ€™t do anything else. <br /> <br /> For example, let's take the scene where there are two policemen (of course, one guy is one Gal and of course, between them there is this whole supposedly witty banter), standing over the first dead body. The camera moves between them along each line (there is more than one width of the screen between them!), And you end up wondering if you are ill with this disease or ignorant dialogue. <br /> <br /> Well, it CAN become better after the first 10 minutes, but I would not know. I turned down the sucker and found something better for me.
