This movie may be good. if not for the whole language in it. I think that the storyline itself is not bad, but I would be too embarrassed to let my wife or children watch the movie. I know that children will eventually learn all the swear words, this is true, but parents should not help them in this, allowing them to see and hear these things in the guise of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I used to like Robert Loggia very much; with his coarse voice, he has a characteristic coarse quality, but in the last few years I have only seen roles with a lot of language. If we had a reward for using the word F excessively, he would have to be a contender. Unfortunately, I think he has now lost me as a fan. When in the future I see his name in the films, I will think twice about picking it up. <br /> <br /> Listen, I'm not a prude. Sometimes I also use language in extreme circumstances, but when we watch a movie, it is for the sake of E N E E R T what is happening on the streets of any big city these days, and I can't wait to ask myself if I can watch a movie for my family. <br /> <br /> I also like Matt Modine, but it’s a pity that he associated himself with the picture that had so summed up his image. He probably did well. work in the cinema, but I turned off about a quarter of the way after others in the film crew were too often attacked by my ears. Why can't these actors just say no when they are asked to continue this gutter language in these scenarios? As soon as the actors (especially the big names) make a fuss, the writers will stop showing this in the movies! <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I can not recommend this picture. It’s a pity, because I think that everything would be fine if it was done well enough for decent families to watch! Thank God, I spent on it only 2 dollars!
