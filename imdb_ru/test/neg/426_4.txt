Jeff Speakman never went beyond the lower ranks of martial arts masters who became actors (for example, lower than the "dragon" Wilson Don), and with cars such as "Expert", you can understand why. There are three main problems in this film: 1) The plot - or, I would say, the plot - everywhere, there are some characters who get a lot of screen time but serve small purposes, 2) There are only 4 battle scenes. in general, some of them are completely unrelated to the main plot, and some occur in the dark. 3) The music is too hard and domineering. Strangely enough, this is really the most annoying thing in this film: the score constantly tries to convince you that you are watching some kind of grandiose epic, and not a low-budget film with limited action, which you really watch. With that said, at least around James Brolin, to instill confidence. * 1/2 of 4.
