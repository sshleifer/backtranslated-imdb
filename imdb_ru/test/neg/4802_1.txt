I got this little piece on the VideoAsia DVD label "Tales of Voodoo". I don't know where voodoo exactly fits. Indeed, I would not in any case associate Voodoo with Indonesia (not to mention WIP). <br /> <br /> I know and love WIP movies. I have seen most of them. Therefore, I could not resist this little-known gem from the description given to him on the cover. <br /> <br /> This is HORRIBLE. You cannot have a WIP movie if women wear clothes (even in the shower!). Although it gives tribute to the genre of exploitation, WIP without nudity is like Big Mac without beef. <br /> <br /> As my physical education teacher used to say, I would prefer to be at the disco ....
