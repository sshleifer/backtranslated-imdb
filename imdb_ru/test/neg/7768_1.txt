Awful, petty, materialistic nonsense. How can women (and gay men?) Enjoy this nonsense, outside of me. No self-respecting person will ever want to be with one of these neurotic gold prospectors. What is even more disturbing is that many reviewers say that they are related to women on the show. If this is the future of women, Lord, help us all. Demonstrating your independence and being respected on a par with men should not mean that every three seconds you have to spread your legs to another person. I think it humiliates women and does not make them fair. But this review does not rant against women. Fans of this show say that it is “fun” and “rebellious”, but every time I watched this show, I just tried my best not to sleep. Despite the narrative of the female reporter, none of the performances of this show even have anything close to what could be considered a rational thought. So it is not entertaining and not informative, so why do you need to look? One of ten stars.
