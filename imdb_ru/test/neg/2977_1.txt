Despite the fact that lately I tried to avoid German films, positive feedback made me shoot this film. There, I am again deceived by the German media, which again and again promotes home movies. For me, it is not surprising that no one abroad wants to see this nonsense. The idea to make this film is not an idea at all (probably, some fool read an article in a women's magazine about a speed date). In short: the characters (which are not), the dialogues and content are so amazingly trivial, banal and cliche, I continued to look, because I could hardly believe what I saw. By the way, it would be simply wrong to call flat theses mechanically posed by figures (of course, from the above-mentioned journals). Acting so exorbitantly, I cannot remember worse than on the screen for a long time. You have to guess that the director did not have / has no clue. Surprisingly, distributors and producers across the country are still wondering why German films (with rare exceptions) are of no interest around the world. What for? Because it is a waste of time and money.
