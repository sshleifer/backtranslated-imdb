We all need to start somewhere, in films like “Escape in the Fog”, someone like Budd Bettihera could learn his profession before releasing good films. In fact, the film was dated before it was released on June 25, 1945. <br /> <br /> The war with Europe ended almost two months, of course, even Harry Cohn could not control the events of the story. So I wonder why, even then, the public did not wonder why the Nazi espionage ring helped the Japanese. Another very serious historical inaccuracy was that the FBI had nothing to do with the Pacific or Asian theater. Cloak and dagger material was the territory of the OSS in this part of the world. <br /> <br /> When you're an FBI man like William Wright, it would be nice to have a psychic girlfriend like Nina Foch. He is going to go on a mission to the East to report the names of key underground leaders in order to start a general uprising in China against the Japanese occupation. The Germans, who were in charge of Otto Kruger’s home, will find out about this, and the whole film is being played with these guys who have already lost the war, trying to help their allies. Who, by the way, they call "Japs." When Foch is confused by an accelerated machine and is knocked unconscious, she dreams of Wright’s danger and sees what should happen to him on the Golden Gate Bridge. She goes there and breaks the plot. <br /> <br /> Here you have everything you expect from a good film noir: the misty atmosphere of San Francisco, the dimly lit scenery, Budd Boettcher tried his best, like the actors. But they were simply not convincing, probably because they themselves did not believe this clap. <br /> <br /> It is possible, but unlikely, that Nina Foch’s dream and her mental effects could have been more developed, and the events were left on the floor of the cutting room. I think it was just a lousy script. <br /> <br /> Here, Budd and Harry Cohn in Columbia Pictures had a quick history story.
