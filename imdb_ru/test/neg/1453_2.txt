This is a very strange product from Hollywood. Obviously, this did not work out well, because the actors, who have the shots in the credits, were completely edited from the film, which means that it was a hasty job. It seems that he was pulled out of the hands of the usually competent Demme and simply thrown away. On the other hand, this is so lacking in the substance that, perhaps, nothing could save him. He has no real center, neither narrative nor temporary. Despite the fact that the playing time is 92 minutes, I remember that it ends abruptly, about 80 minutes. It's over before everything starts. This is pretty much no laughing. <br /> <br /> The merits of “Matthew Modin’s paintings” were as elusive as those of Luke Wilson.
