With all the potential for a good film in its magnificent conditions, the cast and cinematography, the dim script of this film, the lead tempo and the wooden performances produced only great disappointment. With decent production, editing and music, it could be a good film, perhaps the dark version of Blake Edward's “10” instead of the crying version of Ron Howard's Splash.
