Any chance of seeing Katherine Hepburn in something I didn’t see, or in her early film career, is a pleasure, and at this level the movie is fun, but she is terribly mistaken like Hill Billy. Her famous dictum in New England slips, making phrases like “I'd rather be joking about Whittle,” quite ridiculous. Is she so beautiful and so young ?? it almost overcomes this major flaw. The story is an old-fashioned melodrama, and so the younger generation might think that this is pretty trite, but it was the main product of American Entertainment in the 1940s. He has his moments, but you may need a movie buff to appreciate it.
