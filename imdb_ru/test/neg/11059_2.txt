Audio: <br /> <br /> Seriously, I have never seen a movie with the worst sound. There are scenes when people walk on the grass and you can barely hear them in their footsteps. They must be walking on their legs. <br /> <br /> You know how in some films they forget the line, so they have to duplicate it on a picture of the back of someone's head. Here, the editors were not so smart. In fact, there is a scene in which the character Shannon Tweed utters his phrase, not at all moving his lips! <br /> <br /> I am pretty sure that due to their background sound, they reproduced effect loops during shooting, because in many scenes the sound effects will either be different or be absent when the camera changes view. <br /> <br /> I could write a lot more about how bad the sound is in this movie. <br /> <br /> Other nuggets: <br /> <br /> In this film, they probably consider the opening credits as special effects because they seemed so difficult to produce. The main title and the first few names in the opening credits are written in white text on a white sky, and they sway as if they were carefully painted by hand on each frame. <br /> <br /> Re-use of additional materials in this film is incredible. There are about 15 rebels in the cast, and yet in any given battle, thirty or more of them will be killed. If only the film was high enough to distinguish which ones died again and again. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to note that insurgents usually die from explosions that are always at a distance of 30 to 200 feet. There is one scene, one scene where some of the rebels run out of their huts at the base of the rebels, and one of the huts trembles as the rebel leaves the door. It makes you wonder if the hut is long enough to meet the inevitable explosion. <br /> <br /> There is a blue helicopter that looks as formidable as a pair of running shorts, but somehow is provided with an endless rocket supply. When they show that rockets are fired from the missile compartments of a helicopter, they often shoot in unpredictable directions, very much like big bottle-rockets. They still manage to easily hit their targets, which, as noted above, are always at a very safe distance from the rebels they kill. Pay attention to the recycled material of the pilot who pressed the LIVE button to launch the rocket (since it is printed vertically, the first few times we saw it, we read it as the EVIL button). <br /> <br /> Notice how the grenade launcher they use produces explosions identical to those created by rocket helicopters. In many scenes, itâ€™s also funny how the foreground actor shoots in a completely different direction than the group of enemy soldiers he kills. And often the characters release a disproportionate amount of bullets to dead soldiers (for example, when short shooting kills a large group of enemies). <br /> <br /> Yes, this film is very, very, very bad. The plot was thought out almost the same way as a 5-year-old's football game, and editing is the worst I've ever seen. But, to be honest, sometimes have fun 90 minutes, laughing at a group of adults who sincerely participated in such a terrible film.
