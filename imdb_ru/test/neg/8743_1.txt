Boy Oh Boy, this film stinks. This film is one of the worst bits of garbage I've ever seen in my whole life. Please, even if your life depends on it, NOT, and I repeat: NOT under any circumstances, look at this terrible piece of garbage. Watch this thing only in the MST 3000 episode. It was the only way I could get through it all. If I had to watch it without this show, I would stop watching it before it ends. He has one use: a cure for insomnia !!!!!
