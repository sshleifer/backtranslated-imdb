This film was so terrible, so boring, terribly erroneous - it took a lot of work to turn what was supposed to be true into such a parody. I love Lucille Ball, but she is absolutely stinking in this film. Too old, could not sing, sounded like a truck dropping gravel, even when NOT singing - and the biggest sin of all - SHE WASN'T A FUNNY. EVEN A LITTLE. The studio shot itself in step with this, and in order to destroy what was supposed to be an incredible on-screen version of a fairy-tale musical, some other parts of the body deserve to be wounded too - or perhaps they already lacked these parts. This may explain it. But for Lucy to think that she was right for the part that required Singing - well, this is the saddest thing of all. Very well know your limitations. Even the legend can not get out of such a vile and smell like a rose.
