Now we know where they got the idea about the snakes on the plane. To put it bluntly, don't pay to watch this movie. If you really want to spend 90 minutes of your life, either catch it in action by cable, or get a free choice from NetFlix or Blockbuster. Do not pay to rent it. If you pay for it, then you are one stupid person. The game was terrible, the plot was terrible, everything was terrible, except for snakes. Whether they were real or generated CGI, they looked pretty good. But as they say, yet this film must be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Even the naked dance scene was pretty bad that I actually went through it quickly. I did not sit, I did not warn you.
