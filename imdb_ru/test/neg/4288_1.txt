A terrible psychological thriller, which almost hurt to look, every aspect is terrible. <br /> <br /> The combined talents of leading actors Kevin Bacon and Gary Oldman are completely useless, and although they provide good performances, the question arises why they were disturbed. The script from Mark Caddan is a mess, and Martin Campbell has a story jumping around, but if you can't follow him, accept it as a blessing. Too many senseless, crazy scenes that just don't make sense. Jerry Goldsmith's music also doesn't help much. <br /> <br /> Even if there was a potential in the plot, the director Campbellâ€™s approach completely destroyed it. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Monday, February 26, 1996 - Video
