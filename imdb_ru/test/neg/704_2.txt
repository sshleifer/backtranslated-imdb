I never want to watch this movie again! <br /> <br /> Not only is he terribly bad, but I can't see how my hero Stan Laurel looks so old and sick. I hate to watch this horrible movie! <br /> <br /> Honestly, there is no reason to watch this horrible movie. The plot is just stupid. The actors who surround Laurel Wall and Oliver Hardy are really very bad, and Laurel and Hardy were funnier in any of their early films! <br /> <br /> I’m warning you don’t watch this, images will haunt you for a long time!
