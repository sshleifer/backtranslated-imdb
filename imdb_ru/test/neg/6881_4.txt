In general, it was a watchable movie. I didn’t stop him and didn’t stop him to come back to him - a clear sign of a boring movie - so he passed the first test. Best of all, he quickly went down in history, a boring unnecessary story for characters. <br /> <br /> He will never pass for a great movie. Neither is it a great movie B. I would recommend this movie to lovers of slasher / horror who do not object directly to the video releases. <br /> <br /> Unlike some of these films, there are no nudes, only moderate language and rather muffled blood. Although there is violence. Deaths were pretty dry and sad. Computer special effects were actually pretty good. The way the creature ran its chains in some scenes reminded me of Spawn and the Ghost Rider comics. <br /> <br /> A small pet corn ... She is in Lucini, but no one seems to speak with any accent. I had to look at the loans in order to even understand that it was filmed in Lousinia. <br /> <br /> As with most low-budget films, there are some stupid things on the set. Lack of time and money would be a major factor for stupidities. For example, in one scene from noon to black in seconds ... during a short car ride. Another example was an understudy for a “creature” who had no make-up of a “creature” when falling from a tow truck ... it also looks like he wears a shirt on stage. <br /> <br /> In general, I did not hate this film, but I didn’t like it either. I probably will never rent it again, but if a buddy had it, I can watch it again in a few years.
