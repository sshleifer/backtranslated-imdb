If you see this movie in TV lists, just ignore it. If you're looking for something scary, you'd better watch the X-Files replays. <br /> <br /> Previous comments that refer to the incredibly bad behavior of a female hero are dead. She is almost invisible. In general, its range includes “tearful and scared” and “tearful and not scared”. <br /> <br /> I’m a movie buff who likes a good “bad” movie. But this is ridiculous. There is no direction. The plot is as simplified as the set of numbers that they continue to throw at you, and is very similar to this set of numbers, in the end it does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Your time will be better spent if you turn on the TV and give your dog a bath.
