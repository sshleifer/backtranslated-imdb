This is the third film in a month that I watched, and it did not go as I expected. The first two are "Black Dahlia" and "Hollywood", none of which gave any new ideas about who committed the crimes. <br /> <br /> I was always fascinated by UFOs and was so excited to see a new film about the UFO investigation, which was not a comedy. But after about 30 minutes everything went horribly wrong. <br /> <br /> I could play for acting, camera angles, stereotypes, if there was a good story about chasing UFOs, but there is nothing here. I'm not saying that there was something wrong with the subject, but Netflix put forward this film as a UFO skeptic and a UFO supporter investigating several sessions. <br /> <br /> I stopped looking about halfway through. Can't believe I spent so much time with this. Please do not make the same mistake as me.
