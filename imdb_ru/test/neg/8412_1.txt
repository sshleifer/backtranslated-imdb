I usually strive to find good in movies, even bad ones. Unfortunately, in this film I fail - and the fact that there is only one positive review on this board shows that many IMDb reviewers share my pain. <br /> <br /> I usually donâ€™t watch sequels, but I just needed to see it, since I really like "Baby Rosemary's Baby". What a mistake it was. This simply confirms my belief that most of the sequels are lousy, although, fortunately, very few are as bad as this one. In fact, in my opinion, this is not even a sequel, but a satire about how bad a sequel can be. The film is highly recommended not to be watched - at any time.
