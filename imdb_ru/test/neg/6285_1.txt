The perfect 6-step recipe for the boring middle of the road movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Take one burned down policeman with a bad attitude, but at the same time a sensitive touch (closed concert pianist with a domestic cat); <br /> <br /> 2. Add some cool retro gadgets such as a beaten-up Porsche 356, a roar of a bicycle, a leather jacket with strong patches and a pair of cowboy boots with holes in the sole; <br /> <br /> 3. Mix in several places of "free spirit", for example, fashionable apartments on the beach and a separate dining room for the office; <br /> <br /> 4. Spice it up with “deep” socially romantic themes such as post-divorce, traumatized, but finally remarriage, ex-wife secretly admiring and therefore forgiving, waitress, a couple of ex fellow cops — only because of someone — really — a complete moron and best friend who gets frozen over a suitcase full of illegal immigrants — $$$; <br /> <br /> 5. Allow it to boil for about 90 minutes at a “fast pace”, although not necessarily a logical or internally consistent sequence of mediocre action scenes, cheap tender moments and flabby wise cracks; <br /> <br /> 6. Serve with a comfortable pillow to sleep right through it all or with something more interesting (don't worry: even the yellow pages will do!).
