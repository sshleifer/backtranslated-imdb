This film is a gay love story disguised as a story about graffiti and friendship. Not ONE review described this film as a gay novel, and that is the weight of the plot. I don’t know if it should have deceived people who otherwise wouldn’t be interested in coming to terms with it, expecting the film to be what it was on the market ... The film has no relation to the graffiti culture, abuses and denigrates the culture of graffiti, the action is terrible. Oh yes, graffiti sucks too. This film was a clever way to hide the agenda by portraying young boys becoming gay. Just look at the other films in which the director participated, they all have the same theme. Bored, damn it, not what I expected.
