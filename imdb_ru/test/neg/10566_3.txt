The awkward alien animal struck the Earth and soon destroyed the masses, first using his laser gun to dissolve almost every person he threw into the eyes (that is, when his goal is not very terrible) and which he loves to pluck and eat the human spleen! <br /> <br /> In general, everything is pretty stupid. I have to give him a few points for being fun at times. I really enjoyed the senseless battle with the ray gun at the beginning and some of the later blood effects. However, this does not help when the monster provides only really interesting moments of the film, and it is not on the screen most of the time the movie is shown. The behavior in all this is just awful and amateurish, and our main character Sheriff Sinder is too unattractive to interfere with the hottest chick of the movie. I also have to take off my points for having brazenly copied “A THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD” (1951) several times. When a monster is not furious, NIGHTBEAST is too dull, and in the end its attacks become so repetitive and predictable, even if they become less cheerful. Look at it one by one from 1951 THING and find out the difference between the characteristics, the attention to the plot and the details, as well as to the creation of an unknown character for the monster in the free film.
