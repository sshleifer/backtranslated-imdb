In this boring film, there is little laughter, and I cannot help but wonder how this mess arose at all. The only good thing about this film is Griffin Dunn’s talent, but his best efforts were easily overshadowed by Madonna’s abominable play. I was able to come to terms with this, not missing TOO TOO, but this is perhaps the most pleasant thing I can say about this waste of time.
