Well, for starters, this film was not at all like a book. I read the book when I was 13 years old, and since then it has always been my favorite. When I wait for the release of another book, this is the book that I am turning to to fill the time. I have 3 copies for God's sake. In any case, I knew that it would not be like a book, but come on! They could do a little better than that. I mean seriously, if I wanted to see an American werewolf in Paris or London, than I would watch these films. They took a perfectly good story and turned it into a copy of the story, which was told again and again, and, frankly, I was tired of watching it. I mean hello the best part of this whole story (sorry), she ends up with Gabriel. He does not die. What is it about? And he is old in this film. It is assumed that Gabriel is only 24, not 44 yes ** this. Awww And Astrid, whom he ** put forward, - Astrid - Aunt Vivian, no, no, no. Astrid and Vivian hate each other. Awwwww In any case, yes, it was my little rant. Hope this helped.
