This is a really awesome bad movie, but it is a rare kind of evil that is endlessly, amazingly interesting! I want to add to other comments on this movie. <br /> <br /> A “rock band” on an airplane looks like three skinny drunkards from everyday work in bad wigs. <br /> <br /> Watch out for the serious problem of continuity with the stuffed baby tiger: it turns into a lion, a leopard and back; It is dirty or clean depending on the shot. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER! Stuffed tiger turns into a real animal to save a child (and authors)! <br /> <br /> Kind of little Jimmy, floating on an Amazon in a coffin, squeezing his stuffed tiger and yelling, your memory will forever remain. <br /> <br /> Listen to one of the most inept sound effects: at the end of the story, when the priest goes in search of Jimmy, the guide asks for a monastic robe as payment - the priest drops to one knee deep “Ringing” of the church bell, and “ringing” the bells from the boxing match! <br /> <br /> This is an absolute scream to watch.
