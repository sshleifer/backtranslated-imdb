The story of the majority of how a teenager rebelled against the church and her servant father in a small Norwegian village. The countryside is picturesque, but the story is rather pretentious and delicate, most of the film is about quoting the scriptures. Itâ€™s like watching a religious propaganda film. Theisen, who shot only one other film, is quite good in the role of a sensitive young hero, as well as Sandquist in the role of her strict father and Riise in the role of a woman whom Teissen is fascinated. The film aims to be fresh and charming, but it feels rather stale and tired. The director and co-author of the film Nesheim, who worked mainly on television, does not cope with this task.
