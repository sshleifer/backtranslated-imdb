It's a shame that the infamous character of Sir Le Patterson, Barry Humphreys, made his debut in this film under a spy / comedy film. <br /> <br /> This film reminded me of Beatty / Hoffman, Ishtar (1987). Humphreys should have learned from the mistakes made by the film - if you are going to change the concept, do not use spies! Like Ishtar, the first 20 minutes or so make a promise of something else. It would be great to see the anachronistic and boorish Patterson wandering the world of Australian politics. One of the characters even points out that Patterson was aware of the current times - you might think that Khamfir could have a field day when he commented on the Hawk government (I can just imagine the scene with Patterson and Hawke at an alcohol contest . But instead of a movie that could be clever and even bite our eyes on this world, we make Patterson run all over the world in the role of James Bond trying to save the world from biochemical weapons, which runs out to the middle of the road. <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
