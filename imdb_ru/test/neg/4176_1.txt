This film was terrible ... It had nothing to do with Dark Harvest. And the DVD was very misleading, because it had a scarecrow and a braid, none of which appeared in this film. <br /> <br /> In the beginning there were a lot of random scenes, most of which had nothing to do with the film, except that they seem to show that the person is psychic ... but not too well ... /> <br /> After the first 10 minutes of the film, there is an hour during which a person searches only for a character. for his daughters. This becomes vaguely interesting when the daughters meet two girls who died a year earlier. But that's all. <br /> <br /> And why, may I ask, did this movie get an R rating? There were two drops of blood and 4 curses. And how did he get in the video store ?? This film was poorly filmed, poorly filmed, poorly written and generally horrible.
