Derek Jarman shows us again and again that dialogue is not his strength. He is an artist, and he draws. His films are almost always visually gorgeous, but about as exciting as dry paint. Watch his movies in fast forward mode - really fast tuning, which you can only get on DVD. In The Tempest, Jarman does very little with the script or characters, using them as a simple grid to hang a very long and well-constructed cinematic frame. He even goes so far as to contradict the original script of Shakespeare in order to achieve these painfully slow and lifeless scenes. There is no romance, no magic, no tricks, no urgency, which the script calls for, no small spontaneity, and Caliban's character, in particular, does not boil down to anxious and insane in some way idiot, like Edward II by German . It is a pity that this is the only available version of the movie "The Tempest".
