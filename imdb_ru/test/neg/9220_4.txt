POSSIBLE LITTLE SPOILER <br /> <br /> This is not a very objective review, but I found this film terribly depressing. Like most of the work of Russell T. Davis, he asks more questions than he can answer. His best work (Bob and Rose, Doctor Who) revels in hope against chance and perseverance even after an obvious defeat. These uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here. I suppose that the fact that I still think about it a few days after viewing indicates the quality of the program, but the resolution was too gloomy for my tastes. <br /> <br /> However, I disagree with the reviews I read, complaining that the end seems to be “hooked”. I think that every conclusion follows logically from his premise, and the ending was a sensible personal conviction that neatly decided the main theme of the show. Although I never questioned the course of events, I felt that much could be expanded. I also read that initially it was a series of four parts instead of two, and it is quite possible that the truncation did some harm to the completed part. However, these flaws appear everywhere, in episodes and themes that sometimes appear coarse or in general terms. <br /> <br /> To his credit, Davis is not at all afraid of writing big ones, and you should admire the sheer courage and scale of the project. The premise that he decides here is the material of films or novels ?? This is a bold and ambitious thing to do this in the environment of television. Strengths include Christopher Eccleston, who is clearly mesmeric leader. For me, he was and remains the best reason to watch. The image of the genius of the Messiah was brilliant, compelling to think and attract, and real respect both for the writings of Davis and for the actions of Eccleston. I also thought that the description of the reaction of the modern world to the second coming sounds true. <br /> <br /> Two stars simply because I personally want my entertainment to be exciting. I would prefer to be inspired or, at least, distracted by my invention. I have a whole big real world around me ?? as filtered through CNN or newspapers - if I choose a terrible depression. There are definitely less subjective reasons for judging this work, but I am afraid that my judgment on this issue is clouded by my emotional reaction.
