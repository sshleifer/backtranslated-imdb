It could be a great film with great educational potential for teachers around the world about evolution, biology, creativity in science, research, and Darwin’s life, but it’s not. <br /> <br /> The script is basically historically inaccurate and turns the true story into a Mexican melodrama from the soup opera. Although it is true that Darwin gradually lost his religious convictions, this was largely due to his findings during the Beagle's voyage, and not just because of the loss of his daughter. He was, of course, concerned about his loss, but this did not make him literally insane, delusional, and alienated from his friends and family. This image of Darwin is the invention of the screenwriter. Thus, it can in no way be used as a place to learn a little about Darwin’s life and psyche. According to most historians, by the end of the Beagle journey, Darwin had prepared the theory and did not allow it to be made public, because he wanted to further develop its consequences and check more data. The film deals with Darwin’s imaginary conflict with his religious beliefs and mental illness, which he developed after his daughter’s death, which prevented him from becoming public. <br /> <br /> The film presents the current situation, creationists Argue against scientists about the life and times of Darwin, so this is an anachronism. He portrays Thomas Huxley not as a person who is trying to develop a further understanding of biology, but as a person seeking to “kill God”, in his own words from the film, and destroy the church, which would adopt evolution theory for such purposes, and not because it was a synthesis a large amount of unrelated data. Huxley is presented as a very arrogant and insensitive person, a combination that I interpret was an attempt to ridicule active atheists opposing religion. In real life, Huxley accepted Darwin’s ideas after publication only gradually, and before Darwin’s work, he thought that there was not enough evidence to support evolution. His first support for evolution was published a month after the Origin of Species became publicly available. He was an agnostic, but did not think it was necessary to "kill God", but only thought that there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural. The creationist vs. scientists discussion appears throughout the entire film, and phrases such as “This is just a theory” are part of the discussion. Of course, at that time there were no such disputes or phrases. In fact, the Anglican Church published a positive review of the statement “Origin” that they saw God's work in evolution, in a certain sense, completely contrary to the way the clergy are portrayed in the script. <br /> <br /> Another horrible aspect of this film is that it creates the wrong impression for the general public, that the research is conducted by a lonely madman who simply writes a lot. Nothing could be further from the truth. The concept of the theory of evolution was the result of Darwin’s careful observation of living forms over the course of five years on the Beagle HMS and developed gradually, as can be seen from Darwin’s travel notes. Despite the fact that Beagle's journey was the single most important part of Darwin's life for the concept of “Origin of Species”, the beginning briefly mentioned the journey only once, and no attempt is made to show that the book has become a detailed analysis. observations. To make matters worse, Darwin, as shown, performs one experiment (breeding pigeons) to test his theory and, eventually, throws it. And I'm not quite sure whether such an experiment really took place. <br /> <br /> Great disappointment. This is in no way a tribute to Darwin and science.
