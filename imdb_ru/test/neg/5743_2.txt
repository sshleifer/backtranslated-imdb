This is a relatively watchable movie (+1). After viewing the UKM: Ultimate Killing Machine, this looks good for comparison. There are no obvious technical mistakes, although vampire teeth look weird. <br /> <br /> Storyline does not make sense. We'll see. American soldier fighting vampires. Returns to the states and rehabilitated to see ... vampires. His commander is his ex-wife's aunt. Who does biodiversity research in the South American region, where are the vampires? Ha! Do not accumulate too many matches. Who cares about the head of a vampire? Or his daughter? Or anyone in this movie? The only originality in this is that most of the myths about vampires (allergic to crosses and garlic, can not appear during the day, etc.) are erroneous. But they can not be killed except by beheading or a wooden wound in the heart. Yes, right. Obviously, they simply did not want to make a dark movie, since it was created for a television movie. <br /> <br /> It would be nice for the audience if they hired some actors. Oh, they have Linda Carter (Wonder Woman) and a big black dude with an incredibly deep voice who growls appropriately to boast a vampire's teeth replacement. But otherwise you would never know that they paid people for reading these lines. <br /> <br /> There are more than enough battle scenes and some vampire blood, but there is no violence.
