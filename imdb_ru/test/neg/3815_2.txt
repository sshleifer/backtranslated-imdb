A terrible film that is amateur at almost every level - a boring and derivative script filled with stereotypical characters played by embarrassed actors for a director who lacks the most elementary understanding of his craft. It all stinks. He plays as a slasher film from the early eighties, right up to the crappy score and the SFX ketchup, but without the nostalgia of childhood, which is necessary to look at such scale with love. One of the worst horror films I've ever seen is definitely the worst one that has received a massive theatrical release. I have never left the film in my life - if I were not lucky to see “The Ax” in the theater, this would be the first time. Avoid at all costs.
