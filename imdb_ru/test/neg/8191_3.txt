I accidentally stumbled upon this movie when I was looking for something to watch during lunch. I actually turned to the WE Network because it said that he had the last 20 minutes of a movie about the importance of “sticking to this” for some gymnastics team - I thought it was stupid. Well, I got cheesy good. <br /> <br /> First, I missed a good 20-40 minutes at the beginning of the movie. Fortunately, most of them were done fairly quickly, especially in the bedroom scene, where Crystal admits that she felt responsible for the death of her abuser. <br /> <br /> I love Jenny Garth and I will watch her in almost everything. She is so beautiful, and I want my lipstick to look as perfect as she always has. She looks great throughout the film and is actually no older than what seems to be more than ten years old. <br /> <br /> In general, I felt bad about the actors when I watched this movie. They all tried to sell their parts, but all were so poorly written that it was a constant struggle. Honestly, I was surprised to see Terry Farrell and Mitch Ryan (Greg's father from Dharma and Greg). <br /> <br /> But the script was not the worst part of this movie. Approximately half an hour before the end of her mother dies, and when they show the gravestone, the date of death is 1979. Having missed the beginning, I got the impression that this happened in the 80s. Not a single tracksuit or bell is visible. Shame on who made the wardrobe for this movie! Don't get me wrong - all the outfits in this film were beautiful, but they were completely wrong for a certain period of time. It almost makes me wonder if they told the dressmaker that it was a historical object. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is good for laughing or for feeding Jenny Garth. :)
