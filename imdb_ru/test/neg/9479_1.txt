This movie is terrible sucks. It's funny to see what a bad story it is when two American twins with a pea brain, who know nothing outside their school, can come to another continent and do unimaginable things there. It's just so stupid and so strange. How can they just find two French guys, hit them and eventually kiss them without knowing anything about them? It would be more realistic if the guys took them and raped them, which could easily have happened in such a situation. As for where they are forcing the French president to drink “bad water,” it was simply unfortunate. I do not think he would be too pleased in real life. The girls did it all too easily, and they could get into real trouble in the film many times, if it reflected the real life at all. <br /> <br /> My rating: 0/10
