I'm a big fan of Zach Allan and was disappointed that he only got one scene in the film. It was also my favorite scene, where he confiscates a characterâ€™s weapon and sends it down. Unfortunately, unlike Thirdspace & River of Souls, most actions took place outside the station. I didn't really care about Garibaldi after the first three seasons, and I think Sheridan is fine, but without Sinclair. I like Lockleigh, but she only had limited screen time. If you like Crusade or space battles, you should enjoy it. Personally, I can only give 1/10.
