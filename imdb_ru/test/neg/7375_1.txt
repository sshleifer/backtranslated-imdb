I absolutely could not believe the incompetence levels on display in this production. I honestly thought that gay tastes better than this. I know I know. <br /> <br /> Much of the blame lies not with the cast, but first let's get them out of the way ... The only one who had real talent was Joe Souza (plus he was the best bod in the cast). He had a good, clear voice in a theater style. Well, and James Hodges' voice was so-so, but in every issue he had a free expression. The rest could not keep the note in the bucket, although the music was clearly dubbed after the fact. It must have been terrible to hear them live. They were also girls, with the exception of three. If I wanted to see naked WOMEN on stage, I could go for boobs. Not sure why anyone decided to make a movie about LA instead of new york. I could assume that in New York more easily accessible singing talent, although you might think that in Los Angeles they can find guys with better looks. Obviously not. <br /> <br /> But I was distracted ... the real fault here lies with the creators and producers. This assessment was the most banal, bad taste I have ever heard. It sounded like some theater queens took all of their music CDs, threw them into a blender and poured slime onto the page. Unfortunately, I am sure that there are many people who cannot distinguish a good theatrical composition from all this. I mean, seriously, I laughed at my ass through all this, but not at silly jokes. I think the painful song “My lover died of AIDS” called “Chris, see what you missed” was the most hysterical thing in the whole show. The genius writes ... Chris / Missed ... wow ... they ALMOST rhyme ... must be good lyrics. And Jesus ... THE END of this song ... "Oh, Chris, Oooh, Chris, Oooh, Chris ..." ALL AND ABOVE !!! My other favorite was “You have to be a drunken addict guy to be a Humpy guy” ... WTF ??? The whole performance was full of the most arbitrary lyrics of the songs, simply because they rhymed. Where did these people learn to write songs? Apparently, they listened to Sondheim and said: “He is not so good, I can do it” ... as evidenced by the backward mention of “Bobby, Bobby, Bobby” from COMPANY in one song. Another annoying moment: why do 20-year-olds sing about Robert Mitchum and the Tab Hunter? Obviously, from the lips of the authors of the texts, and not from the actors ... again, a bad letter. <br /> <br /> If you like torture and pain, and I know that many of you, strange fetishists, do it, look forward, But you have been warned.
