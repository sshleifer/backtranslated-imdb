Good things first: <br /> <br /> Underdog voice was FINE. But Jason Lee himself was awesome, and this is not surprising. <br /> <br /> Peter Dinklage (Barsinister) also did an excellent job of giving him trash. He played the part amazingly well. And Patrick Warburton, the idiotic assistant. Now it was an idiotic character, but he acted so well that I liked the character better than the main characters. The lines given to him were childish, but witty. <br /> <br /> however. Alex Neuberger did terribly and hope that he will never act again. His “Scream” was so disgustingly fake. Silence. Silence. "Aaahhhhhhh". In the scene where he hears the dog talk, "oh no, impossible!" <br /> <br /> And then there was the girl and her bitch, who were chasing the character Patrick Cad on the roof. At first it makes sense, she is "Reporter". School reporter, but still an inquiring mind. But why, WHY, HELL, did she carry her dog? It was useless, and the damn dog said nothing but heartless "oh, loser!" Her presence was extremely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Overall, the script was pathetic. The only reason I put this film on 3 is Barsinister, his help and voice of the weak.
