I did not like this movie. For me, it did not make much sense. It was hard to understand what was really going on. I also did not think it was scary. I did, however, think it was stupid, even Absurd, but not in a good way. Radha Mitchell is the main character of the film, which will be released in 2003. She was also, coincidentally, in the 2006 Silent Hill, which I hated. â€œNot so bad, but I think it is definitely below average. This is nothing special. The script is too confused, and there are things in the film that, in my opinion, should not be there. I think Radha Mitchell is probably a good actress if she has something to work on. My vote for "Visitors" - 4/10
