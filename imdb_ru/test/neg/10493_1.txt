Mixing small town sheriffs, high school students, fake rock music, and some eccentrics who kill for no reason, in particular, this film is essentially an alteration of Gig's Giant Monster, , of course. <br /> <br /> Now anyone who has really seen The Giant Monster Monster knows that this is one of the worst films of all time, often so slow that itâ€™s not even funny. And I can't believe that by 1967 Giant Monster Giant had earned such a reputation that young directors simply died to start work on a sequel, not to mention a remake. So someone, please explain to me why this film was made ?! By the way, the dance sequence is interesting from a historical point of view, although it is outdated by about three years; but even this is ruined, as it continues ... and further ... and ... further ....
