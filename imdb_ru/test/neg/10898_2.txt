I have never done any of them before, but this film was so bad that I had to say something about it. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m all for independent filmmaking, as last year the worst (in my opinion) from Hollywood shows, the mainstream, seems to have simply lost touch with what good films are. This suggests that such films really give an independent film a bad reputation. <br /> <br /> Characters are boring and too stupid to empathize. The direction is terrible, the plot is terrible, the plot itself is terrible, stay away, far away. Only one short scene with a bare female breast, and even that was not worth a second look. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this film is to ever see it again. I gave him 2, not 1, simply because the actors were visible, and the sound was heard - he earns one point for each of these features.
