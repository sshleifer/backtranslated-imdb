Well, I fell in love with it. I saw a box for this in the video store, and took it for Girlfight, which I heard was great. In my own defense, the names are similar, and they remake the cover for the box so that it looks almost identical. In any case, to sum up, they obviously redid the whole package / promotional cover to capitalize on the high / success of Girlfight. I turned it on and felt bad when they started showing trailers for low-budget films right on the video, and even worse, the music video for the main song for the film, which sounded like elevator music and showed banal slips from the movie. The film preceded the main feature. When I saw the first few minutes and Maria Conchita Alonso appeared, I realized that I had fallen in love with it. (don’t get me wrong, she’s a talented actress, but I knew that she wasn’t in Girlfight, a film that I had a false impression of which I shot). <br /> <br /> So, besides the fact that I felt deceived and angry at myself for not looking closer, the film was fine. Belle, a young Latina, the daughter of an ex-boxing champion, is involved in the story. One of her closest friends, a female boxer who — and I could see that it was all sooo far ahead, was really a burden — was seriously injured during the match with the middle champion named “Terminator”, which looks like a female version of a larger more pumped up by Ike Turner. Of course, Belle decides that the only thing to do is to become a boxer himself and avenge his friend. She lives with her caring, supportive, but protective father (her mother died of cancer when she was younger), who, as it turned out, is just a policeman. Her love interest, also caring and supportive, but protecting, is also a police officer who works with her father. Hmmm, they both have jobs that put their lives at risk in the line of duty ... I wonder what will happen? She begins to train and meets a dirty manager who, of course, pretends to take care of her, but just wants to exploit her. The actor they hired looks like a very low paid Carey Evels and is so young that he barely manages to sleep. His acting was also very, very bad. I will not even go into the details of the plot, because anyone who has seen Rocky, or almost anyone, knows exactly where this film is going and how it will end. <br /> <br /> This was not a terrible movie. Most of the acting was fine, and the lead actress was very good. There were good, strong female Latin American role models. The final battle scene really interested me, although I knew everything that should have happened long before it happened. The actress who played The Terminator did a great job, being quite incredible, and I really wanted Belle to kick her $$, and would be rooting for Belle again, although there were no surprises. My favorite moment (maybe the only one when I wasn't angry at myself for making a movie by mistake) was when Bell slaps his grubby manager after he shows his true colors, shouts at him, and then turns away to suddenly forge a hit and watch him retreat in fear, showing that she is truly responsible. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was very, very bad, my main complaint. One of their attempts to be witty was that someone was discussing boxing, saying, “size does not matter,” and the female answered crookedly: “Now, where have I heard this before?” Other lines, which should have a dramatic impact, sound like this: “The doctors told me that I would never walk again!” “Come on, you know you can trust me!” and "Your mother would be so proud of you." I could go on and on. Nothing that you haven't heard a million times in bad soap operas or movies of the week. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too stingy - the directors really tried, and I voluntarily accepted it all ... but only because I had nothing to watch while I was working. You could do worse (especially if you're looking for a movie with strong female characters), but you could do a lot better.
