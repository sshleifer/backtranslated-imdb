This is beyond doubt, the worst movie I've ever seen. It has been a long time since I saw it, but the jokes are NOT funny, the plot is painfully noticeable, since calling the main characters stupid means significantly increasing your intelligence ... ugh! I just wanted to hit Tom Arnold and make him cry, because he spent two hours of my life when I finished watching this piece of cinematic dirt. I don’t even know why I ever wanted to watch it, but remember, if you see this film: don’t say, I didn’t warn you. <br /> <br /> PS The character Tom Arnold sings a song in a film called "I am my grandfather." Enough.
