This is what I wanted to scream and run out of the theater, but I restrained myself. Yes, the acting was great, no, it was not a typical Hollywood film, but the dialogue simply did not end (or did not become interesting)! And, despite all the chatter, you will never really know or care about any characters. Definitely the most boring movie I've seen from Sphere, but I expected it to be boring. I had to go through this, but please spare yourself.
