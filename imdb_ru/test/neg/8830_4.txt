This is a good plan for studying corporate power and the dichotomy between the necessary social life and the need for personal life. Robert Taylor was appointed head of the corporation Berl Ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation. He sends him to England to negotiate a deal, where Taylor is stunned by the ethics and morals of the people with whom he is dealing, and he manages to fall in love with a refugee while he is there. He returns with an emtpy award, doing his duty, but telling the truth to the British about his motives. He is trying to marry a refugee, not a boss's niece, and therefore Ives begins an attempt to discredit the refugee as a suitable wife for the head of a corporation. It could be rougher, nastier and less romantic - the amount of time spent on romance distorts the film from the moments he is trying to make about corporate ethics. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the design of the costume was assigned (unfairly) for Oscar - these are all business suits, and the two women in the film dress conservatively - studio policy at work again, no doubt. <br /> <br /> What is striking is CinemaScopeâ€™s black and white cinematography, which is great if you deserve an Oscar. (This was the first MGM Scope movie at B & W). <br /> <br /> Not as good as it could be, but not terrible either.
