I was so looking forward to watching this movie, that I cannot understand how I got the impression that I would like it. I'm afraid this is really a holiday yawn - every patron in the cinema, where I attended, often yawned and fidgeted throughout the film. This is a shame, because this is a fantastic story - I tend to think that it will be better to read. This is not helped by a principled character showing his teeth only once - and that was because of the angle of view of the camera. As the story unfolds, it becomes easier to understand the dilemmas of the protagonist. However, the uncertainty and drama that could have made this film with a really high rating were completely corrupted by boring processing. Boring like unfinished documentary!
