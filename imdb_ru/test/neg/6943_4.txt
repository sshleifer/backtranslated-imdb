The sadly predictable, clich√©d story of a woman who was no better than she should have been. Unfortunately, the script was also written by the once great experimental novelist John Dos Passos from the original French exotic cauldron Pierre Louis. This time Marlene Dietrich - Concha, a manipulative, carefree Spanish beauty. Don Pascual (Lionel Atville) picks her up from a cigarette factory, but she throws him. He warns his high young friend Antonio (Cesar Romero) against her, but to no avail. After the duel, Concha blames Pascualito for trying to kill the only person she ever cared about, so he does not do this: he is pointing a gun at the sky, but Antonio shoots him. But instead of going to Paris with a young winner, she returns to the man who would die for her. With the unexpected participation of Edward Everett Horton in the role of the Spanish governor. Dietrich plays the role of a Spanish woman, constantly moving, curving at the waist and posing, and then turning back, hesitating, throwing up her head, and so on. And she makes faces, and she has a curl on her forehead. The photo is strangely crowded: you cannot shoot any scene on the street, except through a ball of bare trees, no scene in the interior can be shot without such busy details that it is almost impossible to track people moving around the room, no Dietrich sequence be removed without a serious wardrobe change. The carnival scenes are so full of confetti and stretch marks that it almost looks like an underwater scene in the Sargasso Sea.
