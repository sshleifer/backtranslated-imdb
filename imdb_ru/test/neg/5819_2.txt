This show makes absolutely no sense. Every week, two women go to the estate to do gardening, and every week they certainly encounter murder. Because everyone who owns a big house with a big garden is involved in murder, right? But even if they somehow stumbled upon murder after murder, would it not be wise to tell the police? You know, people who can really do something about it ... But every week these two fools walk around, polluting evidence, committing their own crimes, and in some cases causing new murders. Once they miraculously reveal the killings, the killer cannot be convicted. All evidence has been sabotaged. And you think that the people who hide the murders will think not to hire these two, right? Hooray! We solved the murder! Now, like every other week, let's go and fight the killer ourselves, and without any support we will tell them that we know about it. There is no way we could endanger ourselves in any way, is there? Rosemary and Thyme - one of the worst shows on television and, of course, the funny thing.
