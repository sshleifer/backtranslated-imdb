Start with the premise that you will do everything to replace your lost love with a double. Add your scientific knowledge about the deforming disease (isn't that what Leo J. Carroll infected from the spider's poison in Tarantula). Add to this the fact that the protagonist, instead of finding some way to attract a young woman, is engaged in harsh persecution, until he fully attracts attention and should not bear this insane plot: if he can make the girlâ€™s father sick and then help him recover, she will marry him. The problem is that most events are random and unpredictable. Anyone with half the brain would see things. There is a third party, a woman whom the doctor, played by J. Carroll Naysh, treated with great insensitivity. You know that she will be a factor. There is also a gorilla, which is kept in a cage, which is sometimes used to know what's what. Well. This is so little sense for someone who believes that this is played out on its own, and people only get their desserts.
