About the Sex Life of Potato People, what evil demon created you? This is a movie that you watch, grin a little during the performance, and then, when you mention it to others who see it, you just can't help but smile when you speak. But the point is not that “Sex Lives of the Potato Men” is actually a funny movie, and it inspires you to smile when you talk or think about it, it’s just such a strange film; it is so insulting and not shameless in his attempt to laugh at the meek laugh associated with sex and sex life in general, that you just can't help but make your mouth flare up in a grin. Keep in mind that a smirk is followed by an immersion of the head; shaking the head and raising the index finger and thumb in both eyebrows when you gently rub them, trying to remember your time watching this garbage. <br /> <br /> But this is what the film is, it's rubbish; it is very brave and shameless rubbish, but nonetheless rubbish. Whoever came up with this idea, put it on paper and then spread it around the industry, trying to realize it, he must be very brave or very desperate. It is strange to have a film that is definitely “about something”, but does not have a decisive narrative under any circumstances. This follows from the idea that most European cinema is artistic, and its stories are ambiguous and open, and themes take precedence over most other things. In Sex Lives of the Potato Men, the same situation and technically the same joke are repeated again and again, and this is an idea consisting of: “sex is a very, very funny thing.” These ideas may be more appropriate for the American film, so it is not surprising that after a while after watching this film, everything starts to seem a little confused. <br /> <br /> The film begins and ends in the same way, creating the sensation of a circular journey; a circular journey that has not gone anywhere and absolutely nothing has been achieved. Three guys are sitting at the table and talking and what not. Their boss joins them, and the conversation is limited to any rude and disgusting stories, situations or scenarios that anyone can think of. The strange thing is that whenever one person says something disgusting, other grimaces have the same dirty story in order to create in return the creation of a contradiction in what these people find in order to cross the line and what is not. The men are Dave (Vegas) and Ferris (Crook), two people joined by Tolly (Coleman) whenever the film finds it necessary to throw a third person to split some more unpleasant sexual jokes or break some peculiar stories. They are hired by Jeremy (Gattis), a man who has deeper problems and problems, but problems that the film cares more about using for the sake of humor rather than study. <br /> <br /> What is the situation in the sex lives of the potato men? Three or four men are in crisis, and throughout the film we will play the role of the unfortunate fly on the wall when we witness what a dirty game these people get for about a week. If the humor that revolves around Dave and Ferris is disgusting and disgusting, then for Jeremy things are just creepy. It all starts innocently enough, and it seems that there is a woman who likes him, and one who equally loves him in return, but when the essence in which Jeremy is just a stalker creeps in, that’s when the jaws drop. Jeremy's character is used and transmitted in such a way that unrequited love and persecution in general look just “ridiculous.” Jeremy sits in his apartment, listening to classical music and writing insulting letters to Ruth (Davis), repeating some kind of psychotic personality more connected with Hannibal Lecter writing his letter to Clarice in 2001 to Hannibal. But whatever sympathy we have for him at this moment, it becomes absolutely false when it later turns out the true origin of their relationship. Suddenly, as an audience, we feel deceived, feeling a pitiful pity for him earlier, and for some reason he did what he did first, it just seems cowardly and unpleasant. To say that it was would destroy the few surprises that lurk in the film. <br /> <br /> Sadly enough, as in one of Jeremiah’s letters, he writes about something or another, exclaiming that he doesn’t have “Artistic vision? "Just one big mess." I hate it when the words spoken by the characters echo the movie they are in. Sex life of potatoes Men do not explore someone's psyche or special interest in fetish or why they feel the need to engage in as much sex as possible, he simply uses them as a cover for ridiculous ridiculous jokes and situations. Instead of engaging in group sex and exploring what makes a person look for him, it makes a silly joke out of it (tickets with numbers for!?); instead of regaining a fan of sadomasochism, in the film someone hangs from the ceiling of the basement and warns everyone about "incoming salt and vinegar" when it reaches a climax. Ferris covers his face with disgust, and the camera goes into the next scene without much fuss. It is a relief that the film did not get any audience abroad. This is one of the parts of the British culture, in fact the British mentality, which, as I pray, will be limited to our shores and accordingly ignored.
