My qualifications for this review? I have all the films about Aliens and Predator, and I have read almost all the books I can find related to this series. <br /> <br /> I can safely say that this film is Stonker. Save your money and do not waste your time. If you like reckless actions, meaningless blood, there is no plot to talk about, and, for example, about how you were captured in Hollywood, watch the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a serious fan of the Aliens series, send a message to the moved people for paid costumes in Hollywood and the Fox of the 20th century and do not give them a penny. <br /> <br /> There are so many holes in the plot in this film that you can sift pasta through it. Read other negative reviews to get the big picture; everything needs to be said for sure, so I don’t need to repeat them. <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are cardboard. You want them all to die. And the film does not disappoint, almost all of them die. Even a hot blonde with a bubble head. Do you feel sorry for her? Nope No plot, no character development .... who cares. Predators are now idiots too. They scan everything except their own dead warrior. They should be a high tech society, right? In the movie Predator, they scanned the soldiers and the girl to determine who was armed. The trophy kills. In AvP, they looked at Charles Weyland and let him go because he had cancer. A big hole in the plot! <br /> <br /> In addition, the P rating is related to the fact that there are children in the film who like faces, a lot of blood and violence, and there is one hospital scene where very large pregnant women are introduced. with bibs. She is implanted by a hybrid alien with 4 or 5 eggs in a love-mouth-orgy scene, and they all hatch in, say, 30 seconds. A lot of sensational blood, nothing more. These scenes are funny, not serious. It's almost like violence when the aliens are looking into the camera and waiting for applause, thumbs or some kind of nod. <br /> <br /> All the aliens in this movie use drugs to improve performance. They develop rapidly and spread rapidly throughout the city, tons of them, everywhere in record time. It is a pity, because it does not stick to the storyline of the series and adds nothing to the "Aliens", the continuity of "Foreigners." <br /> <br /> I noticed that positive reviews are written by people who love blood. Ridiculous. Like the film, as a continuation of the Aliens franchise and the development of the Aliens vs Predator franchise, this film is a cliché cheesecake at best. If you faithfully followed this series, all the rules are violated, and Aliens and Predators turn into comic book characters. <br /> <br /> There is not a single fantastic, memorable action scene. Virtually no special effects to remember. There are no branded actors. The plot is as thin as onion paper, which ultimately ends: "We have two options to get out of this mess ... Hospital or downtown!". I'm just about myself. The city center means that Big Brother will fire on everyone, because they have AWAC in the air, who can see the infection on the radar screen in the Red Spots special effects. I almost fell off the chair. Special effects, radar from red spots on AVAC over Central America. I break with laughter. <br /> <br /> The fact that I got to the helipad made me choke on popcorn. Has anyone played a game called ZOMBIES!? You must deliver your game pieces to the helipad to win. I almost wet myself with laughter. <br /> <br /> The end is enough for you to shake your head in surprise. Who hired 20th Century Fox to write this script!? Oh, Oh, ask me ... student of grade 5. There really can be no other answer. Oh, yes, there may be another answer ... Low-cost Sci-Fi cheesecake. <br /> <br /> End? “Colonel Stevens passes the predator's rifle to Mrs. Yutani (Françoise Ip). She tells him that the Earth is not ready for the technology she represents. Colonel Stevens knows that Jutani doesn’t want technology to be used on earth. ” You're kidding, right? Miss Jutani? Who is Mrs. Yutani? (forshadow: Weyland-Yutani: The Corporation) She is in the film for exactly 2 seconds, and yet, with her infinite Far Eastern wisdom, she says the world is not ready for technology. Seriously??!! Brothers Dwebs (Strauss) as directors? Who is responsible for this hemorrhage-abortion film? They are Doug and Bob McKenzie from the directors, and yet Fox entrusted them with the excellent Alien franchise. They are advertised as experts for special effects, and yet the film is special effects with a low budget. Hmm, I see a sample. Laugh. <br /> <br /> This film was created just to clean your wallet. It serves no other purpose. He has no plot. There are no main characters worth mentioning. It is incoherent. He does not adhere to any principles of character established in previous films. It does nothing to promote a franchise. Special effects are lame, minimal and low-budget. And it has no end to talk about. It is low budget and strictly designed to take your hard earned money. Nothing more. <br /> <br /> Save your money. Or watch it on TV, where it will end very quickly. Buy a bootleg or skip this bleeding ulcer. There is a reason Fox didn’t watch this movie for critics. Critics would eat this mess alive, and no one would go to theaters to see it. JR Giger, the creator of the original, is at this moment leaning over the toilet, spilling his lunch. <br /> <br /> 20th Century Fox, this movie is ugly. It’s just as bad or worse than Alien 3. You insult us. <br /> <br /> Flash now ...
