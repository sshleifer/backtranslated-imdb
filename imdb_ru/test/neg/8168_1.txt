This is a movie that reminds me of Rajesh Khanna avatars from the 80s. the problem of the gap between parents and children is interesting, but was not solved quite originally ... the characters were not fully developed, and the children seemed to move from being extremely loving (in the first 15 films of the film) to the fact that they were completely do not care about the parents, this transformation was not credible, if not more .. they explored it a little more. amitabh and jaya were mistaken for this helpless old couple .. firstly, amit wasn't very convincing about this role, because he just didn't look as if he should be helpless, i mean, why not return to work, where he is wanted, instead of being with children who did not want them .. Hema was not convincing either when she was 60 years old ... she did not look a day older than 50 years. Then the whole question of how the book wins the Bagbana prize requires confidence ... overall, a film that solves an important problem, but cld was made better, I give it 5/10
