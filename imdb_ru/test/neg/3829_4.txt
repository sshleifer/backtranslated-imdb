Alice Dodgson, a New York doctor, suspends the license when she treats one of her patients with an unapproved drug, which leads to the death of the patient. Without work, Alice is forced to go to Jamaica, where she is caring for the brother of the rich White landowner. Brother thinks he is a zombie and is deeply involved in the practice and voodoo rituals of the locals. Ritual is a mediocre horror movie. The action is pretty boring, plot twists are stupid, and there is no expectation. a little blood when someone kills white people with a machete, but not too much. Cinematography is decent, but acting is really terrible. Definitely who should be avoided. 4 out of 10.
