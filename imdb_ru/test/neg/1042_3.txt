I shot this film by mistake, thinking that this is another film with the same name, and I realized that I shot it some time ago. <br /> <br /> Quick storyline. The couple, consisting of an artist and a photographer, rents a studio apartment in Los Angeles with Joe Estevez, still cursing the fact that his brother Martin Sheen could actually act! They find a bed in a forgotten room, but it is haunted by the nasty serial killer of the 1930s and his last victim. Their ghosts inhabit the couple, first improving their sex life, but eventually becoming more and more threatening. <br /> <br /> The result is cheap R-rated sex scenes, cheaper thrills and a waste of time.
