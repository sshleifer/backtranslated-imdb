This is one of those films that I watch every time it is on, not because I like it, but because it is so bad that I can't take my eyes off of it (for example, “The Land of Battle” or “3000 miles to Graceland ”). The first time I watched, I continued to wait and wait, and wait for laughter, and I did not have a chance until about 3/4 of the way through the film, when they undress the disturbing policemen to their panties and handcuff in the park in unflattering order position. In addition, the jokes are not funny, the characters are not funny, their failures and mistakes are not funny ... add, this is not a very funny movie! Even at the level of farce! And what a reggae soundtrack? This is a film about two white scavengers, and music is reggae. Seems inappropriate, right? If you like a good train wreck, this is for you. If you like a good comedy, look elsewhere.
