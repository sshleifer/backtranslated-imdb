It was hard for me to watch this movie. Stan looked very old and sick compared to what I remembered, and Ollie was harder than I ever remembered in another movie. The most difficult, however, were the gaps in the script / production, when I wondered: “How did they get from here to there?” It took almost half of the film before I could cope with the duplication of non-American actors — that was also distracting. <br /> <br /> Although I miss such great actors as Laurel and Hardy, someday there will be great actors like those from the old era studio ??? - This film helps me to understand why actors sometimes “bow” in their prime.
