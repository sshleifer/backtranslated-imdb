I began to critically evaluate this adaptation in the first few minutes, but as a devoted fan of Jane Austen, I survived to the end ... However, I do not recommend this program to someone who is not familiar with her work, since I do not think that it makes the book fair, and does not make a particularly interesting television in itself. In this adaptation there was something that lacked credibility - many of the costumes and even the actors did not look authentic, and I sometimes found the acting game bad. There is no doubt that all the actors were very attractive, but this did not provide enough variety to create truly diverse, memorable characters. It was too static, because everything happened in the same place and missed the return of Fanny home, which is one of the most interesting parts of the story. The best actor was Blake Ritson, who captured Edmund's beauty very well, and Crawford was also effectively used. I like Billie Piper as an actress, but this role did not suit her and was played much better by Frances O'Connor in the 1999 version, which in general looked much more subtle and convincing. Adapting Jane Austen will always be a love story to make you feel good, but unfortunately, this is one of the worst I've ever seen.
