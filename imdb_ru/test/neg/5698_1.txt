I am surprised that someone will really think of spending some money on such a film. Indeed. Let's forget for a second that the plot doesn't even give a hint of originality ... Most films today are based on stories from other films, so the “simple” lack of originality is not so important. <br /> <br /> But I can hardly believe that none of the guys in the film ever got on the plane before filming it. Because let's be honest, that would be the only excuse to come up with something so funny. To be sincere, I think that a 6-year-old child with a fake camera could come up with something technically much more believable. Here are some examples. <br /> <br /> The scene that really drove me crazy is when the engines turn off when they regain control of the aircraft. When they need to turn them on again, the guy on the radio says something like: "Ok, press buttons 1 and 2 on the dashboard." Now it is not a button. They should not be pushed, they should be pulled up to the pilot. You say that this is known only to drug addicts? Wrong. In the next scene, you can see how their fingers press the “buttons” ... And, of course, the so-called “buttons” do not move at all! Not a single millimeter! (And note that I didn’t even mention the fact that aircraft engines aren’t like automobile engines, that you just turn the key and the magic happens ... you have to do a rather complicated procedure to turn them on ...) guys! You could fake a move at least! Not to mention the ridiculous final blow when the plane hits every thing on the runway (light poles along the runway? It happened to me once ... Except that the plane was made of Lego! How about the flight attendant? In fact, she is so experienced that she knows perfectly well where the aux 1 and aux 2 fuses are in the middle of the wires behind the cab. an ambulance using your computer? And to did he turn on other aircraft engines? <br /> <br /> Indeed, I could spend hours doing it. This is the dumbest movie I've ever seen, and I turn on trash like Alone In The Dark and other things on the list Do you want to do yourself a favor? Do not look.
