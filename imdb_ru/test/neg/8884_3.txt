I made here this film was good from different people. Plus, I like Natalie Portman and Javier Bardem, as well as the director Milos Forman. But after watching this movie, I really had nothing to admire. <br /> <br /> Firstly, acting was far below average. The performances were not powerful enough to feel the shock of what the Inquisition did. Javier Bardem did speak solidly and was probably the only one who had a Spanish accent. It is obvious why this Bardem was the only one. Natalie Portman, who, I think, is very good and the future actress, didn’t really make me regret having been tortured. As in the film, she had nothing to admire. Stellan Skarsgaard, whom I love, showed very average figures, like other actors acting dull. This film has been essentially about him since he plays Goya. And yet he did not become what he was supposed to be to make this film a good one. What about Randy Quaid? You just have to be kidding me. He is played by King Carlos IV. Look, he's great at comedies, but he plays the King, who just describes the whole movie for you. <br /> <br /> The direction in this film was terrible. When a movie is a mess, two people are usually to blame: the director and the writer. I have a feeling that Milos Forman really didn’t want his actors to put on a Spanish accent. Of the very few battle scenes here, they were all shown horribly. Just like the director, he should be shocked by what the Inquisition did. After this film, I felt that I could take care of this event. To summarize, he poorly filmed scenes and misled the actors. <br /> <br /> The letter, which Milos Forman also did, was just as bad or perhaps even worse than directing. In this film there was really nothing memorable, except for one case where Bardem receives the same appeal as the character Portman. In addition, the film did not give you the feeling of a time period and, at least, he could compensate for this with a quote or two. <br /> <br /> After this movie ended, I just watched TV thinking well, why should I take care of all this. I care and are very interested in history, but when such films appear, it seems that the producers robbed you of something good that could be taken from the film. When films are so bad, we highlight a lot of technical flaws in the film than if it were good. Like accents. I'm not sure that people would emphasize the absence of Spanish accents if this film were good. <br /> <br /> The whole point of this review - just do not watch it.
