This weak attempt to turn your typically mild Japanese horror film towards a creepy cult hit did not have the ammunition necessary to keep the viewer involved everywhere. Translated into a vortex, Uzumaki is simply an irrational and excessive tribute to a strange descending spiral into oblivion, which seemingly flooded the whole small town with obsessive dementia. Although it certainly makes a pleasant b-movie on the surface, the traditionally tedious action, direction and script will be all but Asian horror lovers, shaking their heads in dismay. What could roughly translate into the Japanese equivalent of David Lynchâ€™s early play would have exhausted his spiral ploy instead, before he even had the opportunity to explain himself - which of course not. In addition to a few ingenious tricks, the film rarely connects a dizzying theme with a dull scenario, which ultimately leads to cheap exploitation in the cult genre, replacing the empty images with a genuine substance. When the film ended, almost nothing was obtained from any interaction, except for tiny scenes or images that rose above the film on one note. I applaud the creators who, at least, are trying to transfer the genre to more supernatural, metaphysical realms and understand the gross losses lost during translation, but with zero content, to support any quirkiness, this is most likely to make basements for fans.
