So I once caught it as “What lies above” and really watched it, because the beginning was somewhat promising. The heroine, Diane Pennington, is an expert in mountaineering ... but this does not help her when her fiancé Brian gets injured while climbing. When she leaves to get help, and returns, he disappears from the mountain, and he is never seen again. <br /> <br /> Two years later, Diana is still a mountaineer ... but she doesn’t fit the Snowman Pass. That is, until Kurt Siver shows up and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with the help of a new satellite program. She agrees, and they take off the mountain with Kurt's two assistants: his “bodyguard” Hugo and computer specialist Tyler. From the very beginning, you know that some hidden motive is happening, but, unfortunately, the turns are not very good and lead to a terribly bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> The main disappointment is the red herring, most of which have supernatural shades that never materialize. An object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which is not so unnatural), the story of how the Snowman Pass appeared, and the most memorable of them: the sequence of Diana's dreams halfway through the film. But most of all I was disappointed that they dropped the ball. Most of the film revolves around the search for Brian, so I can not understand why the secret of what happened to him and where he was is never revealed during the film. This was the main plot. So the movie began! How do you NOT wrap it? <br /> <br /> I wouldn’t tell too many people to worry about it ...
