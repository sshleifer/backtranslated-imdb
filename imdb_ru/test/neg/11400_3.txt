As a fan of frivolous and humorous books by Gipharts (of which Ik Ook van Jou is not the best), I looked forward to seeing this movie. I did not catch him in the cinema, and seeing him on TV, I am terribly glad that I did not buy it on video. From a good book they managed to make one of the worst films in the history of Dutch cinema. All the good moments have been left out, the story has changed, and not in her favor. All the humor was cut out. There is a bad, dramatic, inconsistent film that I no longer want to watch. <br /> <br /> I sympathize with Gifart with this result and am glad that Robert Jan Westdijk has done a hell of the best work on the topper of Giphart Eagle-owl Segt Sorry. Go and see!
