I was more entertained by watching my wife almost pull out her hair in despair for most of this movie. I thought that something that would tie it all together would be at any moment, right around the corner of the dairy barn. Therefore, I deceived, grabbed the remote and was relieved to find out that it ends only after 20 minutes. I had to turn the channel. Honey, he had potential, but disgusting!
