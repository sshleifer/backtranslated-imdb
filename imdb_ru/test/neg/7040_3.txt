Two escaped convicts come out of the woods and shoot two of the rest in the head. This is the first scene, and she made me flinch, afraid of what was in the store. But by the end of the first half an hour I was covered in many images. Not because I cared less about any characters, but because I was stunned by how good the film was, and I was curious to see how truly low it could go. <br /> <br /> Frank (Remar) and Red (Woolvett) are former prisoners. After killing two innocent tourists, they plow through the woods and crash into the isolated hut of Dean Stockwell and his two sons, lawyer Keith and the alienated homosexual Ber. The fugitives first pretend that their car has broken down and they need to use the telephone, but they gradually reveal their identity. <br /> <br /> Well, this looks like familiar territory. "Desperate hours" or "Fun Games", maybe. But - wait - son-gay in collusion with the two. It seems that Stockwell, having found his son in an offense with another man named Billy, kicked Billy and kicked him out. Billy is dead, and now Bere blames his father for death. And indeed, Dad is a bit of a Neanderthal, when it comes to paraphilia, the fact that he was found in cohabitation with the secretary. <br /> <br /> The destitute Baer just searched and searched, searched for someone else who knew Billy, someone with whom he could share his despair. It turned out that this is one of the fugitives, and now Baer is determined to see them free. <br /> <br /> After that, everything is distorted. People talk. They speak and say. They talk constantly. And NOT about two crazy killers who just can't wait to put one between their eyes. No - the dialogue goes something like this: “You were so scared by something inside you that you even chased away your SON.” This is Baer, ​​a young gay guy talking to Stockwell. As if in the afternoon, the home drama mixed its genes with the thriller-killer in some kind of transforming device or shaker. <br /> <br /> The only real view is James Remar, more talkative and sinister of two fugitives. And this is mainly due to his rough but fluid baritone that sounds like Lance Henrikson and his wide, guppy-like lips It is light in eyes and ears. <br /> <br /> Dean Stockwell showed decent results, including his invaluable strange move in Blue Velvet, in which he was my support player, but here laziness, advancing years or a weak direction formed his every move and every utterance in stereotype. It’s as if he was reading the instructions on the stage - “Look surprised” and “scream angrily” - and literally followed them. There is nothing surprising in loading a cart. <br /> <br /> If the cheerful son Jason Behr ever blinked, it should have happened when I blinked at the same time, because I missed it. He has a long neck and only one expression in his instrument. Woolvette, as a minor villain, turns into a pine-paneled tree. Son lawyer - Robert Glen Keith. I hope he did not quit his day job. <br /> <br /> Direction - pedestrian, scenic functioning, although not innovative. Sometimes it is confusing. I lost the idea of ​​where everyone should have been, since the killers were circling on the cab porch, and the family locked themselves inside with a shotgun. I also could not understand how Stockwell could have blown the cabin door, hit Remar and kicked him back from the porch, and then Remar could just get up, dust off and come up with a fractious retaliation. like, "Good. Two can play this game". But why continue? Look, if necessary.
