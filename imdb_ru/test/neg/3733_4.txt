It has even been two years since I first saw this film, and yet, I can hardly remember something about this film. Needless to say, I found it VERY forgotten. From what I remember, nothing stands out particularly well. A talented cast is wasted on what I believe was supposed to be a dark comedy, but if so, then fail miserably. At best, this film is slightly interesting. In the worst case, the seemingly ubiquitous overcast skies are more interesting than the storyline. If you like to watch movies where they always seem to be wet and cool, then I think you can find something that you like in this picture. Just try to ignore what else is happening, because it is barely noticeable.
