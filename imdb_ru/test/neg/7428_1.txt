I took this thing from the science fiction shelf, because I remembered seeing the first series when I was a kid. I rented a second, and it was a decent fantasy fiction. This one was just nasty. “Special Effects” on cars looked like my 4-year-old cousin could have done. Two female cyborg helpers were so terrible that I literally cringed every time they appeared on the screen. The plot left much to be desired, and I was sick. I don’t know what someone was thinking about when they agreed to be part of this film, but I’m sure they would have better left it in two films. The films in this series go from good to decent and terrible. I only hope that no terrorist group has access to this film, as it is an excellent means for torture.
