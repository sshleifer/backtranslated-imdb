Even before the release of this film, it is clearly seen that Ali Ji became precisely the character he intended to parody. In any case, I am not a fan of Sasha Baron Cohen's character, but I was curious to see how a person with such a small talent could convince universal studios in financing an almost one and a half hour long feature film from a three-minute joke. <br /> <br /> A thin paper plot is just a stream of jokes about penis and marijuana, and I have to admit that I cringed when I saw such respected fans as Charles Dans and Michael Gambon who dropped so low to work . To say that I have to admit (even if I am very ashamed) that I raised the title more than once, and no matter how bad this film was, it was never boring, and I never thought to turn it off (mainly because gorgeous Rona Mitra). Having said that, watch this movie only if you are a young guy between the ages of 14 and 17 and you find funny jokes.
