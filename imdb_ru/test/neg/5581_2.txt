B-movies from the 1950s, which were very lucky, but at the same time very funny, is what Predator Island pays homage to. Filmed in Connecticut, Predator Island is located on an island called the lighthouse. Hell's Beacon, which is inhabited only by a couple who care for the lighthouse. In the typical science fiction of the 1950s, after half a dozen young people crash into a boat on the rocky shore of the island, hideous creatures from space invade the island after a meteor strike nearby. Creatures begin to dwell in the bodies of their victims, and absorb them. The many curses and unsuccessful returns are the main form of dialogue in this film. It is so strange that sometimes you have to laugh. If you are looking for a film that is stupid but fascinating, then this one meets all the requirements. <br /> <br /> Interesting note: I appear in the film as a dead body against the background of the final scene. During the filming, they needed about 50 extras, but about 300 people came to this opportunity. In the end, they used almost 200 of them.
