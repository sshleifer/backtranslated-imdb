John Knowles' modern masterpiece, The Separate World, is one of many subtle, and subtly is shadowing, themes of love, hate, jealousy, denial, and regret. The 1972 version is trying to solve this style, and what kind of a book is a love story with a war in the background. <br /> <br /> Version 2004 does not use subtle, but frankly in the image of the story. What you face when you read a novel is a love story, and yes, maybe it's a controversial gay love story. In the novel and the 1972 film version in the texts and dialogues everywhere there are sexual shades. In the 2004 version of the Showtime film, these tensions were omitted, and the actors were there in the late twenties, playing teenagers, which resulted in a mature acting game that removes any tenderness or hesitation of innocence in youth. <br /> <br /> I didn’t like this remake for several reasons. The hair that broke the camel's back was that Phineas was given a surname on the letters he received from the bulletin boards! Finney is a character who does not have and does not need a last name. John Knowles did it intentionally. <br /> <br /> Although I accept the 1972 version, the acting was sometimes a little amateurish, so he tried to be sincere towards the novel by filming on the set at the Phillips Exeter Academy that Devon Acedemy was based on; who was also visited by the writer John Knowles as an apprentice. <br /> <br /> The directors and producers took all the teenage students of Exeter, with the exception of Parker Stevenson, who attended the Brooks School to play in the paramount movie! A cool game involving pre-rivals compared to this frame from a Canadian college, involving adult actors, a politically correct, platonic version. No - try this veto again. The 1972 film version with John Hale and Parker Stevenson was a real bargain for the film “A Separate World” on screen. There was no Showtime 2004 film for the cable version.
