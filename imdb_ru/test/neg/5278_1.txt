I saw a lot - perhaps too many live videos, no budget slash films, and I got a taste for “good” or less cool, no matter how ridiculous it sounds, hahaha. DR. Chopper, this is what I kindly call ... absolute shit. Nothing in it is fun - the actors are slop, the characters are slop, the killer is slop, the blood is minimal ... and the slop. This is a group of friends from college who travel to a newly discovered family hut owned by the parents of one of the children. It should be a relaxing retreat, but few know that the mortally ill former plastic surgeon, who became ill, along with his two female helpers, are searching for usable tissue to save the doctor. His name is Dr. Chopper, as he rides a motorcycle and, of course, discourages. This is just a terrible film, worthy of no one time. Enough said.
