I get sick of movies that seem interesting in a single-line synopsis, and then end up with what you find at the bottom of the compost pile. <br /> <br /> Who knows: "The Witcher" "It may seem interesting in the field of view for studios, even with" celebrity "(for example, Blair and Hasselhoff - wink, wink) and the bubbly similarities of Hildegard Knef ( some woman ...). <br /> <br /> But on film, it just falls apart faster than a papier-mâché sculpture in the rain. It seems that these unfortunate people fell into an island mansion off the east coast, and one of them (a woman, I suppose) is attacked by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell, while others are killed in a grotesque, winding way. <br /> <br /> So, you have several stories from The Exorcist, The Omens, Ten Little Indians, and several other small films in the film Satanic Fans. line amok. None of this is very exciting, and for the most part you will move from stage to stage until it ends. <br /> <br /> No, even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff don't really help. They just want a salary and they don’t seem to be going to give her their “everything.” <br /> <br /> Apparently, Hasselhoff would probably want him back in touch with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda ... well, who knows; PETA celebrity winnings or a pro-am golf tour or everything she does now. <br /> <br /> And scenes of torture! Ecchhhh. You will see how people sew up their mouths, hang down in roaring fireplaces, strung on trees during a strong storm, ships erupt from their necks, etc., and so on. D. Shish, and I thought that the “Devil's Sign” sadistic film that i saw .... <br /> <br /> don't worry. It is not worth your time. I can't believe I told you as much as I did. If you watch it, just see if you can count the cliché. And yes, Blair is obsessed, as if you didn’t see THAT walking along Main Street accompanied by an orchestra. <br /> <br /> There are no stars. "Witchcraft" - these witches will make you itch.
