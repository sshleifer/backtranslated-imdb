Why was this movie made? Are sadists so easily fooled that they will give them money to create methods of torture, such as this so-called “movie”? I love a bad movie as much as the next masochist, but “Cave dwellers” are promoting it. It is seriously physically painful to watch. In the story there is something like a guy named Ator - increased torpor, whom I will call Private Snowball in the rest of this review - who must fight invisible warriors and save the princess to defeat the bad guy who needs to find the best hairdresser. I may have made a mistake in the plot, since a lot of time has passed since I watched these excreta, but in fact, do you care? Oh yes, Private Snowball also has a dumb Asian assistant (and who doesn't?). Who is not funny. <br /> <br /> In any case, ordinary Snowball fights invisible people, visits some caves, in the name of a good king, so disinterested that he makes Al Gore look like Jim Carrey. Then Private Snowball builds a hang-glider (yes, I'm serious) and starts a girl. Yippie-Ki-yay. It is cheap, unintentionally stupid and boring. Why am I not surprised that the director ended up making porn? <br /> <br /> Outcome :? TO AVOID. Ator will steal a part of your life, and you will not have funny phrases “so bad, they are good” that you can take with you from experience. Bad Ator! BAD! Aak! * choking *
