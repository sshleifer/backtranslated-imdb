I was looking forward to "Man of the Year", a couple of girls at my work said that it was a very good film, and my mother said she liked it, so I waited for the rental and watched it last night. I have to honestly say that this film was a huge disappointment. I barely coped with this, because, frankly, the beginning was quite good and very dynamic, but then it became too dark, and not in the film that I saw from the trailer. It looked like a good comedy, then it turned into a very dark drama that wasn’t even that interesting, considering how many such stories we had about the government's conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Tom Dobbs This is a very popular comedian with a show of the highest rank, in which many people would like him to get involved in politics, simply because he has a good idea of ​​what needs to be improved. Therefore, he does this, he is running for president, but many people doubt that he can win because he is a comedian, but he wins! But Elenor Green, who is ensuring that all voices are taken into account, is trying to fix a computer crash, but when the government tells her not to fix it, they try to get rid of her, and Tom soon realizes that this is not the kind of work he is looking for. <br /> <br /> With the acting, everything was fine, the direction was fine, in my opinion, the story did not work. As I said, it just turned into a dramatic change of genres, because if you see the trailer, you would think that it is a comedy, and when you start watching it, this is what you get, but then it just turns into a very dark and somewhat scary drama. I wouldn’t really recommend this film, it was one of the biggest disappointments I’ve ever seen. <br /> <br /> 2/10
