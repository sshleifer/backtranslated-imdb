Istenders went full circle from the impossible in 1985 to the absolutely terrible now. This is so bad reflection of the nation that this shit outperforms the ratings. <br /> <br /> Plots ideas can consist of nothing more trivial than simply putting the character's name in the header. The first two (regardless of their gender) will sleep with each other, the third and fourth will come out to fight in Vic, the fifth will be arrested, the sixth will develop dependency, the seventh will become pregnant, etc. Etc. D.>> Manufacturers smart though. The 30-minute show actually consists of only 3 lines. <br /> <br /> 1) Someone will go to Vic and say: “What is happening?” 2) Someone else will stand up and say: “Leave it” (3). Then the woman will say: "Doan Chu came before insulting you, Mom's" <br /> <br /> That's all. This is every show. In addition to the episodic “Get this id sorting / is this id sorting?” <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, the show was a realistic depiction of people from the East End and their lifestyle. The buffers faded away when 1) they extended it from two nights a week and 2) the Slater family appeared. How they attract the audience, I can not do it. Kat's character symbolizes everything that went wrong with society, treating anyone else as if she took off her shoes from the bottom. <br /> <br /> People who consider her the best character in these polls should be the same as those who vote for Jamie Redknapp "Best Athlete", despite the fact that he did not play the game for 3 years old. <br /> <br /> What I can never understand is that the show is the pinnacle of British television, why do all the biggest names go away? Ross Kemp, Martin Kemp, the list is endless. <br /> <br /> How long is the marriage of the longest couple, and they are true to each other? Yes, people are leaving, but until the writers understand that the characters, the couple can be interesting and cute, without sleeping around the show, will continue to deteriorate. The episode last week had 3 separate plots of this particular. Both Zoya and the doctor on top are even Elevated and "Shell", as "The bridge is an unpersuasive couple that has ever appeared on television." <br /> <br /> Yes, Eastenders is the most popular show, that is certain. But this is facilitated by many external factors. 19.30 / 20.00 is the ideal time of the day to get the most viewers. He has a consolidated publication for 2 hours, and moreover, millions of viewers watch it no more than out of habit, but if they were absolutely honest they themselves admit that (in 2002 more than ever) it can be absolutely pitiful.
