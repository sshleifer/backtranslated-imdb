They took the story, dear people from the heart of Edinburgh, a true story and changed it, as did Hollywood before many fairy tales. The end result is a film, but well done for those who do not know the story, but completely different and inaccurate. In the original film of this story, over which Walt Disney himself watched, the correct breed of dog was used, which is crucial for this story, and didnâ€™t make anything special about John Gray, he was poor Shepard who died in poverty in a hotel.
