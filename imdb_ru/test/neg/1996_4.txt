"Kitty" with a smell is a cartoon that Pepe Le Pugh introduced to the world ?? sort of, sort of, sort of. There are several key differences between Pepe, whom we know and love (or hate, in the case of some people) and the character of this cartoon. For example, a disguised cat, which Pepe is lovingly pursuing in The Plowing Kitty, is clearly male. In addition, Pepe is exposed as a crook, whose real name is Henry at the climax of the cartoon, his French accent disappears when his wife and family appear. Pepe is not even the main character here, in the center of attention is a dressed cat that disguises itself as a skunk in order to scare away its enemies. For the most part, the storyline largely follows the usual Pepe Le Pugh cartoon format, but Pepeâ€™s aggressive courting lacks the usual tricks and direct camera addresses that make him such a wonderful character. He is also not as good as he could, and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, Kitty's Plowed Up is a rather ugly and clumsy cartoon. His main source of attractiveness comes from his concept, which was original at this stage, before it became the template for each subsequent cartoon Pepe Le Pugh. This subsequent development has deprived "the able smell of Kitty" of any impact, and for modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull little pepe Pepe Le Pugh with a strange unexpected ending. As a child I hated Pepe Le Pugh. As an adult, able to appreciate his more sophisticated, verbal and risky humor, I love the character and most of his cartoons. "Kitty, who smelled," makes me feel like a child again!
