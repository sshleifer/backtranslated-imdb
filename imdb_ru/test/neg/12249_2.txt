There are cases when, less than in the middle of a film, I begin to think about what the creators think, which made them decide not to record every video and instead release a film that has no real merit. And I mean any kind. This film does not even hold, as they did for cable porn. In fact, the Tears of Heaven are completely and very boring, and sometimes disturbed by their naivety. The girl, who, as I remember, is eighteen years old, is masturbating, thinking of the older Nazi who hit her with a car - the syndrome “crashing into her in the hall as a way to present herself” from sitcoms and Robert Zemeckis films. Then, during their second or third meeting - get it - he is shy, the one who resists the girl's sexual advancement, and yet, all she has to say is: “I am old enough. I "I want," and he takes her to bed. Then, after sleeping with this girl, whom he barely knows, he feels finished as if he could die right there, in bed with her, and he would live complete life. It's like Lolita without any social or personal comments. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is the most boring part of the film. No interesting perspectives or originality whatsoever, even for sex scenes that are supposed to be the main draw for movies like this. A masturbation scene is just a camera circling around a girl's bed. (very pretending to look like she is on stage), and she is interspersed with her fantasy about a person taking a shower in a waterfall. The “I’m over” scene is just a close-up of the girl’s right side (head down to her chest) from the top. her, and this is the same frame for the entire time, even if there are repeated cuts, the rather unrelated scene of the Nazi's older sister, who has some kind of incestuous crush on him (she is funny and stupid, so it doesn't matter). I think that all this lasts from five to ten minutes, and it does not enlighten and does not cause.
