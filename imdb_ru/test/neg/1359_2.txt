For those of you who have never heard of the film so far (I suppose there are many lucky ones who have not heard), I will summarize for you. Ryan Gosling plays the title character Lelanda, who also acts as a film narrator (a la Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, but without intellectual life observations). Leland is jailed for slaughtering a retarded child to death, and the film is trying to figure out why he did it. He seems to be a good boy (if not mentally absent), and Gosling portrays him with a total absence of violence, anger or intention (and if you wait until he shows his sinister side later in the film, don’t waste your time - it’s not such a film). In prison for juveniles, Leland attends classes conducted by Pearl Madison, skillfully depicted by Don Cheadle (who is not capable of anything except quality, even in bad movies). Pearl is trying to uncover Leland's secret, trying to figure out how such a child can do such a thing, and so he could write a book about it later (along with the fact that he is a prison teacher for minors, Pearl is also a novice author). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Leland and Pearl is the driving force behind the narrative underlying the film, as their talks reveal Leland’s past to an audience. However, to call it the centerpiece, it would be understood that this wandering film had one. Is not. "The United States of Leland" boasts an impressive cast, which seems to be detrimental to the film. It seems that the writer / director Matthew Ryan Hodge (do not worry that you didn’t hear about him, he never did anything) should have given EVERY character a personal storyline and personality flaw for the actors to play them, Most of these features and stories are shaded, and most of them are underdeveloped and unresolved. <br /> <br /> I will try to break them here: Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson are the parents of a murdered, retarded boy (I love how the film constantly called the child “retarded,” not part of the “mentally handicapped.” inside), they have a clearly cold relationship, because all the suburban marriages in modern cinema should be cold. Their two other children are Michelle Williams, who appears to be an aspiring actress about to attend college, and Jena Malone, who plays the same problematic teenage archetype she always plays, this time with heroin addiction. Malone was also Leland's girlfriend, which gives him a connection with his victim. Chris Klein plays the Williams guy who is orphaned and came to live with his family, and is a baseball player who wants to go to the same college as his girlfriend. He ends up doing more with his character than any of the other beat players, sometimes managing to steal a movie. Lena Olin is the mother of Leland, who seems to be constantly sad for some reason. Kevin Spacey (also executive producer) - cold and absentee father Leland, a famous writer. In the end, Sherilyn Fenn will come to blunt the story of Leland - if you don't even care. Oh, yes, and there is a former drug dealer, a couple of fellow juveniles and a Pearl employee, with whom he has an affair with his girlfriend at a distance (played by Kerry Washington). <br /> Sorry if this whole overview and character breakdown took so much time. If it seemed pointless and boring, then you just experienced something of what I did in the 108 minutes I spent watching the movie. But the undisciplined cast of rehashed stamps is the smallest of the crimes of this film. The biggest is that the whole exercise is completely pointless. We are not given a fascinating look at a restless mind, we are not given an effective explanation, we are not given anything. Considering that it sucks so much, I’m going to spoil your finale, so you never have to see it: Leland struck a blow, because Leland could only see sadness in the world and wanted to spare Corky was the name of the victim) sadness in his eyes. It looks like the worst emo band in the world made an album and called it "The World Is Sad, so I killed the retard." Oh, and Leland dies at the end, in a sequence so dependent on incredible coincidences that it would destroy the film if the film were no longer sucks. Of course, in the end he dies, because it made the film so deep. <br /> <br /> I give the film 2 stars, because the actors themselves coped well with the junk they were given. The scenes with Cheadle and Gosling were even interesting at some levels. But, to paraphrase the film itself, you must believe that films are not just the sum of their parts, baby.
