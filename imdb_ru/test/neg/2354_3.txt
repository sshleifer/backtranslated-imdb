At the time of publication of this commentary, IMDb is currently evaluating the secondary saboteur Alfred Hitchcock as 7.3 / 10. Personally, I rated it less than half. Frankly, I can not say how this bad film could appear in probably the most consistently good director I know. I saw about 10 other Hitch films of the 30s-60s. Dizziness is still my favorite, and the saboteur is simply the worst. It's hard to believe that 7 years ago, Hitch used the same formula in “39 steps” much more competently. I would recommend to see this and avoid it like a plague. This is the only Hitchcock film that I’ve turned off to the end, and I don’t have a desire to go back and watch everything else. If you have to watch this, then rent or borrow. Do not make the mistake I made, and faithfully buy a DVD earned through Sad, Rebecca, Dizziness, Rear Window, etc. I believe that even the master is mistaken. <br /> <br /> EDIT: Maybe I was a little harder in this movie than I should have been. This, of course, is nowhere near Ed Wood, Manos or something like that, but I think there are three reasons why I should rate them so low: <br /> <br /> 1) The name “Hitchcock »Carries with it certain expectations regarding quality. This film is about some of them, but they are too clouded by a curse next to meaningless plots. <br /> <br /> 2) I want to slightly compensate for all 8+ ratings of this film. , Hitchcock is similar to John Coltrane from directors. True fans will find reasons to consider it a work of art, but a high rating on IMDb makes for such casual movie fans like me the impression that this film is much better than it actually is. <br /> <br /> 3) I spent $ 18 on this. Perhaps if it cost me $ 5 or even $ 10, I would probably be a little less bitter. ;)
