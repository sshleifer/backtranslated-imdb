Lance received quality support from James Cameron. Hell, he even had his own television show (Millennium) for a couple of seasons. why is he doing this? Can't he find the best way to pay his bills? <br /> <br /> I like a good low budget movie. You can laugh at some of them simply because of their ridiculous background, their stereotypical characters from the textbook, or often because the actors are connected with the director / producers. But this film has no redemptive value. I did not laugh. I did not cry. I only had a nauseous feeling in my stomach. This feeling was quickly identified as pity. At one point, Lance Henriksen was an A-list support actor. He was in the "Terminator" (he was going to become a "Terminator" before Arnold appeared), "Aliens", "Foreigners" III, the classic "Pumpkinhead" from the B-movie and many others! I wanted to send him money after that. Maybe we should create a support fund for Lance or something. <br /> <br /> Again, to create this thing ... perhaps not.
