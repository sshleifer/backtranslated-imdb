I was not sure where it was going to end. when it turned out that it was an entire liberal conspiracy to pass on peace to the European weaklings and the United Nations. What is the load on the right dirt! By the way, a little about Canada’s accession to the United States actually had nothing to do with the plot, and the idea was never developed. It seems that the only thing is that the protagonist was entitled to run for president (but they could make him an American and do without it). In any case, it was bull and not worth your time. If you do not want such things to be done well, see the BBC's brilliant political thriller “The State of the Game”.
