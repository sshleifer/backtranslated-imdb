Anyone who knows anything about evolution does not even need to watch a movie to say "fake". “It has never been refuted” and is a weak argument. To say that the universe was created by a giant behemoth, can not be refuted. Although, to be honest, it seems that the only people who believe are the same people who open e-mail attachments from people they don’t know, or their bank details to the dude in Zambia. No primate bones were found in the United States and Canada. There is also a good reason why legitimate scientists are not worried about this. The same argument applies to the Loch Ness monster, ghosts and god.
