Have you ever read a book, then watched a movie and wondered how they screwed up? This is one of those. Huffacker's book Nobody Loves a Drunken Indian was great, incredibly funny ... no this movie. It seems that no one cared to change direction, so we took care of the characters. This film, which addresses some of the real problems of the Indians, makes us wonder why we have not seen more comedies about the Holocaust or slavery. Not very well done.
