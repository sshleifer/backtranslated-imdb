Why can't a movie be rated zero? Or even a negative number? Some films, such as Plan 9 from Space, are so bad that they are fun to watch. THIS IS NOT ONE. Dungeon of Terror can be the worst movie I've ever seen (at least some of them. I had to rewind it to the front!). Fortunately, due to the negligence of my youth and old age, I can watch the worst films, but, fortunately, I can not remember them. The sets seemed to be made of cardboard and trimmed with cans of paint. The special effects were similar to the C + diorama of a fifth-grader in a shoe box. The film contained unforgivable mistakes, for example, when the Marquis shoots and kills his servant. Then he immediately gets into a fight with his fleeing victim, who takes his flintlock and shoots him out of it, without the weapon being reloaded! This film was so bad that my DVD copy had only titles. I guess no company or studio wanted to be blamed. Although I think when you shoot in your garage and make sets of cardboard boxes, the studio is not needed. This film is definitely included in my cellar of the worst films of all time with such terrible sacrifices as The Manipulator, the worst film I have ever seen, with a real (once) Hollywood lead man, Mickey Rooney. The only time I would recommend to see the Harrow Underground (or "Manipulator") would be if someone paid you. (I'm a bit cheap). I would need $ 7 or $ 8 for the Dungeon and at least ten for the Manipulator. The cinematographer never failed
