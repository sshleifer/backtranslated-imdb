This is the debut of Jonas Quastel as a director, and to be honest, it shows. Looks like he threw in every trick with a camera that he learned in film school to try to add style to the poorly written script he helped write! The film has Lance Henriksen and a group of others who are looking for a plane in the Pacific Northwest that crashed, which had his daughter on, as well as a special car that his company built, which he also wants to receive. The first 5 minutes of the movie are either blurry, or wobbly, or out of focus! Quastel is trying to capture the Blair Witch mode with such pictures, and they tire very quickly. And there are also POV shots that come straight from Wolfen and Predator. These pictures are in terms of (POV) Sasquatch. Editing is sometimes intermittent, as the scene seems to shift right in the middle. I heard that this film was shot in about 12 days, and I believe that instead of “Going back to one,” they just restarted non-stop and edited the scene together. And the rest of the film gradually disappears from one scene to another. These are so many scenes that disappear and I lost count. Now the nude scene with Andrea Roth. That's not her. You can easily see his double body. And you know that you watched a bad movie “B”, when in the middle of the Pacific Northwest a hot chick decides to go to the nearest hot spring and take a dip! ******** SPOILER WARNING ******** <br /> <br /> And Sasquatch himself is not bad when you do not see him, but he is just a blurry image behind trees or bushes, but when you, finally see it at the end, of course you are disappointed. First of all, he is not so tall. An actor who plays Sasquatch has hair only in certain places on the body. This is a partial lawsuit! And he is bald! I heard that the make-up artist died during the shooting, and perhaps this explains why the costume looks hastily. Some of the sound effects that come from Sasquatch are nothing more than the familiar roar of a lion that we have all heard in other films. I have to admit that Henriksen is not so bad. Yes, he works with bad material, but he has one of those interesting faces that can improve some moments of the film. People keep saying that a good film about a snowman has never been made, but I do not agree. I have always said that “The Creature from the Black Lake” is a good film, and I highly recommend it. I am addicted to the Sasquatch film, but this one is for amateur only.
