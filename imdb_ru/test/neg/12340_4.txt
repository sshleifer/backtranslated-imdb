Rather, like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their movies about racing cars, Robert Redford looks like a “fun” project when he skies up and down the valley under the alpine sun. <br /> <br /> The story is as light as powdered snow with the little Redford boy David Chappell (what is this name?), who, looking at the Olympic glory prize, raises his nose, in no particular order, to his coach Father and teammates. Women are just a side show in his closed world, as evidenced by the rather unpleasant scene of a pickup truck with an old girlfriend in his hometown, and then his selfish insolent pursuit, heaven above, free-thinking, independent woman played by Camilla Sparv. The sequence of skiing is good with some good stunts, including numerous bumps and scratches on the track, but their effectiveness decreases due to our subsequent acquaintance with the best television programs about ski events right up to today. Also, I'm not sure that the Winter Olympics have the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games, so when Redford eventually won his gold medal in the final reel, I could not worry or other. <br /> <br /> Of the actors, Redford, the best attacker, doesn’t have to do much or even do it, while Gene Hackman copes with equally meager material. Ms. Sparv copes well with the role of the main female hero, who treats Redford the way he undoubtedly treated any other woman in his chauvinistic way. <br /> <br /> In fact, in everything that happens, there is not enough dramatic tension. do not fully compensate, and you do not care about any of the leading characters. One of those films where the actors probably liked to make it more than the audience watched it.
