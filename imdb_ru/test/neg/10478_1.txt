At first I must confess that the Separate World is my favorite book. So, of course, I have some prejudice against any attempt to adapt it for a feature film or a television film. But when I started watching this movie, I was more than ready to give him the advantage of doubt. The original version of the early 1970s, although filmed at Phillips Exeter Academy, where the author visited the school, and although it remained a faithful book, did not have any depth of feeling and could not grasp the essence of the characters. The original seemed to just go through the motions. Reading the trivia about the film, you find that it was filmed mostly with non-actors. So the original has an amateur feeling towards it, and it ultimately fails. <br /> <br /> This new version, although I admit that it captures the period’s look better than the original, seems to have thrown the book all together. Scenes are reordered, characters are superimposed where they do not belong, characters are created that were not in the book, and no attempt has been made to penetrate into deeper conflicts that make the book so compelling. And the main sin of all: the tree is not considered as vital, almost central character, which it is in the book. This is an unforgivable mistake by the filmmakers. How could they downplay the role of the tree? Why it was not introduced immediately? Why is the Dead Poet Eski Beginning? And what in the name of God was with a gin accent? This film, frankly, garbage. The “separate world” should not be difficult to adapt with a book or a scene. John Knowles wrote it in a completely beautiful, linear style. The filmmakers had to trust the story as it was already written; make changes, of course; decorate here and there, of course; Of course, take a soft dramatic license. But destroy one of the pearls of American literature in the process? What were they thinking about? In their storyline corruption, they exclude any possibility of waiting or drama. The whole movie is crumbling and failing. <br /> <br /> If you are a schoolboy or a college student who has been assigned to read this book, and you think about being stingy and just watching a movie ... don't even think about it. This movie will not help you. <br /> <br /> Alas, we will have to wait even longer before the version of this story comes out on the screen, which really makes it fair.
