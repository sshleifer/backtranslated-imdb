R Xmas is one of the few films I have seen where I can almost say that nothing is happening. It seemed to me that I was watching a middle-class couple doing drugs with a child, walking, eating, smoking, talking (I'm sorry, I swear) through most of the movie. And I do not believe that I am missing the point. I think this film was well directed, well acted (although the husbandâ€™s presentation was rather wooden), and the constant feeling of impending doom around every corner, of course, kept the viewer at ease. But when the dust cleared, you stayed with zero (just a bunch of fading). I did not want to chase the car, violence with the use of firearms, beatings, etc. In fact, I'm tired of violence. But, my God, let's dive at least a little into all these characters (let's get to know each of these corrupt officers a little better, and not just show their views with street thugs). Why was the dialogue so minor? Everyone spoke as if they were in junior high. I believe that even this side of our human race can say something other than fu_ _, sh_ _, and so on. D. The tempo and plot of R 'Xmas I found quite interesting, but the performance was simple and clear - empty.4 / ten
