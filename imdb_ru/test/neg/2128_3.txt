The man (Goffredo Unger) was discovered floating in the sea among the wreckage of his destroyed boat, near the coast of Florida. A helicopter raises him to find that both of his legs are missing under his knees. Dr. Stella Dickens (Valentina Monnier) and her partner Dr. Bob Hogan (Lawrence Morganth) are marine biologists and conduct research in the sea regarding dolphins. While at sea, Hogan hears a strange high noise. Intrigued, he and Stella are hiring Peter (Michel Sopkiu) and his assistant Sandra (Iris Peinado) to create a device to detect and track the source, or something like that, as this is not very clear. Meanwhile, a scientist by the name of Florinda (Sindia De Ponty as Cynthia Stewart), who works in a rival organization called "The International Ocean", is brutally murdered when she threatens to expose someone to the organization. More people are being attacked, and Sheriff Gordon (Gianni Garco, like John Garco) is in business. Peter, Stella, Hogan and Sandra went to sea. Soon they find evidence that something monstrous and very unfriendly hides beneath the surface. Together with rival scientist Professor Donald West (William Berger), Sheriff Gordon and the United States Army, they intended to destroy the monster, but there are other sinister forces, because someone does not want the genetic engineering creature to be exposed to Cost! Directed by Lamberto Bava in the role of John Olda Jr. - this is far from the classic Italian horror films and spray of the 70s and early 80s. The screenplay of Gianfranco Clerici, Herve Piccini and Dardando Sacchetti is very slow and will make most people sleep well until more than 90 minutes have passed. The monster is practically not used, large parts of this film consist of videos of boats and helicopters. The big chunks of the first half concentrate on the not so mysterious part of "who is behind this." In fact, there is nothing to talk about, a guy who has both legs bitten off, and someone with one arm about it. The special effects on the monster itself, as a rule, are bad, and this is manifested in very fast flashes, which are disappointing. The composition of virtual draws will not make it easier. There really is not much to recommend this film, so I will not. Do not worry, you can do much better.
