I just looked at it yesterday and wanted to read other people's comments, but I found some high marks. <br /> <br /> WHAT ??? It was probably the worst Asian horror movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * There were so many fundamental problems in this story. Many Asian horrors have a turn of mind that is trying to help, but it looks scary (with some exceptions: ring and ju-on). This is the case, except that they are not scary. A pretty Asian woman who looks a little pale is not at all scary. "Monk" straight up explains everything as a completely natural cycle of life; there is nothing wrong either. But the woman simply does not understand this, she would rather kill herself and her child than allow this poor ghost to reincarnate. My friend and I just laughed when she jumped off the building twice, and the ghost waited until the second time she told her why she was stalking her. This information would be nice to know before she began to jump, but it does not matter. <br /> <br /> * However, I liked the pair of parts right in the middle. First, she rides a taxi with a ghost (do ghosts take a taxi?), Which has a lot of excess hair, which for inexplicable reasons is HULL. Right after that, at the bus stop, you should see him, since he is pretty spoiled. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is a complete bomb, I gave him an extra point just for these two scenes above, This is a terrible Asian horror that makes ghosts fly in the female wombs almost beautifully, trying to scare you with the same images.
