The scariest thing about this horror movie is that the end hints at the sequel. The Cave is a really disappointing action movie. A team of cave and underwater explorers goes to Romania (one of these inexpensive places to make a film, at least for the moment) and, following the destroyed church, enters a cave, which turns out to be the realm of underground monsters. Or are they demons? The film never decides whether it wants to be a fighter, science fiction or horror, it is a mixture of everything without salt and fun and acted in a wooden manner. The best thing about the film is cinematography, but even the dark landscape of the cave soon becomes boring because the film lacks pace and the characters are simply not interested. Waste of time.
