Even at the dawn of human civilization, cavemen sat idle and joked, beat each other on the head with what they could ever grab, and women were never seen and, obviously, they once had tails. These cavemen lived in a geographically diverse region with a cockatoo, a camel, a monkey, but without women. This film tells about the "merry" misadventures of seven (or so) cavemen - burned on their land with a new discovery of fire - moving across the water to a new land, where they find this woman with an additional appendage. Along the way, we get such "wonderful" moments of comedy, like fat cavemen swallowing a frog that continues to caw in his stomach. The monkey throws stones at their heads. The man swallows the mouse so that the frog gets into his stomach. Mandatory "gay" caveman. The list goes on and on. This film is the very definition of a cinematic brawl. I was bored from the very beginning, and it only got worse when the cavemen hung around, hitting each other, making bad jokes like puns on the perch word, hitting each other, and beating poor Seth Berger, who seemed to have lost the bet to the producer appear in this nonsense. She is truly one of the two bright spots in this film. She's not very an actress, so you have to guess why she's an ass? Another “bright spot” is music. As soon as I heard the score, I told myself that it sounds very familiar. I never heard the real score, but the music certainly belonged to Ennio Morricone. This is a good result and the best thing in another rude, boring, obscene, inconceivable and ridiculous film, mainly about the group of Moes who first found a woman and first want to eat it as an animal, teaching what it can do. Awwwwwh Sorry, I suppress a yawn, reliving the plot! At the end of the film about 100 or so, mostly naked women on the screen with all the erotic feeling of scab from the knee. In this film it was painful to look and there was nothing special about it. The fact that he spawned a sequel does not surprise me, since he offers one thing that will cause the viewer interest - the tail.
