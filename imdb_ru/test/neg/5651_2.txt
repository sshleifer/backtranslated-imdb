Flatland is one of my favorite books, so I was looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately, the film is absolutely terrible. The dialogue is so bad that half sounds like improvisation. A new storyline makes me think that they took a book and a couple of newspapers, threw them into a blender and used what happened for the script. This is a shame for books and independent filmmaking. The only reason I managed to go through the whole film was my hope that it would be better. Unfortunately, it only got worse, the climax in a really backward final. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that everything about the film is bad. CG is acceptable, in the spirit of the "reset" of the 1990s, which I believe was the goal. And I suppose you will not go wrong if the “people” are split in half and there is blood everywhere.
