Of the four main players here - John Candy, Gene Kelly, Amy Madigan and Macauli Kolkin - the only one I had never heard of (at that time) was the one who irritated me and spoiled the film. Well, she must have done a decent job to make me throw her and VHS into the trash. I mean Kelly in the role of teenager Tia Russell. Ironically, six years later, she played an amazing and extremely pleasant role in the role of "Rowena Morgan" in "Mr. Holland's Opus." <br /> <br /> Candy, as usual, is interesting to watch as “Buck Russell” "or the title character" Uncle Buck. "Few actors were better than Candy, they played an attractive and unhappy bib. I liked his character here, but I can't look at this pampered girl more than once. In addition, in the first few minutes of the movie, a little boy “Miles” (Kauklin) utters the word “damn.” How bad is it when a six-year-old child says the name of the Lord on film in vain? Hollywood people are so sick. No wonder many of their childish actors are mentally unbalanced, and Kolkin can be cited as an example.
