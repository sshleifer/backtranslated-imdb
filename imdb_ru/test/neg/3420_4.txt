Summary: I’m not entirely familiar with Macbeth’s Shakespearean story, but my wild suggestion is that it’s pretty close to the original, just now. He tells the story of Macbeth, a member of the criminal syndicate in Melbourne (?). He is a valuable assassin in favor of leader Duncan. But he and his ladies have big ambitions, and they plan to kill Duncan and any rivalry with the throne. This is a story of betrayal and a cold, cruel death. <br /> <br /> Comments: A very interesting idea, I must say. To use history, but change the setting to the present, but keep the original (?) Dialog. This sets a huge contrast between classic poetic work and violence. Promised to be extremely cruel, it is a promise that it fulfills, but not in the form that I imagined. This is indeed very bloody, but the violence is slow. Not only figuratively speaking, that it is calculated, that too, but literally. Many actions actually slow down to a slowdown, and that’s what puts the film on its knees. <br /> <br /> What could be a unique force, the contrast between superfluous and poetic dialogue and extreme violence is now turning into something completely different. Now both painfully slow down the movement, so much so that sometimes it becomes boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Also, I cannot understand the context in which the three witches operate. To imagine time and reality, I believe that such magical witchcraft had no place in the film. Apparently, this is so, but it seems to me completely inappropriate. Not a plot, but a complete plot with its own rules, completely different from the rest of the film. It seems completely out of place. Surely, it might have been possible to transform this part into something modern. Perhaps drug-induced hallucinations (which, I suspect, the director is hinting at, but then he left too much witchcraft in him to be plausible)? Now they bring only those fragments of the film that are clearly behind this story, and I just waited for the real movie to start again. <br /> <br /> Explicit disappointment, but perhaps something for Shakespearean fans? <br /> <br /> 4/10
