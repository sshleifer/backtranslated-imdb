So, Vinorsky rewrites the Komodo Curse a second time, this time replacing the interesting characters of the original with a group of disgusting environmentalists / anti-capitalists. And he adds a cobra. Most of the film is about how self-satisfied heroes chat about evil capitalist pigs, and between this cavalcade of condescension, memories of what happened on the island pop up before they got there. Experiments were conducted with DNA, the creatures began to grow, people talked to each other without posing as morally superior assholes, etc. It is needless to say that the film would be much better if they made memories of the film and forgot about it. sanctimonious virtues. So that I do not forget, there are several short scenes scattered here and there, where the passage from the sanctuary comes off one by one, but they probably make up less than 2% of the film. The main event, in which our title characters run into each other, lasts about a minute and is just as exciting as watching the previews for the latest Dino-Crisis video game. <br /> <br /> Overall, the game is pretty bad, even for this kind. the movie. Half of the actors seem to be more concerned with the pronunciation of each last syllable of each word than by pronouncing their dialogue in any plausible way. <br /> <br /> I really got to the end, but this is one of those films that I would like to record and then watch later, because there are many parts that need to be quickly scrolled through. In general, I put this effort on a single star; there is absolutely no element in it that makes a B-movie interesting to watch. This is really a sad day when you can sincerely say that the creators of this film could learn something by watching Boa vs. Python.
