SKELETON MAN was fine for the first 5 minutes, but as soon as the so-called “Special Forces Agents” hit the screen, he went down faster than a fat child in a sleigh. <br /> <br /> An autopsy makes us think that we may have a banal, but funny horror film in our hands, but no ... the filmmakers destroy any hope for it when the "Special Forces Agents" appear. I would like the screenwriter to choose another path and make the Skeleton Man pursue some vague teenagers, until one of them finally gains the upper hand. Instead, "Skeletonik" pursues some vague "Special Forces Agents" and drives them away until their captain finally gains the upper hand. <br /> <br /> I know all the “tracking down of vague teenagers by killer killer” “it was done earlier, but it would be more suitable for such a film. <br /> <br /> When the Skeleton finally meets its “so-called” demise in an exploding building, a police officer asks the captain of the “Special Forces Agents”: “What the hell happened there?” My answer to this question: " Who cares?"
