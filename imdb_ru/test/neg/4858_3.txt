On this 22-minute short walk, preceding the previous, much better “Rock and Rule”, there are two mouse-singers who are not going anywhere. The female mouse, Yang, signs an agreement with the devil to become a hit rock star. So it depends on Daniel Mouse to save her soul. Made in the late 70s, it has all the attributes of this decade (shitty music, shitty clothes and hairstyle, terrible folk melodies). This cartoon is shown on the Second Disc of the Rock and Rule 2-Disc Collector's Edition; it also comes with a Making One that runs almost as much as the show itself. <br /> <br /> My rating: D +
