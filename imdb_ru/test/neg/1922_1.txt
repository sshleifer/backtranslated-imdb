*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** HERE ON EARTH / (2000) 1/2 * (out of four) <br /> <br /> Mark Piznarski "Here on Earth" is the record holder of the film containing the most recycled material in 96 minutes. Literally all the tricks, clichés and familiar elements of the plot are somewhere here; there is nothing unique, original or fresh. God, what a painful film! I would like to see the film during its theatrical release last year, so that he could make it on the worst list of my year. This is a film in which the story becomes immediately apparent and goes down from the opening credits, and, worst of all, takes itself seriously. "Here on Earth" is undoubtedly one of the most horrendous and painful films ever coming down from a pike. <br /> <br /> “Here on Earth” is a film for teen-heartbreakers, so it should contain some Hollywood films. most dear young people who are attractive and inexperienced enough to take part in a film as bad as this one. Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett are suitable for a different description and storm the main roles. Klein plays Kelly, an arrogant and defiant student with a rich father (number one cliche). He should graduate as a rogue and go to Ivy League College, following in the footsteps of his father (Stuart Wilson). This creates the cliché “I don’t want your life,” in which the father tries to control his son’s life and the son resists rebellion. Throw in the dead mother Kelly, who some time ago committed suicide. When his father brings another woman home, he severely questions his intentions (the cliche “no one can replace mother” is considered number two). <br /> <br /> Josh Hartnett plays Jasper, a character on the opposite side of Kelly's society. His family owns a local eatery. Enter his longtime love interest, Samantha Kavano (Lily Sobieski), a waitress at a diner who covers her sister (who has no goal instead of controlling the next scene) when Jasper and Kelly act like child morons by racing their own cars and (oh no) bump into a diner, causing it to catch fire. (Conflicts between rich and poor will be counted as cliché number three.) <br /> <br /> The unsuccessful pursuit of a car forces Kelly and Jasper to prepare for a contrived and believable conflict. They have problems with the law, but since this film considers it necessary to exist, the local judge assigns them an alternative to serving the sentence: they must work together to help restore the dining room. <br /> <br /> Two boys work during the summer, becoming strong and getting a good tan. Samantha is striking Kelly, and romantic sparks fly. Jasper is jealous, but wants the best for his true love (cliche number four). Her parents (Annette O'Toole and Bruce Greenwood) do not approve of her little romantic triangle (cliché number five), but she continues without thinking, continuing the two dimensions of Jasper’s time. Her father also turned out to be a local sheriff, which is amazing (let's count the melodramatic nugget number six). <br /> <br /> Invented romantic feelings between Kelly and Samantha are cliché number seven. But Samantha’s relationship with Jasper is never defined, as some kind of romantic tension may arise? If the film causes Samantha to participate in the choice between two young people, then we need to see both characters on both sides. In the film, Jasper distracts her "legitimate love" Kelly. It is clear that Jasper really loves her, but it is also clear that she does not love him back. This absolutely kills the romantic tension at the beginning of the story. <br /> <br /> Lily Sobieski is not harmful here; nevertheless, her charisma and goodwill do not match the character of two times, like Samantha. John Hartnett is also suitable for the role of Jasper, but the film does not give him anything other than to quarrel with Kelly. Chris Klein gets a name for himself here; he spends most of the movie shirtless, sweaty and overworked. Unfortunately, he does not demonstrate his acting skills, perhaps because he has very little. The cast is much more talented. Bruce Greenwood provides the best performance in the film, but he doesn’t have enough time to save, except for a few short moments. I also liked the performance of Stuart Wilson, who is ideally suited for the role of a rich, controlling father with a high social status. <br /> <br /> Then we tend to the problem of Samantha with the knee in exactly one hour and ten minutes in the film (there is another spoiler ahead). What is it, she has a serious incurable disease (another trick in the picture, about number eight). Her incurable disease unites two competing young people as friends, well, at least I think the film intended to show that the loss of one beloved by two opponents can unite both (cliché number nine). > <br /> Klein rehearses his farewell speech to demonstrate that his character is not just a superficial stereotype, but we have seen it many times before I would prefer a rich character, rather than a deeply sentimental, who hides real feelings ( cliche, it Ten)? The conflicts between Kelly and Jasper are desperate and pointless; The comment "your mother" causes a fistfight while they are rebuilding the establishment. In Armageddon, a second reading occurs when Samantha and Kelly stretch in an open field, excited to hell, when he slowly moves his fingers along her body, calling areas after US cities (why not call this number eleven). In the film, alcohol is used as a means to heighten romantic tension: the intoxicated Kelly fools himself after a fight with Samantha's girlfriend, Jasper, but the next day he repeats the desire to just dance and lose the score).
