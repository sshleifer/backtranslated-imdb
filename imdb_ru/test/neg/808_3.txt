As a South African who again lives in South Africa after a 32-year stay in the UK, I am sorry to say that this film is a huge disappointment. I had three major problems with the film: a) Why did Swank and Eghifor - American and Nigerian - play a major role? This country is full of talents and does not need to be imported ... b) Gillian Word has been selling its credentials for several years now. She is a very mediocre writer, and even her novel does not withstand Mr. Hooper's sluggish leadership ... and c) Hilary Swank again, such a wonderful actor that was proven in the movie "Million Dollars" (but this is also Eastwood), here dressed York-style, while freely wandering around the poverty of Karoo. Where was the attention and sensitivity needed by the client and the director? Yes, the movie ends up moving - how could it not be? - but the general mood in custody is one of tremendous disappointment. The heart is in the right place, but it needs a stimulator.
