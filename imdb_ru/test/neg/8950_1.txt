This series is template and boring. Episodes are the same thing every week, just with slightly different settings. Some purely evil character commits a despicable act, Walker comes after him, and this ends with a karate match. Villains are super-clichés, super-stereotypical evil-doers, good guys are clean, honest and holy, and storylines are simplistic and unreal. After about 2 episodes, the show becomes completely inaccessible to everyone except the least astute fans. Of course, not the best work of Norris. His other work may be cliché, but usually it does not last for weeks. If you like formal, boring, repetitive cliché festivals, then this is for you.
