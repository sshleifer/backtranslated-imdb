The two most notable things in I Won't Play are: he won the Oscar for best double-drum short film of 1944; and it was directed by the leading man of the silent era, Krane Wilber. The plot of this mediocre short film is irrelevant, the dialogue lacks a spark, while acting is no better and no worse than in most of the 1940s Hollywood war films (in other words, it's terrible). Admittedly, there are moments when “I will not play” is ridiculous - the absolutely artificial appearance and delivery of the line of Janice Page are precious - but laughs at the picture, not at it.
