Rarely will anyone deny that Hitchcock remains one of the most creative, inventive and prolific directors of all time, because he is probably all these things. It takes a real genius to scare generations of viewers from showering and wearing neckties. The saboteur, however, is not creative or fertile at all. Rather, Hitchcock decided with the sincere intention to create a film to collect “American Pride”, a certain call to arms, the name “support our troops”, which was a popular theme of that time. With this in mind, Hitchcock seriously underestimated other important aspects of the film, including, but not limited to, the logical plot, characterization, plausible dialogue, and cursory, running storyline. <br /> <br /> As a rule, Hitchcock does an excellent job with spy movies, having achieved cinematic greatness just a few years earlier with “Foreign Correspondent” and “39 steps”, but seemingly lost success in creating Diversant and just reworked the same once-fascinating story line from both his previous excursions readily provided. Without going into details, I will give a list of the main problems of several films: <br /> <br /> 1. Despite the fact that his face is smeared on every newspaper throughout America, the only one who recognizes Kane is blind. <br /> <br /> 2. At a dinner party, Kane and Patricia do not want to run out the door, because the bad guys can grab them and tell the party that they are “breaking the gates”. Logically, what's stopping the spies from grabbing them and saying this at any time during the evening? Also, is it necessary to remind anyone that Kane is a wanted terrorist? <br /> <br /> 3. Since when is the fan belt cutting through the handcuffs? <br /> <br /> 4. No one recognizes him ... his face on EVERY NEWSPAPER !!! <br /> <br /> 5. Spies catch up with Kane in a ghost town and suggest that he is the man Freeman sent to work with them ... should he not have any powers? I know that spies don’t run around with photo tags and photo IDs, but maybe a secret handshake? <br /> <br /> 6. A policeman takes Kane, who escapes Freeman's house, but nobody seems to recognize this guy. <br /> <br /> 7. How exactly did the FBI believe Kane without proof? They don't even show that Kane is talking to the FBI, the scene just disappears, and we are forced to assume that everything has now become kosher. <br /> <br /> 8. When the police search the Carnival Caravan, how do they know that Kane is with a woman? The blind believed that the story of Kane, therefore, would not logically report that his daughter was missing, kidnapped or, more importantly, fled with Kane. Why is there no logic in this movie? <br /> <br /> This is the current list. The film is not exciting, the plot does not make sense, and the world is full of people who willingly deliver wanted terrorists to their homes and cars every day, because this is not so important. Hitchcock fails miserably at this.
