Well, it was a “risky” move to rent this film, but I thought I had nothing to lose. Well, I was wrong. This, next to the "Bloodsurf", is the worst "horrible" I have ever seen. Crappy actors, crappy tech out, crappy story and so on. The soundtrack is not bad though. That is why I give him 2 when voting, not just 1. And, of course, cats are a positive surprise. Of course, the main actors in this film ..... Do not rent or buy it. Stay away from this and hope that this horrible, horrible film will disappear for an obscure existence and will not become a “cult classic.” It definitely does not deserve any recognition.
