Well, I thought it would be terrible. But when I saw this .. I was wrong. Emily Bergl did an excellent job, as did Jason London. Sue Snell was underused and underwritten. Mines were fine, Dylan Bruno and Rachel Blanchard definitely stand out. As for what teenagers do, and how people claim that everything is wrong. No difference. My friends and I often use the term “swank,” and I drove a car, and someone drove me when I changed. It's pretty much all there. I just never been to a party after playing in such a big house with my own light show. Death is good. The best includes a pair of points, a spear and a pool ... everything is in that order. I have to say that there will be people who hate it .. but I am not one of them.
