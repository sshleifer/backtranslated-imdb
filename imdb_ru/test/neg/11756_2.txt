In fact, this is a movie above average, but why was it made in the name of God? It’s impossible to treat him as if I was myself, because it was almost converted into a remake class of the 1960 classic Alfred Hitchcock. You will not be able to watch it without a 1960 film knocking you into consciousness. <br /> <br /> What does the word "credit" mean? How can we attribute to Van Sandt and his partners anything other than the decision to use different actors, slightly different decorations and colors? <br /> <br /> Anne Heche is attractive, but she lacks Janet Lee’s firm determination to become a respectable middle class. woman. And Heche is younger than Lee, which led to her fruitless attempt to marry and settle down, the despair of a woman over forty. And Heche does not project anxiety, as Lee did. The scene in which the CHP officer looks out his car window illustrates the weakness of the role. In the original, the officer asks: “Is something wrong?” Lee: “Of course not. Do I act as if something is wrong?” The officer hesitates before answering: "Well, frankly, yes." This exchange is excluded from the remake for the simple reason that Heche is not nervous enough. <br /> <br /> The worst change, without a doubt, is replacing Vince Von with Anthony Perkins. Perhaps this is not the fault of Won. Who could compare with Perkins in the role? Perkins is a cocky, bird-like, with a long neck, covered with a seemingly charming appearance that masks the internal vacuum. His every movement (eating sweet corn, with the swaying of his Adam's apple) and every utterance, weak laughter, dry chuckle, just in place. It simply cannot be improved. Vaughn brings to the role of the presence of a short-haired, pumped-up guy who has just been fired from his position as a junior corporal from the US Army. To suggest his psychosis, all he can do is to put a manic chuckle on top of what otherwise seems perfectly normal Norman in speech and manner. (Unlike the original Norman, Vaughn doesn't even stumble about the word "delusion" because it resembles a phallus.) He can just hang around the motel, waiting to hear about his application for a football scholarship to the University of California at Los Angeles. <Br /> <br /> The direction deserves a few comments. I don't see what this adds to the story when we see Norman masturbating by looking at Anne Heche. I do not mind this. I wonder why this is there, just as I wonder why the rest of the film is there. <br /> <br /> And, I suppose, to impress us how much color adds to the visual experience, Van Sant seems to have missed some more subtle things of Hitchcock. Heche is given underwear of different colors - green, pink, orange and - mango? Is it color? If so, what the hell is it? Nevermind. The fact is that in the original, when a passing camera looks into the window of the Phoenix Hotel for the first time, she removes Janet Lee in bed, dressed in a pure white semi-box and a white bra. Later, after she stole the money, we again see her in her underwear - this time both her slip and black bra. This is a trifle, but Hitch by itself. <br /> <br /> In this case, the idea of ​​shooting in color could be a good idea if it were not for the original black and white photography. The color and weird lighting effects in this version transform a normal, boring and subconsciously sinister motel into something like the harshest part of Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Most of the 1960 film was shocking in many ways than one. I remember seeing him in a car in San Diego and looking at the screen with horror when it became clear that the main character is actually DEAD - halfway through the movie! Nothing like this has been done before. <br /> <br /> This murder in the soul, in both films, was a great improvement over the original novel by Robert Bloch, by the way, in which the author writes something like: "Then the killer went into the bathroom and cut off her head with a knife "I don't make it up. Well, not quite. Even here, the film Van Sant gives us an excess. There is more blood and more naked flesh. And where Hitchcock first approached the blood flowing around the bath and disappeared into Marian’s fully open eye, then slowly pulled the camera back to show her face, he turned the camera from a slight inclination to the correct vertical, giving the viewer a feeling not just of disbelief in the murder but dizzy disbelief. Van Sant does not tilt the camera by 10-20 degrees, as Hitchcock did. It practically rotates it around its axis. <br /> <br /> You shouldn’t call it Hitchcock’s bow because it’s not. This is a monetary robbery of Hitchcock's material (already broken in “Psycho” I, II, III, IV and “Psycho: the beginning of the year”, as well as “Come into my room: Revenge of Mrs. Bates” and “Serve me”). This knife is not it? The true story of Norman Bates. “) Rephrasing and splitting up truly original things, a brutal, if not criminal act. And not to mention the many merits in other films, especially French ones, such as the notorious scenes of the“ ocean of boredom ”between Marcel Brühl and Jeanne Gato “La Mere de la Nuit.” (Maybe I should add that the last sentence is a terrible attempt at a parody of academic critics. And when chicken guts grind corn, this is a “rough” act. How are they more fun than a film.) < br /> <br /> So for whom it was done? I should wives would guess. Children who are too young to know about the original and who don't like movies in black and white? Children who hope to see another regular slasher? Chimpanzee?
