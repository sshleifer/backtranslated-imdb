“Italian Work” is a film with capers, shot by number. Being on the back of each caper cliche, it rises without any special heights and will become a note to the film by the end of the month. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that “Italian work” does not have any imagination at all. I saw it all before and did better then. Filming is in order, cinematography is quite acceptable, but this film does not reveal any new grounds. <br /> <br /> Let's note the cliché: <br /> <br /> - “the father of the old school”, the figure of the criminal and his protégé <br /> <br /> - another gang member who envies the protégé <br /> <br /> - double cross <br /> <br /> - only the bad guys use weapons, and the good guys - the criminals do not need <br /> <br /> - good criminals always outwit the bad guys <br /> <br /> And this is about the first fifteen minutes. Everything is so predictable. Even scenes of robbery and car chases, presumably the highlight of the film, seem pretty ordinary. This is especially true since they appeared in movie trailers, so I already knew what to look for. <br /> <br /> For me, a caper film works only if it contains an element of realism - perhaps, just maybe, it could be done without relying on deux ex machina or "just because" moments. Parts of “Italian work” just throw it out the window: computers do what computers can't do, good guys don't hit anyone with their car (especially going down the stairs), and not a single police car responds to the street blasts, recklessly controlled mini or even low-flying helicopter. It must be hell because of these things, so as not to evaluate the reaction. <br /> <br /> The game is quite bearable, and the film crew (Seth Green, Jason Stretham and Mos Def) is at least fun to watch. Mark Wahlberg is too clever as the hero of the “good guy,” and Charlize Theron is the only actor to show a certain range. Donald Sutherland, as always, is a group act and reveals the weaknesses of Walberg every time they are together. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a rather uninteresting film. Considering the IMDb ratings, it’s girls who really love this film, which I can understand to some extent, but there are also such best caper films that even the helplessness of the recent Ocean Eleven overshadows the non-event that is Italian Work. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> In conclusion, think about what will happen to the character of Norton. Should we encourage the good guys for causing his death, especially since it will be long and painful? He did not deserve this by simplifying a goosebump. <br /> <br /> *** END SPOILER ***
