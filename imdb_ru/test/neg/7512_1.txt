If you like me, you will see it in a movie history lesson or something similar in your school, try to convince your teacher to see something else. believe me, everything is better than this movie. it's a slow pace, tangled, boring, poorly built, terrible, dirty, do i need to continue? This is a good idea, but I have seen that they are better dealt with in several other films. The game is not even good. This film is even more awkward because it starts as funny (though not intentional) because of its surrealistic story than it just becomes uncomfortable to watch in the end. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I feel that 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life have been robbed. Why would anyone want to watch the girls describe the top three for 10 minutes, watch them ride through the cork for 20 minutes, listen to the hippie that can make sheep appear, witness rape, see the role of the female is eaten by her husband. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this film deserves nothing but 1/10. And if you are unhappy with my preview, seriously, I'm an open guy, and I like films that protest through symbolism, but this film was just awful. apologize to avoid this movie.
