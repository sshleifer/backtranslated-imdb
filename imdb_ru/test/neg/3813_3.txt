As with the Blair Witch Project, Ax has received its own significant share of bottom-up advertising (as an avid reader of Fangoria magazine, full-page advertising is hard to miss); even after its average theatrical performance, the film will necessarily exist solely against the background of deception, and, perhaps, at some point will turn into a cult object. With a MySpace URL and a powerful (albeit mysteriously subjective) promise to preserve the so-called “old-school American horror,” Hatchet will attract many curious seekers with their DVD release (where this statement is decorated on the disc itself) Ain't It Cool News about advertising made me approach the film with some trepidation (it seems that Harry Knowles and his henchmen will approve any film for VIP passes and free food), but “Hatchet” makes me wonder what it really is an idea writer-director Adam Green of "old school American horror": on the basis of the facts presented here, this means the end of tasteless looting 80s "Friday the 13th" and "Freedom". Characters are disgusting stereotypes (black type of Chris Tucker, surviving Chick, Topless Bimbos, Requisite old couple, Asian tour guide), whose interactions are clouded by painful dialogues trying to be fashionable, and, as a rule, obvious strokes of humor are bad as "Cabin Fever" , but still); in the script, there are too many indents (for example, the scene of a “rustling bush”), and “Hatchet” turns out to be as typical as any postmodern slasher of the last decade, with its only distinguishing feature - an elaborately designed advertising machine. I praise him slightly for blood - if you can get through the gasket between the killings, red wine is definitely a miracle, and the only real reason to watch it.
