Harry Knowles has a quote right on the cover of the DVD that says "Next icon of horror." Really?!?!?!? I heard a lot of excitement around this, but was not completely convinced. Nevertheless, I am a devoted horror fan and will give a chance to any horror movie. Regardless of budget or rating, you never know where you will find the next gem. Not here. Not an ax. The ax is badly thought out, acts badly and is not amused. The fact that you have actors who played Freddie Jason and Candyman, and chic topless Buffy with tons of blood, does not make you an expert on horror. Excuse me. I do not even want to describe the plot, because it is so stupid. Honestly, my money is on Rob Zombies. There is a man who knows the horror of the old school. Forget this trash.
