Firstly, this film works on what it bothers. I really didn’t like to see all these scenes where people heal alive, and so on. D. Strange strange erotic entry gives a feeling of necrophilic wonder. This is somewhat ... unpleasant to me personally. But the film really works in this respect, and it is supposed to be scary, so I give it its due. Yes, there are a few points for these scalpels and ... well, damn it, a disturbing idea of ​​getting sick alive. <br /> <br /> But this film lacks an interesting plot, characteristics or real surprises. The entire horror genre of teenage cinema usually passes very simply, predictably. A lot of "tense" moments, creepy guys who are insane, and the main question: is the guy really a murderer? This film fits into the category of "Scream" and countless others that appeared in the 90s. Well, I won’t spoil it for you, but I don’t really know who the killer is. We find out who it is halfway through ... and from there, the film goes on, trying to fill up some time ... pretty boring, to say the least. I looked a little at the clock in this film. <br /> <br /> The lead actress is gorgeous, as usual, but the cardboard box in which she is placed causes pain ... a college student who is a detective who everyone thinks is insane, but she really knows that going on. And the cops? Aah, they just laugh and eat donuts. Very predictable, flat, sometimes troubling, and most importantly boring and boring ... It’s like the American film company flew to Germany to make a film to make it a stranger ..... hmmm ..... or are they? <br /> <br />
