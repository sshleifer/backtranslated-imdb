Seriously, if you want to watch a horror movie cliché, you should see it, I think. It contains all the “scary parts where nothing happens,” “a type of botany who is not really killed,” “a boy and a girl get together and survive,” “face old childhood fear,” etc. I wanted to watch this movie because I tried a combination of a video game and a movie to make it work. I think I was wrong. What makes the film more tolerant? It's only 1 hour 17 minutes, so if you are bored, it may be a good idea, although I’m rather bored. Why not see it at all? Frankie Munitz, he's Malcolm, is just as annoying as a nerd. I could hit the guy, and it's so sad that he didn't die earlier, and in the end he even came back. See something else!
