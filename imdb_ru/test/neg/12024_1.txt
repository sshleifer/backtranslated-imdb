What to say about the "Dead End Road" ... <br /> <br /> Let's just say: Edgar Allen Po would be so ashamed. The acting, the scripts, the effects and everything in this movie were just awful. It doesn't even do justice! This film was the biggest trash that I had to worry about. That's why I stopped it about 20 minutes before the final, because personally I didnâ€™t care what happened to the characters. I saw badly, but it was definitely the worst. I was bloated for this because I am a Pau fan, and it was just bad. Just bad. <br /> <br /> What makes me sad is that you can't rate movies with negative numbers.
