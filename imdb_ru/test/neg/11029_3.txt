This film does not have a clear idea of ​​who he is or wants to be. There are some good moments when Stewart is on the screen and they give him a few lines to work with. Best of all, he works at an early age as a romantic comedy, but the story moves to a more dramatic territory and is lost in the process. By the last fifteen minutes or so, plot twists are just dramatic clichés. <br /> <br /> A shot with an airplane resembles the remaining footage from another movie. <br /> <br /> The main reason I can watch this is if you want to say you have seen all the Jimmy Stewart films.
