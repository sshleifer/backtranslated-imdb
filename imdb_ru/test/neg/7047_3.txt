Why watch this movie? He probably rates the award as the worst career move of a major movie star after the ridiculous play of Clark Gable with the Irish patriot in Parnell. <br /> <br /> It’s impossible to imagine that Bergman chose this film and its director, and not a lucrative career in Hollywood, where she could choose among the best writers and directors offered at the time. To begin with, there was no script for the work, except for a few notes. Then we must believe that the polished Bergman is a poor refugee, ready to do everything to be released from the refugee camp, including marriage with a poor Italian fisherman, whom she does not even like. I read where Anna Magnani was the original choice for this piece. If so, it made much more sense than throwing the luminous Bergman into such a proletarian unit. But since she was in love with her director, common sense flew out of the window. <br /> <br /> She is leaving to live in this poor village where men have to work in order to get a meager life from the sea. A place that she clearly does not like, and where she does not fit. <br /> <br /> Her only friend is a village priest who knows that she is not suitable for the life of a poor fisherman’s bride, but tells her that for the sake of love she must suppress her true feelings of disgust and accept poverty and despair, she faces everyday. Besides all this, this volcano is always on the verge of eruption and drowning in hot lava. But, like a real heroine, Bergman rebelled against his sufferings, declaring war on almost everyone else in this dark movie. She even goes so far as to seduce a village priest in a scene that would cause laughter if she were not so pathetic. Since her poor husband must lock her up in the room so that she does not run away, she is forced to use her body to bribe a married man to take her out of the island. For her, no sacrifice is too great; there is no person inaccessible if he wants to help her escape from the island and its suffering. I will not tell you how it will end. Ending a movie without a script is as believable as the rest of STROMBOLI. I even remember (after watching on TV in the late evening) that he had two different ends! So be careful if you feel brave enough to sit through this royal turkey and catch a lost Bergman. This led to her falling in Hollywood for the next seven years, and she was convicted for having slept with her director while still married to Peter Lindstrom. None of the films she made with this director (which she later married) deserves attention, except as proof that her career has gone insane. I am not kidding. This is pretty awkward. <br /> <br /> - - SoundTrack
