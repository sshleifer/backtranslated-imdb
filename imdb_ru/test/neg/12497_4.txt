Plot Summary: Los Angeles in the future. Basic trackers control crime, android killers, sent by a computerized computerized US judicial system to execute the perpetrators. Secret Service agent Eric Phillips prevents an attack on his boss, Senator Robert Dilley (the man who created the USCJS), from the Union for Human Rights, a group of activists against cars. Dilly tries to initiate Phillips into his personal circle, but the SS agent runs on the run after Dilly killed UHF agent in cold blood. Dilly sends Core Trackers after him. Phillips joins the UHR group and helps them uncover a conspiracy involving Dilly. <br /> <br /> Cyber ​​Tracker is the first of many sci-fi / action hybrids created by Richard Pepin, co-founder of PM Entertainment. , powerhouse militants in the 1990s. Pepin's other films include Hologram Man, T-Force, Silencers and Dark Rock. Peppy movies usually start with a basic sequence of actions that lasts about 10 minutes before the plot begins to act. The script of this film has several holes in the plot ?? it is never clear that the heroes are actually trying to stop the plot. As for acting, Don “The Dragon” Wilson may be tough, but he cannot play for beans, with a little charisma. His colleagues are much better. The best bet in the film is the fighting scenes that kindle an impressive artillery fire, a huge number of people, and not one, but three moments when the vehicle flies through the air, turns over and falls to the ground, exploding. The border of visual effects is on the cheap side, and the music is restrained and piercing.
