Lord, it sucks. There is a special kind of sexual revolution, filmed in the 60s, which managed to confuse sexual violence with sexual liberation. This film is an example. I lost count of how many times women are beaten, beaten, beaten or slapped in a film. And then all the time women in the film fantasize about being beaten, beaten, beaten or slapped (you know they want it, right?). Sometimes this is supposedly part of a safe fetish game. In other cases, this is clearly not the case, but you will wait in vain for the heroine to inform the authorities that she has just been raped. Instead, we hear her rapist lecture on her inability to “let go.” <br /> <br /> Each scene of this film smells of misogynist (speaking of a straight white married man at the age of 30), not a lesbian student who studies adolescent problems with a chip on her shoulder so as not to be mistaken). <br /> <br /> Perhaps one good thing about this film is that it serves as a sharp reminder of how bad things really were for women just a few short decades ago.
