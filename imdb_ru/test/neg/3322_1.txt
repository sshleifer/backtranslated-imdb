I am usually not inclined to write reviews about films that I think do not deserve a mention. But in my desire to become a writer and film critic, I feel that it is important to express my thoughts when I don’t like the film. "Queen of the Damned" - one of these films. <br /> <br /> Popular scary stories about Ann Rice about Lestat, a bisexual vampire, first appeared on the screen in 1994 in the successful Interview with the Vampire. Starring the two main heavyweights of Hollywood - Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt - the stylish aesthetic and gothic stage setting of the film captured the public. Although this may have been the case when it came to content, there was something that worked, despite its chessiness (I was never so in love with the vampire genre as a whole). <br /> <br /> Since then, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise have been doing much bigger things. Probably both would have roared with laughter when asked to appear in the sequel. They would have laughed even more when they saw the final result. "Queen of the Damned" is a type of cr * r Hollywood that is ready to be released at a low price with the hope of making quick money thanks to an average soundtrack and a large marketing campaign designed for children aged 13 to 17 years. /> <br /> Needless to say, this film is terrible from the very beginning. Lestat, now played by Brit Stewart Townsend from "Shooting Fish", wakes up from his dark grave to the sound ... you guessed it, Nu-Metal. He infuriates some embarrassed punk musicians and joins their group, provided that he appears only at night, when the sun burns his skin and all day ... <br /> <br /> Jesse (Margarita Moreau) student paranormal phenomena (perhaps Vampire Research 101), trying to find out if Lestat really is who he says he is. On the way, she falls in love with him (something related to her strange past), but has little competition in Queen Akasha (Alia), the queen of the Vampire demons, who returns from the underworld to acquire Lestat as her elected King. <Br /> <br /> The film shamefully indulges its desires, but its picky tone leaves room for its humiliating humor. Anyone who sees this film for nothing but good laughter should see more films in general! Watch Townsend nice. He knows that the role completely rolls over and does everything possible to get through the tightrope between full pressure and serious play. The late Aliya, unfortunately, is terrible in the title role. She has the minimum time on the screen, and what she has, she does not use to the full. Bad makeup and special effects do not help; at times it sounds like it is talking through a voice box. <br /> <br /> It is rumored that this film went straight to the video before Aliya’s untimely death last year. With the opportunity to see her final film, Warner Bros released it to the general release. Otherwise, it would be one of those films that you see on the shelf in video stores, but avoid it because you can say it would be just awful. <br /> <br /> No doubt, such films will be shot. Take a look at the stream of teenage rom-com breaks around or on the spoofing of this genre itself with films like “Not Another Teen Movie”. If there is a market that can be used, Hollywood will do just that. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I encountered in this film is not the film itself. Hollywood is making money, so if there is a market for this film, they will chase it. This is a business. But what worries me most is that people will actively go to the movies and pay money to watch it! I think this is the biggest argument in the world of cinema: is cinema the first, and entertainment the second, or vice versa? The only people who can decide that this is the audience. If you like good movies and are intrigued, stay away from this turkey.
