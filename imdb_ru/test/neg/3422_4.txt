The Macbeth Game was written by William Shakespeare between 1604 and 1606. Since then, many other versions of the play have been released, including remakes, completed in 1948, 1971 and 2006. Akira Kurosawa even shot the Japanese version of Macbeth. in 1957 under the name "Kumonosu Jô". The play begins with King Duncan learning about the success of his two generals, Macbeth and Banco, in a recent battle with the Irish and Norwegians. After a quick promotion from Duncan, Macbeth instantly gains a strange feeling of thirst, greed and power and does everything possible to gain access to the crown: even if it includes murder. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Wright tried to create his own version of the famous play in 2006, putting it in the modern underground world of Melbourne. Imagine a humble Macbeth killing hundreds of soldiers with the AK-47 and at the same time beating “Low” in his performance. Just kidding over the latter, but he does only traditional Shakespeare. And he continues this throughout the film. Like this! Shakespeare meets the ghetto. That's all you could hope for! Not?? The latest “Macbeth” is rather crude and brutal to match any other modern action movie, but it lacks decent acting skills, proper jargon and good camera work technique. <br /> <br /> A modernized film begins with Macbeth (Sam Worthington), who works as an assassin / drug dealer in Duncan (Gary Sweet), a drug lord from Melbourne, Australia. After Duncan was assigned to Tan Glamis (as the three witches predicted), aspiration begins to capture Macbeth when he looks at the throne. After advancing Macbeth, Duncan invites himself to the Macbeth house for a night of drugs and alcohol. Before the start of the holiday, Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hall) persuades Macbeth to kill Duncan in order to seize power over the throne. After the bodyguards are drunk and everyone is sleeping, Macbeth sneaks into Duncan's room and wounds him to death. After killing Macbeth, he takes all of Duncan’s possessions, including the hidden title and crown. As soon as he thinks that he got what he wanted, he discovers that to solve his problems will take more than bribery and escape. <br /> <br /> One of the main drawbacks of the film was acting. Once bright and energetic Macbeth suddenly turns into a woman. And he looks like a sad puppy throughout the entire movie. I really do not know whether it was the fault of Worthington or Wright, but in any case, one of the two had to understand that Macbeth was the king, not the knot on the beam, which literally perceived everything his wife could say. As I said earlier, Macbeth should have been rude, arrogant, and angry. But when his character changes to a drug baron, he, I believe, also changes his personality. On the other hand, Lady Macbeth really knew how to nip it in the bud when it came to recognizing and impersonating her character. She didn’t look as angry as in the play or the 1971 version, but she’s reminiscent of Macbeth that, compared to murder, something else he could do wasn’t exactly the same. <br /> <br /> Another thing that seemed unpleasant to me is nudity. This accident was supposed to be Wright's mistake. The Witches didn’t do acting, unless you call yourself a parade in an acting costume for a birthday party. At some point in the film, I began to wonder whether I was watching Macbeth or Unique Positions Vol. 2. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong when I say that Shakespeare’s dialogue is inappropriate. He is spoken perfectly, but when the Australian gangster speaks, it’s just weird. When Macbeth starts killing people, he first informs them about it, talking to them in old English. Macbeth contains many actions, blood, blood, and nudity to last someone’s life. You forget all the positive facts, although when you start thinking to yourself: “Well, what the hell did he just say in this last sentence?” In some moments of the movie I don’t even think that the actors themselves knew what they were saying. The new era of the film could be easily removed if it were not for "You" and "You." <br /> <br /> Working with the camera was just fair for me. One thing I could not stand was the constant movement back and forth between the characters. The camera technique used emitted Blair Wich's vibration and made me vomit a little in my mouth. Matt Reeves tried to apply the same concept of working with the camera in the Clover field, but it just does not work. It makes me want to get up from my chair and look at the little barf bags that they conveniently put on each seat on the planes. <br /> <br /> Looking back at all of this, gangsta Macbeth has one positive thing: a lot of action. In addition, the film is nothing but a boring game, proper use of the English language and turning the camera. The soundtrack contains one or two identical songs, but each song is edited or remixed differently for each scene. There is never a variation of interesting or exciting media. From now on, the directors should leave the dangerous drug to the underworld Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro. Macbeth’s future performances should be created just as Shakespeare intended to stage a play 400 years ago. I would recommend using medieval clothing, Ye Olde English, swords and shields, and the Enya soundtrack. But in any case, modern Macbeth makes you crave good folk music, a bonfire and a bustier.
