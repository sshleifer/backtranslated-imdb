"The Man from Utah" opens with a singing cowboy playing a guitar on horseback. That's how we met John Weston (John Wayne), going to the city and looking for work. When he helps Marshal Higgins (George Pre-Gabby Hayes) to prevent the bank from being robbed with his bizarre shooting, the Marshal offers him a secret job as a deputy to investigate the Dutton Rodeo. Apparently, the annual winners of big prize money in rodeo are a close-knit group of bad guys in Spike Burton (Ed Peil), who also heads the rodeo committee. Serious contenders for the superiority of the main henchman Barton Cheyenne Kent (Yakima Kanutt) are seriously ill or dead. <br /> <br /> Even in the 1930s, John Wayne had a charismatic presence in the film “The Lone Star” that hinted at the quality of a future star. If for nothing else, seeing Wayne so young in these films is a real pleasure. The film itself moves at a fast pace of fifty-three minutes, most of which is occupied by rodeo shots in which you can play, play bulldog, as well as parade and dance in India. At the rodeo decisive event, Weston avoids a catastrophe by finding a poisoned needle inserted into the seat of the Dynamite, a previously unused bronco, on which he must survive Cheyenne. <br /> <br /> The ending did not come as a surprise, since the bad guys of Burton refused to participate in the rodeo competition and went for a pot with a prize fund of thirty thousand dollars, which is stored in a local bank. But Marshal and Weston are there to thwart their plans and save the day for Rodeo Valley Valley. And, as we have seen before in films like Arizona Heaven and Randy Rides Alone, Wayne's character closes the film in the clinch with a pretty young lady, this time Judge’s daughter Marjorie Carter (Polly Ann Young) throughout the entire film.
