The Bone Collector is installed in New York and begins with the fact that one of the world's leading experts in the field of criminology and criminologists Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) had an accident, because of which he is bedridden. Jump forward by four years. Alan (Gary Swanson) and his wife Lindsay Rubin (Olivia Birkelund) are abducted, shortly after a New York police officer Amelia Donahy (Angelina Jolie) is called to the crime scene and finds Alan’s buried and mutilated body. Amelia notices some unusual clues at the crime scene and notes them that Rhyme is impressive when asked to work on a case, and he quickly realizes that the evidence is in fact mysterious clues about Lindsey's whereabouts. Having understood the clues, the police come too late to save her, but this is only the beginning, when the serial killer-sadist continues to kill and leave clues for Rhyme and the police ... <br /> <br /> Director Phillip Noyce I watched The Bone Collector last night, and I have to say that this is one of the worst big budget posts, “Silence of the Lambs” (1991) and Se7en (1995), which I have ever seen, in fact, it makes Friday the 13th (1980). ) Look elegant and realistic! Jeremy Iacon's script was based on the book of Jeffrey Deaver and is so poor on many levels that I don’t even know where to start. First, he perceives himself to be mortally serious, which makes all the other faults two times worse. The characters are really terrible, and I did not believe that one of them was a real person. First, we have Lincoln Rhyme, who was paralyzed from neck to tip, and the script can do little with him, in fact, he literally can do nothing but lie in bed for the whole movie. Amelia seemed to be impressed with him, because she stopped the train and thought that the fresh trail next to the dead man might matter, I’m not funny, but doesn’t any policeman realize that the trail next to the murder victim could have is the value? ? Why is he so impressed with her? In addition, there is Kapatin Cheney, who is not only unattractive and screaming at everyone for no apparent reason, but also so incompetent that he could not link several murders committed in a short period of time, when each victim’s parts were surgically removed. How exactly did this guy become the captain of the police? Then there is the killer, whose motives are less than plausible. Are you trying to tell me that they developed a convoluted plan to kill at least seven people because they spent six years in prison for what they really did? If they wanted to take revenge on Rhyme, why did they kill all those people who had nothing to do with anything, I could just buy someone who wanted to take revenge on the guy who cleaned them, but not kill a few other people, which have nothing to do with yourself Target Rhyme anything else. In addition, after developing an intricate plan to kill these people and get away with hands, they suddenly turn into the stupidest person in history because, despite holding a big knife and able to walk and use their hands, they are actually defeated and almost killed by a quadruped who has no movement in his body below his neck! How did it happen? I should also mention Amelia, who is a terrible character, she actually buys her own camera to take photos from the crime scene and shoots rats for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> In addition to some of the worst characters ever written, the story and plot is not much better. We will never know why the killer uses the Bone Picker book as inspiration. We will never know why the killer took pieces of flesh from his victims. It never explains why a police recruit, such as Amelia, is allowed to enter crime scenes even earlier than the relevant forensic teams. There is no reason why a killer chooses his victims. Also, the killer's tips are a bit obscure, aren't they? I mean animal bloody bone and rat shaved hair? Logically, how does someone go from bones and rats to the exact exact location of the next victim and can choose from all of New York? There is some sort of nonsense about the bird that sits on the ledge of the Rhymes window, which is completely random, and after almost two hours the bone picker is going very slowly. There is so much bad in the Bone Collector, and it all comes down to one of the worst scenarios in history, it’s terrible at all levels and not credible. Obviously, Angelina Jolie stated that she shot nude scenes for this film, but they were cut because they were too distracting. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 48,000,000, the Bone Picker is well made with good production. values ​​and that hollywood shine about it. I also have to add right now that I think that Angelina Jolie gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen, I think she is absolutely terrible at that. Denzel Washington really just lies, Queen Latifah is terrible, and even Michael Rooker can't do anything because he's stuck with a cliche and a one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> Bone collector should be one of the worst Hollywood movies I've ever seen, I saw them for free on TV last night, and I still feel deceived and ripped off. There are so many things that can be done to make holes in this stupid, embarrassingly horrible or should it be terribly embarrassing? It works in any case, to be honest ...
