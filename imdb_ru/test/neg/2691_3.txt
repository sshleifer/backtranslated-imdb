I have to admit that, although I am a fan of Shakespeare, I was never familiar with this play. And what I really cannot say is that it is a poor adaptation or just a poor choice of film. There are some good things to do, but the performance is very awkward, and the plot is obvious. The theme of the play is about the nature of debt, using the financial idea of ​​debt and equity as a metaphor for emotional issues. This becomes clear when the problem with rings becomes more important than the business with Shylock, who unfortunately falls into garden-grade anti-Semitism, despite all the attempts by the Bard to save him with a couple of good monologues. <br /> <br /> Outside of a decent turn of Jeremy Irons, I did not think that there was a decent performance in this group. Yiddish Pacino consists of a small whining added at the end of each ad, and some of Shylock's best scenes boil down to variations of the standard “Pacino angry” scene that his fans know and love. But Lynn Collins frankly embarrasses, to such an extent that I would think that they had tested it on the screen at an early stage. When she becomes incognito like a man, it's hard not to laugh at all the things we should not laugh at. When Joseph Fiennes is standing there, trying to look sincere and complex, it’s hard not to make destructive comparisons with Gwyneth Paltrow’s performance in Shakespeare in Love. However, the big problem that overestimates everything in this film is simply the lack of emotional concentration. It's really hard to tell if this film is trying to be a somewhat serious comedy or a strangely stupid drama. Of course, good summer promotions would let you hear more material than this dismal production. The actors seem to be embarrassed by the attempt at humor and are unsure of where to put a dramatic and comedic accent. The director Michael Radford is guilty of all this, and he seems to think that the material is much harder than it seems to me.
