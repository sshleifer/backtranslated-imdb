What kind? - What was it? Is the city sheriff (John Agar) blowing up a mutant gorilla with a stick of dynamite hidden in a mannequin? Did I just write this? Did I just see it? <br /> <br /> With the instrumental tools of The Wildcats, Night Fear is one click that never deserved to be made back in 1967. The gorilla's heyday was over, and any costume other than Ray Corrigan in the monkey just begs for trouble. Make it black and white and state the story about thirty years earlier, and you will get at least a 4.0 rating on IMDb. But, unfortunately, it should never have had a chance to see the light of day. Oh, there is another oddity - you will never know the day or night in history, as they seem interchangeable. <br /> <br /> I'll give you this, a couple of early malt scenes looked like they could go on the air as a Coca-Cola ad. Thinking about it now, these were probably the most beautiful and better lit scenes of the picture; Coke must have paid for them. If they saw the finished film, perhaps it would be better for them to prevent its release.
