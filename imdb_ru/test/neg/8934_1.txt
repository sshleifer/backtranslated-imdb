This movie is too stupid for words. Even if you think that this is a parody of making films, if you think that this is completely a camp, even if you spend time watching it - because you have seen it a hundred times before. But perhaps you are a big fan of high, shrill female voices, you still love Barbie and Ken and can endure this typical background noise of an 80s electric guitar ... Well, then you have a chance.
