I was so excited to finally watch the “Pulse” after receiving it from Amazon, and I must say that I was completely disappointed. I probably think I was too bloated. I had expectations from fans that simply could not be justified. After loving the other Asian horrors, I thought I knew that it would find a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The story was slow and painful. I am a diverse horror fan. I like the cruel, bloody madness of Devil Deviation, and I equally love the steady, growing grim Tale of Two Sisters. Unfortunately, "Pulse" offered little from both spectra. <br /> <br /> Along with the slowness of the plot, he was also very confused. I had no idea why the characters do what they do and how what they do will help their problem. It seemed that the director blurted out the plot in a sentence or two, and the rest was arranged by our actors. Unlike The Tale of Two Sisters, which also has a rather complicated storyline, the Pulse at the end clears up very little and leaves me frustrated, confused and not interested in the attempts of the characters. My final statement about the conspiracy was his inconsistency. At first it seemed that the story of the crowded ghostly world and that they were being saved was the Internet. This is a damn original idea. I like it. But since the plot is buzzing, plot holes and inexplicable events raise their heads, it seems that the director switched to some apocalyptic story (as can be seen from the ending), which simply was not clear enough everywhere to be performed. <br /> <br /> I understand the sadness of the pictures, and the situation was intentional, so that the viewer would feel gloomy and isolated, but the dullness of the film was only intensified by the grainy, dark surroundings. I admit that with the film there was a certain feeling of surrealism, but this, perhaps, was only my attention, gradually disappearing. <br /> <br /> The actions of some of the characters are also a little ridiculous, and maybe if I were more passionate about this story, I would be able to stop even more disbelief, but I was also unmotivated, like some of the characters. As I mentioned earlier, the logic of what some characters did was absent and contributed to the inconsistency of the plot. Perhaps this was due to the inconsistency of the plot, that the characters do questionable things. To be honest, I don't care. <br /> <br /> The game was decent. Of course, nothing outstanding, but nothing terrible. No outsiders, which can be mentioned either from one side, or from the brilliant, or from the terrible. <br /> <br /> Now I stop sounding so sour and mention that there were a few creepy moments. One by the end, especially if it were more, I would have liked this movie (almost) completely. I thought that whenever the website showed up, it was quite disturbing, as were some of the ghostly encounters that our two main characters face. What happened between these terrible raids was too dim, confusing and WTF for me to truly appreciate. <br /> <br /> Now something related to the DVD itself ... Magnolia Pulse Edition comes with subtitles, yes, but the subtitles are turned off. They are not pronounced at the correct character speech time. This may sound meticulously, but it bothers me a little and it may bother some others. I think this is the only North American release of the film, so you will either have to play or watch dubbing (NEVER WATCH DUBLING !!!) I liked the film, really. I wanted this film to justify the hype ... but, unfortunately, it failed for me. If you are looking for another creepy Asian cinema, I can recommend “Listening”, “Shutter”, “Tale of Two Sisters”, “Strange Circus” and “Marebito” to you - all this is more than my palette.
