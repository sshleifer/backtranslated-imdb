Horrible script, apparently, the director ... no one? Marines cannot fight off a monster with machine guns, but this retreats when a 15-year-old karate girl slaps his face several times. It should be a luxury liner, but an unusual dining room looks like a cafeteria in a hospital. It looks like they rented a high school for the summer, and pulled out chairs and things to decorate the set. Ultimately, they are pulled out of the water into the boat, and in less than 3 seconds they are apparently located about two miles from the ship when it sinks. I think everyone can be in the film these days. Aaron James, New York
