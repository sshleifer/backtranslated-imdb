I had high hopes for this film, although I did not read the book. Richard Gere and Diane Lane together - should be good. But the film does not fulfill the promise. I kept waiting for more depth for the characters, and there wasnâ€™t. I have no problem with the fact that they only needed a weekend to fall in love. This can happen. But we will never know the characters. I would like to focus more on them. The film reminded me of the locations in Madison County Bridges, and this film was much better. I really felt for the characters in this film, and there was chemistry between Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep (much more passion) than between Gere and Lane. Each of them is in itself a very good actor. Just not the right movie for them together.
