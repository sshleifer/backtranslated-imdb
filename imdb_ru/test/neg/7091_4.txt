Trying to keep up with the youth audience approaching the 70s, OaCD, YCSF was the product of the material for various oddities selected for musical processing. Here it is a past life regression, ESP and hypnotherapy ... rather strange! The real problem with the concept (music or not) is the extremely low dramatic stakes; only where the film can go, and what can happen when a man falls in love with the previous incarnation of a girl he cannot bear? It cannot go to any new place, but, oddly enough, it cannot even go to any old place! Indeed, if it were possible, the audience would still not be interested in the union of Yves Montand (playing much older, arrogant, French donkey) and Streisand. (much younger girl). We never invest in them, their situations or results. Montana is mistaken, and his strong emphasis makes many of his texts illegible. <br /> <br /> All this received the surface appearance of the 60s, which makes it extremely disposable; despite efforts here and there from Minelli, who are respectable. It's not even adapted from a non-musical history that has met with any previous success ... it's just too outdated! Streisand sometimes offers funny things, for example, when she tries not to fall asleep on her roof and improvises an energetic dance. But she relies too much on her ingratiating (translation: annoying) strange Jewish joke. However, she can sing very well, both at the “soft” and at the “powerful” end of the range. Among the many musical drosses, she gets 3 or 4 amazing songs * of a much higher level than anything Fanny or Dolly could offer. “He is not you” is a sweet trifle, as sublime as “My Funny Valentine's Day” by Lorentz Hart, but the film is not capable of influencing it; because the lyrics do not seem to be related to anything in the film, and nothing indicates that great love flourishes between Shabo and Melinda. <br /> <br /> The only thing we can see is the poor performance of the ax, a much larger movie. Strong research shows a longer, better explained and more decorative, but not necessarily the best film at: http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. You can be sure that there will be more Babs in this version, but, more importantly, Minelli will have more thoughtful work. <br /> <br /> At the end, Montand sends Babs to sing the title song after she discovers that he is a full member who feeds her self-esteem to allow himself to be pulled off the hook. And she takes the bait. So, uh ... hooray. <br /> <br /> (* rather, it is beautiful here, Love with all the decorations, He is not you, and the title song)
