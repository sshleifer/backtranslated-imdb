Closet Land - unpleasant work with excellent actors. Nothing more (or less) happens in the film, except for the endless violence against an attractive female prisoner by a sadistic police official. The setting is minimalistic. This can be considered as the soft core of S & M porn because the drama is devoid of all reference points, such as time, place and political context. Since what is happening, turns out to be away from the fantastic futuristic environment, the abuse becomes very personal. Pornographic aspects are justified to be a warning about the dangers of a totalitarian government, but because there is no real context for the torture of this young woman, we go out disturbed, but not knowing anything. <br /> <br /> What is the point? Does this torture exist in the world? What bullying prisoners is bad? What dictatorships curse innocent people? We already know that. Closet Land has echoes of works such as Darkness At Noon and Rhinoceros Ionesco, but both of these works were made by competent artists whose work had a historical context and depth of meaning. This work is amateurish and dialogical sophomory. Certain fingers down.
