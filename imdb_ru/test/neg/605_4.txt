"When the killer calls" is an unusually unpleasant click of a slasher, with some very unpleasant and disturbing episodes. It was clearly decided to try to make a remake of "When a Stranger Calls", practically inserting - almost verbatim - the sequence of phone calls from this film. They seem very forced. <br /> <br /> In addition, the director commits a cardinal (but too frequent) sin, which consists in the fact that the friends of the heroine are disgusting. So at the beginning of the film we really like and support the nanny (a good believable work of Rebekah Kochan), but then her usual girlfriends-tears join her, and the mood is destroyed. <br /> <br /> Flick seems to work, but itâ€™s probably a lot more annoying than you expect, so be forewarned.
