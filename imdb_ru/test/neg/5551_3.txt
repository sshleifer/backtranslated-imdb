I argued a little about what rating to give this, because this is my most unloved film by Gershella Gordon Lewis, other than The Gruesome Twosome, but he has the best acting game I've seen in the Lewis movie. However, we all know that it does not say much. When the film ended, I was happy, because it seemed to me that I sat through a 4-hour film, although it lasted only 82 minutes. I'm trying to watch all the HGL movies, and this is probably the only reason to watch this. <br /> <br /> Blood, as usual, is good, the only thing that Herschel seems to have understood. Acting as bad as usual with one exception. This exception is Frank Kress. Now I would say that he is a good actor? No, but it is good compared to everyone else. The story is boring and flat and goes nowhere, and by the end, I didnâ€™t care what happened while it ended. I know that this is a cult classic, but I did not like it at all. I hope you will.
