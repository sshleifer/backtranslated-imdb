In this desperate and utterly foolish attempt to preserve the Hammer Dracula franchise, despite the fact that it has long lost most of its strength, our legendary vampire returns to life in the swinging London of 1972. Exactly one hundred years after he was destroyed by his enemy, Van Helsing, an occult student named Johnny Alucard (understand? Understand?) Gathers his bright friends in an abandoned church, among them Van Helsing's great-granddaughter Jessica, and performs a satanic ritual that raises Dracula in smoke haze. Dracula’s sole mission is to damage the entire Van Helsing line, and fragile Jessica is the perfect victim to achieve this goal. This is perhaps the only film of the 70s, which goes up immensely, trying to look like a movie of the 70s! Given that all of the previous six Dracula films were made in the Victorian era, director Alan Gibson really wants to emphasize the fact that we are in the 20th century, and therefore he fills his film with unbearable hippie characters, disgusting 70s and 70 horrible Music Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing seem hopelessly lost in this setting, and their performances regret it. The sequence of discovery (remembrance) and the culmination of the autopsy are rather pleasant, but everything between them is painfully dull and the complete opposite of the terrible. The greatest elements in this series of films have always been the dark castles of Dracula and the exciting bus races, and, obviously, this issue lacks all of this. Fortunately for the fans, modern Hammer Studios have released other films that revolve on vampires, which are much better (“Vampire Lovers”, “Evil Twins”, “Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires” ??). Not recommended.
