One of the problems with popular culture, especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s, is that the media, especially television, usually four years behind the "underground" media, especially music. Many people think that the “Woodstock Generation” remained important throughout the 1970s, in fact, it was in Altamont in 1970. By 1972, “underground” rock or “counterculture” moved east to England, and Ice Tsepplin, “Black Sabbath” David Bowie, the early metallers and the so-called “glam rockers” who were all “peace and love” did not. None of them, in a completely different way, was the "family" of Charles Manson. <br /> <br /> This obvious pilot of a television show (which, fortunately, has never been accepted by networks) is trying to come to terms with a culture that was already as wilted as yesterday’s flowers. lay about a few years old - by the time he was released, the writer Carlino had already achieved recognition for tough stories about mafia revenge. And all this cultural references to The Easy Rider and Woodstock (1969). The music that the soundtrack actually refers to earlier, 1966/67 - in Woodstock, Hendrix, "Canned Heat", "Sly and Family Stone" turned this folk-pop into oblivion. <br /> <br /> A film about a middle-class family that goes on the road to meet hippies. Wow, dude, far, far away, this is a terrific breathtaking event from the bag. But politics means nothing - Vietnam is a place in Asia, right? <br /> <br /> This medium (i.e., stale and nonsensical) television film is redeemed only by the remarkably mature performance of Jeff Bridges. After he left college, he convinces his parents and grandmother to “discover” (hippie) America. All other performances are a standard television fair of standard television actors of the time. The director enjoys good cinematography, but otherwise the film is a bad way to spend 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I knew it was over when Sal Mineo noticed a young runaway man (who tells other characters they really don’t): “She’s a latent existentialist.” Wow, far, great. <br /> <br /> A couple of extra points for being “so bad, it's funny,” but if you don't need the TV version of the 60s and 60s, stay away.
