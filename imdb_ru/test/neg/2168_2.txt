I understand that it was an attempt by Lleda Kaufman to save the film that was the pits. The entire film is voiced, since the audio clip was garbage. The voiceover was SO bad and terrible quality. As much as I love Troma, they tend to be a bit heavy on the voice at work. The game was terrible. One thing that I really enjoyed this film was Trey Parker's short cameo making a joke of aristocrats with a dull wig. There are many major directors in this film, such as James Gunn and Eli Roth (friends of Lloyd Kaufman). Again, I think it was Leldâ€™s attempt to save a crappy movie and try not to lose thousands of dollars. I will not go on and on, but this film was a mess. Check out other Troma names.
