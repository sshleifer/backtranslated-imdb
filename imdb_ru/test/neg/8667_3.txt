For a teenager who never read Austin, this adaptation might work. But only for them. This is a scattered version of “Mangfield Park” in “Marked Rocks”, and if you didn’t see another version or read a book, parts of it might scratch your head. <br /> <br /> Why was it so hard to do? good adaptation of this book? The one that in the 1990s took on such freedom that it seemed to be not the same book - the thinking was completely modern and prudent. <br /> <br /> Here we have Billie Piper, who looks like a cute country girl. She has a charming personality that develops beautifully - but her blond hair blatantly died, with black eyebrows and - through most of the picture - dark brown roots. So much for the uncorrupted cousin. It is incredibly distracting, and the rest of the cast is in the genre of greasy hair, wrinkled clothes, which demonstrate a real disrespect for the accuracy of the period. <br /> <br /> One thing is good here - Hayley Atwell is the best Mary Crawford of all versions. She is remarkably perfect, flirtatious, not at all modern and not thought-provoking, thoughtless and completely without a moral or ethical compass. In fact, Henry looks good enough to be a little temptation for our heroine. <br /> <br /> Gemma Redgrave plays one of the most interesting roles in history and manages to get bored to the very last scene - too much sensible. It’s just a play that really didn’t reach the goal, very low for Austin fans. <br /> <br /> The only valid version is the one in which there is a strange duck (perfect for this role) Sylvestra La Touzel (despite the very gay Henry Crawford - he is just ridiculous).
