First of all, I have to mention that as a group of comrades, we often find entertainment in films-films that are known to be terrible for a comedy film, hence Camp Camp rental. <br /> <br /> Camp Blood was the first movie we rented that was filmed on what looks like a video camera, and it was so trash that it wasnâ€™t even funny. <br /> <br /> The DVD was returned, and a refund was required with an additional proposal. This kind of quality control is implemented to prevent the accumulation of such full debris. <br /> <br /> Don't do what I did, and let curiosity overpower you, it's so bad that it's not even funny.
