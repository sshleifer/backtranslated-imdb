I do not know about the rest of the audience of this film, but personally I am very tired of the films of Steven Seagal. When the Law came out higher, it was a great fighter. Wahoo. Now in The Patriot, Steven Seagal plays Steven Seagal, Over the Law. I am tired of seeing no change in character. This is the same character, time after time, after time. He needs to change. This film was probably one of the worst action films I've ever seen. Calling him a fighter, you get him too much, because there are too few battle scenes, and they are scattered throughout the film. I think they wanted to do some kind of drama, but it was a meaningless attempt, because there was nothing in the film except for the usual cross-eyed Stephen-Seagal, whom we saw thousands of times. I want to say that to take a fresh look at the tail and lose the tail - I definitely do not recommend watching this movie in any way, go eat it, damn it, rent it. that Seagal will make a great performance.
