When PUFFY CHAIR beckons, beware of its soft, colorful upholstery. <br /> <br /> The film starts pretty well. Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Catherine Aselton) are a couple of guys and girls who have relationship difficulties. One night, there is a quarrel, and in order to catch up, Josh asks Emily to go to his father’s house, where Josh plans to deliver the purple LazyBoy chair for his father’s birthday. Emily agrees, and along the way they pick up the frivolous brother Josh Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), who looks like an Amish, who is more concerned with other people's lives than with her own. <br /> <br /> The road quickly turns into squabbles. between Josh and Emily, as well as a bitter feeling for the “Puffy Chair” (it is initially very dirty and falls apart until Josh “convinces” the original owner to repair it). Rhett quickly finds out that LazyBoy is the cause of all of Emily and Josh's problems, and sets fire to the torch one night ... <br /> <br /> And this is the last thing we hear about the chair, although there are many In the film a few minutes left . <br /> <br /> The big problem is that the name of the film is “Puffy Armchair” when it’s not a chair at all, which occupies a central place. This is Josh and Emily's doomed relationship and the way the strip holds together their feelings for each other. After the chair is destroyed, no one mentions it anymore, although they come to the house of Josh's parents for his father's birthday without a gift. Josh never mentions a chair, like his father. There is no connection between this and the life of these people. So why call the film "Chubby Chair" and why is there no link to it at the end? Bad script. <br /> <br /> Another annoying thing is that Mark Duplass's brother, Jay Duplass, is not only a director, but also an operator (and not very good). Almost every scene has a rapid increase in characters that become grainy and out of focus before camera autofocus is captured and adjusted. Initially, it acquired a strange and artistic character, but quickly became unbearable. <br /> <br /> Movie acting is accessible and interesting. All the actors / actresses did a great job. But the poor quality of the products, the fierce ending and the lack of consistency with the title caused this film too many problems.
