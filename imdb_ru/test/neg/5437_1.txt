Let's see: there is a civil war, a lost city, a talking gorilla, some ordinary gorillas, a previously unknown type of albino killer, the most powerful laser ever known to man, * a lot of * diamonds mined and flowing into the sand, attacking hippos, an active volcano and a balloon packed in a suitcase in a downed airplane. It's not that much, is it? I had clearer dreams of a fever (“... and then the Romanian guy picked up a bunch of diamonds, because it was the lost city that he was looking for or something like that, but then the evil gorillas we saw before”) went out of nowhere and ate it. Now, in some way, the talking gorilla has returned from visiting ordinary gorillas, and when some kind of earthquake or volcano began, a female industrialist / doctor built a gun using a laser and this large diamond that she had just found in her dead groom's hand ... "). This is a blast if you are looking for more ammunition against Michael Crichton’s disastrous influence on American entertainment (and therefore world entertainment), and if you firmly remember the extent to which this cynical and indecisive attempt has fallen on checkout Oh, unfortunately, the responsible people — Crichton, screenwriter John Patrick Shanley, director Frank Marshall — probably never lost a penny. Shame on them, and I mean it. 1/10
