Technically speaking, this movie sucks ... lol. However, it is also fun. Be it intentionally funny, I don't know. Horrible in all aspects, this is also the only film I know about, in which there is 1) a fat child, played by a thin actor in a (very obvious) fat suit, 2) an attractive actress at the age of over 30 years old, playing a character who should be in her late 60s, and 3) the most compliments for plastic yard daisies ever. Don't take this film seriously, just watch it for a laugh ... great party movie.
