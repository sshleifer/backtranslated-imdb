I just saw this movie last night at the midnight preview (I work in an independent theater network in Colorado - this is one of the perks) ... Sorry, but this is one of the worst films I've ever seen! I know that there are some Bruce Campbell fanatics who (for example, Star Wars fans) will get you out of a nearby tree if you dare to talk about your favorite cinema icons badly ... nevertheless Campbell-Tirs, especially The “chin” is a celluloid black hole. <br /> <br /> Before making any assumptions, I am some kind of short film lover who only watches “real” films, such as “Ladies in Lavender” and “Sideways”. Think again - I'm big fan of B-movies and in particular Bruce Campbell. His signature character Ash is one of my favorites, and his idea of ​​an aging Elvis in Bubba Ho-Tep was phenomenal. <br /> <br /> But hey, B-movies still have the potential to be real, very bad (and not in that “good” trekking style that we all love) ... and that's how this movie looked for me and my work colleagues. With the exception of one shot, where Bruce runs across the square and scares the children, there was no laughter. In general, we found that this story is stunningly stupid, similar to red-hot molasses and so-called humorous stupidity than a bag of hammers. (Sorry, but Pavel Tedi Raimi’s character was not comical relief ... he was just mentally retarded!) Believe me, we all went into it really, wanting to please, but left a feeling of incredible disappointment and were deprived of two hours. <br /> <br /> If you really liked this film, schedule it to be watched several times, want to get married and have children with him, etc., this is fantastic - we all like what we like, so you won’t get Judgment from me. But one should not question the sense of humor or the loyalty of fans to those who do not experience multiple orgasms compared to Campbell’s latest cinema coupe. This film, in my humble opinion, was a steaming shit sandwich ... and as a true Campbell fan, I can say it!
