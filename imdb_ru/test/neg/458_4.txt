After the NIGHT MUST FALL fracture, Robert Montgomery (in most cases) entered his best films and performances: HERE COMES MR. JORDAN, THEY WERE EXTENDED, LADY IN LAKE, RIDE A PINK HORSE, Saxon charm, June Bride. Even some of the failures in which he found himself were interesting enough to be seen (RAGE IN HEAVEN, MR. AND MRS. SMITH). But Montgomery wanted to do more and more production and directorial work. In 1949, he starred in what would be his last movie performance - he played Collier Lan, a selfish movie star who is called to help the authorities investigate a young girl's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Apparently, my opinion about this film represents a minority. Most of the opinions presented are favorable for this. I thought it was a boring and stupid script, and the heroine Ann Blyth is not very attractive as a character. She admires Montgomery as a star, and it “helps” when he is called to help the authorities, but after a while I discovered that there was no chemistry between them. The script was also devoid of fun, although Montgomery and Roland Winters tried. The only thing that I still remember as a joke is that Taylor Holmes is Blythe's rich father, and he is a fan of Winston Churchill. Therefore, he always dresses as Churchill, and we see that he wears a flexible wide-brimmed hat, smokes a big cigar and draws (Holmes' bald head helps in disguise). It was the most memorable joke of this film - not a big part of this memory. <br /> <br /> Montgomery went to early television and finally won the attention and respect that he always deserved in movies. His latest contact with the films was his “The Gallant Clock” guide about Admiral William “The Bull” Halsey, in which he played the main role of his friend Jimmy Cagney. This is a much better movie than this. For his entire film and television career, I will give this mediocre film "4." It seems generous to me.
