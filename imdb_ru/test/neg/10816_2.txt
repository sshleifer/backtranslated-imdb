“The Cave” was released more or less simultaneously with the English film “The Descent”, directed by Neil Marshall. Both films have a similar premise; only “The Cave” is terribly unoriginal, uninteresting and incompetent in comparison with the magnificent adventure of horror “Descent”. It feels like Neil Marshall realized that the main story was too poor and immediately added brilliant ideas, depth and personalized style, while the director of The Cave, Bruce Hunt, simply went to the most basic script design that was thrown at his desk it turns out an incredibly mediocre film, which presents all the clichés of horrors that you can think about, and in which most of the violence takes place behind the scenes. And we all hate it, right? This story tells about the intolerable cave divers who fall into the trap of a completely unknown underground Romanian ecosystem. Disgusting winged creatures, which are also parasites, soon attack them, and escape seems impossible due to a landslide. The first half hour is still a bit interesting, if you are busy searching for all the cliches and listening to dialogues with empty textbooks, but everything becomes too scary. None of the events is even a bit believable, and the whole cast seems to be competing with each other to provide the BEST performance. I have already seen the best special effects in anonymous B-movies, the filming locations are not fully utilized, and the ending just sucks! Very NOT recommended!
