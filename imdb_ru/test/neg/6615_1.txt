His obvious ESPN is drooling whenever Knight appears on the news, but should they make an awesome movie about him? It was the worst attempt of a serious drama film I have ever seen. It had everything: a terrible game, a terrible dialogue, ridiculous casting, cheap sets, and so on. D. And so on. P. It looked like it was taken off for a budget of $ 10. Kammon, how are things with the game scenes? Were they in high school gym? And the lighting, well, let me just say that it was funny. And Brian Denehi like Bob Knight? Give me a break. The money looked like ... The money in a red sweater, nothing more. ESPN lost a lot of confidence with this flop attempt. They spent millions of dollars on advertising, then the premiere caused great disappointment. Bob Knight is not a topic that can be revealed in a two-hour film. ESPN blew it. Even Knight himself thought it was more stupid than anything else.
