You are unlikely to know that a year later MGM placed Norm Shearer on THE DIVORCEE, which shines MGM technical know-how. How far they have come in one year. Cheney is a very scenic early talker. The camera almost does not move. Shearer is her usual charming personality, and Rathbone succeeds in a romantic leading role. They are all very careful to speak clearly and slowly into the microphone source, which softens the natural dramatic scene, but the game is a strong and funny warhorse, so you can enjoy it if its expectations are not too high. Oh, by the way, the plot includes a ring of high-class thieves who enter society to hunt their victims. There are some tricky turns in the script, and true love conquers all. Oscar nomination for the best adaptation of the script.
