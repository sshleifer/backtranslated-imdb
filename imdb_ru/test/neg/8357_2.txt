I write this review simply because I am a big fan of the book “Prozac Nation” and was shocked by the film. <br /> <br /> I think that if you had not read the book, you would have lost watching the film, as it did not give any real story of Würzel’s depression. There was no real mention of her childhood (her relationship with her father, her experience at the summer camp, her first therapists (in fact, the film gave the impression that she had never been on therapy before Dr. Sterling) ...). However, if you read the book, you would be embarrassed by the amount of editing that took place. <br /> <br /> I found the book to be a vivid depiction of depression, highlighting the low points of Würzel and the experience she gained along the way. The film, however, began at Harvard and literally put the public in order without a real explanation of what was happening. <br /> <br /> Important events in the book (such as Wurtzel's miscarriage, her summer job in Dallas, her suicide attempt while on Prozac) were excluded from the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is pedantic, but Würzel did not lose his virginity with Noah. The suicide attempt shown in the Stirling office was completely different from the book. For starters, she actually overdosed Mollaril, in contrast to the parasiological gesture shown in the film. <br /> <br /> In general, I would say that if you read the book and enjoyed it / identified with it, then do not watch the movie. Instead, read “More, Now, Again” (by the same author). Or see "Girl Interrupted." <br /> <br /> The only feature in the film is Anna Heche's play, which, I think, very well portrayed Dr. Sterling. Christina Ricci was also good, although her performance seemed a bit ... unnatural. Jessica Lange made for a pleasant viewing, but looked the opposite of the way Wurtzel's mother described in the book. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Do not worry
