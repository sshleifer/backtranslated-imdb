A tiresome gangster movie that makes you want someone to edit it with a farce more ruthlessly. I would have thought that the story of the creation of Las Vegas would be interesting, but it fails at almost every step. Warren Beattyâ€™s speech as a stupid and incredible Bugsy Saigela leaves you wanting you to watch someone else. Once or twice he flashes in the fog of his performance, creating an interesting scene, but in most cases you just don't give a damn about it. Annette Benning makes a qualified turn as her unreliable lover, but even she is only slightly more piquant than he. <br /> <br /> I really wouldn't worry about this cruel drama if you are not a devotee Benning.
