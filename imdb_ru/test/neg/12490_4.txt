Dear Mr. Ram Gopal Varma, I do not know in what capacity I am writing this letter to you. I am a fan of Amitabh Bachchan, who never said that he graduated, and participated in his pursuit of a rooster in Jaadugar. I also require several important appointments at The Godfather fan club, because I’ve watched Coppola classic more times than you brought flops from your factory. And, of course, I was your big fan, from the very moment when Nagarjuna wrapped a bicycle chain around his joints in Shiva. <br /> <br /> When you announced Sarkar and called him your look at the Godfather all you wanted to know was the release date of the first film, Sunday, when commercials will be shown, Friday, when the film will be released. It was just a fulfillment of desires at work, knowing that you, and not someone soaring between the mustard fields of Amritsar and the tulip gardens of Amsterdam, took to recreating the pages of Puzo on the big screen of Bollywood. <br /> <br /> Your composition could not be more than you ?? working with a legend for the first time, assigning Abhishek to his son on the screen, giving Kay the role he deserved for many years, returning forgotten faces such as Supriya Pathak and Ruhsar, and selecting completely non-actors such as Katrina and Tanisha to join the list? ? Until July 1, you made Sarkar the most awaited film for the Godfather fan ever, who worshiped Bachchan. <br /> <br /> Introductory titles instilled hope that your stunning sepia-inspired promotional videos have set the TV on fire. But now you called Sarkar your tribute to the godfather instead of the word "inspired" that you have been using all this time. You may not want these two creations to be compared, but when the environment is the same, then Kaanta is compared to Wheelchair Dogs and Wheelchair Dogs with Burning Fire. <br /> <br /> Also, when are your first and last episodes ?? the heart of any treatment script ?? it’s all about establishing and transferring power; you cannot separate Nagarez and Corleone, even if you replace the actions of the American mafia with Maharashta political power. <br /> <br /> But you are mistaken Mr. Varma ?? You wanted to show Amitabha in his 70s avatar how the hands of Salim Javed rustled. You wanted him to hide more than life. You wanted him to be his own brand (o). Then how could you steal his voice in the name of silence? How could you keep him chained to a chair looking for interesting camera angles? How could you leave him alone without his voice and height, two things that made him so big? Coppola's Godfather operator Gordon Willis masked Brando's eyes throughout the entire film, because he did not have the strength to match that dense hoarse voice or that sudden snap of his fingers. But you tried to repeat the act of Malik from your own company. But Bachchan is not Ajay Devgan ?? his forte is not in a frozen look and suffocating silence. You made this person look like a comatose patient who is reminded from time to time to look at the hint cards and make these predictable lines. For this Agnipat will be here on any Saturday. <br /> <br /> What fan of Bachchana will go see Kay Kay Menon stealing thunder from under his nose in the scene where Sarkar asks Vishnu to leave his house? Which fan of Amitabha will go and see how he has focused on hachaare and karome in a film that talks about power with a capital P in commercials? We cannot cope so much in the name of restraint and understatement! You do not even allow the camera to stop on it for five seconds, when he finds out that his son wanted to kill him. Give me the “school-only on Bachchan” style every Saturday. <br /> <br /> Glory to you, of course, for the fact that you made an actor from Abhishek, first in Naaha, and now in Sarkar. You also allow him to show Mallika Sherawat that he can run just like his father. Even in a short prison sequence, you really force bachchan to emerge from the text - an opportunity that Shaad missed at Banti Aur Babli. I wish the film was more a story of father and son than a chaotic conflict between caricatures in the name of the characters that appear as advertising windows on the Internet. <br /> <br /> You also give women more to the script than Puzo and Coppola, and again, you deserve all the Brownie points for squeezing them so efficiently. Pathak - the long-awaited return, because the mother in the middle, Tanisha, beloved like a girl in love, Katrina is a revelation, like a bewildered lover of Abhishek, and Ruhsara's silence says a lot. <br /> <br /> But the minor plots are not a classic remake. When your free camera tries to make every frame look like a hat, and your loud background is constantly annoying, we are constantly reminded that we are in a factory. Well, maybe this is not the score of Nino Roth, but Sarkar certainly deserved better than Govinda, Govinda's chants and uninvited flutes. <br /> <br /> Mr. Varma, some of your Factory directors tell me that you participate in every project, from observing the shooting schedules to observing the editing sessions. Perhaps in the middle of all the different storyboards, the cry of Bhiku Matra is muffled by the silence of Subhash Nagar. Perhaps you need to remove the shutters in the factory and work on one homemade product. Otherwise, your products will remain products that can be used and thrown away, not treasures. And lovers of cinema, like me, for whom there are no hits and failures, there is only a good movie, would prefer a film without finishing on any Saturday.
