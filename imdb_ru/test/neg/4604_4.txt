In Los Angeles, the alcoholic and lazy Hank Chinaski (Matt Dillon) performs a wide range of unqualified functions, just to get enough money to drink and play racing. His main and only goal is to write and have sex with dirty women. <br /> <br /> “Factotum” is an uninteresting, meaningless and extremely boring film about an irresponsible drunken vagabond who works a couple of days or weeks just to get enough money to buy perfumes and gamble, being immediately fired from due to his reckless behavior. According to IMDb, this character will be the fictional alter ego of author Charles Bukowski, and based on this story, I certainly will never read any of his novels. Honestly, if the viewer likes this topic of alcoholic couples, it’s better to look at the touching and heartbreaking “Iron Weed” by Hector Babenko or the “History of Follia” by Marco Ferreri, based on the life of the same writer. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Factotum ?? Sem Destino" ("Factotum ?? Without Destiny")
