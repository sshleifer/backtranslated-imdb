Too bad Mike Myers chose this for his dramatic debut. It seems that this film was created by a committee that could not decide whether it was a comedy, drama, suspense, or fantasy. It all starts somehow playfully, then quickly gets dark, and then, eventually, apparently, soon after one of the main characters was killed, the whole family stands in the backyard, laughing at something. It is absolutely strange and impossible to tie together. Acting is extremely uneven: senior professionals draw your attention, and then younger and less experienced actors look like they play in high school. This film showed me that making a good film is probably more difficult than it can be seen from the truly professional fare that we see on top-notch art houses. It would be a good film to analyze the film. The plot, character, theme, sequence - they are all either faulty or missing in this film.
