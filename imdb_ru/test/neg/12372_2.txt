This horrible movie is funny on many levels - the most obvious is a clumsy puppet that looks like a fake bird that floats around cheap sets without flapping its wings (how was it on a rope, perhaps?), Attacking model trains and car toys. "Science" - is asinin - Masonic atomic gun ?? And what happened to the huge amount of Brylcream in everyone's hair? I think the 50s were the decade of the Slimeball! Well, this bird puppet, obviously, comes from "some kind of god-forgotten universe against matter," and she is here to build a nest and lay eggs in New York. Seriously. The fact that they manage to kill the puppet is almost a shame. I give him 1 hoof out of 4 - it's stupid and stupid, but more fun than Armageddon. : = 8)
