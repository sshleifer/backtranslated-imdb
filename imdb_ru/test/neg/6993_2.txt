So it’s a pity that it’s not even funny. From the first scene in the film, I realized that I had a bad time. Thank God, I saw this movie only on TV. The storyline was terrible, not to mention acting. It was terrible. Very unreal and unusual things happened in this movement, such as. The lady sticks a whip under the door, slaps the guy a little bit, and he just passes the keys. I like, GET THE PRESENT. The creators of a lousy attempt to make a futuristic city even deepened my dislike for the film. To tell you the truth, the only good thing about this film was the fight, which in itself was pretty lame. All I could ask myself when I watched this movie was “when it will work!”
