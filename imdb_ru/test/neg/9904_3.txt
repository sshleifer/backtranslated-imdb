What is it!! This is so bad. The animation looks so horrible that it looks like a game like ps1. The actors are terrible, they just can't act to save their lives. I watched this whole movie, and in the end I was annoyed when I realized that I had lost 3 hours of my life. I have not heard of this film, did he ever go to the movies or directly to DVD? Girl shot? What happened to this, it was just a stupid movie. They completely copied The Day After Tomorrow. It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. I would definitely recommend people not to waste their time on this. You could spend time watching “The Day After Tomorrow”, it is much better. Well, that's what I think about the movie. In fact, why did I waste my time writing about it, oh, damn it! It really annoys me, its wasted 3 hours and 10 minutes.
