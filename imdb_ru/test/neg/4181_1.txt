The first DH was not so good, but I really did not expect it to be. But this horrible movie was beyond criticism. I really try to look at it from the best side and give chance to similar films, but I just could not find anything good in it. I appreciate what Bill Cowell tried to do, but this film was sooooo boring. The history of the film is really not so bad. In fact, it is somewhat original. But the shape of the film is really as bad as many say. In my opinion, this is a place in the rating of "Season" and "Dracula 3000". I know that many people really cheat and record such films, but I really canâ€™t think of anything good to say about it.
