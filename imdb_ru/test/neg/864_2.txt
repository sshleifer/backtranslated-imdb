This film was created by the largest producer in Costa Rica. Although their authors brag about it as the biggest movie in Costa Rica ever made, and their actors even dare to say that they did not get an Oscar nomination because of its political significance with oil (he really) ... Good This is all a lie. This film is presumably based on a book written by Carlos Salazar Herrera about a love triangle (a subject similar to a serial similar to a serial), and this is a secondary story about an oil problem on the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica with an American oil company that wanted Oil Exploration deposits in the region, but in the end it was never approved by the government. Now he can have good shots about the beaches, but that is all; nothing more than that ... it's all in the camera. Most actors are lousy except two or three. The rest lack the understanding of what it means to act: they replay most of the time. This story is completely ordinary and cliche, worthy of a cheap Mexican soap opera, as I said ... because the film crew advertised it as a protest film about oil, but 80% of the film is based on a stupid love triangle. The script is not impressive, it is very simple, and the dialogues are not very thought out. He also has some editing problems on a few changes to the scene ... but besides, it's pretty decent. The director did a good job, I mean, he doesn't look like Oliver Stone, but he did his work using the resources that he had were on hand. I would like to ask him why, instead of using the Costa Rican actor, he spent most of the money on foreign ... I mean, after all, they boasted that they are 100% Costa Rican Production ... this is what you at least expect. The final end is not very well done, there are flaws and details that are not the same or useless. Besides the fact that this is the most complex film in the history of Costa Rica, I think it is mediocre. You can make more interesting and high-quality photos with less money. Never heard of "Pi"? In any case, if you are interested in learning about films about Costa Rica or Central America, this will do, but you will definitely not miss anything.
