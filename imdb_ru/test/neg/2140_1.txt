Italian filmmakers love to pluck American films. All our films and as often as possible. <br /> <br /> I do not claim that this is like an insult to Italy as a whole, but I would like to once again note that the Italian film industry is doing great harm to itself, allowing similar parodies to go abroad to be seen around the world. This is all I say. <br /> <br /> The Italian people are exposed to no more serious injury than the non-imposition of severe punishment on those who forced the world to see the Shark Rosso Nell'Okeano, which is admittedly robbed of far superior Jaws (as if You did not know). <br /> <br /> Let's dive into the conspiracy (Get it? Ha ha ha ...): this is a huge monstrous thing that looks like a cross between an octopus, a shark and Steven Tyler, attacks many innocent Americans ( for example, Italians) off the coast of Florida (for example, in Italy), and the fearless, bottled in Peter (Sopkiv) beer sails. with his anorexic, beer spilled girlfriend and other people pouring beer, whose main objectives are to eat the creature, kill the mysterious forces that want the creature to be left alone or just stand around and remain useless (and spill the beer) .. or be a doctor in this film, which repeatedly defibrillates dying patients (20, maybe 30 times in a row), without waiting for its paddle to recharge (must be a damn, good battery, dock). <br /> <br /> Then there is the monster ... brother, if you thought that the jaws shark was a fake, look here, and IMMEDIATELY changed your mind. <br /> <br /> This film, which was filmed as an afterthought (from Bava!), was edited with an onion chopper, which used ambulatory (beer-pouring) pieces of snag and written by (REAL, beer-pouring) people who never should not ever be near a typewriter, film studio or a major city in the world. If that's the way people who made this film think that real people are acting in such a situation, they obviously made too many zombie films. Or poured too much beer. <br /> <br /> Need I say that this movie is bad? It is: bad, like green curd; bad as a Hawaiian shirt at a formal wedding; bad, like "Bad Theater", the parodies that Dan Aykroyd took on "Saturday Night Live"; bad as calista flockhart weight gain pills - get it? Good. <br /> <br /> Mike and the gang SOL slap this drunken beauty upside down and show this horror movie what it is: horrible. However, with a certain European charm: he is charming when he is watched by a European, preferably filled with beer. <br /> <br /> There are no stars for the marshy dead fish known as the Shark Rosso Nell'Okeano; six stars for the MST3K version. ... and now someone for a beer? <br /> <br />
