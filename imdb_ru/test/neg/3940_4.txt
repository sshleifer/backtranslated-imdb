“Stay Alive” is a soft horror movie about a video game that kills people the same way they die in a game. Friends who play this game will soon realize this and understand that they must defeat the Countess of Blood from the video game or accept their fate. We had videotapes at The Ring, the death site at FearDotCom. Now it's on video games. Stay Alive does some things well; character development is a little deeper than usual in a horror movie. We really get acquainted with the feelings and past of some characters and get to know them all quite well, so viewers may experience some emotions for them. The film is also very tense. The film often sounds tense, unnerving moments, accompanied by disturbing, creepy music. There are many jumps and jolts for the viewer. It may be perfect once or twice, but these false fears, which Hollywood now likes to replay in horror films, wear out in “Staying Alive”. The camera will seek to provide sharp corners or quick flashes to give viewers a very quick look at the demon or witch, and try to scare them with this sudden explosion on the screen. What for? The mountain is obviously very weak due to the film's certificate. The “Lost” scenario is very wacky and quite funny, and the characters tend to play it too melodramatically and confusingly. In addition, clichés come from all directions, for example, people roam by themselves in search of strange noise or, if they notice a figure in the dark, they will go and investigate it. However, the computer graphics used for video game segments is quite impressive and looks colorful and sharp, combining well with other parts of the film. But in general, this film is not enough. Stretching a little over a hundred minutes, it will not be a battle to stay alive, but rather remain conscious.
