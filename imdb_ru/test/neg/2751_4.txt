I read a lot of reviews on IMDb (well, all five of those that were written while I was writing this), and I am surprised at the amount of praise that leaned on the Groom without the groom, which is undoubtedly one of the smallest comedies played by puppets . I prefer the older ones, where they were Larry, Curly and Moe, although Shemp receives an award for most of the funny scenes in “Sing a song about six pants”, another short film “Stooges”, which is only moderately funny, but far superior to “The bride of the groom” . Indeed, in the film there is one slightly amusing scene, the scene “do not beat the lady”, which is not at all amusing and takes 15 minutes in the film. Not very promising in a 17-minute comedy. <br /> <br /> Shemp is a voice trainer whose uncle passed away and left him an inheritance of $ 500,000, provided he got married within 48 hours, which is quite a short notice, because yes, but by that time when Schempe finds out about this, he has only 7 hours left. This is a premise that was made and redone earlier, but I don’t think it was a massive cliche during the making of this film, as it is now. There is a series of gags in the film, none of which even closely matches the level of comedy that the Three Puppets are so well known for. It seems that the Stooges had the same problems that tormented many of the Shirley Temple films ?? too little reliance on content and too much reliance only on the fact that they exist. <br /> <br /> The standard characteristics of the puppets here, Mo is an average, whose meanness is certainly not used sparingly in this film, and the sound effects of farce (although with more exceptions than usual) are quite funny, but included in their standard slots in this movie. The line "Hold hands, you, lovers" is immortal. The rest of the movie is gone. <br /> <br /> Among other people who have watched this film for this site, they say a lot that this is one of the best Stooges shorts that you will not find. One weak point about how this is best since the early 30s shorts. This is simply not true. Of course, I can understand the level of automatic respect for the classic milestone and for the giants of the early comedy, which, of course, are The Three Puppets, but this respect is violated when worse films praise more than they should. “The bridegroom without a bride” deserves some respect, because this is the film “Stozh”, but for the same reason it should have been better. Three Stooges were just better than that.
