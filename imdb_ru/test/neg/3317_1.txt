Now don't get me wrong, I love to see half-naked chicks spinning around. This is part of the fun in a Moroccan restaurant: watch out for belly dancing. But this does not constitute a large amount of conspiracy. <br /> <br /> My first major problem is music. I have a feeling that when Ann Rice wrote “Lestat the Vampire”, “Cure” was more a style of music that he would have liked (although I could be wrong). I know that relating to modern "gothic" music might seem like a good idea, but they did a terrible job of turning it on. Lestat was an actor with a apparently pretty good singing voice. The fact that they chose Jonathan Davis as his stage voice is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Secondly, and someone else said it, mixing two very complex books into one crappy movie is a bad idea. “Lestat” could be a movie in itself, and damn good if everything was done correctly. Honestly, I don’t think the Queen of the Damned is great for a movie. Although I would really like to see a film that tells the story of creation, the book contains too many words about inaction for it to be a very interesting film. And the retelling that they really got dirty is pretty bad. Now, notice, it's been a long time since I read it, I always thought that Lestat, The Tale of the Body Thief, and Memorial The Devil were much more intense and ready to make the best films. /> <br /> I know a lot of people (hey, including me) who like a lot of wacky vampire shit who thought it was the worst of the genres to be the main movie. I tend to agree with them there. Aliya had a good body.
