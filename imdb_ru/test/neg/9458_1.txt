Oh yes, this is another retelling of the classic "sociopathic killer doctor who creates a woman of Frankenstein and falls in love." <br /> <br /> From the same director who brought you such timeless classics as “10,000 Maniacs” (no, not a group) and “Blood Festival”, this “unfinished” film practically calls for treatment MST3K. The assistant doctor even has the overtones of Torgo from the classic "Manos: Hands of Destiny." I don't know whether graphic elements, fictional violence or frequent boring, tedious speeches could scare the team, though. <br /> <br /> The main reasons to sit in this film are for the hysterical “hypnosis” scene, a ridiculously serious final and incredible production values. I actually watched all the credits after this film for the same reasons that you tend to slow down your car when you get into a serious traffic accident. This is also the obvious genius of the ultimate theme, which sounds like a blurred “My favorite things” played on a toy piano. Goblin is not.
