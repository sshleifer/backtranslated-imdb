There are special heavens meant for people who make the world laugh. Along with Chaplin, Wall and Ollie, Marx Bros and ..... (fill in your own special favorites) a place should be made for everyone connected with "Airport 80 - Concord, the film". Robert Wagner, in particular, exceeds all expectations, providing comedic performances for life. I would never have thought that he is in it. The only way he could have been funnier would be to wear a red nose and a spinning butterfly. British moviegoers will recognize the fat man from Cannon and Ball, pretending to be a Russian athlete, a good trick if he could handle it, but unfortunately he could not. My 14-year-old Labrador is more sporty and almost as funny. George Kennedy — bless him — has a part that requires him to speak and move at the same time, and, my God, he is winning! Eyebrows, wrinkled with effort, he utters endless dialogue, every word is polished with love in a cowardly shine. Only once in twenty years, Hollywood produces a film similar to "Airport 80". All the years of hard work and sweat, sweat, tears, lessons with Lee Strasberg, life from suitcases, birth in a chest, etc., all come true. A work of art will be created as long as there are films and cars on which they will be shown. I think I'm ready for my medicine now.
