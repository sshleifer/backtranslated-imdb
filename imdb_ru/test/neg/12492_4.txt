I expected a lot from Sarqar’s role as Mr. Amitabh Bachan, but I’m disappointed. Being the director of Rama Gopal Verma, I was not ready for such a film. Sarkar should be a strong character, but the film shows that Amitabh is too dependent on the strength of others, not on him. In Tamil, there is a film called GOD'S FATHER, in which Kamala Hassan played a major role. The film is well shot, and the power to the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, and not his son. Amitabh Bachchan seems to be too helpless in the film, and he just accepts everything instead of changing something. The film does not show the strong influence of God the Father.
