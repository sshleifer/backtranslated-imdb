In fact, I do not tell the main story in this comment, but in just 2-3 sentences I can make it a spoiler. Well, here they are - <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is just an 85% conversion of Hollywood movies to Bollywood using Vikram Bhatt software. The name does not match the plot, only in the thriller. Only that!! He does not deserve even one star for his imitation, imperfect casting, low standard and predictable history. Undoubtedly, now I can say that Viram Bhatt is gradually disappearing from his status as a director, since not a single mature audience will appreciate his recent work, including this one. Next to him, Aftab Shivdasani also makes his own look at comics. Who knows how long it will last in the film industry? Sometimes the standards in performances and cinematography look lower than in class C films. But the most supporting role was played by Zayed Khan, who was somewhat identical to the role of Chris Evan in the role of Ryan in Cell Phone. With an innocent face, Sanjay Suri does not participate in the film, as he has nothing to impress. That is why those who have already watched Cellular, I advise you never to waste your time on this imitation bag.
