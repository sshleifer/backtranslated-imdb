This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is so much in the house that can go wrong, not even funny. Of course, this is a film, meaning that things that do not happen in ordinary life occur here, but this film is more far-fetched than theories that no child left behind works on. All these people are in the house, and no one noticed the other, not to mention the damned owl, which seems to come everywhere, but in a cage. The first few times I could cope with a joke with an owl, but after an hour I just could not take it, I would rather commit suicide than see that damn owl again. Did I laugh during this movie? not. Not even once? not. Awful, Awful, Awful. The fact that this trash pile is closed when Ashton Kutcher tilts his boss and takes off his pants in front of everyone only makes this movie worse. But wait, the day is saved, because the damned owl can fly. WOW YOU, AMAZING! However, I attach some importance to this film, itâ€™s not as bad as Epic Movie .....
