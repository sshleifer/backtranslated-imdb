This horrible piece of thrips (comfortably) was based on a true story in which two of my relatives participated (played by Jack Thompson and Jacqueline MacKenzie). <br /> <br /> This film is offensive; apart from the fact that it was not a very good film in any way, it in no way reflects what it was like to lose such a close family member, and completely excludes those who have really suffered from the real life tragedy. <br /> <br /> Regarding the director; he managed to cash in on the misfortune of the family for the price of a Porsche. <br /> <br /> If I could give it a zero, I would get it. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs
