I can't understand why many seem to hate it. <br /> <br /> This film links together many of the overlapping settings of historical and biblical epics of the fifties, using sets, props, and costumes similar to those seen in other films. Here, however, the story is trying to go through the whole of human history, with a framework plot about the human race under trial, with a guilty verdict, meaning that the h-bombs will spread throughout the world. The prosecutor is the devil played by Vincent Price with devilish glee. So this is a little deceiver who calls the protector "The Spirit of All People", but I think this is one of those things that give this film a sense of period charm. "Spririt of Man", by the way, played a good Ronald Coleman in his latest film. This is also the last film in which all Groucho, Harpo and Chico Marks appear, but not together. Groucho plays Peyter Menue, buying Manhattan from the Indians, in a scene played exclusively for obscene humor. Chico is not at all a funny monk who thinks the world is flat, and Harpo, as we are told, should be Isaac Newton discovering gravity. Most of the other performances are well made. <br /> <br /> Other tricks lie in the fact that the test allegedly takes place in outer space, which is portrayed as an area of ​​clouds and blue. There is something called “The Great Clock of Outer Space”, which, breaking through midnight, can signal the end of the world. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the film is the problem of WMD and the eternal question of whether a person is mostly good or mostly evil; and it seems to me, in an interesting way. In addition, anyone who likes the image of the costumed epics of the fifties should like the look of this film.
