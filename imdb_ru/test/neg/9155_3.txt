Great book, poorly made movie. Cheesy performances and contrived situations make this film a sentimental, boring festival. The flat and boring work of most actors leaves this film in the After School category. There is no doubt that there are many talents in this cast and crew, but something went wrong. Very talented Gretchen Mole is trying to pull this film out of the swamp, but even she cannot rise above the silly dialogue. It feels like everyone just called. Even the makeup (Mulroney at the age of 20 over the course of the film) looks amateur and coarse. Do not waste your time on this rags .... go read a book.
