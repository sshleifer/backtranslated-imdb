Just watched it to see Joe Morton in an early role and sincerely wished that I did not worry, he can and has since done much better than this nonsense. I can not understand why someone thinks such nonsense is ridiculous, but each in its own way; This is an absolute mess and not at all funny. No, wait, the ONE line was just funny when Mr. Kent (Joe) and his family are having lunch with this crazy job when he is invited to dinner (the Lord alone knows why). Pest for Mr. Kent: You know what a dog looks like, you were there. Mrs. Kent: Not recently Joe's expression was funny, but one line doesn't make a big comedy, and this tattoo is so far from being funny to be sent to the nearest waste basket, that's enough for that. Joe Morton - glad to see that you no longer appear in such garbage; You are much taller and a great great actor.
