Try not to see this. I thought it would be good, because I am a fan of 80s trashy movies and I really liked the work of Linnie Quigley. I was wrong. I had to say no and watch Gigli instead, which is probably a much better movie. I think that my biggest problem with this film was his attempt at humor. Nothing in it was funny or even funny. The acting is bad even for the queen of the 80s cheese films. There are no stories, just random clips. I think I shouldn’t hate it so much because it was just a funny and silly piece, but I wasn’t fun and I was never entertained. Sorry, but I do not find aerobic zombies funny.
