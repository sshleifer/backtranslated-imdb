The film begins with the smartest joke and goes down from there (pun intended). After that there is a lot of insignificant humor and sexual situations. Beautiful women were the best part of the movie. Pun words should not be a joke, but they try it here. The battle between two groups in a local city (rich people and grandmothers) is an old, tried and true installation, so how can this go wrong? Well, there is no reason to envy the "rich" or regret goosebumps, so we can forget the central plot. Situational humor is all about toilet or sex aimed at teenagers, but only chuckling, not real laughter. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves the comedy for this film is the character’s humor with the blind person. providing some paraphrased, but rarely used settings, and a black bar owner providing a formal "street" or "hood" humor. <br /> <br /> Well, forget the jokes, there must be some suicidal snowboarders, as it was a commercial enterprise. Unfortunately, there were only 4 seconds of background action, which could be inspiring. The rest were all class B tricks or worse. The important moment when the main character rides on the “goat”, the killer people’s ski run, really provided one shot when a small avalanche eats a stuntman. It was the best fit in this movie. Any serious snowboard fan will be disappointed with the quality of the stunts in the film. <br /> <br /> With regard to the technical aspects of the film, the soundtrack was average, which is surprising, since these snowboard documentaries are regularly filled with quality melodies. You can catch a lot of editing errors, and even though it was filmed on a ski hill, most of the landscape pictures could not convey any sense of true size. <br /> <br /> In general, it MAY be worth watching if you manage to completely turn off your brain and you love silicone breasts. Even then you don’t remember any of this in two days. <br /> <br /> The snowboard is still waiting for its final comedy, it’s better to watch a documentary about snowboarding.
