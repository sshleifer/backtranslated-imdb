Rob Lowe must have eaten the whole budget, but I can't blame him for running away with the money. Even he would have to agree, there was nothing good about this movie. Shooting, editing, directing, dialogue, scenery, makeup, writing, casting (especially a young girl and an imposter psychiatrist), and the story was all the worst. I have never seen such a terrible movie. Pass it on to any other choice of rental, or shout out nasty comments on TV. Dead Silent should be silenced at all times.
