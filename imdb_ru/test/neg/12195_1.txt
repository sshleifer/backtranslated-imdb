It was not a good movie !! Why do you people keep saying that? There is a cute little story, then some sexy girls and then BAM vampires !!! What for? Why are there vampires? Where did they come from? Also, what the hell ?! There are all these "superhuman" vampires, but George Clooney and three other random guys dominate ALL of them. Fast too. Not that there was a long fight scene with a lot of fighting. There were only three guys from the bar who killed these vampires, like a fat man kills twinks! The next thing you know, Clooney and the stupid girl saved Cheech and leave the homeless without a family in the center of Mexico. The end of the story. Literally. Oh, and the strip club was an Aztec temple, which is funny, because it should be southern Mexico, not the border. Why do you people lie and tell people that this is a good movie? Do not rent, buy or even watch this film in a friendâ€™s house. You would like to have time when you returned.
