Being a big fan of horror films, one of the most difficult things, given the lack of good films in the genre, and looking at hundreds of them in my life, I must say that Dracula 3000 is by far the most boring. Stupid and poorly made piece of garbage. misfortune to see. Stay away from this movie! It is so bad that it is not even funny. The special effects (did I say “special”?) Were probably achieved by spending a couple of pieces, the acting was terrible, and the script should have been in the bin after the first reading of the studio, which decided to take on this pathetic project. The entire film was literally shot in stock. In addition, for those guys who love nudity in their films, do not be fooled by the R rating. If you think that you have a chance to see Erica Eleniak even half-naked, you are mistaken. She is fully dressed throughout the film. And the cover is completely misleading! There is not a single scene in any part of the movie that even looked a bit like a terrific cover that they put on the box in order to attract unsuspecting horror fans. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the rating is only 1 to 10. I would give this film a -10. Keep in mind. Do not waste your money or your time on it.
