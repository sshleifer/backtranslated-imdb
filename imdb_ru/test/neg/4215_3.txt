Margaret Mitchell turns in the grave every time someone watches this mess! Beautiful costumes and scenery can not even surpass the dull representations of Joan Wally (as the title character) and forever sweet Timothy Dalton (as Rett). Even worse than the action - and perhaps partly explains it - the script, which is strikingly stamped and predictable. Add to this hellishly bad script an account that will make you cringe, and you will get a catastrophe that I would not wish for any viewer. Scarlett is just incredibly lousy, and I canâ€™t imagine how it happened at all, and even more so on the video.
