Keep in mind, it should not be, but it is. As a child I watched this film in the theater (being a fan of wrestling and Hulk Hogan). All I remember at night is that we were the only ones in the theater, and I didn’t like it very much. I turned off everything else, and for good reason. <br /> <br /> A bad movie along with such great people as “Gymkata” and “The Pumaman”, “No Holds Barred” is a film shot in high limits. World pro wrestling. Well, maybe the stakes are not so high ... and, frankly, I feel dirty, just calling these people "professionals" in everything. And indeed, besides the first scene, there is nothing to talk about. So I think that a film about the world with minimal bids is an amateur beating without people. Sounds good, right? <br /> <br /> Hulk Hogan plays Ripa, WWF champion (Never say that Hulk Hogan was a typographer, and films like Thunder in Paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles that really parted the boundaries of his talents). In fact, he plays himself, but with a wardrobe that is more black and blue than Hulkster’s red and yellow. He also has this hand gesture that he makes. It's like the Ozzy Devil sign people do at rock concerts, except that you put your finger in the air and bend your index finger. My friend claimed that he should have looked like “R.” Try and see for yourself. If it looks like an "R," then Mars needs women. But anyway. <br /> <br /> Kurt Fuller, with his replay detector, apparently on Fritz, plays a television performer with his slightly homoerotic heart, when Reap, clearly more than Elvis, connects to his network. He will have nothing (and he leaves the office with a triumphant gesture of the hand just in front of the camera), and therefore the film follows Fuller trying to raise his rating and return to Rip. He does this when he creates his brilliant game “Battle of Tough Guys”. Marketing genius, this guy. <br /> <br /> From numerous hand gestures, to rather idiotic scenes of struggle (all play as if the fight is very real and deadly serious), to replay, to too frequent shots see in silent film. It is frivolous, not too burdensome for the mind, cruel and includes the phrase "What is that smell?" "Dookie!" “Duki?” <br /> <br /> A classic for all times.
