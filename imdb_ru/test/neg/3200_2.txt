I'm a big fan of the first Critters movie. The second episode is good, but not as good as the first Critters. The third episode is a bit boring, but cute. AND WHAT IS IT? What the hell! This is stupid and really, very boring. This is the worst of the series. I can't watch it again, because I felt a dream in the first hours. And the evil side of Ug ... eeewww ... is one of the worst moments of the movie. In the first 50 minutes, we canâ€™t see little furry monsters, so the audience fell asleep at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> This could be much better. > <br /> 2/10
