<br /> <br /> Dude, I just can't believe this movie. I watched it completely (believe me, I did it!), And the best part was at the beginning of the trailers (and I hate trailers !!!!). <br /> <br /> No conspiracy, no acting skills, No, nothing. I watched the movie and thought, “When will it start?” It never began. How can people spend money and time to make such nonsense? <br /> <br /> "Story": The dog is bitten by a bat and gets mad - well, still no problems, nothing special, but everything is in order. Now the rest of the film will be - Dog will chase people !!! that's all, nothing more !!! Now add to this some of the worst actions / actors that have ever seemed to me, some completely unrealistic scenes (and some other really idiotic ones, such as a child can't breathe, and the mother hugs him tightly to see if he is getting better), and a very unfortunate ending, that's all, here you have CRAP ... ops! .... CUJO. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and do something more worthwhile, for example, by hitting your head against a wall or playing chess with yourself. <br /> <br /> ZERO of 10. <br /> <br /> Gabriel.
