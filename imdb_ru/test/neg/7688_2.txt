Being a little fan of Michael Dudikoff, I sat down to see one of his good old actors - I'm still waiting. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a group of American commandos trying to get rid of. from a group of Syrian terrorists who captured a nuclear reactor. Maddy Reese (Felicity Waterman) was an English member of the commando division, and, of course, she was romantically involved with Tom Dixon (Dudikoff). I have to ask since the British had female SAS members - as far as I know, if they are ever needed, they are from other sources. Even if they do, I can guarantee that they will not be as wet as Maddy Reese. I also think that Tom Dixon will be a little more responsible in his position - or have I lost the conspiracy ?! I know that in these films there is always a romantic point of view, because it helps to ensure a good mood, but whether it should be everywhere, especially when you need to take into account more important things, such as nuclear war! <br /> <br /> Signing a contract on an aircraft carrier in the USA intrigued me. The “sacred pen,” which was carried by one of the alleged television news teams, did not have any security checks to find out who or what was on board one of these ships, especially with the caliber of people who were on it. Keep in mind, if it were, I think there would be no story. <br /> <br /> I could continue, but when it came to “deactivating the inner body bomb” to safely remove the bullet, I threw it on the Action movie a little bit and I really liked the comedy. <br /> <br /> By the way, does the reporter really say: “The center of the city of Damascus” ??
