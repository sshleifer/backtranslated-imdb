Too much mediterranean courage for me. The cast was beautiful, it's nice to look at all the romantic scenes. The place was beautiful with azure sky and azure water. I just was not convinced that such selfish nonsense, prone to anything other than its building, can attract so many beautiful, vulnerable women. I think only in the Mediterranean. Of course, in no other world am I familiar with. Machos were really nasty, and it was hard for me to believe that female characters could have had something with them for such a long time. Scenario, cinematography, directing, etc. They were created to show a class B film, with the main focus being on showing scenes with beautiful naked female breasts. It was aesthetically pleasing for a while, but a very mediocre film could not stand.
