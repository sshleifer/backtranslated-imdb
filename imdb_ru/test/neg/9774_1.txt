No, in fact, I'm not joking here guys, and I can't believe how many people here gave him really very positive reviews! oh wait, this is the IMDB comments section, stupid me. It is interesting to note that at the moment there were not enough votes to give this film a rating of ten, but there are dozens of comments that rave about the film. What does this mean, I wonder? in any case, the script is terrible. The character changes his personality, motives and actions in each scene, so that the film continues to move in something that vaguely resembled the tempo. it was not even the stupid behavior that was there, but the sheer idiocy of the script was superior to any nonsense that the characters showed. for example: Karl does not obey orders, because there are two dead bodies in the desert and there is a “killer around here,” so he makes everyone walk 40 km to find the killer, disobey orders and dissuade everyone. when the hero notices something unpleasant in the dark and warns Karl, Karl tells our hero to stop being an idiot and that there is nothing there, so they all go home. In the next scene, he refuses to let it go and must hunt down whatever it is. it's just a joke. yes, the monster is very impressive, but the shit that people say about it is just trying to cancel its interesting aspects, and the moments of the predator and the alien were very tedious. and ending ... ending!?!?! Jesus .... the worst movie I have seen this year, and I saw it as a bus-buster!
