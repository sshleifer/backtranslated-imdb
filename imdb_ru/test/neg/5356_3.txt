Normally I would welcome a movie that is trying to do something different or original in the genre. Obviously, this film is a kind of parody of ninja films. And I really did my best to enjoy the film. But I just could not. The jokes aren't funny enough! (I saw my share of Japanese films. And in most cases, I love and understand the humor used in these films. Red Shadow is just stupid!) The characters in this film know that this is not a serious film and show, what is all about fun. Look at the characters from parodies, such as "Hot Shots" or "Scary Movie". Everything that they do on the screen is done with an open face and never falls out of character! And because of this, some scenes become funny and funny. In the "Red Shadow" the actors do not achieve this. Shadow Ninja must be very skillful and deadly. Unfortunately, the actors do not do their best to convince us of their talents. They do not do things with a straight face. Jokes would work better if they did! The bad choreography of the action scenes also hurt my viewing experience. I love the humor in martial arts movies, as long as the action is good. Red Shadow simply fails in this department. So, what's left to enjoy. Well, music (techno) was uplifting. It should be like an action, which in itself is never exciting. And there are several short dramatic scenes that are nice but simple. The use of humor, lack of history and depth make me think that this film is intended for children. But I wonder if the kids will like this movie. Waste of time!
