I discovered that the Dominion is a lousy attempt to continue the success of this story. The original film was a story about evil and how it can penetrate our lives. <br /> <br /> Schroeder’s version lacks evil. Viewers do not have an overwhelming sense of fear, fear or even foreboding. Harlin’s version offers an obvious evil, reveals a violation of the sanctity of the church and creates a compelling story that is plausible, given the origin of Father Merrin. Schroeder's story makes you wonder exactly what happened. Dominion does not cause the audience to feel empathy with Father Merrin, and makes the viewer wonder why he was concerned in the first place. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in seeing the sequel, which corresponds to the original, must be seen by the Exorcist: The Beginning.
