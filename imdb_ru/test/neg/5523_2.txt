Every year, Nu produces several “action”, “full expectation” films. This little nugget, called Shadowcaster III (until I visited this site, I didn't know it was a whole trilogy), is an excellent example of the good work the company does. Frank Zagharino is just as despicable as ever, and does a great job, like the almost indestructible (?), Schizophrenic (??) android. I won’t waste any more words, since I don’t want to reveal a terrific plot and spoil you with a couple of great laughs. <br /> <br /> Rating 2/10 (Revard for those hardworking technicians. Man, collect this type of garbage should be nervous.)
