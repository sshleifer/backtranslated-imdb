I think that many friends of the people who acted in this thing had to come and appreciate it, because I tell you, itâ€™s just awful. Acting is worse than a bad sopaper, the effects are the same as in the Doctor Who episode of 1970, the story, well, in general, there is no story. And they continue to use the same 2-minute song over and over and over. And a werewolf? It's like the dolls they used in Wing Commander, giant cats, remember how bad they looked? Werewolf is so bad. Seriously, the guy who was in charge of this thing is terrible, and he will never have to direct anything else except, perhaps, his son's school play, but even then he will have to pay viewers to see it. The ghost wolf is just a bad joke.
