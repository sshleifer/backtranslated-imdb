This is far from me, as this script was ever sold, much less produced and distributed. The dialogue was so bad that it was disgusting. Scenes of the train and helicopter, it seemed, were made on flash cards by high school students. Lou Diamond Phillips must have hid under his seat when this --- this "film"? was shown in a closed show, after which he most likely left through the back door. The only emotion he gave me was pity for the cast, they had to “bite the bullet” in order to get through it. I could not look at all this, it was so predictable that it was ridiculous. Who knows, maybe one of the networks will pick up a comedy of situations.
