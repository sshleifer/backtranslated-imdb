BLACK EYE (2 out of 5 stars) A 70s film, unimaginable, looks like it was made for television ... just a random curse and a plot about lesbianism indicate that the film was actually made for cinema . Fred Williamson plays a former tough guy policeman who becomes a tough guy. He stumbles upon a pair of murders and attempted murders related to a mysterious cane. There are some fistfights, a bulite car chase, a rather original lift scene, and even time for Williamson to confront his girlfriend's rich, lesbian lover (Teresa Graves). There is also a scene in which Williamson mocks a poor old man by ripping a few priceless old autographed photographs in his store of memorabilia. Yes, the way, tough guy ... maybe you will find a cripple to beat later? Obviously, this film is intended to capitalize on the success of Mine (this and about six thousand other films), and it does not have enough sharpness or originality to make an impression.
