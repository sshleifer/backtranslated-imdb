This film is a completely inaccurate description of the real story of Noah's Ark. The producers probably did not even read the Bible. This is the worst movie I've ever seen! Noah's wife was never mentioned by name in the Bible, but the authors of the film "gave" her the name Naam. This film depicts the destruction of Sodom 1000 years before it happened, but what about Gamorra? It was also destroyed at the same time as Sodom. (It is possible that the producers thought that if you do not include Gamorra in the story and not show the city of Sodom, as you know, something that would have caused even more surprise.) This film is an abomination and mocks God and the Bible. It is amazing that any true Christian would like to take part in the creation of this terrible, disgusting, disgusting mockery of the Bible.
