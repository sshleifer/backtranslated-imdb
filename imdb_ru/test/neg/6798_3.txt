Poor Diana Arbus (whoever she is). Not only did she (according to this film) be a spoiled but sweet acting top of the East Side, she was a bad wife, bad mother, terrible business partner; moreover, in this picture there is no evidence that she was some kind of artist, except for the bold statement in the prologue. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman, who is incredibly attractive today than 25 years ago and actually looks younger, really gives excellent performance; but what can an actress do with a wife and mother who is looking for and falling in love with an incredibly strange guy, like a werewolf, living in an apartment upstairs? Established in the early 1970s, Manhattan was a virtual magnet for freaks and eccentrics of all sizes and shapes, most of them unlike human balls; So why is this film worthy of a 122-minute film? <br /> <br /> Robert Downey Jr. was one of my favorite films, but I would say that his well-known and long-term drug use bore fruit. Some might think that he will not participate in a film that treats drug use as carelessly as smoking cigarettes. <br /> <br /> FUR was already defeated at the box office, but given those who scored 10 points for this unhealthy piece of garbage, I would like to say: â€œSay so, McGee.
