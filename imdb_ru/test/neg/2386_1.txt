“New Twenty” is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Yes, some may argue that formal low-budget films that tend to less may seem worse, but I would say that a pseudo-intellectual anti-formula “indie” film that pretends more is worse. <br /> <br /> “The New Twenty” was written and directed by Chris Mason Johnson, and I will never return the 91 minutes of my life I spent on his film. <br /> <br /> THE SCREENPLAY & CHARACTERS <br /> <br /> From the very beginning and to the end, the script did not give the anti-hero or hero a moral core that viewers would like to see successful or unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> The story tells about three dramatic conflicts: man against man, man against the world and man against himself. <br /> <br /> The script focuses on a group of college friends in New York and is concerned about the “man vs. yourself” dynamic, where each of the film’s characters is so immersed in the stupor of depression and self-destructive behavior that the film atrophies in front of viewers. <br /> <br /> Each of the main characters is engaged in inexplicable bad behavior (heroin addiction without a story about why a character is a drug addict; a bride who has sex with the boss / investor of her bride, even if the character is written too clever to do having sex with such a sloppy character: a person who starts with a decent guy, but attracts a wicked investor and for some unknown reason turns him into a like dirty business donkey - a closed plump gay cyber-geek who does, but finds dates on the Internet, and a gay Asian who meets an HIV-positive older man, but he doesn’t have scenes setting why relationships work and why love develops). <br /> <br /> Critical scenes establishing the cause of character dependency, suffering, and hatred of the bride, which can explain why she is sleeping with her pajama bag; a story that explains why a decent guy is attracted to a character like “Gordon Gekko” and he becomes a donkey; storyline for a plump cyber-geek; and more and more scenes of interaction between an Asian man and an HIV-positive guy are missing. <br /> <br /> Without proper detail, all actions of the characters seem forced and contrived. <br /> <br /> DIRECTION, CINEMATOGRAPHY & SCORE <br /> <br /> I discovered that the leadership of Mr. Johnson does not have a clear point of view, leaving the actors emotionally incoherent. <br /> <br /> Cinematography at best can be described as ordinary. Mr. Johnson chose small locations for filming and could not catch the greatness of New York. This failure led to the emergence of a claustrophobic film, which looked like the filming of a stage play, not a film. <br /> <br /> The score was absent in most films. I assume that Mr. Johnson is to blame for this, since he could have asked to score a full point in order to improve understanding in each frame. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION <br /> <br /> “The New Twenty” is annoying and unrelenting failure in filmmaking.
