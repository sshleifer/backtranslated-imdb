I was told about this film from a friend who saw him late at night during the week. He told me that it was so bad that I had to watch it! So I went to the auction site and bought a movie. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It makes you laugh when it really shouldn't. Awful game and terrible plot. In addition, he does not look like Michael Jackson ?! <br /> <br /> I still recommend buying this movie, as this is one of the funniest things you have ever seen. Van Peebles is a joke in this movie. <br /> <br /> Robots can't bluff ... PSYCHE! <br /> <br /> I must say that the special effects are really awesome ... PSYCH! When this movie came out, the DVD probably even came out, but if I had my own way, it would be a direct release of VHS, yes, people, THIS IS BAD!
