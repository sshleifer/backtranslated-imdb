This film was childish in writing and ridiculous in its visual effects. The scenes where Father Merrin is tossed in his bed, and his views on the lame native are signs of bad behavior and bad imagination. It seems nothing fits. The story jumps from scene to scene. The elementary letter leaves no fact for the imagination and leaves no place for waiting. A woman doctor at some point declares that she thinks that the city will soon "explode" from all the insane events. In fact, there was nothing in the film that could make this line relevant. From the terrible work that the film has done, I would never know that tensions have arisen in the village. If you like vulgar films, rent it, but if you want it to be done right, look Exorcist: The Beginning
