Italians are the undisputed masters of the dubious "art" of robbery and imitation of movies. What they do is adopt an innovative, profitable and foreign concept, support the main plot and just add a ton of actions, meanness and political incorrectness. But what to do if the non-Italian original is already a well-known film, and it is quite difficult to surpass it in terms of indecision and contradictions? Well then, I think you just ignore everything in terms of construction history or style and concentrate fully on the fact that this is practically a porn movie! This Italian turkey was inspired by Richard Fleischer’s “Mandingo” slave saga, released a year earlier, but since the creators were even too lazy to think of a different name, you shouldn’t expect anything that even remotely resembles the depth of the story, character drawings, anxious atmosphere or compelling reflect on statements about intercultural relations. “MandingA” is pure and just an attempt at sexual exploitation when the plot develops only during the last ten minutes, in other words, when you have long ceased to care. The characters in this film are a collection of hideous bastards, which, of course, can be expected when you are dealing with wealthy and disgusting white people who manage the plantation in South America. The elderly and extremely sloppy owner of this place is a widower (who probably also received a couple of awards "Mustache of the Year"), who exploits and constantly slashes the slaves working for him. His mistress, who, if I understood correctly, is also his cousin (?), Is a real bitch of a woman who loves to provoke controversy and sneaks out of the house for the night to copulate with crucified slaves. When the son of the owner of the plantation returns from Europe, after about 25 minutes of just spent time, the site finally begins to develop gradually. A handsome young man had sex with this bitchy woman a couple of times (even in front of the slaves, ostensibly to “demonstrate” how their masters do this?), But in the end he falls in love with the daughter of a Cherubim preacher. His romantic preferences obviously drive the bitchy woman mad with rage, and she is preparing a terribly cruel act of revenge that will change life on the plantation forever. Hello ?? I just realized that this brief description of the plot actually makes Manding sound like an interesting movie! Well, it is not, and I apologize if I raised someone's expectations. This is an incredibly boring and disgusting film to fight, but if you like the themes, be sure to watch the aforementioned Mandingo. This film is not just a terrible exploitation, but a truly insightful portrait of one of the darkest pages of the history of mankind, as well as a film, shot properly, with real actors, great music and impressive film sets. “Manding” has nothing, absolutely nothing to offer.
