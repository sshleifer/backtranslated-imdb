This film was a classic in my part of the country, because it was shot in my small town. I now have many friends who are security guards at Dixon Correctional, and I myself worked for 3 years at the SuperAmerica store next to the Krogers store, which was an old woman. Nevertheless, it is still the dumbest film ever made, intended to be shown by Gilbert Godfride or Rhonda Shearer, if it hasnâ€™t already been there. A little trifles, in Illinois, there is not even a hearing for parole, and Dixon Prison is a medium security facility that houses robbers and vandals of vending machines. The classic seduction / seduction scene is perhaps the most fun piece I've ever seen, especially with intense preparation.
