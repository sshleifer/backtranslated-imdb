The idea of ​​"Dead Silence" is great: a flash of zombies occurs during a sharp radio talk show of paranoia. There was so much for this movie. Unfortunately, as soon as the zombies appeared, everything was lost. <br /> <br /> The movie is funny, and only those who passionately love raw horror films will enjoy it. Zombies were sooo stupid! They ran, waving their arms. They looked like a group of people who were building a haunted house for elementary school students. <br /> <br /> I know that this is a brief overview, but I just don’t see the need to invest a lot in this. This is a stupid movie. You have been warned.
