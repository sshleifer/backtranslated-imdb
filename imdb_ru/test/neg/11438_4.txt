This film was bad, and films about how some college students stay in the house to get money repairing it, and then they find out that there is a woman Damon in the house and that there is a portal to hell. There are a lot of silly scenes in this movie, like at the beginning of the movie, how they clean the house, and they start dancing to a crappy song, and some of the Demons at the end of the movie are just guys in bad suits trying to make scary sounds for example, when a professor's face is torn. I only made this film because I’m a big fan of horror films, and it’s worth seeing only if you’re a fan of horror films. really bad, the only good actor is Roy Shader from the wonderful movie Jaws, and there are a lot of flaws in this whole movie, and my rating is 4 out of 10.
