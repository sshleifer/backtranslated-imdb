The film begins with a 30-minute explanation of the war, human cyborg, battles, history, and then dumps two actors in a gravel pit. They run around this gravel pit / desert for about an hour, shooting at each other. That's all. It should cost around Â£ 10.00, with modifications. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Grades out of ten: Acting skills -9 Kits 1 Costumes -9 Directing -50 Production 1 Under the headline entry 4 <br /> <br /> I think that this film could be improved: to lose comment. (Let the observer decide what is happening). Remove some of the horrific CGI. Add some techno rave music to it. They can just save it .......
