I wanted to like it - the situation was rich, and the situation was unusual and interesting. But the story is littered with children's elements of feminine gothic romance, which are difficult to swallow. The director unfairly biased refers to "goyskim" characters, pleased to allow them to be grotesque cardboard cartoons, and inexplicably condescending attitude to the behavior of the heroine in the housewife. The potentially interesting power struggle between the inventor and the governess is not really considered. <br /> <br /> Feminist directors will gain more confidence when they stop manipulating situations to quit all sympathy for the heroine, and act honestly with the problems. This film is more like “7 pieces of gold”, another serious failure, more than “Piano” is a true story about passion.
