Messy cheesy madness because of the lava ejected from La Brea quarries in Los Angeles. Even if you try to suspend disbelief by ignoring this ridiculous premise, you will still howl with laughter over meaningless dialogue, senseless tricks of conspiracy and wild reckless scientific plots that pass through the screen. <br /> <br /> I have a theory: every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in his career. It was Tommy Lee Jones' turn. Despite the fact that he makes decent efforts, the script is so pathetic, even when it lights up (oh, sorry for that). Most of the support staff are also suffocated by the beaten letter; some of the actors just call in their roles. Anne Heche deserves special recognition in the Hall of Shame for her embarrassing image of a scientist. She is as convincing in this role as Pee Wee Herman, and even he, at least, would have done a better acting job. <br /> <br /> Since there are too many holes in the storyline to list them here, I would suggest that you watch the movie with friends and play Find the scientific absurdities. The loser may be forced to listen to cassettes with banal lines from the movie "All look the same" again and again. Here is an example of the nonsense you can expect: a building explosion diagram was designed, designed, and dynamite installed and blown up in about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the obligatory clich√©s about disaster films: divorced dads, scientists who are ignored by everyone, disgusting police, homeless kids, stupid teenagers, greedy investors, and so on; all are present and abundant. The film also hits you in the head with an unrelenting stream of political correctness. <br /> <br /> Only for lovers of cheese and nonsense. All other viewers: be careful.
