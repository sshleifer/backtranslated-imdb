As a child, this movie scared me green. As an adult, I could not stop laughing. <br /> <br /> I didn’t have the pleasure of watching this movie through MST3K. Instead, I caught it late Saturday afternoon, when there was absolutely nothing in the cinemas, and there was nothing on the street like raking up the autumn leaves. I decided that it should be better. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> There are some very good elements in the movie; A watershed mystic, a hipster artist, a pair of idiotic ranches, an elderly history buff and an “evil wind.” Hmm ... I mean ... an evil head. An evil head, which, as soon as the systematic hypnotism of each of those present is completed, will seek its own evil body. <br /> <br /> The whole story takes place on the evil "ranch", which, obviously, neither grows grain crops and does not breed evil cattle. <br /> <br /> Since their resident mystic declared everything “evil,” you either roll your eyes terribly or laugh while your sides are split, depending on your mood. To me? I laughed until tears ran down my face. <br /> <br /> I fondly remembered this film as one of those that really scared me as a child. But some children are also afraid of Santa Claus .. no? In any case ... if you hit the horror camp of the 50s, then this is a movie that you should not miss. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good storyline, this film has one. This incredible drama and innocence of the time make it so terrible. Acting was just BAD, but it still had some good elements. Maybe it appreciates the remake ...? <br /> <br /> Rating 4.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
