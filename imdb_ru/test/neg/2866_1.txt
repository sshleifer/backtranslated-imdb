and parading around a 14-year-old girl in a bathing suit on a belt is one of them. I would like to ask lovers of this film: will you allow your daughter to take a walk around the resort, dressed like this? And can your 14-year-old cope with the reaction of men? If yes, I would like to know why, on both points. This costume is a clear invitation for men; It is hypocritical to assume that this is not the case. <br /> <br /> And on the other hand, which teenage girl would claim that her father was her lover, without justifying serious mental problems? It is almost as disgusting as a swimsuit. <br /> <br /> Simply put, some things are just not funny or relevant, and they will never be like that.
