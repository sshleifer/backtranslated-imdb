Just to save you $ 3, or as much as you like to rent movies at your local video store, and an agonizing hour — and, no matter how long — this movie is a simple plan. Go to a friend's house, persuade him to rent The Pest for you, look for the first 30 seconds or so, and then find some reason to leave. The initial sequence is really fun, definitely worth a look. Unfortunately, the remaining 99% of the film is terrible. Without a shower scene at the start, this is one of the worst movies of all time.
