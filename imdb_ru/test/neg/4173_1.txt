What can I say about this? Truly one of the most overwhelming experiences in my life. Your brain will try to shut down as part of the primary impulse of self-preservation. I was shocked by the experience of watching this “movie”, and it took me a good two hours to fully recover. This film now combines Revenge of Boogieman and Zombies as part of the hellish horror movie trinity. Of course, I do not mean this difference in a good way. I mean it in a terrible way. Horrible way. <br /> <br /> This movie has no redemption features. Everything is terrible. Shooting without art endlessly gives us the ugliest scenery, that is, a lot of corn, a lot of dirt. History beyond nonsense. Scenario? Was there a script? The villain is not very scary and wears yellow boots in wellington. Kids are annoying. The leading person is free from charisma. And it has the courage to last for 100 minutes. Totally useless on any level, it’s like torture. Usually such a statement would be an exaggeration for a comic effect. Not in this case. Will I even say it again ?? it is torture. <br /> <br /> In the end, I was in a state of paralysis. Fortunately, it was brief. But as soon as I came to my senses, I decided that I should watch the movie “Making Out”. I had to understand. Perhaps there would be a rational explanation for this atrocity. Was it a hard joke? I looked at the first 2 minutes of the “Deal” and found that the writer / director was, to put it mildly, somewhat erroneous. I also found that due to the fact that I spent the time to watch the first two minutes of Making in Dark Harvest 2, I am an idiot. Not a pleasant journey to self-discovery. Life sucks. <br /> <br /> Extremely discouraged.
