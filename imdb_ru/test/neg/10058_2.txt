Donald Sutherland, an American paleontologist visiting England, once picks up a hitchhiker. Two years later, after finding the address book of a man in his car, he returns the book to this man’s luxurious home, but he discovers that he was hanged for murder. No one in or out of the family seems to care that the traveler could not commit the murder (of his stepmother), because he was in Sutherland's car at the time of the crime. <br /> <br /> Sutherland is an alibi of man, but he appeared too late. Out of guilt, he hunts down the real killer. <br /> <br /> Agatha Christie’s riddles usually involve different people, each of whom has a particular motive for the crime, all of them are suspected, and a riddle that depends on building a strict time line. Often, but not always, there is an assistant with whom the investigator can discuss the situation. <br /> <br /> Due to the complexity of the situation, due attention must be paid to explaining each element of the mystery to the reader or viewer. Reservations are fine. We need to keep the characters and time lines straight. Christie's films are a rare form in which the use of celebrities in subordinate characters is really useful. (Jacqueline de Belfort? Oh, yes, this is Mia Farrow.) But this version of Ordeal by Innocence is a production of Golan-Globus, with all the resulting production values, a well-thought-out script and the skills behind the Camera. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes during which Sutherland discovers that an innocent person has been hanged is in order. After that, everything rushes at the viewer in scattered notes, often in sudden memories or in tangled voice-over comments that tell us nothing. The script has the quality of slapdash, as if it were assembled by two hackers overnight. Few people know each other, and this does not help at all. Everyone throws notes about everyone else, and the names turn into a hopeless mess. The musical accompaniment consists of four instruments that perform annoying atonal jazz riffs. Some nudity is added to wake up bulldozers in the audience. If Dame Agatha were alive, she would be among the spectators who needed to be awakened. <br /> <br /> Doullsville.
