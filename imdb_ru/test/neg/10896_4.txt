Something is happening in this film directed by the X-Files John Shiban, which escaped me. You feel it when the film moves, that everything is not as it seems, but I feel that the film is not able to give you enough to really care. It is about perception. There are heroines whom the heroine Nicole (Jamie Alexander) meets in the film, and she tells about it and disappears. This may seem like a spoiler, but this is something that really inherits only a small part of the attention of the directors. They seem to mock us when we observe with curiosity whether we should trust what Nicole sees or not. He never gets the right answer, and I was a little ignorant in this matter. There is a moment in the film when the ambiguity can be just disappointing because the viewer is led in pursuit of the wild goose, which ends in a dead end with a little explanation of what we have just seen ... ultimately, it looks like a debilitating exercise instead of an exciting psycho -drama. Now there is nothing wrong with ambiguity itself, but give us something to grab onto, otherwise you will turn away from us. This is how I felt when I watched “Rest Stop”. This film is presumably about a young woman named Nicole, who decides to flee to California with her lover Jesse (Joey Mendicino) in order to succeed in Hollywood. They do what should be a little detour at the bus stop for Nicole to pee, but it turns to horror for her when she discovers that her Jesse is completely absent. Someone in a dusty, dusty yellow truck is a weird job that seems to give Nicole a lot of trouble, and we soon realize that he is behind Jesse’s disappearance, when everything starts to happen, if signs are given to her, she will get a way out of very difficult situation. Nicole is far from any existing city and has limited resources to protect herself from a maniac who gives her convincing evidence of how evil he can be. <br /> <br /> This is the easiest part. When a female character comes into play, the film makes a really strange leap from logic, as we are not sure where it came from, how it got there and, more importantly, where it goes when Nicole tries to free her from the supposed prison. in the restroom office. She meets another police officer in the area (Joey Lawrence), who may seem to be her savior, but when he too becomes a victim of a truck driver, amazing things happen again that ask questions if he ever was even there from the beginning. . The truck driver commits agonizing acts with Nicole (for example, keeping her in the toilet, and when she tries to untie the wire that the killer has wound on the lock, she gets an unpleasant bite from him). Then he sets fire to the restroom, leaving her without permanent refuge from the beast. <br /> <br /> The time of the truck driver's attacks drives me crazy. Perhaps he just likes to torture her, but he appears in certain situations when Nicole has time to run or prepare. It does not make much sense, his motives that push the film into an illogical idea. Why does he make himself so obvious? Why does he let her get ready? It seems that I am here on the threshold that he likes when his quarry believes that they can find a way out only to crush this hope when he comes with his next terrible attack. And yet, why does Shiban decide to play with the audience when Nicole experiences strange encounters with people who do not exist? What is Shiban and the writing team trying to say? And, to limit the frustrated film weirdness, is a family in the RV. They play a small role in the scheme of things as religious fanatics themselves, but the film does not do enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in this film at all.
