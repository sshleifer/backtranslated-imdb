, and, and never, never see it. Now I watch bad science fiction films for many years. I love watching bad sci-fi movies. I think that was the only reason I could watch this movie to the end. I was toughened by Nukie, Indian Superman and this terrible Fantastic Four movie, just to give some examples. I usually have to bang my head against the wall after I watched a bad movie to get rid of the pain. No, not with that. With TDB, I had to hit my head in the middle of the film with my shoes. Temporary fix. I can't believe I wanted to see it. I cried. When it was over, I cried. It was terrible. It was worse than when I saw * Shiver * Wil Wheaton in his underwear in The Curse, which, by the way, had never looked either. Aside from the fact that Wesley Crusher is in his strong whites, it's just sooo bad. But this review is about "TDB". The worst thing is that someone wrote this film and said: “It deserves to be filmed! It's great! ”And Wayne Newton, Rob Lowe and all the other actors said,“ Oh, this is what I want in my movie history! ”I will watch“ Indian Superman ”until the cows return home, but I will never again I'll see this steaming pile of drains.
