Usually I don’t view movies that I don’t like. However, once or twice a year, I temporarily put aside my rule in order to only comment on what I like to give a word of warning. I like commenting on something that I like and doing it better than making bad movies. But some "movies" require a razor. <br /> <br /> Bilitis is one of them. Cinematography is not the only aspect that is blurred and out of focus. An almost unintelligible plot (of course, incoherent, if it exists at all) is a bad game, a silly scenario and a terrible pace. These are his main problems. <br /> <br /> Understand, I firmly believe that not all films are created equal, and films should be rated according to their categories. Saying, say, Bingo Blanket Bingo against Gone with the Wind is impractical. I judge Bilitis against other films in my weight class. Compared to films like Emmanuel or The Secrets of the Maid, this is really very bad. Even eye candy should be interesting, and Bilitis is definitely not.
