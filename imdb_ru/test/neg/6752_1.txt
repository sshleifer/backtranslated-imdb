they must make terrorists watch this video as torture, and not only for the disturbing final scene in which tying up and beating a woman with mental problems seems to be the source of the comedy. About half an hour of this will convince even the most persistent fundamentalist to shed the beans, rather than survive another minute of this disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. I rented it, because my friend said it was fun, only when he found out that he was talking about the director who was confused to comment, and not the film itself. I suppose if you find unrestrained arrogance ridiculous, you will like it. Obviously, it is true that he continues to talk about tiptoes, which he "hit", the most tasteless example when the leading actress appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> In fact, CJ Stacy was the only good part of this film - her charisma shines like a diamond in this horrible pile of dung. Apparently, this is the only film that she shot in accordance with IMDb. I hope she enjoys theater or indie music, as I think she has talent and natural beauty that can really be useful for any production.
