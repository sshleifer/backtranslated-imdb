This is a family movie that was broadcast on my local ITV station a couple of hours ago at 1.00. This may be a strange decision on the part of the planners, but THE REAL HOWARD SPITZ is a rather strange film, strange in the sense that it does not want to upset its audience. C'mon, there's nothing that kids like more than sadism, which is why Roald Dahl was such a popular author for children. This also explains why the WHO DOCTOR has been such a successful show all over the world. In this scenario, you just want the author of fiction to do something unpleasant for the children, but this does not happen. I do not advocate child abuse, but to see Howard Spitz lose his rag in the smallest would make the film better. Can you imagine how much worse KINDERGARTEN COP would be if producers went to all PCs? I mean, if you are making a film about a children's writer who hates children, shouldn't the story be shown and not told? <br /> <br /> Most of the problem is with director Vadim Jean, and you have the feeling that he doesnâ€™t know how to deal with the material, which is bad news for the film. As someone previously noted, the soundtrack is erratic, and Kelsey's grammar is very wooden. I assume that he tried to play this game, as in this series, for which he is famous, but he does not work here, and there are many scenes with quiet ridiculous camera angles that seem unintentional but very distracting. But in the end, the main problem remains that the potential is destroyed because no one wanted to offend the susceptibility of the audience.
