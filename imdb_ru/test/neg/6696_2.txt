Poor basketball film. A rough coach with dubious origins comes to a small Indian high school basketball team in the 1950s and trains the boys to victory, “first breaking them and then raising them.” thing. Photo is fine. But the plot is absolutely predictable. No real subplots. Nothing added to make the movie exciting. You know what will happen from the start. Suitable for 4 classes.
