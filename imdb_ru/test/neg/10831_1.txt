when I first saw this film, I literally rolled on the floor laughing (especially when they were haunted by water, and when a guy was driving through the gardens of nations, I mean, would it hurt to drive along the washing line?) this film clearly did not have a big budget. or this, or the guy left his baby in charge of control. the water emanating from this damned looked like a big can of beer that was raised. What were the actors thinking? did they really believe it was a good movie? or did they just really need the money? not that they earned much. when I first saw it, I was like “God, how old?” When I looked at the information about it and saw that it was made in 2003, I thought that my TV was broken. <br /> <br /> This is really a film about disaster, in many ways, than one.
