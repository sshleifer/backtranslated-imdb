I’m sorry to say this, but in fact it’s one of the worst documentaries I’ve ever seen. <br /> <br /> Because of his title Darwin's Nightmare, I was expecting a documentary about the problems associated with Nile perch in Lake Victoria. <br /> <br /> What I actually saw in this “documentary” is a collection of individual stories, most of which have nothing to do with fish or lake. And for the most part you can hardly call them stories - this is more like some accumulated scenes in which there is no significant connection ... <br /> <br /> Why this film spends time on: - showing us irrelevant information about the family of Russian pilots (a few minutes were wasted, for example, on their own digital photographs of wives and daughters) - mourning the death of an African child bitten by a crocodile (as if this could not have happened without the Nile perch) - Showing us about 100 times how airplanes land and take off in aero the port - Shows strange religious events for a few minutes - Sluts at the airport discuss in detail the lives and deaths of the airport - Talk with children about their mothers, fathers - what they work and / or how they died (well, guess what: HIV - who could guess?) These are just a few examples, I could continue on several pages ... <br /> <br /> This film is absolutely not focused and absolutely does not know what it wants to say to the opinion of e. If you have never heard of Africa and have no idea that there are problems with social security, health, HIV / violence, and war on this continent, then this film may suit you. If you have not closed your eyes over the past decades, 90% of what is shown in this film will not be something new for you - and the way it is presented here will try to do everything possible to make you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Perhaps my expectations from this film were high, but I really didn’t like it, although this is a topic that I would generally be interested in. If this film wants to show how poverty is related to Nile perch, then perhaps he should have spent some time discussing this issue ...
