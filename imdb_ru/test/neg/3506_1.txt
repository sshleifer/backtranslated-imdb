*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> One of the worst films I have seen in recent years is The Village. Insult any intelligence. Badly written and surprisingly contrived. Nobody, especially in Los Angeles, speaks like these characters. No, elusive. If the meaning of this film is to say that “we all have a bit of bigotry in us,” he does a terrible job, stating the obvious. Not only was his point of view clearly basic, but every character in this film was amazingly stupid. The car start-up scene almost made me leave with the rescue, and oh, let's not forget that WHITE off DUTY Rookie COP picks up a hitchhiker and ... I can go on and on. Awful, just awful.
