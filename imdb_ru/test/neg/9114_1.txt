Ten seconds later I had a bad feeling when a pair of overloaded packs (probably left from a bad western) exploded on stage. The bad feeling intensified after ten seconds, when the obligatory open victim, turned into a man, for no apparent reason, lowered the rearview mirror to see the shadow in the backseat. For the next five minutes for the opening credits, we are being watched as the car swings back and forth, and only the dramatic music created for the television film tells us that the killing is happening, not disassembly. For the next 27 or so hours, we are treated with two idiotic psychotics, who for some reason have to travel together through the desert southwest, chasing each other, like a mad abbot and Costello. Even with the “shocking” twists at the end, we can only shake our heads and wonder if producers and director / screenwriter feel the same shame and embarrassment as they did when creating this inconsistent, incoherent nonsense.
