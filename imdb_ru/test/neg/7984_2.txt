My God, I was so expecting something more interesting than this, when I downloaded this film, seeing that 1903 was one of my favorite years in the cinema, but it's terrible! The “plot”, although I would not dare to call it that, concerns some kind of stupid elephant. He slowly makes his way to some platform and gets the death penalty in the electric chair. Lame. Even for a short film, the plot was too thin to hold my attention. Edison is probably the worst director ever. Plus, the elephant has no screen presence at all. And the ending? Wow, that was not predictable. * Sarcasm * <br /> <br /> Image quality is also terrible. You can hardly tell what happens in most cases. The only positive point in this film is that, unlike most other not-scary horror films, it did not produce eleven sequels. In addition, it is a complete waste of money and 1 minute of your life that you will never return.
