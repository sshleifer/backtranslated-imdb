I am a historian. This film is so wrong that it hurts. I tried to watch with an open mind, but if you are going to delve into the film or anything else on this issue, at least do your homework on history, places, church protocol, and so on. Stop playing for a dumb audience, please. There are those of us who actually dress and go to the theater when something like that comes to the city, worthy of a theatrical release. A little research, all that I ask. But then again, the book on which it is based is in itself a joke. In general, they took a novel with many mistakes and decided to turn it into a script, invest millions and millions and millions of dollars in it and make an incredibly popular world that spreads theatrical release, and no one had time to do a little research . I know a few of my colleagues who would do it just for a loan, or at least give it to a group of students as a task for several weeks to study various aspects? or just pay someone who knows a couple of bucks to just go through it, because, believe me, there are many starving historians who would have taken the opportunity if she had presented herself.
