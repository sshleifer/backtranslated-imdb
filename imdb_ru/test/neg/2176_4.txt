Adenoid Hinkel, a humble soldier in World War I, rises in the following years to become the ruthless dictator of Tumania. He creates an aggressive, anti-Semitic war machine and grows his antennae from a toothbrush. Looks like someone you know? <br /> <br /> From the safety of Hollywood, Chaplin uses this soap box to convince Europe to take up arms and challenge Hitler and Mussolini. Considering that the United States had been neutral for more than a year in 1940 and did not have a strong desire to involve itself in the civil struggle of Europe (remember that it was Hitler who declared the war on the United States, and not vice versa), it is surprising that Chaplin was allowed to spread this over-controversy. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the story includes the vulgar and repulsive Ginkel and the kingdom of terror, which he ineptly leads, and life in the Jewish ghetto, where every person is friendly, humane, brave, etc., etc. ., Chaplin - Hinkel, he also plays the "Jewish Barber", the little hero of the ghetto ("Rogue in everything but the name"). Needless to say, Chaplin writes, directs, plays major roles, composes music and prepares food. <br /> <br /> In 1940, the complete truth was not yet known about the Third Reich, and Chaplin can be forgiven for having less. than a perfect historical foresight, but even according to generally accepted standards, he misunderstands Hitler. A comedian and sentimentalist, Chaplin tries to make fun of Hitler, making Hinkel stupid and unhappy. All this makes him humanized. When Hinkel, a not very militant soldier, fooling around with a big gun and an inverted plane, he becomes more attractive, not despicable. As a dictator, he checks the technical innovations of his subordinates who do not work (parachute cap, bulletproof form, etc.), and these passages are intended to make us think that the real Nazis are incompetent and can be discarded. In fact, the Hinkel regime is made like a pretty and likable by his clumsy body. <br /> <br /> In truth, Chaplin’s day had passed when he began this ill-conceived controversy. In the depths of his soul, he was still a dinosaur of a silent screen (note the humor, with gags like a reeling up and down the street, semi-conscious or pantomime coins in puddings). It is assumed that the hero Schulz is a criterion of European decency by which Hinkel can be judged, but Schulz looks more like a character from an operetta than a Nazi. Is it possible in any case that Schulz’s figure (if one existed) would tell the Führer’s face: “Your case is doomed to failure, because it is based on stupid, ruthless pursuit of innocent people”? And how did Schultz end up in the basements of the Jewish ghetto? If he is the object of an exhaustive hunt for people, why does he continue to wear his Rouritan uniform? Chaplin did not yet know all the horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, but the Nazi concentration camp that he offers us has hopelessly passed away from the dark spirit of the era. As usual, Chaplin thinks in terms of "quiet" comedic scenery, loosely tied to the narrative clothing line. A devastating blow with the participation of attack aircraft, shaving a person to the accompaniment of Brahms and global ballet (follow the plot, shot in reverse order). <br /> <br /> Paulette Goddard - consistently perfect Hannah. Just as people from the ghettos are incredibly sweet, and the Jewish refuge in Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, Hannah is literally too good to be true. Brave, bold, resourceful, hardworking and (of course) beautiful, she is a canary of Judaism in a ghetto cage. "Gee, am I not cute?" she asks, after the hairdresser gives her a make-up. Too cute is definitely the answer. She does not come close to the truth, because Chaplin made her a caricature. “Wouldn't that be wonderful?” The speech that Chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author — too verbose, too emotionally veiled. <br /> <br /> Jack Okey is great, like Napaloni, the fascist dictator of Bacteria. He brings to the process the smell of a much-needed comic film, but the film’s main weakness remains. If Napaloni is stupid and ineffective, how can we be afraid of him? And in any case, the stuttering of a rear-propelled train stop is an excellent example of the Chaplinesque gag, which persists far beyond its comic significance. <br /> <br /> And where did the Jewish Barber buy this flawless Hinkel uniform?
