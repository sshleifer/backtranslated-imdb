I loved so much that all dogs go to heaven, so I went to see the sequel in the theater, and I can't remember that I was more disappointed by the cinema. The story was smelly worse than an old bag of manure. I mean, come on! How Carrif could imagine the possibility of revenge on an animal, much more than he, no matter how angry he was. Plus the image of Satan in the form of a cat?!?! How clich√© can you get? So much for the story. Is it any wonder that Don Bluth, Burt Reynolds, Melba Moore and Vic Teybach would not touch this with a 10-foot pole? The animation was absolutely miserable. All colors were blurred, and I cannot count how many times I could see through objects that were supposed to be solid. It was supposed to be the worst animation I've ever seen! I usually like animated films, but not this bomb!
