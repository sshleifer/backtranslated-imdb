The only reason I bought this DVD is because it has Cynthia Rothrock. Now everyone knows that she is the martial arts queen in the movie. The trouble is, this is not a martial arts film. Cynthia Rothrock has about a minute of battle scenes. in this stupid movie. Now, if you were the director and you had Cynthia Rothrock in the film, wouldn't you like to do a lot of martial arts? all she does in this movie is, she walks around, looks boring, like me, when I watched this bunch of crap. I have a lot of her films, and all of them are films b, but at least they have some cool fighting scenes. I am a martial arts fan, avoid it, no matter what. I'm still angry, I spent 4 dollars to buy this DVD
