This film begins with showing you a map, and then explaining the radar, and it will take quite a long time before you see the deadly praying mantis. Probably the best film of the 50s, this outdated piece slows down a bit, and the return is not very good. Although there are times when a guy from Perry Mason argues with an old man and when he says: “I have narrowed the possibilities down to one,” I'm sorry, but when you narrow something down, you have a couple or more opportunities, not one .. reduce this to what you have not narrowed down, but in fact you figure out what it is. Monster is a standard science fiction exhibition of the 50s, better than, say, grasshoppers at the beginning of the end. Acting is not normal, and the heroine is the most unattractive ... in fact, in some shots, she looks like a guy in a drag. You see a lot of fighter videos and other things, but you don’t see a lot of deadly praying mantis.
