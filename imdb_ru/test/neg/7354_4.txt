What could have been some kind of creepy stuff turns out to be an incomprehensible, crazy movie that even the cinematographers themselves probably didn't understand. If they showed more satanic ritual or something else, it could be worse, but in its current form it is a waste of time and brain cells. Someone else bothered that "a small child draws terrible pictures with a pencil"? Could there be more horror cliché? Probably no. I know, I know, this is from some other country, and it is too sophisticated and complicated for me to understand, so I should not expect that a “conspiracy” will be served to me with a spoon, blah, blah, blah. No difference. I'm still saying the movie is blowing.
