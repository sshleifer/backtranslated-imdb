This movie pissed me off !! Here I think this is a new horror movie, one with a sense of intelligence, and then the movie begins. Landscape, delivery lines, costumes, fake blood, should I continue? There are porn movies with better dialogue than this. I understand the concept behind the indie films, but, my God, it was not just indie, it was a reportage from a school book with a video camera, and all the actors are friends and relatives. This is 1 movie that was doomed from the start. Perhaps, if it was 1982 instead of the new millennium, this film could fly. But it seems to me that someone hung a stone around the neck of this albatross, and he sank at a constant speed.
