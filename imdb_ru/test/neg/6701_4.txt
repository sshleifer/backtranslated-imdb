Last night I attended a viewing of Badland with my cousin. We were excited when we learned that the director / screenwriter, the producer (his wife) and several actors were also present, and that after the film there would be a discussion and questions and answers. But as soon as the film ended, and the credits began to roll (and the film was really not edited well enough for too long), my cousin, without consulting with each other, immediately got up and left. As soon as we started talking on the street, we learned that both of us are so angry that not only do we not want to remain on the discussion, we can’t even look at the cast and the crew that stood near the exit and we went right after as we left. <br /> <br /> I realized that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene in which Jerry cuts the palm of his daughter Selina with a large knife so that her blood can be used to escape the fake mark. It was inevitable in my mind to link the physical pain he caused to her body with the emotional pain that he caused her spirit by killing her mother and two brothers in her presence, sparing her and taking her with him as he ran. I cut my palm earlier (by chance); even a rather superficial cut is incredibly painful, because the palm is very sensitive, and it heals very slowly if you do not keep it still, because you just keep opening it, trying to change your life. But after a very short time, with a clumsy narrow strip of cloth tied around her palm and one scene with a large adhesive plaster, it seemed that she had never been cut. My anger has reached its peak - I will not spoil this moment for you - in Selina’s last scene. <br /> <br /> I got angry because Selina is by far the most responsive character in the film (the actress portrays her good); I was, and you cannot tell me, that a good screenwriter would not know this, immersed in the feelings of both her physical and emotional pain; and the screenwriter, so fiercely and with such contempt for Selina's emotional pain, also treated me, a member of the audience, with cavalier and complete disrespect. some kind of dialogue that tells us that it hurts somewhere. But by this time we, the spectators, feel so manipulated that they are closed. The manipulation begins very early in this film, when the Jerry family dialogue explains to the audience that Jerry had psychiatric problems. Rule one, the writers: make a bet on your audience. Let them do most of the creative work on their own. Tell me a story; do not explain to us everything that we should think and feel. We do not like it. <br /> <br /> My cousin also knew that she had problems with the film at an early stage, in a dialogue, when Jerry and his wife had little to say to each other, except f *** this, b ** * that b *** you. Some couples do find themselves in such bad relationships that the bomb ends up saying every other word from their lips. But it's like watching comedians who swear a lot. Some of them are really funny; curse is auxiliary. But some of them replace the curse with humor, and this screenwriter to bring the metaphor to the end, not Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> This team of husband and wife bravely decided to take on a terribly complicated story with terribly complex characters. But they did not seem to understand that the meaning of the story, especially difficult, will vary for each member of the audience. Successful storytelling requires attention to important factual details, rather than desperate work of interpreting the meaning of the story to the entire audience. <br /> <br /> I’ve worked with Vietnam veterans for five years, I’ve heard more stories than most, and I’m always happy to see released films that bring their stories to a wider audience. At different levels it is important to hear them. But I am less than excited that this storyteller decided before the film began what Jerry’s story meant, and continued to set it out for us with a very heavy hand. Next time pay more attention to the details.
