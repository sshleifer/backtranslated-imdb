This film comes from the eponymous long-awaited ITV sitcom. Sitcom lasted about half a decade or so and brought Rigsby, Philip, Alan, Mrs. Jones and Vienna to our screens. <br /> <br /> Then in 1980. movie version hit the cinema. Now that this happened, unfortunately, Richard Beckinsale died and was replaced by "Only when I laugh, actor Chris Strauli." <br /> <br /> I myself felt that it gave the film a different feeling. I would prefer not to be filmed, because Richard was a key character. Itâ€™s like a porridge movie without Godber or Mackay! <br /> <br /> There were really classic moments in the film, but he felt a little De-ja. -Vu! Many pieces were seen earlier in the series. Now, if you first watched a movie, not a series, you would have a different opinion about it than about a series fan! <br /> <br /> To say that Leonard is definitely in great shape and makes a film, like on TV. series. The film has recently received a new life on DVD and usually comes out on the Terrestrial during a quiet weekend. This is a terrific movie, but for Rigsby fans, you may feel that you have seen it before. <br /> <br /> To say that it is worth buying / watching <br /> <br /> 7.8 / 10
