I felt like I was watching an example of how not to make a movie. I think the director took it in his backyard! There was no real plot. <br /> <br /> Awful script. <br /> <br /> Awful game. <br /> <br /> The worst production I've ever seen. Several bad effects of computer graphics, and then the rest of the films were spent on a walk in the garbage yard. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t usually write reviews of films, but I was touched to warn everyone about it. one. <br /> <br /> Life is short to waste time on this movie!
