This film should be one of the lowest lows of Michael J. Foxâ€™s generally respectable career. I should have known how terrible this film was when I shot it and found that the film was only half watched and was not rewound by a previous tenant. Never a good sign! Fox plays an adult child star, who is now an agent for other kids in show business. His character is delusional in the fact that he still believes that everyone should love him for being Mikey. His big break comes when he meets Angie Vega, a talented child. Vega is abrasive and not at all pleasant. In fact, the only pleasant character in the entire film is Cindy Lauper serving in Brooklyn. One of those films that makes me want to attach a note to the box, warning others not to waste their time!
