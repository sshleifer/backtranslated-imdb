A dedication to a local sports team involves taking novices to corn fields and guess what? There the scarecrow kills people. Only one of the newbies survives, but falls into a coma due to diabetes. Meanwhile, a scarecrow begins to kill all the people involved, one by one. What is the secret stuffed? Do they know this before the scarecrow gets them all? This is a low budget movie, and it shows. The sound is fine, but the picture is really banal. The plot / script really sucks, rather pathetic and illogical. Acting is really bad, and sometimes just ridiculous. I can not say much about the special effects, because there are not so many of them, but very little ranges from bad to normal (for a small budget). There is some nudity, and this is probably the only thing worth seeing in the movie (that is, if your nervous teenager, if not, skip the movie together). Another complete waste of time and money, so do not look. Goes for hack'n'slash fans.
