I watched this movie twice in the last six months (what I’m experiencing so you don’t need to). The first viewing left me half crazy and babbling. The second viewing at 5 am on a rainy morning was a bit better. only once cried out in agony. <br /> <br /> It seems that Pokon (the Aztec mummy) had special desires for some Aztec princess who "had to hold her maid." Obviously, they gave each other a case and were put to death for it. (Now it is harsh!). But before they leave, the film tries to kill us with a screaming Aztec ceremony. Singing will make your ears bleed. <br /> <br /> In any case, there is the usual rubbish of reincarnation. Not to mention the treasure map on the bib and bracelet, guarded by this covered with a sip, Pokonoy. This time, Pocon looks like he was at the sunset of 2000 and is pursuing the defilers of his grave. His groans and groans sound like he has a bad case of Montezuma's revenge (or he read the script for this film). It will make your breath stink. <br /> <br /> Evil Dr. von Krupp appears, desiring Aztec treasure (perhaps to finance acting lessons and scripts) for actors and film crews. His name is The Bat, because in The Curse of the Aztec Mummy, he wore a bat-like hat, hat, and something like a ski mask on his face. I think this is better than Laughing Fat Man. <br /> <br /> The Bat in a typical crazy manner of a scientist wants to rule the world. He emphasizes this, rolling his eyes, laughing manically and chewing on the landscape. He connected the invincible robot. It looks like the bot was made from a 1957 garbage can, chandelier and grill. This will make your eyes bleed. And even takes responsibility for making this can! <br /> <br /> Well, a powerful fight between Pokon and a robot takes place in a new crypt of mother, who used to be homeless. <br /> <br /> About half of this film is taken from “La Aztec Momia”, never released in the United States in its original form, but in Jerry Warren’s chopped atrocity (see My review of the Mayan Attack of the Mummy) and The Curse Aztec. " Mom ". Robot, frankly stupid, like most of the characters. If this and the plot does not make you howl with laughter, it will not work. <br /> <br /> My first impression was so bad that it would get one. But after watching “Mother Maya” (this is a film deserving to be burned) and reviewing “Robot”, you get 3. You should watch this without any expectations. Then it can be naively pleasant.
