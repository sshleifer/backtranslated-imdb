The film opens with beautiful landscape shots of the north-western countryside. Fence poles protrude from the dirty land, a freight train crosses hay fields in the distance, clouds of clouds, small buildings on the side of the road, a motel or a snack bar in the middle of nowhere. Above this is the languid, but mysterious, piano arrangement of Twin Peaks, and all this is sufficiently gloomy and atmospheric in the style of American Gothic. Nevertheless, director John Yost continues to alternate clumsy frames, blocks of letters, opening captions with annoying sounds, colored frames that declare "BLUE", numbers that are counted in the "12 Steps to Conclusion" announced in the opening credits. The first couple of minutes it is obvious that, although Yost is more than able to capture the landscape and the atmosphere, he doesn’t care. He has neither affection for the open Pacific Northwest expanses that Terrence Malick does in the Badlands, nor the time or inclination of David Lynch’s Twin Peaks to weave secrets and intrigues around a certain place. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie John Jost is disappointed with the experimental stunts that serve their own goals. Using a split screen is interesting, I especially like the way we get the first image of Ricky Lee, divided into two parts: one tells about childhood memories that matter only to him, the other swears and knocks his head on the wall, etc. In the film dominated by the second Ricky Lee, macho, an unconstrained hipster with shades, hopelessly involved in himself and stupid. On the other hand, the animation of the stop motion and the choice of playing most of the film in the voice-over text do not work. From time to time, this happens because Yost writes just as well as taking static pictures of a small American Naufersville town, but Beth Ann's monologues, presented in the flattest nasal monotonous voice, which sounds like Stephen Hawking’s computer speech program, the neighing of a horse, so listening to the rumor, it as if defeats the goal of trying to pay attention. <br /> <br /> Each of the couples tells us about their past experiences, their small victories and stupidities, doubts and past relationships that have led to nothing. They speak very little to each other and what they say, they speak with empty faces. But they hump like rabbits. This seems to be the only communication channel left open, perhaps the only one they can trust in any security. Jost clearly chooses his main characters in the "Frame" among the naive and delusional, those who lure the American dream, burned, but he does not put himself above them. He is not forgiving and self-satisfied in his image. They may be misleading, but they are decorated with moments of humanity, although they may be awkward. We are called to empathize and show affection, not point and laugh. This is the most successful frameup; film characters come to life even when their expressionless faces are gone, even when Jost interferes with his ferocious framing and intrusive cameras. <br /> <br /> Then we return to an angry riot over the devastating effects of money. Having lost the inserted snapshot of a dollar bill, we get a weird psychedelic sequence where Jost's camera slides under large deciduous trees that soon become red beet when Beth Ann constantly reflects on the "red trees" in the voice-over, we even get a sudden turn to the plot and genre, when a pair of Beth Ann and Ricky Lee, losers from a small town who have nowhere to go, and he can not keep them in a dead end, come to California and decided to rob 7/11. The film is not thrilled by the emotional crescendo after a failed 7/11 job, such as one would expect from a road movie “couple on the go,” it slowly freezes, and you look out the window to see it really has no place in particular. Parts of the trip were hypnotic, and parts almost touching and funny, but everything else was mostly annoying.
