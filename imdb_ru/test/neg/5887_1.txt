At least some of the sitcoms that endlessly come out of the United States are really bad. This garbage, however, depicts the parents' warm, warm side to the horse for clothes. Acting ridiculously "learned" with the views and phrases uttered in the style of "I am so important, thin and beautiful." In the episode that I just experienced, someone’s “job” was threatened simply because a colleague “made” a phone call by turning off their capabilities ... !! Indeed, it is the lowest of the lowest. What kind of damage this imposes on the observing masses, seeing only brilliant glamorous people marching around the "workers". Totally ill. When the credits rolled, I thought, well, it provided a job for the boys. You know who you are.
