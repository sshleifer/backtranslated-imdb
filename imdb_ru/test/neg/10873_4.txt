Director / host Larry Bishop tried his best, too hard with Hell Ride. The film wants to be harsh, witty, provocative, outlandish, bite it all, apparently in the style of Quentin Tarantino / Rob Zombie. But it is not acute. Links seem forced. Dialogue tries to be smart and fails. Humor is never funny. A good attempt to set a rough tone, but we need to take care of the characters or the story so that it will have remote success. <br /> <br /> You have cool Harley and pretty girls around, surrounded by a bunch of tired, old and not in the form of "bad guys" in what looks like an attempt to modernize western Sergio Leone. If this film may be interested in new generations in the films of the 60s and 70s, thank him. But in itself, this is quite boring and irrelevant. I believe that there is a place for essentially style. But this film is wrong.
