Hey, remember when Hal Hartley was brilliant? What time it was. I would say that the Book of Life was when things really began to go downhill, but I will say that, at least, it went uphill from this one. A film that looks as if it was shot on someone's mobile phone would not have to be bad if it had an interesting story and dialogue, but, alas, it is not enough, just like Hartleyâ€™s spare, bizarre dialogue. In their place is a tedious exposition on the themes of the Christian end of time and the banal history of modern Jesus in a quandary, packed in the modern world, where everyone tries to look like a man from the film of Hal Hartley. Although in the second half it is gaining momentum a little, it is never pleasant or especially meaningful. What the hell happened to you, Hartley?
