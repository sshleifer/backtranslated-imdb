Magnificent fiction, played as if actual. Tonight I was looking at Alcatraz's Farm. Robert Stode was not a model meek prisoner, and he was in prison because he was a pimp and the client did not pay. When he went to prison, he became so unmanageable that he spent most of his time in solitary confinement or in a prison hospital. In prison, they also killed several people. This film reminds me of Alcatraz's Birdhouse, but worse. Robert Stroud did write books, and he somehow contributed to society. And the BOA had some hints of Stroud’s madness. But this guy Henry Yang, who is supposed to be “Murder in the first,” was a well-known bank robber who took hostages and beat them for more than one robbery. He was not some poor guy who stumbled upon a grocery store, which turned out to be a post office and took some money. This man was a tough criminal. He also killed a man 3 years before he went to Alcatraz. He did not kill another man in prison because of solitary confinement, which ended a year before the murder. The real story of his life would be more interesting. They didn’t even understand the warden correctly. You cannot be a warden in 3 different prisons at the same time. And, apparently, the warden in the film was a pretty decent guy. Plus, if my math is correct, the Warden, played by Karl Malden in BOA, is supposed to be the same in this film. Oh, man. Moreover, in this film we think that poor Henry committed suicide. And he wrote the word Victory. Not true .. he can be alive right now. He was sent to Springfield, where Robert Stroud was also a prison medical center, and then Walla Walla for another murder he committed, and then was released and released on parole in 1972, which was never found. Maybe he hangs out with that guy from CB Cooper, who jumped out of a plane in Washington state after committing a bank robbery? Now the acting was very good. Kevin Bacon enters a class of actors that includes Jeff Bridges and Dennis Quaid, an extremely underrated theater of actors. Gary Oldman, they could just come up with the role of the warden so that he could play her because he was great. Christian Slater still sounds like Jack Nicholson, I'm not sure if this is good or not. Bacon’s wife Kira Sedgwick was in the film, I think, just because she is his wife. Although I like her, but not in this film. For some reason, I felt that this film, when it first came out, was supposed to be a special project for Kevin Bacon. I feel that he could take a person who is really a victim of the penitentiary system, there are plenty of them, and they shed some light on their plight. Another then selects a psychopath to show as a victim.
