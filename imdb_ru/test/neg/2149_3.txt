Hell pay was a disappointment. It was nothing like the movie B Western, and in no case can it be compared with such a fantastic film as Silverado. The dialogue was boring, the plot was sluggish, the soundtrack was powerfully unnecessary, and the game was terrible. Even professionals could learn from the Sunset Carson School of Acting. The only positive thing about this film is that it showed some of the best Cowboy shooters in the country, but you can see them in the best light in any SASS video. The packaging of this feature makes it very tempting, and the preview is decent, but after that it's over.
