How is this a documentary? Much more like a walk with a ghost that you can take in any southern city. Quotes were generously omitted without any prior attempt to determine the source. George Orwell was the most famous quarterr. <br /> <br /> Documents were transmitted without any representation. Flat fraudulent footage depicting historical films were glued to the side of historical films, not separated from reality and self-promotion. The films, which were completely unrealistic and unbelievable for that time, were abandoned, as if trying to raise Blair's monkey, hoping to play the ghostly house on the fact that otherwise it would be just a dead estate. <br /> <br /> Is this not some kind of disrespect for the real victims of tuberculosis, a dance on their collective graves for the sake of commercialism? The border between actual shooting and self-service is so thin; drops of doubt, so slightly understated; scientific boundaries are so clearly ignored ... how can this be stated in my TiVo as a documentary? <br /> <br /> This is an advertising campaign for the holidays, and in this she was completely successful. <br /> <br /> Hell, I would visit this association if I could find it in Google Earth. Not terribly said the previous poster. Not too serious, I say. Fascinating story. Shaky filmmaking.
