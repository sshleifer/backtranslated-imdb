Steven Seagal plays the role of a dude, who is persuaded to drive an armored car for the bank and drive in everything that comes his way. However, the police seem to appear at the scene of the accident very quickly, and Segal smells the rat, who notified the police in advance. History permeates many turns, and the money from the delays disappeared, and no one knows its new owner. Poor Seagal is a little substituted in this hold, and, of course, he is looking for a person or people who are trying to remove him for a long time. In this film, Seagal is trying to be a good guy, but the forces of evil are against him. Unfortunately, this is not a great movie and rather boring and too long.
