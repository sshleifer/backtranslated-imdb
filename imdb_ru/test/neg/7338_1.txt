What a horrible movie. I can not believe that I actually sat down and watched it. Very, very, very, very, very, VERY miserable effort, without any redemptive qualities. Hateeeeeeedddd ittttt! The so-called "racing" episodes are ridiculously terrible, and the plot was so bad that I forgot it. Part of the film was made at the Spa-Francorchamps resort in Belgium, I think, in 1988, during this Grand Prix. I was there and glad that I had not appeared in any of the paddock scenes shown in the film. That could be good ... what a pity.
