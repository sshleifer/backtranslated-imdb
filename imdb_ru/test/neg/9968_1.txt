The only thing that interests us in this film is the subject matter. Looking at Manson’s “family” from the point of view of family members is a great idea. However, an attempt to understand the incomprehensible - this is what can really be done only in a masterpiece - and it is not. <br /> <br /> Presumably, because so much information was embedded in the script, this film was made in an artificially documentary style, with added reconstructions. The problem is that the script and direction make it impossible to create those things that make the movie watchable, such as character, story, theme, etc. What's worse, there is an incredibly weak plot that follows a small group of modern mansonites for the reporter who is working on the anniversary of the killings. This is stupid and meaningless, and it is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is one big missed opportunity. The only ray of sunshine is actor Mark Pitman, who plays Tex, who in real life committed most of the actual killing. While the female characters look like a giggle in the memories of the 60s, Pitman manages to convey a real feeling. <br /> <br /> In short, do not worry about this movie.
