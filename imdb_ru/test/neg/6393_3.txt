Yes, I know that girls are hot, and the scenery is beautiful, but for those who know this place, this is fun. <br /> <br /> If you need accuracy, you canâ€™t rely on this movie. It begins with a flight from Sao Paulo to Rio aboard a 747 aircraft. This will never happen on a 400-kilometer flight. Small planes, such as the 737 or A-320, run between the two cities every half hour. A trip from home at the airport, if it is shown on the map, will show a tangled zigzag back and forth. Manufacturers may have tried to imitate one of the very well-known routes for taxi drivers when they came across tourists. Not that it was a local habit, since I myself was torn down in very serious places, such as Switzerland. Girls, yes. All topless. This is something a stranger will never understand. Brazilian chicks will be happy to show off 100% of their incredible bodies at parades in Samba schools and wear virtually nonexistent bikini at the beach, but they will never be topless. A handful of beaches across the country will allow this. All carefully secluded and out of town. Oh, the interior; amazing wallpapers ... maybe in Disneyworld ... Also, this is very interesting, and yes, Demi Moore is absolutely gorgeous.
