I knew Brad Linauvera in Florida in the early 70s when he was an inspiring, resourceful writer who, I thought, was headed for fame. <br /> <br /> And that's why I shot this video. Well, well, well, time was not kind to Mr. Linaweaver. I believe that the pressure of earning a living makes higher aspirations worth it. Another flower, the flowering of which came and went unnoticed in the summer wind. Amen. There is nothing more to say. And nothing more to add. The sad epitaph of a once flourishing career, as mentioned above. But this is the price paid for chasing shadows without a solid foundation or goals for yourself in life. Because this film has no goal, no goal, and I kept repeating to myself what happened to Brad's work, his once bright genius? The gone, gone, years of neglect spoiled his once shining mind.
