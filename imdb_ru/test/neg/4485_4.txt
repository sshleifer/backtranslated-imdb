I was persuaded by one girl .. John was a nice guy, sweet, sensitive and looks great without a shirt !! I thought it was a love story about both of them, but mostly it was his reaction to her letters. Savannah was a pleasant character at the beginning of the film, but as soon as she left him, I lost respect for her. She said that it separated her from being away from him, and it was difficult - he was the one who was a million miles away, he killed people, and the only contact he received was through her letters !!! She was not hard, she had family and money, and he had a debt! I was so upset at the end when he forgave her - he was too beloved. I would wait 3 years and meet him at home with open arms.
