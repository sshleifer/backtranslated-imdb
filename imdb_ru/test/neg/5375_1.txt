I have to agree with two other comments. I waited over a month to see this great new show A & E advertised. What a disappointment!!! The show is largely devoted to Ryan Buell. His voiceover is off-screen, not creepy. It sounds like he is talking in a bank. As for the second episode, which is about 30 minutes or so (if you are shooting an advertisement), he is being pursued or pursued by something that he knows is demonic. He cannot give a name, every time when someone needs to give this name, they write it on a piece of paper and pass it on to someone else. Not particularly informative or interesting or believable for the rest of us. Why can't he pronounce the name? ... perhaps it will give the demon more power. Funny, I always thought that the demons want to hide their true identities. If you know the exact name of the demon, will it not be easier for you to exorcise him? Now the next episode, which comes out quite recently, is called "Exorcism". So is Ryan already in need of an exorcism? Not to say that this could not happen, but so far the show has not provided any evidence or evidence of anything. I can tell Ryan that if I were a little kid, damn it, if I were an adult, and someone gave me a small bottle of holy water, to get rid of something that terrified me, I would have asked for help elsewhere! !! In addition, if you do not use holy water, blessings, etc. In the right way, do you not risk even more angry with what is already angry with you? I’ll probably watch tonight, but if these episodes are as ridiculous as the first, it’s probably the last time I watch them!
