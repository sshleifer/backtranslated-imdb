Although the film looks quite stylish for an indie created with a very low budget, I donâ€™t go to the movies. There was not one character whom I would sympathize with, they all seemed to be completely ignorant losers. All that they are trying to end badly, for me it is too hopeless. Reviews relate to Puffy Chair as a black comedy ... comedy? Brother Rhett behaves like a fugitive from the institution. When Josh talks to his friend Emily about his brother, he almost hints that Rhett is not playing with a full deck. Nevertheless, Josh holds a "wedding" for Rett and the woman with whom Rett met just a few hours ago. There were several interesting speeches of some characters who met on the road. However, for me the most revealing thing was that people were leaving the film ... and I saw him at a free show.
