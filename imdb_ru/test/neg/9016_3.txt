WARNING: SPOILERS Dear Roger, <br /> <br /> You have done a lot of fun during your outstanding career, some good, some good. The Night of the Bloody Beast falls into the latter category. It's not so terrible, like, say, the “Ghost of 10,000 Leagues” or, maybe, the “Horror of Danwich”. However, one of my greatest critics of this film is that I could make it faster for you, better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the preface and titles. Roger, the rocket sequences look like something from Disney's Man into Space, of course, not so good. The futuristic rocket ship in the modern world of 1958 has nothing in common. Why didn't you just use Vanguard, Atlas or even launch Viking? Better yet, why not do without a launch and start with a satellite image and a capsule floating in it? That's what I would do for you, Roger. Secondly, why does the spacecraft fall at the entrance? Even a high school student in physics could tell you that your astronaut would come to the earth very crisp and largely discolored. I would show that your astronaut becomes an “obsessed” monster (perhaps with the help of the wonderful “negative / positive” material you used in the “War of Satellites”), losing contact with the ground and landing in the desert. It also explains how you, the “bloody beast,” could soak up your astronaut during the tremendous heat of the return, but still be destroyed by fire. Even with these stupid things. The first half of your movie is pretty good. If you spent some money on decent music, it would be as good as the mediocre episode of "Outer Borders". But, again, your writer describes Ed Nelson as a developer of a landing system, and then gives him some silly talk about magnetism. The biggest problem with the second half of the Night of the Bloody Beast is Michael Emmett. He is terrible as a doomed cosmonaut. You had to fire him on the spot and replace him with Ed Nelson. You could combine the duties of Nelson with the duties of John Dunlap and save on the cost of one actor. I don't know if you paid any of these people; but at least you would save on three meals a day. I also threw the "scorched parrot" costume and spent the extra money using cosmetics to turn the astronaut into a "bloody beast." It may have been too close to “Creeping unknown” for you, but it would have greatly helped the pace of the second half. if you have a bloody beast, wouldn't it be a good idea to show some blood? Yes, I know that the name comes from an astronaut's blood embryo, but Kowalski could do much better for you if he poured some chocolate syrup. In the end, it looks like blood in black and white. How much did it cost you, maybe two dollars? I would also use a few close-ups. For some reason, ruthless dialogue and bad play do not seem so bad in close-ups. Watch almost the 70s TV series, and you will understand what I mean. In conclusion, Roger, note to your writer. You cannot use a fluoroscope to show some kind of poor schmuck full of alien embryos when you do not have electricity. Remember you fry the generator on the first drum? Oh, and I almost forgot. Roger, could you not afford a fake knife? You know, kind of where the blade goes into the handle. I had one of them when I was 9 years old, and this is also the year when the “Night of the Bloody Beast” was arranged. It cost maybe another two dollars. I think I knew enough then to make you a better film. I KNOW I know enough now to do it. So, Roger, if you decide to remake The Night of the Bloody Beast, or if you are looking for a writer / director to work with you on SOME OTHER PROJECT, I am your man. I’ll be cheap because I really want to make a movie for you, Roger. <br /> <br /> I put the "Night of the Bloody Beast" on "3." SPECIAL NOTE: If you like watching kitsch movies like “The Night of the Bloody Beast,” the DVD I bought for $ 3.99 was very good quality. You can also get the Night of the Bloody Beast, along with many other horrible horror / science fiction films in places like Bestbuy, for about $ 6.
