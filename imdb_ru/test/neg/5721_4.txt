Honestly, this film is weak. Very weak Only the title character can do something. It works like a supercharger on a bad engine ... so if you like red-haired Valkyrie, take a look. But better find a picture of Bridget as Sonia and place it on your desktop. It will save from disappointment. Well, Arnold does his job too ... but this is definitely not his best role. Other characters - bad is not the right word. Is the sword fighting? Monsters? Funny. The plot is really shameful. Why rape her? Especially we do not see it. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is rather weak. Although the worst films exist ... Without the main characters, it would be just ******. And if someone even discusses this, maybe ...
