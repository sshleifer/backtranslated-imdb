Do you know that they really want to escalate the moon? And in Geneva, is there a project under discussion that could lead to the creation of a time machine? All I can say about this film, which is based on facts about the future (during the movie), scientific projects but real. I hope that the moon will not exist as in the film. Now about the film itself, I also watched the original film and read a book. A book I didnâ€™t like, but a film, yes. I completely agree with the previous comment that this film was depressing, unlike the 60s. It was very good with strength, this one was only the parallel future of what is good cinema.
