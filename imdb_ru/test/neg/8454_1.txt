I caught it during a short run in the Philadelphia Theater. Despite his local origins (and his connection with the tragedy in his hometown, namely the beating of Eddie Polek’s death in 1994), I really have to fall heavily on this film. The director, for the reasons best known to him, decided to shoot the entire film in the style of partisans, with non-stop hand-held cameras and rapid-fire sections. Such a technique may work for scenes of brutal violence, but is completely unsuitable for the rest of the material, which makes up most of the film. A walk on the sidewalk, a conversation between brothers and sisters on the sofa, hell, even a kiss on the first date - all this is in the style of “cusinart”, distracting this viewer from the opportunity to enter the drama. Martin also undermines his narrative by packing too many topics: besides the birth of mob violence, we get anorexia, alcoholism, divorce, racism, parental violence ... did I miss something? Without a doubt, the best cast (and more focused direction) could unite these threads, as Martin definitely suggested, to demonstrate how one moral flaw leads and supports many others ... but good intentions are not necessarily great films to make. Just a sprawling mess. Martin, I know you're from my town, and I'm with you, man, I really ... just do better the next time you did in Two Plus One.
