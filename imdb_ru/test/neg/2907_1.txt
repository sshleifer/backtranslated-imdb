The installation prologue, obviously made by blessed maniacs who actually decided to distribute this thing, tries to convince us that the comic effect of this incredibly incompetent piece is nothing quite deliberate. Do you not believe: this is Lloyd Kaufman, like Andy Warhol - Herschel Gordon Lewis. He is so thorough in his project of torture of his hypothetical audience that it looks like some kind of misanthropic set of negative art, but this can not be, because he is completely devoid of self-consciousness. As disgusting and ugly as “Things” or “Ice Creek”, this manages to raise the stakes by reworking itself with insanely bald persistence, which must be seen to be believed. Hitchcock-style frame-by-frame analysis, say, attacks on cardio girls can give twenty edits and maybe three minutes of footage — only the sequence lasts ten minutes! You WANT to believe that this beginning of life is like a slightly more tolerant short subject, except that if you remove the repetition, what is left will be much less exciting: for example. when the "villain" really enters the room, he only inspires long, very apathetic, completely empty views from his inevitable (offscreen) victims. Repeat this scenario about four times, in slightly altered conditions; connect them, perhaps with a total of thirty lines of dialogue; to propose actors who are even more hated and lethargic than those that were in the above-mentioned classics; and decorate us with a monster made up of gauze, ketchup, and one Spock's yellow ear, and you have a stunning film to give up, a working definition of the bad. I'm proud of it!
