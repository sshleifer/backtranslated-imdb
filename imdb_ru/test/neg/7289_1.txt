This movie was terrible, and you should not even call it a movie. From my point of view, these are rather three mediocre daily episodes from Disney cartoons strung together to create one video that claims to continue the first Atlantis film, which was much more successful and enjoyable. And why should I start with the problems of this DVD? Story? Characters? Pictures / animation? For me, they are all bad and invisible. First, the story on this live DVD video is ridiculous and meaningless. The only good thing about this is that it is consistent - that is, consistently bad, from beginning to end. After the end of the film, I still don’t know why Milo returned and how the events in the three little stories relate to each other or to Atlantis itself. And all I could remember about this film was how badly I felt after watching it. The characters feel wooden and they lack individuality, and the drawings look very different than on the first. You can say that they are obviously not from the hands of the same animators from the first. While the DVD was playing, I was less concerned about what could happen to the characters, and just hoped that the movie would end soon. In addition to the plot and characters mentioned above, the quality of the image in this film is also low, probably one of the worst video products that Disney has ever produced. As a fan of the original Atlantis: a lost empire, I could not be more disappointed with Milo’s return, which is a waste of time and money. Thank God, I rented it first instead of buying it. Despite this, I still would like me to never see this nonsense and not even know about its existence.
