Come on FANTASTIC DRAMA ON SCREEN? Are you kidding guys? I would not play the terrible Molly Gross even in the school game! Where did these people learn acting skills? Borrow some papers from the neighbors of the actor? Scary plot, terrible game. Heh ... why do you take us for the weak-minded? What can I say more. I understand that this is a television production, and it is not supposed that this is an acting game from citizen Kane. But, nevertheless, they must try their best to earn their money. And besides, what can be said in 10 lines for such a simple film? Want an article in the morning paper? To tell that? Worst movie in a decade? Well, you want it - you got it!
