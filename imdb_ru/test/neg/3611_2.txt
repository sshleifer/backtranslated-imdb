George Sluizer, known as "VANISHING" (he made both a ghostly European original and a Hollywood remake), shot "CRIMETIME". He should not be blamed for this confusing, bad film, because all the problems lie in the script of Brendan Somers. It is poorly focused and lazily written. For example, a murderer hangs around a nightclub, waiting to pick up a victim, any victim, and starts talking to a teenage girl. Going to the next scene where she tells the villain: “I told you everything about myself, tell me about your life?” Unfortunately, the girl told the villain her life behind the scenes and is a terrible example that the screenwriter cannot revive the character through dialogue . I know exactly how damn difficult it is, but for the script that is being created, the screenwriter should have tried his best. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to explain the meaning of the film. At some point, it seems that he is trying to be a British “NATURAL BORN KILLERS”, satating media voyeurism with crime (it may even have affected the infamous video game “MANHUNT”), but the script is not so witty to do it. If you have a sex scene that does not develop a plot, characters, or a hint of subtext, you know that you have a poorly written script, and CRIMETIME is a poorly written script
