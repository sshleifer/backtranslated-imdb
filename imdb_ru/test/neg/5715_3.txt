It's nice to see that Julie Andrews plays a direct dramatic role here - something she didn’t do some time ago - but her character Judith (wise, they didn’t try to pass her off as Judy) has an old sophistication of manner and a tomboy hairstyle of the past, and Andrews plays " adult ", like any other actress interprets the frigid. This is an amazingly soft dramatic series in Barbados, in which Omar Sharif participates (not the most lively leading man - even in 1974!), Hoping to make Andrew a spy, and also slowly leads her into the bedroom. An unforgettable walk really has a certain value for the camp: loans like James Bond are at first a trifling cry. As for Julie: she is calm and contemplative, but it does little for the public or film. Blake Edwards walks this damn thing like a funeral. * from ****
