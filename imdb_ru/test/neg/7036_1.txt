one of the worst films I've ever seen, but very funny (not on purpose). Every scene that is related to something; The plane, the novel, the script or the acting is badly flawed. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to all pilots, it is so bad that at some point in the movie you have to burst out laughing (see also Airport 79: Concorde, for the same reason). <br /> <br /> Anyone else, avoid this movie like the plague (except for fans of B-movies, of course) <br /> <br /> enjoy
