I was subjected to this terrible excuse for a film made for television. I only watched it because I didn't have cable television, and my only choice was Golf, College Basketball or local news. The plot is very general and has no substance that I could see, not to mention the fact that in my eyes there was a big flaw. The protagonist, Dr. Sorensen, is a scrubbed astronomer who believes that an asteroid named Nemesis will hit Earth, and his whole life will stop. He bases his faith on the discovery of cave paintings by the aboriginal (I am sure that I wrote it wrong). The pictures show an obvious timeline, showing significant events throughout history, such as the construction of the Great Wall of China. All events are shown in perfect chronological order, and the most recent picture on the timeline is the destruction of the Earth. Now for me, if the picture shows things that really happened, why does the great Doctor believe that he can somehow change what was going to happen? All this aside, the film moved with extreme formal precision. There was nothing in the film that would surprise me. The actors were not very good, and on several occasions I simply felt that they didn’t even take the film seriously to make enough effort to convince me that the characters deserve attention. The whole movie was mixed up on the cliché, and it is a waste of time and money. I would recommend Armageddon for this piece of shit any day. At least, Armageddon has a good game (compared to this), not to mention the fact that it is sweet for the eyes - Liv Tyler. Now that I think about it, Golf is not so bad .......
