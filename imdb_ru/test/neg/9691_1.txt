This is the most inaccurate and shameful biblical film I've ever seen. I would like to know why anyone on earth could enjoy this viewing. I am so surprised that such a big name as John Voight will agree to perform in this disgraceful piece of garbage. Many people who may not have read the Bible will now be deceived into believing that this film was accurate, and the thought of that really bothers me. I think that manufacturers have, for what to answer. Worst of all, I suppose no one could make such obvious mistakes with the biblical film, as they can explore the Bible for truth, so I think the creators deliberately distorted what the Bible says, and nobody has the right do it and I find it very offensive. There are no words strong enough to accurately describe how I feel about this.
