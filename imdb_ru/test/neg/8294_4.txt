Well, a movie about a movie that takes a crack when making a movie Video can be interesting. Maybe it should be, it should be funny, sharp, even contradictory, or at least interesting, and yet ... This film is a negative version of it. Hamlin was the entertainment producer of the movie "B". Shatner played crazy but cute and had all the best lines. The remaining characters were boring, predictable, boring, underdeveloped, boring and boring. The value of production was lame. You will actually see the boom coming down in one scene. The sound was terrible in some scenes. Hey, I'm a big fan of Shatner and Hamlin now, but their talents are in vain here. At the very least, the story had a clich√© ending.
