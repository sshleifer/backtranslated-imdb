I'm afraid I only stayed to watch the first hour of this film, since it seemed to me to be pointless television trash and waste of talent. Liv Tyler plays a gorgeous beauty, but her acting skills are not yet sufficiently developed to play the role. Since she slowly seduces the bartender into a life of crime, it is difficult to feel any real concern about any of the characters. Even John Goodman expounds his poorly humorous lines without any pranks, as if you need to slowly repeat the silly humor if someone misses the joke. It is supposed that the final will be good, but the starter and the main course have left me no interest.
