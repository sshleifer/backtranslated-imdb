Little did I know that when I signed the package “All payment channels” on Direct TV, I was faced with such a movie. It happened right after another film that we watched ... and I was a teenager in 1981, so I'm not sure where I was at the time ... but I missed this film. <br /> <br /> I also can't believe we left it. It's pretty funny, because it takes you back to the time machine in the early 80s ... but I think that even then it would be a painful film. It was just ... good ... "too cute"! ET was "cute" in a sense ... but not too unpleasant ... and stupid. <br /> <br /> When I see such a movie ... I go to IMDb to see what others are saying. I was blown away that this thing was assigned! Wow ... the film industry has come a long way since the 80s! Oh, well ... it did show some old actors ... by the way, this is another thing that I surprised ... the lineup ... not the nameless band ... but some real actors / actresses. Must be on their drug days! In any case ... strange, interesting, strange and happy that they grew up!
