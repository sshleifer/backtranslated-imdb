Oh, man, I hated this movie. Of course, the sites on the site were great, but this is ONLY positive, what can I say about it. Now I am going to state at the very beginning that I am VERY critical of how a weapon, especially a firearm, is portrayed and processed in films. As a war film, the image was fine, but poor-quality handling of weapons in a film would NEVER be allowed by this PRINT command. The action was more wooden than my first sailboat, the wearable equipment (or lack thereof) was ridiculous, and the dialogue, let's say, lacked ANYTHING interesting. Well, except for the journalist who was actually prophetic. Watching this film was comparable to watching “Palmetto” with Woody Harrelson, where every scene was so bad that you simply couldn’t turn it off, because you had to see if they could get worse in the next scene. Like Palmetto, they certainly did. The scene in the water, where, after shooting at the first enemy, they blow up the damn boat, thus encountering a possible drowning, made me laugh so hard that within a millisecond I almost thought it was worth waiting for a movie. Then Charlie Sheen decided to drag the surviving enemy into the depths of the ocean (as it was filmed, with numerous camera cuts, it seemed that they fell about 80 feet. Good continuity there ...) before striking his throat was damn stupid, I was stunned. Again, so was this whole damn movie. I like action movies, but not this one. NOTE: The version I watched was the television version, pan and scan. I cannot imagine that it mattered, except that it was all blessedly shorter!
