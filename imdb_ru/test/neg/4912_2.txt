Emraan Hashmi post MURDER played some good roles in Bhatt films, but another director only used his kiss and naughty image <br /> <br /> AKSAR is one of them, and he appeared after AAA, JAWANI DIWANI in a row, and I was him already fed up with such roles <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film there is a good twist, I felt like Abbas Mustanâ€™s film, but then it turns into a regular film with sudden love, sudden jealousy and bad climax <br /> <br /> Anant Mahadevan makes a terrible movie. Music saves grace. The filming is great. <br /> <br /> Emraan Hashmi simply repeats his actions in his previous films and has 2 expressions throughout Dino, looks tough, speaks as if he practices Hindi, and in some scenes he is all right. Udita impassive and annoying
