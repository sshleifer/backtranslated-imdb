I remember watching this movie when I was a kid. I remember, it terrified me, and it remained with me all these years. I spent a couple of years trying to find it on the Internet ... I do not remember the name, just the storyline. After searching and searching, I came across VHS, which was sold on E-Bay. I was excited, and when he finally arrived, I inserted him into the VCR and could not help but feel nostalgic. Needless to say, I was a little disappointed. It was not the movie that I remember when I watched in childhood. It was boring from time to time, and I found that the continuous nagging of Beryl Reid was very annoying. Both of Reed and Flora Robsonâ€™s performances were good overall, but the film was not scary. I think that any film is worth watching to form your own opinion, but sometimes, well ......
