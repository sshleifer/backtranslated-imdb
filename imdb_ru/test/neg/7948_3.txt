Attack on Plot 13: 3/10: Let's forget for a moment that Attack on Plot 13 is a remake of a classic action movie. Taken completely in essence, Sturm is a rout. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the script in the style of Rio Bravo. About a dozen people were trapped in a decaying Detroit police station (if the location in Detroit gives you a warmth for Robocop and the fluffies stop right now. He could easily say Topeka in the opening credits and nothing would have changed. There would be more meaning in the forest .) Around them are our bad guys; corrupt cops. <br /> <br /> Now I know what you're thinking. Corrupt cops? Were the Nazis and drug cartels busy this weekend? Of course, these are no ordinary cops. These guys are right on the cover of the latest Tom Clancy video game. Yes, we have a bulletproof vest; helicopters; laser sights; night vision goggles works. So we have thirty S.W.A.T. The members of the special forces are armed to the teeth with verses 4 cops (drunk, this is the eve of the new year), 2 girls in evening gowns and half a dozen criminals. <br /> <br /> How are our heroes protected? True, they can not. They must all be dead within ten minutes. (Not to mention the fact that the characters inside have an annoying habit of passing by the windows.) Now the illogical scenario is not the reason for the full pan of the film. B-style action movie However, with the exception of Lawrence Fishburne and Ethan Hawke, all the other characters looked ridiculous. (At least I hope so) <br /> <br /> Although the Ja-Rules and Leguizamo characters are pretty bad. This is Aisha Hind's minstrel show, which takes a cake. Rarely on the modern screen appears more stereotypical African-American character. Her performance resembles a dummy boy with a black face and a precious acting ghetto. <br /> <br /> In the original attack, a gang member captures a truck with ice cream and drives around the neighborhood, shooting little girls in the head. Since then, I have had an irrational fear of ice cream trucks. After this assault, I have a completely rational fear of remakes.
