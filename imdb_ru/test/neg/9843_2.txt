If this film were shot by a man, he would be put in jail. While Adrian Linea was chained with a lawyer in the editing room to watch for gutting a classic piece of literature to appease the censors, and to avoid conflicting with the Child Pornography Protection Act of 1996, the woman dumps ripe for us, and everyone applaud, did I miss the meeting? In addition to blatant pedophilia, this film is completely ridiculous. Has this woman never set foot on an active military base? Has she ever met a soldier? Whose army is this? Uniforms must have come from Uniforms-R-Us. Just add a few patches, who cares? Just make sure each one has Big Red. There is a small joke here, which, no doubt, passed over the authorâ€™s head, but may have been picked up by those who provided military vehicles. Of course, there were no military advisers. The US Army does not control slums. Temporary base camps in war zones in the jungle are cleaner than this. The US Army does not force 14-year-old girls to work at military bases and does not allow them to use training grounds or training courses. A lot of drama comes up in the sexual majority of teenage girls. This film has absolutely nothing to do with it.
