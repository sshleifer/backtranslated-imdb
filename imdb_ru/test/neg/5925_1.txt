An example of all the worst gay stereotypes - all in one movie. <br /> <br /> Charles, why do you speak with such a strange pseudo-British / strong accent and insist that the child say so too? Has anyone else noticed that all the music from the soundtrack is exactly the same? You must stick to the good old Hollywood camp where you are so good! Die Mommy Die II, continued !! I see no reason to spend time and money on such a project; You can tell so many REAL life stories of young gays, and we have to see them, not this garbage. God, what a waste of time. An embarrassing example of gay cinema.
