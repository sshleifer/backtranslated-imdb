Scary beyond faith. Obviously, on the Isle of Man, which is disguised as the United States - very bad - and full of stripped-down British actors who cannot make American accents. A monster that looks like an unclear advertising cutout for an alien from a movie store, with the most inflexible legs ever seen. Girls in the shower, undressing, fights, blah, blah, blah. You get the idea. Do not look, run, hide, AVOID.
