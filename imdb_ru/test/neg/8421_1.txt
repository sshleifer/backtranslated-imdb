One of the worst gay movies I've ever seen. Since these are not characters in this story, it is difficult to comment on the real film. Therefore, since Colton Ford (aka Glen) put his life on public display, I think he is a fair critic. And it is not difficult to do. Here it is. 50 something Glen is a great time porn star who wants fame and fortune as a great time singer. (I guess 11 movies make him a “star”) Being gay and forty, I saw porn, and I didn't recognize him or his lover. Personally, they all look the same to me with different hairstyles. Admit it, guys, he is not Jeff Stryker, Jim Bentley or Casey Donon. This is fine though. The goal of these films is about 6.5 minutes, so they all have the same requirements, if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So Glen wants to become a serious (legitimate) singer after he dumps the porn industry, but he can't get anyone to take him seriously. I wonder why? Was he stupid enough to think that he could whiten, taking off his clothes and having sex in the movies. And according to the film, it’s not just porn movies that he dabbles in, he lives in a house with other “stars”, where people can hook into the bedroom, bathroom, and where ever with the help of webcams. It is 500 dollars an hour to have fun at a private party. Strip shows on clothes at the request of "hotels". Do what is called meth, which, I believe, is a drug. And then you have eggs to get angry when someone at a club concert is trying to touch you ---- because he is “legitimate” now. Oh! <br /> <br /> The only interesting non-cardboard character is a gay screenwriter who won an Oscar who did not name his name. And if you consider that this documentary, well, porn, like porn does. You can tell that he was most amused by the silent rabbit porn star. <br /> <br /> Glen has one hyper-Nelly manager (Kyle) who wants to "sell" him as a porn party in the hope of getting his gay club club. He is trying to fulfill the routine of Svengali the first mistake. I'm not saying that Kyle was right, but if some aspiring singer starts asking the manager, they won't go far. It seems like: the one who is his own lawyer, a fool for a client. /> <br /> All this would not be bad if it were not for one small piece of information. Drum roll please. He is bad. He sucks. His singing talent is rated there with Ashlee Simpson. it's hard to root for someone who, although trying to make his dream come true, is 50! - does not work like normal people. No work. Can you say lazy ass? And whining, and “Why not take me.” Song and dance. And After several months of cleaning the surface of the music industry, he said: “Why do I not have a recording contract now?” What? Actors are waiters. Writers work in low-end newspapers or magazines — anything. This guy is above that. This is true. He wants his success now simply because he decided that he wants it. Whine. Whine to whine. His lover leaves him to return to nursing, but I say that I do not want this jerk to give me medical assistance. Both were useless. Airheads The film is useless. If you really don't like Whine and Cheeesy, people stay out of it. Do not waste your money on the trashy life of useless people, there are much more interesting things stuck to the bottom of your shoes.
