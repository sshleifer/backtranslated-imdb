During my struggle to wake up during this borefest, I struggled with my close dosage to discover some stupid conspiracy about brotherhood, smacking, incredibly unpleasantly annoying, facing a problem with a psychotic, radioactively injured half-man / half cyborg by named Splatter, who sends his soldiers for them for killing their prestigious, politically loud leader (for whom Splatter killed himself, substituting them to take the blame so that he could become a leader). These painted monsters form a group that expresses its feelings anarchically, though non-violently, living on the dilapidated streets left by the “civilized world”, expressing its fears about nuclear disarmament. In any case, in most films, these five thugs run through darkened streets with graffiti walls as Splatter and his punks are pursuing. Fortunately for these guys, they find punk chic who helps them on their journey from this rather ugly place they are unfamiliar with. This territory, in which the guys are immersed, is a real labyrinth of streets and lanes with the idea of ​​getting out of the hardest thing, especially when the crazy and a bunch of Splatter occupy almost every turn. <br /> <br /> Yes, I was deceived, like others, thanks to the HR Giger poster, which is the most excellent. If only he was the designer of this dragon ... this is not the case, and we, the viewer, leave the film, modeled after all of the films, it seems, "Walter Hill Warriors", except this film there is no style or sand, which have a movie. The film has a lot of unfunny beats and unconvincing clashes between fats and punks with melee fights, often funny. The atmosphere is quite interesting, and there is some atmospheric use of neon light, but the problem is not the environment ... it’s the plot and the characters in the environment that become tedious. The saddlebags under my eyes were getting harder every minute as this film went on. Yes, Texas CHAINSAW stars Edwin Neal (... a rather funny vocalist who has an entertaining DVD interview I shot for this fiery film), and Marilyn Burns plays "key" roles as opposing members of his faction against the government led final conclusion in the building complex at the end. Neil Spray's character uses these metal spikes, which emerge from his metal arm to kill his victims.
