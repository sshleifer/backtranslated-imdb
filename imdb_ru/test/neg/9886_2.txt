The film "Blood and Chocolate" ANYTHING does not look like a book. The plot has completely changed, and the one who chose the cast, had to read the book. First, the girl is not an introvert of Aden. Vivian pursued Aden. Her mother had to survive and be the one after Gabriel. Astrid was the only one who committed all the killings along with Ralph, the former Vivian. Gabriel is not old. He looks old. And Aden did NOT get Vivian in the end, Gabriel. The name comes from Vivian, who compared the kisses of Aden (sweet as chocolate) and Gabriel (tasty as blood) She took blood because she promised more, and he understood her more. It reminds me, Gabriel is not against people like in the movie. He simply avoids intimacy with them because they hurt him in the past. Actually the book is sooooo better than the movie. But if you want to see jogging, dating, and a lot of jumps. Then this is a movie to see.
