RKO was trying to boost its star JOAN FONTAINE when it was introduced as a flying nurse, strong-willed enough to make the doctor (JOHN BEAL) put up with the escape from duties in this little programmer. TCM showed it as a springboard in Joan Fontaineâ€™s career. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is serious and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and John Beale is fine, because her love interest. But it is obvious that PHILIP HOUSTON (who has the appearance and daring manners of young James Garner) is an actor who should have shared the best bills with Fountain. What happened to this beautiful actor? Why didn't RKO promote it with Fontaine? He showed skill as a lightweight comedian. <br /> <br /> It was such thoughts that occurred to me when I watched this rather cool drama, which never corresponded to the absolute promise of its name. The story itself is quite tiring, only occasionally comes to life because of the energetic heroine of Fontain. <br /> <br /> She nicely photographs the nurse and skillfully wears serious expressions, suggesting that in the future we will need to use something else for the Date. Bill never made an outstanding career, and his presentation here shows why. Strictly dim. <br /> <br /> But what happened to Philip Houston? This suggests that he had to make a decent film career. <br /> <br /> General Information: Watch out for Dwight Fry (from Dracula), who is in a state of uncontrolled patient on board the aircraft.
