Two popular actors in a pair, like De Niro and Murphy, play the role of a policeman and actor. Although they spend more time together on screen, they do not achieve the expected results in films such as Analyze It, Meet the Parents, Dr. Dolittle and Nutty Professor. The film begins interestingly, but it becomes a subtle, ordinary comedy, which is very disappointing. It seems, especially De Niro does not like being on Showtime. It's a shame, because he really shows his feelings, that's what I think. Unfortunately, if this idea were used wisely, it could have been a more interesting piece and accompanied by a sequel, like any other popular Hollywood film. Well, I do not think there will be a continuation of this, at least the re-casting of De Niro and Murphy. ** outside *****
