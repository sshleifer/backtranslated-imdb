This movie is funny. This is an attempt to be a comedy, but the script is terrible. The whole film is made in low light conditions, and you cannot understand that this is a comedy. Truly bad cinematography. You really have to sit there and watch it in order to understand that there are a few jokes happening here and there, but in any case they are all inside the joke between themselves. This is more like a drama of imitators, which went bad. This is really a very meaningless movie. Their expressions show nothing but horror and unhappiness, which somehow turns out. If you do not want to get bored out of your ass, I advise you to stay away from this movie.
