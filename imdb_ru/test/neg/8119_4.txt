Yumiko (Wakana Sakai), the rather adopted daughter of a recently deceased Japanese businessman, inherits control of her father’s company; her uncle Kazuo (Shun Sugata), dissatisfied with the fact that he had not left the business, orders to strike his niece. When a chef with Kensuke's eared ears (Takashi Okamura) mistakenly enters the wrong number and knocks out the hired assassin Invincible (Yung Yuen), he is mistaken for a murderer and sent to kill Yumiko. Instead, he falls in love with a beautiful heiress and ends up swearing to protect her. However, Kazuo’s people kidnap her, while Kensuke is busy playing an arcade game with policeman Daniel (Sam Lee). <br /> <br /> Uncle Kazuo holds Yumiko in a hypnotic trance and controls the business, but controls it. to the point of concern when his gangster friends threaten to uncover his illegal activities if he does not give them complete control. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Kensuke teams up with two martial arts experts, Lam Kaw (Euen Baio) and Lam Doi (Candy Lo), who prey on Invincible. He is studying Kung Fu and trying to free Yumiko. <br /> <br /> The combination of scenes with humor, spooferism and battle scenes “No Problem 2” is a disappointing film with talent: Kung Fu superstar of the 80s Yuen Bayo manages some fighting scenes, but today for acrobatics she is aging a little; director Kar Lok Chin made such a stupid parody joke that I expected from the movie “Scary Movie”; Jung Yun resorts to mocking his character in Operation Scorpio; and Sam Lee ?? Sam Lee, as always, annoying! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Colleen Chow, like the gangster Ben, impressed me; he has a clearly strong presence on the screen that has not gone unnoticed in Hollywood - since then he has starred in two films The Matrix and will soon appear in D. O., directed by Corey Yuen. I was also impressed with Wakan Sakai, but for a completely different reason: this beauty is easy on the eyes and should go much further in the movie business. <br /> <br /> You can have fun with your workout. which films are parodied, but in 104 minutes I found this film a real routine to sit on. If people pulling funny faces with stupid sound effects make you laugh, then problem no. 2 might like you. Otherwise I would be left alone.
