Wow, hmm, it was a completely different movie. It calls itself a comedy ... but it was not really funny. It was crazy. If you agree that 3 people have survived a global disaster, why not 4? or 5? ..... and why did it suddenly end without anything happening ??? They could have done it a lot better just by having another element in the plot, such as an obscene woman for an ugly dude or something ... zinc, ridiculous .... I don't know .. watch ... it was not so bad ..... something funny from time to time .... i think ... <br /> <br /> Schneider
