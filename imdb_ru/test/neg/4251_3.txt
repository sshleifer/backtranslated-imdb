A family of farmers is going west. <br /> <br /> The head of the newest motley brood, Walnut Grove, is called "Charles". He works at the mill, sawing a lot of lumber, although who the hell thinks he is cutting all this wood is a mystery, because none of the town residents have enough money to buy a splinter, and even more so twice as much. four. <br /> <br /> City Governance - Olsons, a rich but stupid clan, who moved to these parts to cut down all the dough they make, selling eggs for eleven cents for a dozen. They have two children, the boy Willie and the girl Nellie, who have only one saving asset between them ... Nellie is hot and she has fun spying on her when she takes a bath in a scream. <br /> <br /> A city preacher is also a village idiot, because he thinks that he is really something special for this deaf grove of village algae, when in reality they hate his boring sermons and the only thing they pray. because on Sunday he must fall from the nearest cliff as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> The city doctor is a dinosaur who saw his best times about 20 years ago, but he still hangs around to give free breast examinations for old witches who live in the city. Unfortunately, the only time these ancient hot moms kneel is to get a piece of bread out of the oven to give to Doc for his services. But Doc is fine, because he knows that these old girls give good bread. <br /> <br /> In the back of this colorful collection of roast cows live Charles, the “weak wife Caroline” and their three girls. ” Mary ”,“ Carrie ”and“ Half Pin ”. Mary is another hot chick that all the guys look at whenever she has a shower or shit. Carrie annoys a small child, but sticks a cookie in her mouth, and you won't even know that she is there, in fact, where is she? ... oh, here she is ... she plays with a pack of cigarettes in the yard ... how cute! Half-pint is the youngest failure in the city. She may not have a brain or any other body to talk about, but she can spit no further than any boy in this whole crazy school. <br /> <br /> This is a great city, Walnut Grove, where someone always has to fall from the roof or face the wheel of a cart, and this is also beautiful, consists of one building ... church / school house / town hall / billiard room. Ah, the prairie is getting a little hairy, but that's fine, especially when Mary takes a bath in a scream ... then you can see how hairy she really is.
