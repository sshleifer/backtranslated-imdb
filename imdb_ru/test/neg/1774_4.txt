Casper Van Dien ... what can I say? I like the guy! His films bring them a certain talent, which the director or producer doesn’t really bring, and he himself! Recycled areas ... check. Robbery of the best movies ... check. Wooden game ... check. It’s not that Van Dien was a bad actor (he was effective in Hollywood gloss like Star Marine and Sleepy Hollow), he was simply not offered a script worthy of his talent; and yes, he has an acting talent different from being a candy. This film offers a small hint of what Van Dean has to offer, but is hampered by the production of it all. The scenario can be better developed (see Oliver Stone's U-turn). The direction can be used better (see “From Dusk Till Dawn” by Robert Rodriguez). DP could make the desert more exotic (see Fass Pussycat Faster Kill from Russ Meyer!). This scenario is weak because this is what we saw before, so double / triple crosses are expected. The direction is weak because it offers nothing new and conveys many of the weak points of the script. The cinematography at times draws in it the beautiful autumn scent of the desert, but in other cases it does not use scorching light, and the initial sequence is terrible in the color of cornflower. <br /> <br /> Now for the cast. .. Wang Ding demonstrates grace and charisma to his Jake. He becomes neither too methodical nor too amiable in his role. Good balance, especially because the rest of the cast seems too distracted about how they should act in this film (bad script or bad leadership ... you make your own opinion). The only person to be mentioned is the villain Brian Brown, because he gives a real opportunity to play in this film ... beginner actors forget to try to learn how to act on a green screen, try to learn how to act in a terrible scenario and take notes. on brian brown in this movie. He adds extra depth to his role and is a good contrast to Van Dean's character. Jake always seems to be either one step ahead, or in control of any situation, regardless of whether he is beyond his control. The femme fatale is weak (after all, it is desert noir) and is another nail in the coffin of this film (you decide ... the script or the direction). The character of Rosalita should have been pushed forward in the film, and not to push off into the background later in order to make room for a real femme fatale. So watch a movie for Van Dien and Brown; and for fun, try to skip the stone through the holes of the plot, penetrated by the film.
