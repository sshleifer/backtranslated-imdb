This derivative erotic thriller remains visible most of the way, mainly because the viewer is not indifferent to how it will turn out, and because director Peter Hall manages to play a rather hot (and rather bold) sex scene. But the finale, though unexpected, is ridiculous, and the whole plot (full of children's injuries and disorders of a multiple personality) turns out to be unbearable, especially with regard to motivation.
