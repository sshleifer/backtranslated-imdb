this film belongs to the cutting room. On the one hand, the initial sequence does not push the element associated with the “gang”. If this was not intended, then at least they understood this part correctly. Secondly ... what with all the views left and then right ??? they even do it in synchronized style. Nowhere did I witness how a member of the rival team approached the bar, searched for someone, looked outside as if he were all that, and a bag of chips in a Barbie and leave without even encountering, let alone get ". I wasted money on the rental price and I am glad that I did not buy the DVD myself. <br /> <br /> If this was done by college students (T.A.F.E), then at least they gave him an old Australian attempt. Lucky next time.
