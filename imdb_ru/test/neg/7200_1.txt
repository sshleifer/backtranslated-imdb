I absolutely hated this movie! I was 9 years old when I saw this. This is the only film I've ever played in a theater. My mom, dad and I all looked at each other during the film and knew that we were wasting time. This film stole about 45 minutes of my life. Everything in it was funny. The whole premise was too curved. When I was 9 years old, I was always easily entertained. This film proved that I could not expose myself and still have fun.
