Luscious Candace Bergen as a first-class Victorian beauty, kidnapped by Sean Connery as the devilish desert sheikh! How can you go wrong? How? Oh, let me count the ways !!! Earthly, primitive Sean Connery, is the man who tames the fragile, cool beauty, like Candace. Well, not happy with the role. This is because instead of engaging in a dialogue about real problems (“you are a woman ... I am a man!”), He should babble nonsense about “the will of Allah” and “the wind blows its fate over the sands of the desert. "John Milius, a director known more for worshiping naked male bodies and brute military strength than any kind of understanding (or interest) in ordinary human relationships, has a maddening way to cut off from his lovers in the desert every time it seems that Candace can be kissed. Instead of watching nature move with two fabulously attractive people in a picturesque landscape, we are treated to endless (and I mean INFINITE) shots of Brian Keith, flashing spinners the size of a walrus and telling hard preaching about the joy of being Teddy Roosevelt, I have nothing against Teddy Roosevelt, but observing how he tests his new rifle or gives a talk about the heroic death of a big bear simply does not bother me how there could be a love story between Candace Bergen and Shaun Connery., If it ever started at all! The strange thing is that Milius spends most of his time creating characters and storylines that do not have permission. Two small children Candace in the plot get more screen time than she. There is no humor, no chemistry, no hiss, or what is happening to her in the desert. Unless you think it's funny, after several weeks of riding a horse, her hair is still beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only “real” moment in history is when, late in the evening, Candace Bergen shakes out her little daughter of sound sleep on soft pillows and says: “We must escape.” The little girl turns over and promptly replies: “But, Mom, I was asleep!” This line sums up what is really missing in the story. There is no danger, uncertainty or hissing in the main storyline of a cultivated lady in captivity. She (and her children) are so well-groomed and well-groomed that it is hard to believe that someone is concerned about their fate. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind if Candace herself said that it could work better, If tensions arose from the fact that she enjoyed her captivity (or her admiration for the fact that she was in the arms of Sean Connery) and her guilt for all the problems caused by her abduction, the story would have some tension. But Milius makes the strange assumption that the public is just as excited as he is, whether Teddy Roosevelt can prove his masculinity three thousand miles away. In the end, the beauty and her children seem to have no meaning for him. and, since they are at the center of the story, it all seems rather dry and endless. like the burning sands of the desert.
