This is one of those films that you will find when you go to bed too late and you only have the base cable. It's hard to believe that this film was made in '95, considering that it looks like something from the end of the 80s. Brave young people with a variety of home problems are faced with insane ice cream, which has to make the best flavor of all: Soylent Cream !!! <br /> <br /> This film is extremely crazy and scary just by how creepy and absolutely ridiculous it is. In fact, the really scary thing about this film is the nature of the problems that these children face at home. The fact that these children have not escaped their quiet suburban sufferings turns any random mental hospital in the neighborhood into a real walk in the park. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this film is the fact that the stereotypical “fat kid” is obviously a slender teenager with a mountain of stuffing under baggy sweatshirts. I guess either a) they didn’t invent / couldn’t afford a fat suit, b) the casting director was too lazy to find a plump baby star, or c) we honestly must believe that this child is extremely hungry distended abdomen. <br /> <br /> So, if you got up at 2 am and you need something funny and disgusting to make fun of your drunken friends, go on and see. Personally, I would rather sleep.
