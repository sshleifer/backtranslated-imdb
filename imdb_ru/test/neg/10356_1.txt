I am a fan of this, in general, excellent, although sometimes quite boring show, but in the 3rd season several horrible stories were chosen. The episode HERO is an example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> The story that ultimately unfolds is that the Cylons deliberately allow the Bulldog, a pilot captured several years earlier during a black operative's mission, to escape, steal the Cylon Ship, and return to the Galaxy. The plan is that when the Bulldog returns, he will understand that Adam left him to the mercy of fate and will be so angry that he will kill Adam that he almost does. <br /> <br /> Now the problem is that Cylons has set it up so that the Bulldog thinks he ran away himself. This means that the bulldog leaves the Cylon ship without assistance. So he kills Sylona and comes out of his cell content - that's what we see. Then we must assume that he goes to the flight hangar, he manages to penetrate the Cylon fighter ship and learn to control it, takes off and flies back to the Galaxy. Exactly. <br /> <br /> Now Starbuck managed to get one of them to work in the first season, which in itself was hardly plausible, but she only needed to visually fly out of orbit before making contact with the Galaxy. The bulldog has to program its ship so that it makes several jumps through hyperspace and manages to catch up with the Galaxy somewhere thousands of light years away in an unknown direction. How does he manage to program the ship, which contains completely alien technology? Cylons connect to their computers by touch, there are no visual consoles or keyboards. And, having coped with this miraculous feat, how will he know where the Galaxy is, meaning that the Galaxy took off about 3 years ago and since then has been trying to evade the Cylons - does it leave no lighthouses behind? Even with the suspension of unbelief, which should apply to any science fiction show, this episode still has no meaning.
