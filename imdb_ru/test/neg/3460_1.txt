Let me anticipate this by recording, I'm a big George Clooney fan and I love John Krasinski in The Office. Well, that was it. <br /> <br /> It was the worst nail in the world, and it took 113 minutes to remove it. The overwhelming boredom was interrupted only by my frequent attempts to read my watch and evaluate when it was over. <br /> <br /> Every fun scene was a preview. All three. There was no real story, no character development, and the script was just really bad. I had a more pleasant colonoscopy. <br /> <br /> The name was supposed to be SuperDuper Bad. This film is a castle for Razzie. This should get a whole tearful razzies. I want my money back.
