This film is terrible, I can not even write a review of this garbage! All I will say is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> And the acting is very bad. The boy who plays the main character really annoys me, he has the same facial expression throughout the film. I just want to slap him! Basically, 80% of the film is skateboard slow motion, strange music and full sound * <br /> <br /> Apparently, I need to write at least 10 lines of text to leave this comment, so Iâ€™ll spend a few more lines saying that the main character has one of those people that you just want to hit! <br /> <br /> Fur, I give up ... THIS IS A JAX FILM
