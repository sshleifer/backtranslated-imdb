If there was an EPA for the film, this film would receive their most sincere approval. If we all processed our “things” to such an extent, we would never have finished anything. <br /> <br /> It's funny how I was reminded about this movie when I first saw Star Wars: The Phantom Threat. At least, Lucas did not recycle his old shots. <br /> <br /> This is stupid. But it is not bad. Cute stained (I liked it when the kid said “damn rocks”). And, if you like explosions (even recycled), you will get your benefit. <br /> <br /> In fact, for the “no budget” movie, it looks pretty good. To act poorly, but here and there there is a small characteristic. History is predictable, but it will still lead you forward. <br /> <br /> This is a film like “everyone is chasing a child,” which most likely will appeal to most young viewers. I gave it 2 of 10. <br /> <br /> I dug up my old VHS copy of this movie. I do not think it is on DVD.
