"Elena Troy" follows the story of Helen and the start of the Trojan War. Itâ€™s rather a love story between Helen and Paris, who was shipwrecked and fell in love with Helen, not knowing that she was the queen. In the film, the couple is in love and wants nothing but to be together. (In other films and books, the characters are depicted differently, but they are simply hopelessly in love with this.) In some places, the film is rather slow, but the battles and detailing of the scenery are quite good. There are also some good performances. I thought that the slave had done an especially good job, and she was one of the most beloved characters. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good adaptation if you can go beyond the slow story into places and look beyond some of the cheese novel and the dialogue. In my opinion, the ideal version of the film Iliad has not yet been created, but it is interesting and has some good moments.
