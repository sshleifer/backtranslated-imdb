It is sometimes difficult to judge how bad the film is actually made in Italy or Spain, because they all seem to use the same stable of 9-10 trained ESL voice actors to cast English votes for release in the United States. And in any case, when translating things are always lost - the dialogues, characteristic features and elements of the plot, written for the expectations of the European audience, may not very well correspond to our American ideas about what is funny, fashionable or dramatic. I believe that the team responsible for translating the soundtrack of this film into English had 3 to 3 days to do it from beginning to end, and each of them probably earned the equivalent of paying in installments on his used Fiat. In other words, pure hacking work, rejected for one or two takes, and never reviewed or altered by anyone with real attention to American language. <br /> <br /> Watching Devil Fish, I can imagine that if you were an Italian to watch it in your own language, you might find it a little funny piece of fluff. You will laugh at the "jokes" and the funny drunkard, choke on the monster and the meanness of the bad guys, and you will look at an attractive couple of Peter and not quite Darryl Hannu when they are a couple on the beach for no apparent reason in the midst of searching for tips on a man eating monster who already killed one of his friends. <br /> <br /> But after the harsh voicing and the tin dialogue Continue pulling us Americans out of the filmâ€™s experience, we cannot help but notice that the editors had a serious attention deficit disorder that nobody on the screen could speak so strongly like the Attitude project, that the stated reason for creating the monster has absolutely no sense that the sequence of actions has all the effect of a bowl of cereal full of cooked oatmeal, and that the director, scriptwriters and producers really hate women. <br /> <br /> Don't even think about buying or renting this movie - watch only on cable television on Saturday afternoon with one of several beers in yours or with the help and protection of Mike and Bots on MST3K.
