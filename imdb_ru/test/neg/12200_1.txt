Complete and complete waste of my precious two hours. The entire film could have been made in less than 60 seconds, simply by showing people who were depressed, car breakdown, people who were crushed more, people having sex, people who were crying, and people who were becoming stronger. The slogan for this film was to say: “Let's see how damn excited our characters are! They are stoned! They are addicts! They are in disarray! Who are these people? Do you really care? It is important? “Just give us your money, please, because we certainly don’t care about anything else!” Absolutely awful movie. It never went away, you never recognized the characters (they didn't even say what these people did to make such a big house, so much money, cars and Coca-Cola), and it was just boring. You might like the movie a little more if you are a stoner yourself, but for the vast majority of us it’s not a waste of time and film.
