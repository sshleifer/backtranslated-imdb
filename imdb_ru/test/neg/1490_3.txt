I found an old VHS version of this film in my parents' house, so I decided to try it. From the very beginning, I did not expect much from this film, and I am glad about it, because on the whole the film was not good. <br /> <br /> Overall, the game was very bad, even for the Nicolas Cage film. One scene with a radio controller looks so miserable that it seemed to me ridiculous that this scene was not cut. The first 30 minutes of the film almost did not have a developed plot, and I did not know what was going on. <br /> <br /> The story itself had a decent character, but either the director was just bad or tried too hard to invent his own unique style of film. I managed to watch it all, but I will never see this movie again.
