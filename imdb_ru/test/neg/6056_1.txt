I survived the first hour of this and returned within the last ten minutes, just to say that I had seen the end. If you want a true * mythology, perfectly executed, look for Armand Assante's Odyssey. Great storytelling doesn't need to be set up - the stories themselves are fantastic. I only hope that Sean Astin needed money. Both Sophocles and Ovid must be circling in their graves - wherever they are. <br /> <br /> At least with the Sorbo version, the language steadily poked on the cheek - we knew that it was mostly bald, but perhaps the interest was generated in the prehistory to send someone to the library. I'm surprised that Halmi could do something so funny (the show), and follow it with something so devoid of quality.
