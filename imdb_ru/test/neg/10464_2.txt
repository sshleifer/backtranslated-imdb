Well, I would probably agree with all the bad comments about this film, because, frankly, I thought it was such a piece of shit, I mean, the actors did a terrible acting job, and the script was terrible. Although the special effects were not a bit bad, but I think it was necessary to think much more difficult than that. I mean, as Clara Bryant was successfully placed in this film, I mean that she would be much better off if she looked a little further, and the same thing with Kristen, honey, I mean that her character will die and she doesn't bother to defend herself, I mean, it must be a complete joke. She should, at least, do much better than what she does, become a soldier, a heroine, or something like courage. But the fact is that the actors did a completely soulless lousy job, like the director and screenwriter who made this film. they should have gone to the film school to come up with better ideas, and I hope everyone agrees with my methods, because they probably think about the same thing.
