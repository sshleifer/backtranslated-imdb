Stumbled upon this movie on Amazon.com. I never heard of his release, but three reviews gave him five stars and enthusiastic reviews, so being a lover of German films, I bought a copy ... <br /> <br /> I must say that I was not impressed. Production values ​​are cheap, the history is derivative, the characters are less attractive, and for comedy it is surprisingly short, it laughs. <br /> <br /> I wanted it, but I found it dull and boring. Or maybe I expected more from independent German cinema than gay spin in Full Monti and a set of stereotypes. <br /> <br /> There are pieces in the movie that don't make any sense at all, for example, one of the “Leather Bear” is trying to get Eka in a sling - as if he even looked at him twice? Or a vengeful ex-wife, appearing at the match, but ending up rooting for her estranged gay husband? Bunkum is not a word! Well, at least that explains the name of the film in the UK, I suppose ...
