Kubrick may have been the greatest director of all time. Perhaps he did more classics than anyone else. He may have been a perfectionist. But man, his first attempt was unsuccessful! <br /> <br /> Kubrick had good reason to try to make this film disappear from the map: it looks like Ed Wood's film. He has a strange story, cheap footage, bad dialogue, ominous music, reminiscent of your sci-fi / horror film from the 50s, and what looks like relatives of the cast of Reefer Madness, going crazy for no reason. > Of course, you can see the undeveloped Kubrick there. This is a psychological / terrible study of war. Characters have become inhuman and insane. There are people who play more than one role. There are constant pictures of faces and special facial expressions of different people. And there are some interesting pictures. But really, it's a mess. <br /> <br /> Of course, I do not dissuade you from viewing it. If you master it, you will join my chosen group and several thousand people around the world who have access to it.
