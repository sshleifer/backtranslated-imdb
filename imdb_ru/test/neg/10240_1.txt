How can anyone give this more than “1”? <br /> <br /> I thought that “Manos, Hands of Destiny” would forever be the worst movie that ever hit my optic nerve. In fact, I did not think that something could be worse. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. “Galaksina” is that rare film where EVERY ONE ELEMENT of this film hurts, painfully, dazzlingly bad. How often have you watched a movie and commented: “Who the hell WILL LIGHT this thing?” From lighting to soundtrack to effects, script, acting, cinematography, etc. It’s so bad that I couldn’t even say for a while whether it was the worst comedy or the worst drama I’ve ever seen. <br /> <br /> This is too bad, even to be funny. I'd rather eat a plate with broken glass than sit through it again.
