There is no "fun" teasing the desperate situation of illegal immigrants! Or the desperate situation of the owners of the head shop, for that matter! The fact that richer than God, Brian Glazer did not see the irony that “heroes” do exactly what a villain does - rob honest, hardworking people from their savings - it does not surprise me! Damn, do you think he became richer than God ?! <br /> <br /> In this supposed satire of greed, these mental dwarfs reveal their own hypocrisy: MacMantion, MacToyce, McKildren, McIllegals, who pay peanuts to take care of MacMagesions, Mactoys and McKildren! But the main problem (with the exception of disgusting fanaticism) is that Dick, being the former head of the now infamous company, will become a big scalp for every corporate headhunter in the country! No soup kitchens for him! And, looking at the high six-digit numbers, you would think that he would not be caught dead around the Mount / Lieberman poster!
