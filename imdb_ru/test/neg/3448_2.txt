Two stars <br /> <br /> Amanda Plummer, similar to the young version of her father, Christopher Plummer in the dredge, stars in this film along with Robert Forster - who really had to put on a black shoe over this bald spot. <br /> <br /> I never saw Amanda Plummer in a good movie. She always plays these little wacky characters in films that don't quite fit, and she does it again in this. <br /> <br /> First, we have two young women, sisters, who are not alike in the slightest degree, who allow themselves to pick up dubious people along the roads separately. <br /> <br /> Amanda’s character, Sandra, at least has a good reason to let Dr. Jake (Robert Forster) take her first. She was knocked off the road, apparently, a maniac, and her car is largely destroyed. <br /> <br /> Warning! Spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> However, as we understand, Dr. Jake does not play with a full deck, but with Amanda. He makes every decision based on a coin flip. <br /> <br /> When Dr. Jake and Amanda arrive at the motel, we see, in addition to the maniac’s car, and what Amanda does, but gets into his station van and start spying around. What was her motive to do this is never clear, given that the man is obviously dangerous and might try to kill her. One might think that the last thing she does is put herself in such a dangerous position. <br /> <br /> She not only tracks down, but also finds money and takes it. <br /> <br /> Soon after, we have a few other things that don’t add up. <br /> <br /> Dr. Wu Jake and Amanda run out of gas as a passenger, and they both leave his car and start walking. One would think, crossing the desert, he would have checked his gas sensor - for him it is very unlikely. Later he was seen driving the same car. When or how did he return the car? <br /> <br /> Dr. Jake tells Amanda that he knows she took the money. Now, how did he know that? As far as I know, he did not see how she did it, and she did not tell him that she did it. <br /> <br /> Then we got a character called Santini (David Thewlis), a man who was driving a station wagon, give them a lift, and I’ll be damned if he doesn't know that Amanda has also taken the money. How does he know that? <br /> <br /> He loses confidence at an alarming rate, the farther we go. <br /> <br /> When Alice, Amanda’s sister (Fairuza Balk) falls into the hands of a murderer and decides her fate on tossing a coin, one would think that she would be very, very careful to have the coin she exchanged for a sly a coin will definitely be a stunt coin - but obviously not. <br /> <br /> This annoys this, which destroys any authority that this film could have.
