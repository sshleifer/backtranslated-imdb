The film Noir is a genre that requires a certain level of tact, acumen, intelligence and images. This film is nothing of this, although they really tried very hard with the images. <br /> <br /> This is the film in which your cousin Marki, the driver of a dump truck, always talks about how he is going to succeed in this matter. movies ever do. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is wooden and lifeless. The visual effects, although obviously costly, are the work of a director who tried to be smart and failed miserably because of a serious lack of brain abilities. Actions ranged from subpar to just bad. This story could have been saved by a real writer and director, but I suspect that such people would not have touched it with the help of a barge post. <br /> <br /> Approximately 1/4 of the way, I noticed a striking resemblance to the scene in Simon, where Victor, desperately trying to get rid of his actress, makes the worst film in the world. I thought I'd check IMDb to see if there was a similar effect in this film, and, to my surprise, it has. I would almost be tempted to give 2 out of 10 just because it put up pretentious fans, but I will not. This is so bad.
