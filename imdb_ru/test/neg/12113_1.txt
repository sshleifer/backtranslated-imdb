I anticipate my review by stating that I am not a fan of the independent genre “right in the video”, which is greatly indebted to long-term films of the 60s. I don’t have one, I never took it, so I may not like this mocking, low-budget bitch that many other people have. <br /> <br /> I caught this movie on Cinemax late on Saturday with a friend. Please do not ask me why I watched Cinemax late on Saturday with a friend. We were bored with World Championship Poker. Some of Misty Munda’s terribly bad acting civility (and I would like her not to admit that she is from Illinois, since we do have some very bright fans here), attracted our attention. Now, as a rule, the goal of some good soft core porn would be to make you and your partner in the mood. A little bit of good sex, a tongue in cheek humor, and who knows what could happen? After about 15 minutes and a scene in which the title character seduces the victim of a robbery, my girlfriend said: “If you want to see the rest of this fine, I go to sleep, so I don’t have to. Please turn off the sound. That's what I collect from the plot: Misty's character is a sexless nerd who is bitten by a spider, and he turns into a super-sexy kitten with a super web that does not come from her wrists. There is some evil meanness that does not look particularly angry or sexy. Spiderbabe saves the day, has sex, MJ (who in this film is a man) is constantly being nominated by stereotypically bad gay bikers, and somehow an evil meanness pushes from the building until her death. <br /> <br /> What was good about this movie? It is over. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with that? Acting to make the third-class competition look like an Oscar winner, the script was created by people I represent drunk, sexual perverts of college age who would not know what sex is if they attended classes taught by Dr. Ruth, specifically effects that were as special as someone jumping from a trampoline, humor is about as funny as ?? Well, I have yet to face everything that is a lamer. Sex scenes? If we watched the video, the only thing that would have included these scenes was the fast-forward button. And the fighting scenes? In some of my old Atari VCS games there was a better choreography. <br /> <br /> Now I know that this type of film must be liked because of its inherent harm. Companies like EI are not going to make good films: they have their own niche, and they are aimed at it. My experience as a marketer tells me that they are right to serve their audience. But after my brief acquaintance with Spiderbabe, for example, I can say that I am not going to delve into this world again in the near future. Perhaps the problem with directors in this type of genre is this: they pay so much attention to making bad films, that if they try to focus on things that they do very well, they will be very pleasant. Cinema "le bad", movies a la Troma of the 80s. Sorry guys; there is a spirit, but no effort. <br /> <br /> Though I have to admit that "Alice in Acid" intrigued me ??
