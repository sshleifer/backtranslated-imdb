One must have the right to expect from people who are making a film about the Second Coming and the Third Testament that they read the other two, or at least knew a little more about them than the miracles and Judgment Day. This film contains absolutely nothing interesting for viewers who are interested in Jesus, religion or philosophy - there is only standard British social realism in pubs with guttural dialects and plump characters. <br /> <br /> In fact, good candidates for the present Third Testament have been published several times - for example, the Course of Miracles or Conversations with God. All of them make us think about new turns of the Christian faith and theology. <br /> <br /> The most interesting information in the IMDb rating is not the number of stars, but the number of people who bothered to vote. For four years, only 387 people bothered to vote for this film. As usual, enthusiasts are the most impatient. For comparison, take a look at "Jesus Christ, the Superstar" - the original version of 1973.
