This film is so terrible that it is funny, not quite for a troll of 2 levels of gaiety, but, nevertheless, funny. The acting is terrible, the music is terrible, and the story does not make sense. The story revolves around a man dressed in a terrible grandmother costume, killing a bunch of people at a party. Death scenes are so bad that they are funny. One girl is repeatedly hit in the chest, but she does not scream, does not try, does not defend herself, does not try to escape or run away. She also manages to stay on her feet despite repeated stab wounds. Another death scene involving a rope is also extremely fun. It seems that thoughts were not embedded in the plot. Grandma seems to magically move from one area to another (for example, hiding under the leaves in the forest where a victim just happens, appears in front of someone, even if she was behind them ten seconds ago), people kiss extremely inappropriate moments ( you would stop and kiss someone if you were followed by a killer maniac), and the double twist at the end is completely ridiculous, it seems they just threw him away just to confuse people. I would advise people to watch this movie if they like horrible horror films like Troll 2, The Dreaded or Blood Gnome, but don't watch it, if you expect a scary horror movie, you will be disappointed
