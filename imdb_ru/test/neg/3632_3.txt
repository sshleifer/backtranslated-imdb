First, I want to clarify a common misconception: it is unrealistic that the school where Zoe learns gives students laptops. In my school, students in grade 7 and above must have an Apple Macbooks (this is paid in an admission fee). Moving on. This show is very annoying. He has boring, predictable plots and a bad game. Often, in a show, it brings "the power of a girl" to a new maximum, when girls beat up guys in everything they try. But this is not the worst. Worst of all, all girls are portrayed focused on their personal looks and screaming when they are happy. With the exception of one smart girl, who is portrayed as a freak that is obsessed with ugly boys and science. However, this show is very addictive. I do not know why, but it is. Although the last season was SO awful, it led to the fact that stereotypes, boring scenes and a bad game of extremes, which I never thought were achievable, so that, fortunately, I am no longer dependent.
