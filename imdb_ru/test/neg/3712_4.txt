If you like a bad SE, (some) a bad game and a complete lack of confidence, this film is for you. So a really cheap movie, but I still liked it. What for? Because I like such movies. I can't help but smile when I see such films ....... What did the producers, actors, directors and SE think when they made this film? Do not expect the "Abyss" or "Alien", just (very) low-budget horror film / adventure film. <br /> <br /> There is one pleasant moment of “splashing”, when the guy's head gets off, but for most, the horror is rather tame. The last monster is also very cool. <br /> <br /> It's only 73 minutes, so you can’t go wrong. Maybe you can take it at your local video store or watch it on TV. I am sure you will have a good time watching him. <br /> <br /> But do not say that you were not warned .............
