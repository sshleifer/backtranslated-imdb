Well, so one night I and some friends decided to really smoke and watch a movie. Unfortunately for us, we chose "Ernest Goes to Africa." I have never laughed so hard in my whole life. This movie is above the bad. I literally invented better films than Ernest Goes to Africa. (I make films) <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film, at least for me, was the initial sequence when Ernest makes stupid faces. When he was shown a peanut-sized head, I lost it. Perhaps it seemed funny to me, because at that moment I was the tallest. Perhaps you `re right. <br /> <br /> If I had to guess what favorite movie of George W. Bush, I would suggest: “Ernest goes to Africa”. Never before have I seen a film rely on stereotypes of the 1950s about colored people. There were times when words eluded me, and I just looked with awe. <br /> <br /> While I watched it, I could not help but wonder if this film was intended for children? Do literate adults watch this? How can there be a whole franchise of Ernest films? Is this really my life? It's true? <br /> <br /> I hated this movie.
