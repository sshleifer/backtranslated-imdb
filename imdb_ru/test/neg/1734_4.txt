I made this film with my friend to laugh. In fact, the clerk from the video store laughed us because of the dubious tastes of movies. Unfortunately, I don’t remember the first half of the film, because all I did was look at the giant metal braces Jane wore. and I did not hear anything because of an incomprehensible noise. Another thing that could attract my attention besides her metallic mouth was her dubious fashion sense. This film was shot in 2005, but it seems that the cloakroom attendants jumped back in 2000 for clothes. If you remember the days when Aaron Carter was considered a “pop star” and you liked high-waisted jeans, socks to the ankles and knee-length skirts, then this little trip down the memory path is perfect for you.
