So many bad reviewers, it made me think about what people think while watching a simple film made by a rather bad director ??? Have you all been expecting a super hit of a flawless movie ?? No way, you can already see, Raj Kumar Kohli loves films with many stars ... All of his early work, where many stars, but no one was perfect. Take, for example, the first Jaani Dushman, so many flaws, but still good fun. In any case, sticking to the film, the film “Jaani Dushman” is a Hindi-fantasy film about a snake, which can take any form (Armaan (Munish) Kohli), which avenges the suicide of its beloved (Manisha Koirala) over the people who caused it It's pretty good with a great cast. But I think it could have been much better. For example, to take the script, I can not say that it is flawless. For example, take the age: <br /> <br /> 40-48 years old still studying at university? <br /> <br /> There are many more, I will not list more, but there are a dozen more. Hard 5.5 is good for this. <br /> <br /> **. 75
