This film is overrated, to say the least. It's not good, like a comedy, and it's not good, like a “serious” movie. The tempo is too complicated for the first, and for the second too much weak farce. The only laugh is from the reaction of Bud Spencer when he becomes irritated by his brother’s behavior. Rewriting is great, but full-screen cropping is awful. (* 1/2)
