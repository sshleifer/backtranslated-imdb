Firetrap is another bad action movie about a guy who ... and poison, poison, and happy ends, and fire, and burning, and replaying, and poor expectation, and predictability, and ------ just can not see. <br /> <br /> (Dean Kane is stuck playing Superman on Lois and Clark and can't get good roles anymore. So I don't know if he is a good or bad actor. <br /> <br /> This is not good. <br /> <br /> Why can't anyone stop these bad people who continue to do such things? And I swear that they just ** * put them on a conveyor belt and hope they are good. They should do the guy whose job is to just burn movies that look bad, just put a bucket of carosin next to him and throw away the boxes. Then at the end of Light it every day and go home.
