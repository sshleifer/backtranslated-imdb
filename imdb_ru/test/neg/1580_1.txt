I watched this movie a while ago, and the only thing I can remember about the film is how terribly incredibly bad it was, of course, in my top 5 worst films I have ever seen. In a video store, my reputation was ruined by this movie, will my friends ever trust me again? I doubt it, they always say that you donâ€™t judge something by the cover, they were right when I saw the cover of the skins / guys from the gang, I thought that wow, it looks great, because there was a bunch of skins with metal bars. Do not watch this movie. I can't think of anything else to say that the game is bad. The story is bad, just bad.
