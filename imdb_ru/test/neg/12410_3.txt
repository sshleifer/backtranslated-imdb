Summary: a lone swordsman who lives in the desert and acts as an agent for other swordsmen, recalls how his life turned out to be what it is. It all started with the fact that the woman he loved, chose to marry his brother, forcing him to leave his hometown. One of the swordsmen is Juan, who himself is at the center of a complex love story, where a woman wants to kill him because he escaped from the promise to marry his younger sister. But her sister wants to hire a swordsman to protect Huang, and everything is on the verge of when a woman and her sister are really the same person. <br /> <br /> Comments: I saw the released version of Redux in the 2008 original, released in 1994. The difference between the two versions, I can not say, but Redux is very much stylized for the Chinese action Wuxia. This is regrettable, as it seems to me that this style has forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and interesting film. Clear story. But true to their style, the scenery and visual elements seem to be much more important and the focus of attention of the writer and director Kar Wai Wong. Therefore, there are many colorful, very beautiful scenes that are completely unrelated to history. <br /> <br /> Editing and chronology of history is also wrong. Much is left in the frames, the time line is broken and rearranged by confusion. Very slow and quiet scenes are suddenly released from unexpectedly cruel and seemingly unmotivated fights, only for themselves, which is facilitated by something else and not connected. The result is a confusing and very uninteresting film. <br /> <br /> Thanks to these cruel but very small fights, the film turns into an action movie genre. Poster and photos also imply this, but this could be considered false marketing. Only a few minutes out of 90 can be considered something like an action, and the other can not be further from it. The film as a whole is very slow, boring and, therefore, very boring. Even rare scenes filled with action do not help, because they are so detached from the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I could say that I am not a fan of this Chinese style, because they often seem overwhelmed by the same problems, most importantly, visual material is more important than history, but Ashes of Time Redux is probably the worst example I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 3/10
