If you liked William Hickey in Prizzi Honor, he resurrects his character like Don Anthony in Mob Boss. This is a very weak satire of The Godfather with a bit of laughter. Does Stuart Whitman look puzzled as to what he does in this festival? The performance of Morgan Fairchild is one of the best achievements in the film, and in itself is not a very good sign. Eddie Disen hesitates between the Three Puppets farce and the poor imitation of Woody Allen. “Mob Boss” is so fatal that it is derived that boredom quickly overcomes comedy, and the film is dragged down by car chases, hidden by weapons in the restaurant’s bathroom and many other nonsense. - MERK
