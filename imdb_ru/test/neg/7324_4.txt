I like Kevin Bacon and Katie Moriarty, and I love Mary Stuart Masterson, but the film was not at all good. There was no cute character in the picture, and there was almost no plot. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Masterson is a great actress, but she just didn’t cope with the “cool girl” character. (She had similar problems with her character on SECOND DAY of Christmas.) Perhaps she should avoid these characters, especially those who have a disgusting girl, to play with them. <br /> <br /> Evan Rachel Wood was not impressed. Her heroine was stupid, simple and clear, and no young actress could give Harriet any positive emotions. <br /> <br /> In the interests of full disclosure, I could not even finish viewing this picture. Forty-five minutes of my time is enough to waste.
