What offends me the most in critics after this film is the mention of "originality." This film does not contain a single innovation element. If by “originality” you mean pretentious action films, replay, gluttony in violence, stupid humor and a script beyond intellectual convictions. Then “originality” is something a Swedish film can do without. <br /> <br /> How Rose and Karlsson can agree to “act” on this bad excuse for the film is a mystery to me. And the way Eva Rose, after making this film, can be seen on a TV luncheon advertising it simply disappoints me. <br /> <br /> This film does not contain a story, the script is illogical, cruel, and last but not so. at least, just bad. These two young filmmakers have collected a rather disgusting boy fantasy, containing violence, comics, and banal psychological portraits. I would not be surprised if the DD scene masturbates in the kitchen at the microwave dinner to describe the everyday life of these two overgrown cinematic nerds who pretend to be directors. <br /> <br /> I would not show this film to my worst enemy.
