It is definitely not worth spending either money or time. This is all the same hackneyed story about a boy and a girl meeting and falling in love. But it is with a western tinge. But it fails miserably, either in depicting a love story or in giving it a western tone. We never feel that the hero and heroin are in love. There is no depth to any of their characters. Perhaps with a better cast of characters, some justice could be achieved. Finally, this is a film without fun, without acting, without a theme, without a plot, without a comedy, without action, without thrills, without romance (I associate romance with something more passionate). Definitely not a movie you would like to go with your family. In general, if you are looking for a movie with some content, this is definitely not an option. I will wait for the day when Bollywood films are something that I can wait to watch, and I can call my friends the movie "sure to watch."
