I think that this film was made backwards, first they shot a lot of scenes and action films, explosions, and then the writers set to work trying to find a story to link all the scenes together. This movie is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen, the average porn movie comes with a much better written and much more holistic script. The film does not make sense. Seriously, even if you are a Segal fan, there is no reason why you EVER would like to see this film, except when you like to watch accidents, because this is a terrible accident and should never have been released. in this world. <br /> <br /> boran.
