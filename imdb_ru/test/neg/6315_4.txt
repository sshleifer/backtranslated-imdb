This movie is based on the TV series Street Fighter Alpha (or Zero)! He is in a different place than Streetfighter, an animated film! This film is all about Ryu, accompanied by Ken and Jong Lee. I recognized Rose, Zangif, and Birdie! There were no other characters in the video game (which I might discover)! The fighting scenes were fine, but nothing special! And there were not many! For me it is strange! Is not streetfighter about the fight! Streetfighter Animation (1994) is far superior to this film. He is trying to be more than he really is! Using Hada Power and other supernatural elements has nothing to do with the skills that characters in a video game possess! And in this case it is bad! The story is so boring that you don't care what happens! The action is significantly relaxed! What for? And what happened to the other characters from the video game! Of course, they are more interesting than the villain in this story! The main attraction of the video game are the characters with their special skills! This movie is all about Ryu! That's why this anime fails!
