Well, not much can be said about this movie. it's just rubbish. a very bad acting game, a bad script and a shit story ... well, the actress (I don't even know her name) who played the main role (not blond and Latin) did well, but blond who played the main character's girlfriend her acting level is the same as in high school, like most of the other actors in the film. In addition, zombies, very bad cast. and, the story itself makes no sense at all. Well, if you are really bored and you really have nothing to do, but you want to somehow kill time, you might want to watch this movie, but even in this case, millions of the best B films are still better than this shit. its a complete waste of money and time.
