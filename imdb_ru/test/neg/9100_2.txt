Alain Rene directs three parallel stories that are related to fantasy and imagination in the adult world. In one of them - a kind of story of an opera brothel, where a rejected architect tries to manipulate a group of people in the throes of happiness - only his attempt does not fall into the sole goal - the woman for whom he longs. In the same unfinished castle that he built, a group of teachers is looking for love in a more modern history, as one woman unconditionally believes in the role of the novel, and the cynical anthropologist tries to teach her a lesson, putting her in the biggest push in the group. Meanwhile, a group of children fantasizes about the prince’s adventure, like George Melissa, who saves a girl in distress from swamp creatures, and then kills the evil king, bringing a love kingdom. Two main topics? Life is a fairy tale, and life is not a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> This sounds better than the movie really is. Resnais is a type of director, where often the concept is good or bad, but the main thing is the exposure; here the concept is great, but watching the movie is completely painful. Terrible, not exactly melodious songs, playful characters without an ounce of measurement, backgrounds of disgusting pastels - instead of giving ice cream to her inner child, Conne sinks him into the icing from the pie bucket. Add a bit of French philosophy, and you get a strange witch-like brew that doesn’t allow bubbly work and trouble, but just sits wrong in your stomach until you want to spew it. <br /> <br /> Rene is the risk of an exciting director, and even at his worst you can see that he is trying something that may not work with complete clarity of action. In “I want to go home,” he manages to walk past annoying characters and dizzying scenery, showing some real changes and having a few minutes of silence to take a breath. Here he plunges directly into the fantasy, which does not really reflect the fantasy, but only a link to the wallpaper from the children's room. The biggest problem is that he somehow managed to make the film more vivid than the pop videos of the 80s, and more kitsch than the Hollywood musicals Golden Era. These fantasies go beyond childish and naive, but the film (with nudity and profanity) is definitely aimed at adults, a goal that he definitely missed. <br /> <br /> However, he keeps a close eye on his subject and never retreats. In any case, this film is impressive simply because he does not apologize. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
