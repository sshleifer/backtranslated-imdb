After watching this film, I realized that I don’t really like them. “Captured Women” is another film, “Women in Prison,” which, like most other genres; the plot is completely abandoned in favor of simply showing naked women. Now don't get me wrong; I love naked women, but I also like that some kind of storyline is going on with nudity, and since there is only the basic theme of “women in prison” in this film, it passes through it (just like the main shoot, Of course I got a little bored to the end. The film is good because there is hardly a moment when women wear clothes, but this is the only positive moment. Director (and writer, ha ha) Erwin C. Dietrich is pleased to show close-ups of the naked female body but it is never erotic. The director was selling several junk films, including director Jess Franco. In my opinion, he should be engaged in producing, as his writing talents do not exist, and he does not seem to know how to shoot the sex scene. This kind of material is rather dry, but I think that Franco could benefit more from this. In general, this may be enough for people who really love such things, but I can't say I liked it.
