Rumor has it that the fourth underworld will happen. If so, then the third part, which is also a prequel, will be in the middle of the franchise. With the prequels that follow the original films, you always ask yourself what order to watch the films in order for it to make sense ... <br /> <br /> In this case, I think it doesnâ€™t matter much, Third film about the underworld does not match the other two. They also had their obvious flaws, but this lacks several things, and it looks like cash. It seems that this is not full gas, which is insulting, because the actors probably could use the best material for the work. <br /> <br /> The story is fine, but nothing special. Good movie, but Rona Mitra could not fill Beckinsale's shoes (yes, she plays another character, I mean the void that Kate B. left) ...
