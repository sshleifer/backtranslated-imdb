About your horrible copying of the Beethoven film. As a professional musician, I have to watch every film about any composer, and Beethoven is one of my favorites. When Hungarians and Americans meet, this is a terrible combination of empty emotions combined with the worst taste. You proved it in your terrible bi-movie. The only thing that carries the film is music. Of course, you did not bother to look further than good ones, but, for my taste, the contrived performances of the Tackacs quartet, but well, I must admit that at least the performances are of a quality unlike the film that you made. It begins with the dying deaf Beethoven, who perfectly understands Anna, who is just whispering. Beethoven's hearings during the film are getting better every minute, but this must be due to some indefinite divine thing. Then it is completely impossible for the half-pornographic “wide-eyed eyes” double scene guiding, which is completely on top with juicy Anna and a crying nephew at the end (who also calls out in distant scenes with permanent red eyes, my God, what a performance). And as the culmination of robbery from Amadeus, when Beethoven dictated Anna music not in notes, but in complete nonsense, which she perfectly understands, but none of your audience, even trained professional musicians, will understand. Of course, your reaction will be that a negative answer is at least an answer, but I can assure you that Beethoven himself is turning into a grave because of your useless creation and with reason. This so-called respect is blasphemy, and I am very sorry that I made one of the worst films ever made, albeit about my favorite subject. Ed Harris and others, you cannot comprehend Beethoven’s greatness in your wildest dreams and, of course, not after a couple of lessons of conducting and playing the violin. This is a problem with you Americans: you think you can understand everything, even if it takes a lot of hard work. Yes, we can do it anyway! Remember that a good product is hard work, talent, dedication and professionalism. All of this to you, the creators of Beethoven Copy, is missing. See you in kindergarten.
