OK, where do I start? I saw the screening a couple of weeks ago and was shocked by how bad this film is. Of course, if you just love Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres (bad game) and think that these are the best TV shows on the air, then you will surely enjoy this movie. Personally, I really like the work of George, and he is very talented, but comedy is not his forte. Some people are natural in a comedy, and I’m sure that it’s great and fun to work with him personally, but in a comedy he can’t handle it on the big screen. It was a cute movie, but I would pay 12 dollars to watch it? H & LL no !!!! Now that I saw it, I would not recommend it to anyone to spend my money. George, mate, I love you, but please do not do more comedies? This script lacks a lot, a great concept, but it just didn't do it.
