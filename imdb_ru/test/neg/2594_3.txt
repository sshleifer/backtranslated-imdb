Family man. When the show first went on the air, it was fresh, original and rather funny. Now I have stopped watching this. This was one of the worst TV shows combining unfunny jokes, repetitive, tightened jokes and the hope that every joke could become funny with the inclusion of the word “bitch. Seth Macfarlane is clearly having problems with himself, and he obviously indulges an audience of 13-year-old boys. <br /> <br /> I just don’t understand how something that started so funny, so different from everything else, can turn into this terrible mess of a comedy show. I seriously heard the best way to come off the pood comics. <br /> <br /> It is truly sad to see that great shows fail, and to see how this goes on, continues. Either Seth MacFarlane stopped trying, or he thinks that this show is fun as it is. <br /> <br /> God help us anyway. <br /> <br /> I hate this show, and I will dance the Irish jig when it is finally canceled.
