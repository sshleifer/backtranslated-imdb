I can not understand why someone made such a film. From the very beginning to the end this film is very, very bad. <br /> <br /> All the characters are very small, horribly acting and directly annoying. Neither the characters nor the plot absolutely nothing happens under the surface. <br /> <br /> “Humor”, if you can call it that, is aimed at an adult audience (I suppose, of language and nudity), although basically it looks like toilet humor and problems can arise even with the smile of a half-conscious 16-year-old. <br /> <br /> I would recommend avoiding this excuse for comedy. There is nothing in it that a movie lover would like. A non-existent laugh and a barely existing conspiracy make me ask: “Why was this film made, why, why, why?” <br /> <br /> I expect that in some time this film will lead the top 100 worst films.
