Hoods do not deliver goods. This unfinished mafia comedy boasts a star cast, including Joe Mantegna, Kevin Pollack, Joe Pantoliano, Jennifer Tilly and Seymour Cassel, as well as a number of people familiar to those watching crime films, but this is really a flash in the pan if there ever was one . Writer and director Mark Malone, best known for writing The Dead of Winter for director Bonnie and Clyde Arthur Penn, wrote a walking boiler that has a sick but vengeful Mafia boss Louis Martinelli (Seymour Cassel) sending his son Angelo (Joe Mantegna) from "House of Games") to hit Carmine DellaRosa. It seems that a rival mob fired on one of Pop’s warehouses (in the opening scene), and Martinelli wants to pay off. The problem is that no one knows who Carmine DellaRosa is. In any other mafia comedy such complication can be fun, but everything is simple. Angelo and a bunch of wise men, including his best friend Rudy (Kevin Pollack from Containment), spend half the time trying to figure out who Carmine is. Neither Rudy nor Angelo want to perform the hit, so they track down the crazy bounty hunter Charlie (Joe Pantoliano from Bad Boys) to do the dirty work. Before they can convince Charlie to strike, they must find him, and the slutty wife Charlie Mary (Jennifer Tilly from The Bound) discovers that he is locked up in a mental hospital. Our unsuitable heroes go to a mental hospital and beat Charlie. About half of the film ends before they discover that Carmine is a child in short pants (Vincent Berry) who is soft and harmless. Indeed, Carmine has the only decent role in the film. When our brainless group of heroes leaves his house with him in the back seat to do business, Carmine warns them that they need to take him home in time, otherwise his father will kill him. Charlie is trying to freeze the hedgehog, but can not. Instead, he reconnects with his feelings and wants to return to a mental hospital to report good news to his doctor. In the meantime, after Charlie decides not to shoot at Carmine, the child gets his paws from a pistol and sticks out several aimless rounds. Angelo and he fight for the machine gun. The gun slips out of their collective hands, falls to the ground, walks away and makes a hole in Rudy's chest. Now keep in mind that Rudy never wanted to shoot a guy, and Angelo and he argued about the wrong strike. Thus, Rudy is on the ground with a mortal wound, while Angelo is trying to stop the bleeding. Talk about a boring death scene. Angelo himself is in conflict because his father ordered a strike, and Angelo is afraid that his father will make him if he does not follow orders. There is a story about how Angelo's father taught him to use a pistol, which gives some idea of ​​Angelo’s reluctance to take a weapon. <br /> <br /> In this depressing comedy with a depressor end there is nothing useful, the situation is getting worse, and if you hold out in this 90-minute nonsense, you will understand what I mean. Comedy in many ways without laughter. Good actors roll in fragmentary roles that are not even funny. Perhaps director Malone was trying to shoot another comedy, such as “The Gang That Didn’t Shoot Right”. If he was, he missed by a mile. Big breasted Jennifer Tilly shows chopping and roars after a couple of scenes with Mantegna, but she does nothing more. She is a stereotypical whore who does not even undress. A pay check is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented actor, otherwise this picture will be pathetic from beginning to end. Initially, I was hoping that it could be a fake "Red Leader Redemption", when the child drives the wise men crazy, but there was no luck. Of course, the biggest surprise is that they have to kill the child, but this is not the surprise that makes you want to watch it until its resolution. <br /> <br /> I actually bought this film on the Canadian DVD label Sevilla and it contains only the most basic special features. If you hate the preview that gives the plot, do not watch the trailer. If you ever meet Joe Mantegna, one of your first questions should be why he helped create this yawn. It is not fun and not dramatic. There are no quoted lines, and none of the characters stand out as interesting or sympathetic. Sevilla DVD presents the film in full frame without subtitles and subtitles.
