I admit - I was attracted to this from deception - and I did not stop to look at the sources. "One of the best indie films of the year of operation (1999)", "shocking" and "must have." <br /> <br /> Well, I wasted my money. But not everything was bad in this movie. They at least understood the blood correctly, as well as some of the most unique murder methods seen in a long time. There is even a storyline (kinda), and that's it. <br /> <br /> But for a movie about exploitation there is an amazing amount of content - but without use. We get gay sex - Sorta. We have 3 interracial babes - maybe. We have a psychotic Vietnamese prostitute - a good back, oral sex (well, that made me flinch) and some female version of Gene Simmons (I don't understand this part). We have honest to the goodness of Capone - ratings among the best actors in this film - this is not a compliment. And finally, we threw a government plot in — I don't know — try to put the murder together with revenge / randomly / Jimmy Boy theme to make the Vietnamese psycho seem sane ??????? If nothing else proves that Italians and Americans do not have a lock on this type of film. Latinos can do shit just like everyone else. Glory to all who participated in this achievement, who overcame it and made a career for themselves.
