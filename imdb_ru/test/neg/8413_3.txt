For a film that has received such a great recognition and appreciation of this additional income for Rosemary Baby, this is one big mistake. It starts with the fact that Andrew / Adrian, whatever his name, because he is so confused that he no longer knows who he is, runs away from the cult with his mother, and soon he is kidnapped by a strange woman who ultimately cares about him as if she were his mother. The action is terrible, as Andrew grows up at the age of twenty and looks terrible with a drowned face, never ending a smile, and the clothes of the Duke of Danger look more drunk than the son of Satan. In fact, this is all he does; he drinks and casually falls on himself, trying to understand his past and last memories of how his mother is leaving on a bus shouting at him. He finds a friend who seems like an angel, but he is quickly killed and electrocuted in a mountainous scene in which he looks more like a Christmas tree. Andrew falls into the trap, and the cult with the members of the first part tests him to see if he really is the Son of Satan. His stupid "I" does not stand the test and rises after he sparkles with mimic makeup, jumps from the nightclub scene and dances like a clown on a crack !!! This scene is remembered and worth seeing. The ending is terrible and somewhat predictable, considering how stupid he is in the whole movie. Do not watch this piece of garbage, otherwise you will lose respect for the first part.
