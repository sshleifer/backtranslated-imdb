In the mid-1800s, the Irishman Dennis Hopper (like Daniel Morgan) emigrated to Australia in search of the share of gold on the continent. Instead, Mr. Hopper finds himself condemned and thrown into an agonizing prison; there he was gang-raped. After his release, Hopper contacts Aboriginal David Gulpill (as Billy), with whom he is seeking revenge on the sadist Bill Hunter (as Sergeant Smith), Jack Thompson (as Detective Mainvering) and others. In the end, revenge becomes heroism; Hopper is admired and helped by ordinary people; he is hunted by corrupt and influential authorities. Hopper's “barely human” representation certainly corresponds to the scattered sensation of the film. Mr. Gulpilil heads a strong cast. The staff involved in Mad Dog Morgan makes it not only worthy of attention, but also a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> *** Mad Dog Morgan (1976) Philip Mora ~ Dennis Hopper, David Gulpilil, Bill Hunter
