I will say one thing for Herman, USA: it will probably always be good for the Minnesota audience. I can't imagine that there is another place in the world where a reference to Bemidji's fast life or a line like “I knew something was wrong with the guys from Iowa” would bring down the house. I really enjoyed the first hour or so. In fact, a group of lonely village guys shoots advertisements and finds their city surrounded by willing female fiancés (is the word “fiancé” a word for a particular gender?) Of course, she is not progressive, but in itself she is charming. It is a pity that the filmmakers felt the need to resort to an artificial story about a cunning gold digger and her cruel husband. In general, it’s just too picky for your own good, but you have to give some props to the movie with courage to give the guy with Kevin Chamberlin the creation of a nude love scene. I will always welcome the image of people who do not meet the usual standards of beauty as sexy, caring people, but this is not enough to redeem Herman, USA. Paraphrasing Jello Biafra, this is nostalgia for age, which has never happened.
