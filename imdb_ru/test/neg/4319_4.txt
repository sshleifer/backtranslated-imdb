Firstly, the current description of the IMDb plot seems to be misleading, a film about a group of girls who choose a misogynous hitchhiker who plans to kill them all. They stop at a small motel where he holds them hostage, but develops a strong attraction for one of the girls. Violence occurs. <br /> <br /> I picked it up by mistake, thinking that it was another 2007 film “Hitchhiker”. Not that Hitcher was better, and I still looked for a sluggish film, but sometimes it was almost unbearable. I think that I could have been pulled out on a piece of paper and come up with a better plot than this one. <br /> <br /> I can't even count how many films I watched with almost the same plot, so at times it was almost painfully predictable, but in reality there were several scenes that ... well, let me give example. At some point, the door is covered with blood (which is very obvious), and two policemen at the scene because of the 911 call are looking at it from a distance of 30 feet, they see a person also covered with blood, go outside the door, agree that suspiciously, but decide not to continue the investigation. <br /> <br /> But no matter how ridiculous this may be, the film has never been boring, it was well produced, directed and acted in full good special effects, unwarranted nudity and violence. Probably, I would not advise spending 90 minutes of my life on watching this film, but it turned out that it was fine while I cleaned the basement. It is also highly recommended for fans of evil movies, and it would be a good movie to watch with friends when you plan to talk more than watch.
