What a nasty cynical movie. Apparently, this is a sad excuse for the dramatic view of city dwellers at what 20-year-old children are doing, while crawling along the ditch of Sydney’s nightlife, is somehow related to the target market. Made by any industry by anyone and friends who apparently thought they could hold down any messy behavior with a young actor and put it into multiplexes, SAMPLE PEOPLE deservedly failed at the Australian box office. He is so offended in his clichéd images of obvious and easy goals that he was completely rejected by the audience for which he was intended. Boring and cruel, without any attempt to offer quality or resonance to a young audience that could be attracted by marketing or casting SAMPLE PEOPLE, could be interesting or even informative if it didn’t spoil its exploitative view of what teenagers want in 'film'. The character played by Ben Mendelson is especially insulting, and Kylie Minogue is again lost due to poor material and untalented filmmakers. It was as if the producers thought that teenagers would watch some ugly joke and just bring together scenes and characters that were superficial and less soulful. Well, they were very wrong. The mini budget film, shot in 1983 under the title GOING DOWN, correctly understood this topic and is an excellent antidote to this poison.
