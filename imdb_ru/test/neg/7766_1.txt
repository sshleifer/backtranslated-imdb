The first time I saw this, I recoiled in horror from what was presented as modern, liberated women. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I can't relate to the whining idiots, whose life revolves around sex and acquiring Gucci, Prada and Louis Vuitton. The concern is that some may actually think that this is the way women live in New York. It is definitely not. These women are incredibly superficial and materialistic, and, as another reviewer said, they behave like digging gold. <br /> <br /> This is not a liberated woman, and I'm glad she left. 0 stars and just awful
