I am in two thoughts on the NEXT, debut film of Christopher Nolan. A part of me admires that it costs 6000 dollars, but a part hates me because it is too skillful. In many ways, this reminds me of the cult film “Pi”, a film that I didn’t like, and I cannot deal with the central plot of a person who wants to be a writer, following others. Wouldn't it be more logical if someone wants to become a writer, sit in front of the keyboard and write? <br /> <br /> Well, yes, I think that FOLLOWING gives indie cinematographers hope that just because they shot a $ 6000 budget film, more than two thousand IMDB members will vote for it, and more than five hundred participants will comment on it. but you have to wonder if this film would be so well appreciated if it was not directed by MEMENTO?
