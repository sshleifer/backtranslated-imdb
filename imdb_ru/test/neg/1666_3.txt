This is probably my least favorite episode. I lived on Cape Girardot for quite a while. I can tell you that in Missouri there are no boats with the ocean or shrimps, fresh crab or sea scallops. Cape Girardot is the only inland headland on the Mississippi River. It looks like the license plates were from Mississippi, which may explain why there was so much racial tension. Missouri and Mississippi are two completely different states that do not touch each other. There are many roads in the city and beyond, and none of them is Route 6 or Route 666. All this inaccuracy is very distracting. In addition, Cassie did not look like a person who would like to hang around Dean if she were well educated. I did not buy them as a couple and did not enjoy the long love scene. Joe was more in the style of Dean.
