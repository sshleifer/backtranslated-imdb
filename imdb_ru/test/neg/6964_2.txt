Bela Lugosi as God? Transvestites discussed in the straight-line film of the 1950s? Fortunately, it should be a Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this film, I felt at the same time feelings of guilt, pleasure and nausea. This story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself) and his alter ego Glenda. Anyway, if this film were made now, I could see Kevin Kline play Glen / Glenda. Note that the alter ego of all crossdressers are versions of their male name (Glen / Glenda, Robert / Roberta, etc.). He tries to sympathetically portray him as a mental disorder, and not as a graphic perversion. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Voodoo manages to penetrate the slavery and S & M sequence into his original Glen / Glend story. Along with these bright scenes appears Satan himself, who has a clearly bad day. The dialogue and tempo does not exist, but the film is pleasant in its context - the strange world of Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Sterno says put on your favorite lace panties for this.
