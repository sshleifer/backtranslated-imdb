Being a relentless, unceasing explosive melodrama, this film is one of the worst action films ever created, and quite incredible in every way. The pace is constantly reeling, and all the actions and actors are covered with complete hysteria. It is almost invisible, and the spot is not, the spot is on the careers of all involved. <br /> <br /> A wildly exaggerated attempt at arousal undermines itself, leading to a film where you just go “Come on!” all the time. Setting and events can not be perceived even remotely. I can only appreciate this abomination 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good movie about asteroids, see “Deep Impact”, which is intense, sensitive and completely exciting. All Armageddon is wrong.
