I saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends. His reputation preceded this, and although all my friends were also adults, I alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it. We gathered in the house where the parents left the city for the weekend. Although we sat in close proximity to each other, we did not speak or recognize the presence of each other. As it turned out, the film deserves and does not deserve the anticipation that we experienced. He will not be disappointed with the point of view of purely gratuitous content, but are disappointed in any other way. <br /> <br /> Caligula attempts to go beyond genres, combining a historical epic with an arrogant porn movie. He fails in his ambitions, exposing the audience to the worst of both worlds. Obviously, the point of sale of the film is its pornographic aspect, and it does provide much more than its share of real, graphic sex. But in the formulation of this sex in the context of the depraved rule of Caligula, this is worthy of an act even less than the average adult film. Sex without context can at least be physically pleasant for the adults involved, but pleasure and perhaps even agreement are practically absent in the world of Caligula. In this sex at best serves as an idle pastime, and at worst - an instrument of sadistic domination. Nowadays, such words as “sin” and “depravity” can be heard quite often, which are used maliciously to describe actions that are pleasant, but are considered forbidden according to certain moral or religious views. Caligula takes the viewer beyond the limits of joking, portraying true depravity and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes from this. <br /> <br /> Historical parts are not only incapable of contextualizing the gender meaningfully, they cannot entertain, educate, intrigue or interest the viewer in any way. They provide only long stretches of incessant boredom. Rarely was the movie so boring. Sex after the initial shock and amazement only contributes to the overall monotony of the picture. <br /> <br /> Rare discussions of this film are related to his violence. Although many films were shot, more brutal than Caligula, few can compete with him in terms of the shock value of his violence. Apparently, uncompromising barbarism, as well as hyperactive sexuality, characterized the imperialism of Caligula. Violence is even weaker for the faint of heart than for sex. <br /> <br /> Such a review is likely to cause as much curiosity as suppression. I understand why someone would like to see this film; in the end, I myself succumbed to the same curiosity. I just hope that my review, explicitly describing his lack of redemption value, will at least give potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not. My criminal justice school teacher called the police work "hours of boredom, interspersed with moments of horror." This statement perfectly describes Caligula. You have been warned.
