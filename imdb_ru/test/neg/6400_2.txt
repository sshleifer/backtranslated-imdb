This happens on Fire Island back in the 1970s. Couple Peter (Craig Dudley) and Buddy (J. Will Dean) have a party on July 4th at their home. Unfortunately, their relationship is crumbling, and they have to prepare for a home full of very strange guests. The rest of the film is about the party and what happens between Peter and Buddy. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'm gay, but I was 8 years old when this was done. If this is a true idea of ​​what was gay life in the 1970s, I am glad that I was not there. From the mysterious opening credits, which depict children playing in the sand (???), this film slowly turns into a catastrophe. There is a guru (Robert Case) who talks non-stop about nothing. I wanted to see a guy halfway through his first long speech. There is a young guy Danny, who is there for the first time. There are a couple of lesbians (who do nothing - except for one strip without a reason). There is a leather queen. Worst of all is a woman named Jimmy (Jimmy Foster). We get to know him and his friend (whose name I never received) when they get a flat tire. They basically shout and scream for 10 minutes and do not know how to fix the apartment. I know that some people find it funny, but I find it offensive and rather sad. The party itself is full of people you never want to know. It's like being thrown to a party full of bad actors playing disgusting people. With the exception of Dudley, no one can act. <br /> <br /> It can be valuable as a portrait of what the Island of Fire was in the 1970s ... but it’s pretty boring. It gets 2 only for the frequent male nude of some very good bodies.
