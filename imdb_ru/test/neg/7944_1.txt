I don't think you need to outline the story for you, because the site and other users have already done a great job. However, here is my take. This is by far the worst movie of 2005, and there were really very bad films. I don't even need to go into details, because there is NOTHING in this movie. Bad game, bad story, bad direction, bad special effects - you call it. If he's not standing alone, like the worst movie ever made, he's tied up with some other shit. I would be ashamed if my friends knew that I was in this film. But hey, most people who see him will do it no matter what feedback he gets, so you have more power. When you feel the gap between the neurons two hours after your evening, do not blame me.
