I saw it with my children, they love it, but I don’t know that the reindeer in the song do not overfeed her, but what the hell in this shitty film she got on the sled, it's like hell why, when my children heard how they drowned, they thought it was good, but we watched it, they were like this “dad, why grandmother”, so my children say, grandmother, in any case, my children said that “dad, why grandmother suffered from Sani “I told them that the movie was shitty, they agreed, it’s sad why someone calls the dog Doofas there, which a hundred is stupid, and when everyone is dressed in black that looked like that, I mean Daphne looked like a damn gothic girl every single looked like goth and in the song they found grandmother on the ground I think she died in a song, but in this weird shitty movie she left, I think they should make this show, OK, everyone will like it, I give it 1 out of 10
