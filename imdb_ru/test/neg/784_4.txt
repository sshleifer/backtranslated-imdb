First of all. Should Cameron Diaz ever act again? To call it a bad performance would be an insult to a bad performance. It was a historically terrible performance. Any little chance that Diaz had a serious actress is now fully realized after that. Ridiculous terrible. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film was very boring and not at all thought provoking. I can sit and reflect on the nature of man, not watching the terrible actors, playing a terrible story. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, there was not a single cute character, and, even worse, it seemed that this was a design. You should not love or sympathize with any character. It was quite effective. I wanted them all to just die, to be honest. Aliens included. Kid included. In this film, everyone had just one big joke. Everything was literally hooligans, and they called it a movie. You could hardly distinguish the "workers" of zombies from ordinary people, because they all looked like zombies. <br /> <br /> Finally, nothing really makes sense. From the reactions and emotions of the characters to the literal plot - it all seems random. It's just a very bad movie, disguised and portrayed as a “film about thinking people,” which should be misleading. Give me a break. A bad movie is a bad movie. And this film was bad.
