I do not know why all the previous comments are endorsement of this film. This, of course, is far from true, but ... MOST MOST MOVIE that I have seen recently, full of clich√©s, bad behavior, in fact, no ... very bad behavior and a stupid conspiracy ... If I saw it I would go to the cinema in the first 20 minutes. If you hate someone, you make him / her watch this movie ... that's how bad it is. A girl who has an imaginary boyfriend / friend who gives up her relationship with the real, because her imagination is jealous ... but I think it figures ... she takes her parents, who also have some mental problems ... plus a character that should be, I think, a mockery of it, a thing that should make you laugh, Cal's neighbor is a serious case, and I just feel sorry for him ... and the whole movie
