Have you ever watched something so horrible that you just need to keep looking to be sure that it is as bad as it seems? This is one of those movies. Critics released him, and not least because of how he was financed. I caught it on TV last night and gave in to curiosity. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is what is written on the box, no more and no less: a low level of humor, rudeness, a lot in Continue ... Vienna, but with an "adult" language. In fact, it goes back to 60s / 70s of the UK porn industry, cheating on professional players, promising real sex, not delivery (spot nipple?) <br /> <br /> This has the advantage of Mackenzie Crook (Office, Pirates of the Caribbean and more), as well as Johnny Vegas. The girl from the chips store is genuinely sexy. Besides these unexpected positive moments, I really wonder what happened to England. Junk food, low paid jobs, estates, desperate lives. As a bonus, there are some good pictures of leafy Birmingham. Foreigners may find this informative about British relations and aspirations. In general, however, I still feel disbelief in what I have experienced.
