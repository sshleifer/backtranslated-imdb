The talented screenwriter Alvin Sargent, unfortunately, cannot get any interesting ideas that are preparing in this artificial trivia about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to get them to work in Los Angeles, despite her capricious behavior. Aside from a few good episodes, I didn’t quite buy Susan Sarandon as a shard (she’s too smart and determined to impersonate this devil lady), and her naturally well-founded personality is not well suited for this role of irresponsible parent. Natalie Portman feels much better than her child, and yet her work has a terrible alienation (and some of her scenes, for example, the one where she asks the boy to undress, are misleading and uncomfortable to watch). Of course, the incompetent play “Anywhere, but here” does have moments that work, but this is not a hugging film, nor is it important. ** from ****
