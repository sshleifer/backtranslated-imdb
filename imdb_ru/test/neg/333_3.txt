I felt obligated to write a review after watching the only review that gave this film a suspiciously high rating of 9/10. I speak suspiciously, because it is less like a review, but more like an advertising statement. Perhaps the director himself or one of his comrades wrote this “review”? Naughty, naughty. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on the Propeller channel on Sky TV, expecting it to be really awful. The special effects used were, frankly, very, very good for a low-budget film, and some acting games were not so bad either, but most of the acting was really awful, but well done for trying, as I expect most of them were director pals. <br /> <br /> I think the director really succeeded in trying to jump above his weight. I found some movies funny, because they tried to be very cool when they were not there. <br /> <br /> If you don’t take this movie too seriously and watch it while you are drunk with a few friends, you may well have a good time, but probably not as planned. This film is by no means 9/10, but it's worth looking at the laughter, bearing in mind that it was made with a very very low budget and, frankly, thanks to the merits of those involved in its production.
