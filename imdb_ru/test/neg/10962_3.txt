This film was terrible, especially considering the work that must have gone into its production. Although it is not as bad as Ax 'Em, it is pretty awful. Consider the obvious looting from the Gladiator and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, and what do you get? This buffet with terrible make-up and wooden game. <br /> <br /> The movie begins as most zombie films do. A montage of interesting jumps and a flash broadcast on hand. We see how our hero (Rin, perhaps the most terrible "zombie hunter" in the modern era; he thought about four or five times that he either scratched his head with a gun barrel or looked down at the muzzle during a blow) cut off the zombie's fingers. . Later we learn that these fingers are going for rewards. <br /> <br /> Well, Rin seems to be rioting in his ways of distributing zombies; went so far as to buy the plague * suffocated from his French friend Hans (who is not really French, speaks with a strange Middle Eastern accent). When Rin uses a buddy to collect a bountiful reward from Lost Hills, all hell breaks up. <br /> <br /> And they hint at the horror of the film. Zombies are pretty badly collected. I saw comments praising their makeup, but it was quite amateurish, in my opinion. Halloween's obvious adhesives were used to make zombie faces, and there were points at which one girl looked like she was putting on a clown mask instead of a recently cleansed face. Oy Vey. <br /> <br /> Summing up the following sixty minutes in several lines: Rin was stabbed to death by Hans (who made a deal with some other zombie hunters, Blyth is the leader), gives him a second chance, gets hit again by Hans, then shoots in Hans and gets to Union City, where he discovers that Blythe poisons cities for profit. <br /> <br /> That's all for the plot. When Rin reaches Union City, all the villains gather in the house, which is obviously so massive that Rin takes hours to get to the top floor. People die, Rin lives, and the film ends with one of those cynical "Is he going to kill himself?" scenes. <br /> <br /> * END OF SPOILERS * I am going to blame most of this mess in Nott. The direction was terrible. EVERY character had resentment, except for Hans, who was simply the best "actor" in this group MacBet, which he rejects. When they reach Union City, a bunch of zombies attack the team, and the zombies obviously donâ€™t give any advice or ideas about how to walk, as if your appendages are rotten. One woman sways as if she is floating in the air on a Sunday walk. <br /> <br /> Some movies are terrible. This film is one of them simply because it seemed that logic was abandoned so that the story would continue. It works sometimes, but in this respect (where the story was already in ruins), it is not. <br /> <br /> Avoid this unless you want a decent laugh.
