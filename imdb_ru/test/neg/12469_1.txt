The main structure of the story: Beginning, Middle, End. <br /> <br /> Sometimes this structure is played, and we get Memento or Irreversible, and the story is played backwards. Sometimes it's just not linear, but for fiction. Despite this, they all have a beginning, middle and end. <br /> <br /> This is the first film I've ever seen that has no end. <br /> <br /> Start: the girl’s best friend is excluded. <br /> <br /> Middle: a girl should manage without a best friend. <br /> <br /> End: does not exist. <br /> <br /> It’s not that the end preserve this film, but at least it would be completed. <br /> <br /> This is an exercise in apathy; we get a mixture of characters, and they all turn out to be losers. Boring, vain, stupid and pale role models to people. <br /> <br /> And here is the action in this film: Nothing happens. Nothing happens. Misha Barton tries to speak with a disgusting English accent, Dominic Swain whines a lot, and Brad Renfro gets a blowjob from some old man. The end of the film. <br /> <br /> By the time the credits ended, I had a terrible feeling that many prisoners should have: periods of time, those precious moments of our lives, were simply wasted. <br /> <br /> The only passable point (and this is very decided ONLY) is Brad Renfro. He works well. I like Lacy Schabert, but I have no luck here. Thanks to the good work in other films, I will forgive Misha Barton for this parody, but I hope that all the actors were slapped for their participation. <br /> <br /> Please, I beg you. Avoid. Do not be fooled into thinking: "I will make a decision myself." My sister told me to never see this, and I ignored her, wanting to make a decision. It was a bad decision. <br /> <br /> I never hated the movie. I don’t like many, but I never hated the movie. Until I saw it.
