It seems that this TVM has a polar opinion among the commentators on this page, so I can sort things out by saying that this is a very stupid, not very well made television film. How bad is it? This is a telecast that cannot even determine its name, because, although everyone in America calls it Linda, in Britain it is known as Killing Thirst, and this is usually a bad sign when the film should change its name. And may I also point out that this is not a language in deception, as someone else claimed <br /> <br /> I will be honest and say that the plot is quite sound. Linda and Paul Cowley meet another couple named Geoffrey, with whom they get along very well. They get along so well that they go on vacation together (decide for yourself if any wife exchanges), and Paul sees his wife killing Jeffreys. After that, the plot takes an unexpected turn. <br /> <br /> When writing the above paragraph, I suddenly realized the great potential of the story, and I will not say anything to get you out of the package. Just when the story continues after the events I've described, things become more and more incredible and bizarre. Not only are production values ​​not quite impressive with the actor playing Paul Cowley, who makes a very wooden voice over, which is annoying, while most of the scenes — the exterior and interior — look like they were filmed on a foggy day
