Tom and Jerry visit Africa and disguise themselves as Amos n'Andy. They even act and speak differently, with the standard derogatory use of extremely poor grammar associated with the stereotypical black image depicted in many cartoons of the era. In addition to offensive pictures, this cartoon is simply not very good. Why were they going to Africa? Apparently, simply in order to provide viewers with another Amos' n-Andy and additionally overly cannibalistic depiction of local Africans. The only reason he got 2 instead of 1 was because the octopus had a few decent seconds. <br /> <br /> Worth a glance, which will still make you think about how ignorance can prevail ... <br /> <br /> (Note. Some cartoons containing such racially stereotypical images, I I consider it very good. It all depends on whether there is good content around the cartoon or the only reason for the existence of the cartoon is to make fun of those who are wrongly depicted. In other words, if you get rid of Mommy, shuffling legs, bad grammar and black faces with gigantic depicted s lips, that is something else? In the case of «Plane Dumb».)
