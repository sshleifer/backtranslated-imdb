I don't hate it. I just could not adjust to the story. it really did not capture me. Michael Mann is a very good director, but I disagree with his methods on this. I'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. some of the projects in which he participated are pretty stupid, but his game is great. My favorite films by Daniel Day Lewis "There Will Be Blood" and "Gangs of New York". <br /> <br /> There is one thing that I really liked, and it was a musical score, he gave the film a great atmosphere. that's all i liked about it though. this film also has a high voice, which is a bit random. I see that few will like it, but this is not enough to get an overall rating of 7.8. <br /> <br /> I would have missed this film if you were you, but there were a lot of votes for it. so I think you should look at it and form your own opinion about what you think. I didnâ€™t like it very much ............. 4/10 ............. JD Seaton
