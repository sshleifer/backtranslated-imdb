What can you say after watching this movie? That is, if you had the interest and concentration to see it through. I am speechless due to an incredibly boring story, annoying situations when one American is fifty or more Iraqis, and a boring dialogue. I think that if there is something to learn in this film, then most likely it sounds like this: “Do not joke with us, otherwise we will come and tear ourselves” Plus, this film really encourages and votes to kill the masses of foreigners in the name of war. I got a picture of a game of chess from the playing field. Except that now everything is fast and not many thoughts. And on top of that .. no character has a spirit; then how can you take care of what happens to any of them. Except for the fans of military films without taste, I would not recommend it to anyone. There should always be something more interesting.
