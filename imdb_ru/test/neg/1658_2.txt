Summer vacation homeless teens in a small Ohio town cannot find any meaningful way to fill their time. Some believe that to go to Chicago; others are content to drink and bully their peers. In the random act of arrogance, hooligans fake the homeless and steal a strange book. The handwriting text, as it turned out, contains archaic spells designed to summon demonic forces. After a night or two, one of them recites a spell and is quickly obsessed. He turns into an evil killer and begins to quietly hunt his former peers. <br /> <br /> “Demon Summer” is an amateur production with a microscopic budget. Production values ​​are low, but the filmmakers were smart enough not to be ambitious. Special details or places for firing interfered a little. The acting game is especially weak, and there is practically nothing original in the script. On the positive side, the special effects of makeup are surprisingly good at low budget standards. Despite this, blood is minimal. In addition to the effects of makeup, in this film there is little, even for die-hard beagles. Not recommended.
