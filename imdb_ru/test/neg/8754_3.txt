Hollywood had an old love affair with fake Arabian Nights tales, but few of these products have stood the test of time. The most memorable were the films of John Hall, Maria Montez, who became the camps for a long time. This one is filled with duplicate songs, anachronistic slang and farce. This is a truly generous crop of Mesopotamian corn, and today it is almost unbearable. He was nominated for his creative special effects, which are almost imperceptible in our time, consisting mainly of stunt photos. The only outstanding positive trait that has been preserved is its beautiful color and clarity. Unfortunately, from many films made in this genre, few of them fit the original film by Alexander Korda “The Thief of Baghdad”. However, almost any other Arabian Nights movie is superior to this one. This is a loser.
