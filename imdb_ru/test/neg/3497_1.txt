“Soft” is probably the word that I would use to try to start a description of this movie. I only watched him because he had a good rating, and I was SO disappointed. <br /> <br /> Mostly a film about racism in America after 9/11, and the director went for it with a sledgehammer! There was no subtlety in the film, and it seemed that they were trying to achieve a kind of magnolia sensation in the film - which was never a good idea, since this film was three hours of exhaustion and confusion only to start raining the frog at the end <br /> <br /> Overall, a HUGE disappointment.
