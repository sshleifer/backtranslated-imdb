Do not avoid this movie. Just because it is so bad that it is completely fun. Perhaps this is the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was so bad that my friends and I could laugh at every moment of this movie. From time to time we actually argued whether this was so intentional, but we are sure that it is not. Characters appear out of nowhere, as if they had already been created, the landscape constantly changes the middle scene to this warehouse, and the killer vampire ends up doing about 6 climate battles with enemies before finally getting to the head of the vampire. You can also enjoy the sole face of the Vampire Slayer, as he never changes his expression, despite his obvious attempts. So, if you want to watch a movie that makes you laugh, historically, then I suggest this movie if you are unbiased. Do not expect a good movie, expect the worst ... and it will be even worse. I seriously want to buy this movie and place it on my comedy movie. Right next to the lead.
