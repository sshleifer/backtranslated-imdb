This is a strange, strange film, and it does not deserve a better rating than the David Lynch film! The special effects are bad, the actors are mostly bad actors, and this film is not about a race that is a minority of the planet and is trying to fight the dominators, but about a crazy film that pays tribute to the sect of the organization. This, of course, is not the will of Frank Herbert, the author of the six-part epic! Check out David Lynch, this is a great tribute to romance!
