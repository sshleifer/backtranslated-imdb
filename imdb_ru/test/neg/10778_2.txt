Yawn, this is my reaction to this movie. I really hoped that it would be a good modern slasher, but it does not even fall into the category of slashers. Instead, he tries to be something that he is not, that is a psychological thriller, and he fails so badly. Even the name "Freak" suggests that it might be interesting. Compare this with the cover on the DVD, and you will think, “Well, maybe I'll try.” Do not waste time. <br /> <br /> In fact, the story begins a little more interestingly with a poor, ugly child with headbands wrapped in a fat mother. She screams at him and probably beats him, because in one of the scenes we see that she actually beats him for no reason. After all this, he decides that there is enough of him, and smashes her face with a stone (I guess). He is currently in an insane asylum and is currently being transferred. On the way, he rushes out of the van in which he is located and runs away. Imagine also the two main characters, a little girl and her older sister. They move and set off. Thus, most of the film - they ride in the car, talking among themselves. But the bandaged "Ugly" is now free and is about to start a violent murder! (This is me with sarcasm) <br /> <br /> I can not believe how boring this film turned out to be. The budget was the smallest in the entire history without any special effects and dialogue about which I did not care. This is one of those films where packaging is better than the movie itself. And compare this with Halloween ?! Garbage! I'm not even a fan of the Halloween series (except for the third), but Halloween is far beyond that. At least with Halloween, we have a great bill and some really scary moments. At the same time there is practically no music, except for the piano, and there is nothing terrible in this film. Perhaps this film would be better if it had a good result, because even the worst of the films is tolerated if the music is good. <br /> <br /> Well, this is just my opinion on the film. I thought it was a total waist of time and money. But, since the film has more than 4/10 IMDb points, there must be people who like this film. I am not one of those people. 2/10
