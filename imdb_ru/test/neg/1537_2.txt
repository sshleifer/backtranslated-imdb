Well, the writing was very sloppy, the direction was sloppy, and editing made it worse (at least I hope it was editing). acting was not bad, but not very good. almost none of the characters was pleasant. At least 45 minutes of this film were wasted, and another hour or so was not used almost entirely anywhere else. it was a great idea, but another wasted good idea passes. he could have ended up in 3 different places, but he continued to go mainly to the predictable Hollywood finale. and that which was not predictable was done so badly that it did not matter. the end was not worth watching at all. Sandra Bullock was ill at ease and should stay away from such films. the film looked hastily. the film was simply not worth watching, and if I paid for it, I would be very angry. maybe i was more disappointed because i was expecting a really good movie and got a bad one. the film as a whole was not terribly bad, but I would not recommend it. I gave him 2 of 10 b / c, I really liked the idea, and I liked one character (I think, just super smart). and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes. it was like trying to cover the volcano with a cheap duct tape, it was not beautiful. in any case, if you see it, wait for a theater or video for $ 1.50, if you donâ€™t like every movie you see, then I think you will like this one.
