This was shown at Sundance last night for a receptive, if dumb crowd. Obviously, the story is worth telling, it is powerful and true, but does the director have to play every role with a recognizable face? I mean, in fact, you spend your time saying, “Oh, look, this is a guy from Armageddon” or “Hey, this is an Easy Rider! and you lose sight of the story. Perhaps this is the only way this guy could make his film, but it is a little distracting, like “Boats of Love”, or those old “Exalted Inferno” films that were “crowded” with a block of stars! just telling the story just with lesser known persons. In addition, working with the camera seems lazy, as if there was no thought about where to place the camera in order to best tell the story. In general, I thought that everything was alright, but it could have been really good.
