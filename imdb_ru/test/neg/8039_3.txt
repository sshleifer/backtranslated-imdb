The Great War begins, and dad is a brave pilot who leaves to do the ugly business to put Jerry in his place. Mom plays the role of a nurse, so five children are evacuated to their trembling uncle in a country where a secret passage leads them to a naughty fairy and to the beginning of a magical adventure. <br /> <br /> Based on a book written by the best of a century ago, they no longer make similar stories. And there is a reason. Men fly on airplanes and copyrighted books; women change dressings and clean the house. The boys lead with their compasses and night holidays; girls do what they are told and play the violin badly. Thick children who wear specifications are nasty. All children speak with such clipped, smoothing vowel accents that are inhospitable and stiff, but which are cultivated by a certain economic class of the English. At the top of snobbery and longing for the Imperial Albion, there are holes in the plot that a five-year-old child will not tolerate. I mean literally - my son asked why the father disappeared before sunset, why the compass did not just fall out of his hand when he disappeared. The film, at least, is aimed exclusively at children, until Eddie Izzard's completely inappropriate and unfunny monologue (a waste of genuine comic talent) plays over the final captions. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, five percent of British schoolchildren who attend expensive public schools in the UK will find it all such a hoarse wheeze. For the remaining 95 percent of British families who no longer live in the 19th century, the good news is that Wall-E, Ratatouille, Wallace and Gromit all came out on DVD.
