I honestly expected more from this movie. This could be a problem. There was more than one time when the camera was still - never. On close-ups, the camera is shaking, objects are moving, and my head hurts. Cuts occur so often and so quickly that the viewer often wonders what just happened. (LOOK, SPOILER, WARNING) And at the end of the film, when you expect a happy ending after thinking so much about what is happening, they end up losing. For me, it was basically a terrible film, broken by an operator with ADHD and a lack of meaningful plot.
