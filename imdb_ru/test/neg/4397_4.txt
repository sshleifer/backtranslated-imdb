This film can best be described as a very long episode of a very bad sitcom. How many vaguely humorous misunderstandings can you cram into one movie? Notes are inappropriate, bags are switched, conversations are inappropriate, people get confused, situations are misinterpreted, and somewhere along the line people have to laugh at something. The authors really try their best to keep things going, which makes the dialogues feel really compelled. If someone in this film acted like a real person, it would all be decided in about two minutes, and everyone could return to his life, but he should continue in the same vein. From time to time, this film also tries to make youthful laughter, but all he does is remember you how funny American Pie was. The scene where the nerd says to a prostitute (whom he considers an exchange student) to “eat his sausage” goes on forever, not a single second of this is funny. I have to pay tribute to this film: because of the story of the stolen money, it’s not as boring as it could be. Here and there, too, there is laughter, but then, unfortunately, there is another misunderstanding of the character. In general, this film is too lame.
