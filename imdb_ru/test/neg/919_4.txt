This film is about a struggling actor trying to find satisfaction in life, especially love, for which he had not tasted for 5 years. <br /> <br /> This is basically a film about a person with very bad social skills and he says the wrong things all the time. The plot is hollow and contrived. The main character, James, is lonely, but this topic of loneliness has not been studied enough. This is more like an empty statement, from which other subplots flow. Sadness and disappointment after being abandoned is superficial. In the film, there is a lack of emotion. <br /> <br /> This is not a funny comedy. There are a few fun liners, but that's all. He lacks a happy and inspiring atmosphere to infect people with a happy mood. I do not find it ridiculous "I want someone to eat cheese."
