Strange things happen to Americans Will (Greg Evigan), Maura (Alexandra Paul) and their little daughter Aubrey (Briana Evigan, Greg's real daughter) when they move to a big, recently inherited home in Ireland. Crisp corpses are found in the basement, turkey is shedding blood, furniture is moving, and the ghosts of a dead child and a hoarse old lady appear to frighten a little girl. In the end, paranormal investigators are summoned to exorcise evil spirits, but Maura still becomes obsessed and haunts everyone around the meat woodsman. <br /> <br /> This film is full of clich√©s, but there is an outstanding work from Alexandra Paul. .. It is a pity that this does not apply to this film (and to any other that I can think of). She barely holds a calm face, and her excessive and hysterical screaming tantrums are a joy to contemplate. In any case, she is much more interesting to watch than anything else in this film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10
