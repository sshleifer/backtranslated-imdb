... now, please continue, because this is getting on my nerves. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the person behind the brilliant plays, such as “My personal Idaho state” and “To die for” (and other not very brilliant films, i.e. an unnecessary remake of “Psycho”) began the experimental phase with Jerry, which peaked with the thought-provoking Elephant. “The Last Days” had some interesting aspects, but were very uneven, while in his new film “Paranoid Park” there are also beautiful 15-year-olds walking around ... and nothing more. Some interesting references to Fellini (the soundtrack uses some excellent works by Nino Roth) and the elegant cinematography of the legendary Christopher Doyle (“In the mood for love”) are the highlights, but the film is too fussy, frightening and meaningless for its own doom. We had much better age stories, and “Paranoid Park” brings nothing new. I do not see anything artistic in seeing excessive images of Gabe Nevins in his underwear or shower. Or when Nevins and 13-year-old Taylor Momsen (a little girl from the movie “How the Grinch Stole Christmas”), who plays her cheerleading girlfriend, have sex for the first time just because she felt that they had to do it, and after as they finish, she calls her friend to say how amazing it was (and you can tell by Nevins how traumatic it was). Everyone knows that they start earlier and earlier, now films such as “Thirteen” and even “Elephant” (which show how much they lost consciousness as a whole, and not only in terms of sexuality), did it is better. Gus tries to be minimalistic and artistic, but the end result is just boring and uninteresting. His next project, “Milk,” a biopic about Harvey Milke with Sean Penn, will hopefully bring back the good old Gus, because, frankly, this obsession with minor children is almost ... creepy. 4.5 / 10.
