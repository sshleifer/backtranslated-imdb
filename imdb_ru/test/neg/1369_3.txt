I was a teenager when it first appeared in movie theaters, and I saw it in Japan. The plot of the film was not my cup of tea as a sophomore high school, but I went to see it for the 3-D process. He was delighted in the press, so even the service staff abroad heard about it, although he was never shown in the Post cinema. <br /> <br /> The film initiated the throwing of objects at the audience, which was taken to absurd levels with later 3-D films. <br /> <br /> I don’t know if this qualifies as a spoiler, but you were warned if this is so. In many films of the time, the actors often worked in front of the “rear projection screen”, where the backgrounds could be projected to give the impression that they were in a different environment, for example, in the jungle background, when the actors were actually on the sound stage. This works well on regular films, but when viewed in 3D, they look like a flat scene behind the actors. There were several scenes in the film where reverse projection was used, and this did not work in cinemas. Viewed in 3D, this will be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The film’s sole significance is historical because it was the first of its kind.
