This failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst films I've ever seen. Iâ€™m seriously thinking about buying a copy if I find at least one cheap stuff to drive away an unnecessary company. Honestly, this is bad. I see it as some kind of anti-personnel weapon. If you're the kind of person who just needs to see a train wreck to witness the massacre, then this film is a gem. In fairness, the character Kelsey Grammar has 1 line, which almost works, but not quite. In addition, everything in this film tends to be insightful, but does not meet the goal at about the distance between the Earth and the nearest pair of colliding galaxies. I can usually appreciate a book or film where the protagonist suffers from some existential anxiety, but the anxiety presented here is so incredible and excessive, and the film does not even consider the nonsense that it presents in any valuable way. If you are familiar with the term "word vomiting," then you can get some cinematic insight. Yes, and the narrative structure is poorly thought out, elaborate and amateurish. He failed both in style and in content. If you really hate someone, invite him to play a double role in this film and Terror of a Tiny City, complete with a Western film from the 1930s, and restrict it by opening your eyes in a Clockwork Orange style. But this probably violates certain provisions of the Geneva Conventions.
