I watched the first show of each episode just to see and what a waste of time. The girl from Emmerdale, she was fat, so yes, she should be a fat friend, but no one lost weight. <br /> <br /> As if Itv made a big mistake with this. <br /> <br /> Bad Girls is 100 times better. <br /> <br /> I feel that the whole performance was about big people who tried to lose weight, but never did, then they tried to have a storyline of love, oh my God, that a waste of time and airtime. This show did not repeat on ITV2 / 3/4, yes, that's how good it is. <br /> <br /> I would say that with this box you donâ€™t have to spend money. <br /> <br /> BEWARE
