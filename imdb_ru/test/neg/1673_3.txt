Like another reviewer, my wife bought this film as part of a family package of 20 films. I suppose you could say that it was a decent 1980 television film, but it is super predictable, and the action, with the exception of Robert Conrad, is completely untrue. In football scenes, there is nothing special, and it seems that they mainly play the role of filler of the film. The film is very outdated, but a decent remake can probably turn it into a good movie. However, is this really necessary? I mean, how many “films about a weak sports team working together for a big game with invincible guys” do we really need? This is probably a good movie for your younger children, if you find it in the trash, but it’s not enough for a sports fan.
