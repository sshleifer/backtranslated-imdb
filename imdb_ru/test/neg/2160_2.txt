Returning to the cold and terrible beginning of the 90s, the show called "Family Issues" went on the air and became a real classic. The trick was to buy a guide in standard family situations and their solutions and insert some attempts at sarcastic remarks into it, and you yourself are a fine little theft - wrong, parents are the right show. So everything worked out, so Bickley-Warren had a new ambitious plan: to do the same show again. <br /> <br /> But the difference is: “Family Affairs” had Urkel. “Step By Step” has a guy from those “Kickboxer” - sequels that no one has seen. He says such things as “dudette” and “Dane-meister”, and for some reason the public should not hate him. I mean seriously, "dude"? How can you even express it? <br /> <br /> The rest of the people were mostly white versions of the whole Winslow group, combined with a few more single or zero characters, such as a dumb guy (JT. Well, Eddie), a smart girl (Laura) and a pretty girl that spends days looking pretty (in theory). Character development was just awful in this show. Grover and Monster Cookies have more depth than the Lambert family. All milked their stereotypes for what they were worth. They were not worth much. <br /> <br /> Powered by a massive film of laughter and hooray, stolen from something funny, this show was broadcast for 7 years, which was humiliating for competitors. Although you should notice that this is the time when family comedy shows were pretty much all hits, everyone just ignored their crap because it was the 90s, yet another crap show didn't hurt.
