William Petersen (this C.S.I guy) has a small, uncredited role, but this is the best part of the film. His character is faced with a smart ass and tough, and it is amazing to see him in it. He has a range that allows him to play almost everything. After 5 minutes, it doesnâ€™t look very cool. This leaves you in the hope that his character will reappear in the film, but after 20 minutes you lose hope. The film itself is pretty bad. You should look at TMN or pick it up in the library, but not by much. Too much of this reminds you of L.A Confidential, except that when this film starts to get complicated in itself, this film is so free that it turns everywhere but where it should. 2 of 5 stars
