This film is very bad. In fact, the only reason I gave him 2, not 1, is that it made me laugh. Without giving away anything, in this film the head of a man really explodes. It was so pitiful, I laughed. I do not believe that the scene was supposed to be funny, but this is nonsense. Complete nonsense. The original Halloween is such a good movie, wish they had to go and make it stinky.
