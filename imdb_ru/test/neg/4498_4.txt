It should be remembered that the Hammer films, like many of the Gozilla films in the first series, were in fact aimed at children. Little Kenny and his companions live the dreams of children in the audience: they run and play with top secret things, while adults stand by and allow it; they are trapped with monsters, and even when the bad guys come in, they are never in any real danger. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the first Gammer film is a misconception because the child is PUNISHED and in danger, but the rest of the series is pure wish fulfillment. <br /> <br /> As one critic said, these are not unsuccessful adult films, but successful children's films.
