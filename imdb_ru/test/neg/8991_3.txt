The film begins in Latvia immediately after the First World War. As a history teacher, I knew that during that time multinational troops had occupied most of Russia. There was serious concern about the spread of Bolshevism, and the troops were there supposedly to protect the interests of their peoples. However, sometimes they performed missions or had armed conflicts with the communist army, as the countries involved really wanted the so-called “whites” to win. However, the whites were deeply divided - some wanted the king to return, some wanted the republic, and some wanted something in between. Because of these mixed targets and the lack of real obligations on the part of foreign armies, the entire expedition was doomed and left the USSR only after a year or two. However, what I did NOT know was that German troops were also involved. This surprised me, as they had just lost the First World War and were not in the best shape for such an expedition. <br /> <br /> This is the background for the film, but it's also about pro-communist rich people. Lady and her ill-fated love for her childhood friend, who is among the German troops. She rushes at him repeatedly, but in each case he gives her a fight. So she then sublimates these desires with various deeds. While none of this sex is so graphic, this and the main reason that this person is not interested, make this film quite an adult, and I would not show it to young viewers. <br /> <br /> Although the production for this film is interesting, the film as a whole is as gray and lifeless as all I have seen. I do not recommend this unless you are a surprisingly patient person or you really do not overestimate German films. I especially warn everyone who suffers from depression, as this will undoubtedly worsen it. The simple fact is that there are so many best German films that are waiting to be watched - such as MOSTLY MARTHA, DAS BOOT, MOTHER KUSTERS GOES HEAVEN, Wings of Desire or ALI, FEAR EAT THE SOUL (among others).
