Ewe, Discovery yells a zero budget. Names resembling my grandson were released along with iMovie. The DVD box gives the impression that you will be from the old 80s movie times. NO! Hardly any nudity from the movie that plays the role of Lords Tracy! This film really needed nudity. Instead, you get a lot of lord perks pointing through the shirt, however they seem to be activated by hot steam. Strange, but in my world the headlights turn on in the COLD. <br /> <br /> The plot is miserable, blind - just a joke, not funny. His antics are so forced and predictable. He stumbles over things, and you see how he prepares for a fall. He needs to work on his physical comedy. <br /> <br /> Most of Frostbeit’s nudity comes from the jacuzzi scene, which looks like it was taken a few months later and pasted in to find a distributor. And nudity is not worth it. <br /> <br /> NamoiBucks; it's just a matter of time when Starbucks sues for it. Not even funny. When Billy arrives in the city for the first time when they run into Namoi Bucks, he comments: “Wow, they are everywhere.” This suggests that this is a parody of Starbucks, but it is surprising that Nama is behind the counter of this location. Obviously, she loves coffee so much that the owner of this huge network decided to work in a tiny cold town. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film has is the Warren Miller footage of snowboarding. Yes, these are all Warren things, so if you want to see a great action, make a Warren Miller movie. Leave frostbite alone. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good about this movie. There is no reason to rent it or buy it, and if a friend offers you a free copy of the loan. Hit him and finish the friendship.
