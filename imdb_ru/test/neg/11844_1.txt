The defining scene in this film is when the fat man leaves, but the evil doctor just gives him one more duty - to check out the dinosaurs. Keep in mind that he no longer has this job, and therefore he is absolutely not paid for it. Keep in mind that this is a damned dinosaur, and the doctor he must trust is evil and does not love him. But he is still like, oh well. It just defined the stupidity in this film. Melissa Brassel alone proves that seriously anyone can get some breasts and be in the movies. I can ride a mountain bike between them, but apart from the fact that people in Paraguay are very good. Eric Roberts shows his worst results so far; there are no adjectives to describe how bored he is Everywhere. Corbin Bernsen saves what is to be saved, and you start rooting for him, but of course they must stick to the formula. And I wonder how your life sucks when you play, one of the army guys in this? How low is your acting career? The special effects are so embarrassing. Unfortunately, you expect that a sign with the inscription "Studio 3" falls into the frame. This is not even honest pulp, it's all taken from the "Carnosaur", which even sucked. And then I wonder why just someone is allowed to make a movie.
