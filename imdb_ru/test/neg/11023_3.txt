Since I bought a DVD, I've watched as much as out of duty to my wallet. <br /> <br /> The plot depicts Kirk Douglas as the successful first novelist who hired Leyrin Day as a secretary, falls in love and marries her. Complications begin. <br /> <br /> Douglas is usually considered to be a strong actor with heavy dramatic roles, sometimes a hero, sometimes a rat. He is not bad in this thoroughly comic piece. The problem is that this part is not particularly comic and nothing else. <br /> <br /> The plot rattles. A dozen "whimsical" characters come and go - most noticeably Keenan Wynn as a friend of Douglas, who makes only commentary comments. Thelma Ritter was better at this. <br /> <br /> Well, if the plot is weak, it could still be saved from the spark in the dialogue, but there is nothing to talk about. Some gags are stupid. Others do not clear this bar. That's what I think is a funny line. Douglas just hired Dey and wants to take her to a beach house and seduce her. Day is concerned and notes that she has never heard of a writer working in a beach house. Winn asks if she liked Douglas's previous book, Love Last Year. Yes, of course, she did. "Well, most of the" last year's love "was made in a beach house." Haha <br /> <br /> A good cast, including support, but a bad comedy. There were the best comedies on television.
