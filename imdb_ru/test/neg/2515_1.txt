How dare you? Adam Lowe, without apparent shame, puts his name on this fake tribute. This is not even a serious study or analysis or commentary of the work of the great Visconti. Yes, this is long and significant, yes, we have some wonderful clips from films that most people who are interested in this topic have already seen. But the thing that sounds the longest, leaving the longest lasting impression, is gossip. The last and loudest voice comes from a German third-class actor, ranting and delirium. The correctly named Mr. Low directed this, hoping, I think, to get better grades than his previous, more concrete, but deadly boring documentary about Kurosawa. I have news for you, Mr. Lowe and your colleagues. You missed a great opportunity, and, for example, I will not give you another.
