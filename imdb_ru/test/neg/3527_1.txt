May Nuts may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If Ed Wood was still alive, it would be the type of film he would make. To say that this film is bad would be an understatement of the century. But how bad is it really? Well, here are two levels of bad I pass; "It is so bad, it is good" or "it is so bad that God is terrible." This film falls into the last section. What a little unintended humor he has, does not compensate for the slow, difficult to understand, boring majority of the film. go to the countryside to get some rest and play hiking, there they met Ray, who will soon become Jim (I will explain later), whose tent is near our main couple. For most of the film, these two are seeing the sights on the beach, in the quarry, and other exciting places. In between these adventures, they talk endlessly about the environment, vegetarianism, collecting fossils, the duty of the right citizen and the right nutrition - everything I want to see in a comedy. They carry anyone who will listen to them. The dialogue is not only bad, but in some scenes the pace is so slow that sometimes I would like to dose. The scenes will last forever, and as soon as they begin to accumulate, and something has to happen, the scene ends. Halfway through the film, I thought to myself, “Nothing will happen in this, this is really a film about nothing.” <br /> <br /> Characters are annoying and constantly repeating things. At some point, I felt that the director was playing a cruel joke with his audience. The scene I refer to is the "Sing Along" scene. In it, our two boring Britons play some kind of music for us, in fact it was the same four and four lines again and again, again and again. The idea was to get Ray to sing along with them, but Ray knew, like us, that they were the worst songwriters known to man. This scene was tiring, by the fifth time, when the song was played, I began to doubt the existence of a merciful God. <br /> <br /> Words cannot describe the horror of this movie. The first thing that strikes you is the unintelligible British accents that most actors have. Remember the thick Scottish accents in Trainspotting? Times to 10. <br /> <br /> Toward the end, our couple, hugging trees, come to grips with some of Ray's friends, who absolutely do not respect the rules of camping. Our hero becomes so furious that between our hero and the head of the insurgent hell comes the climate battle. To settle the dispute, the two men come to grips with sticks. This is true bout with sticks! This is where involuntary humor begins. I laughed so hard at the incompetence of all of this, that I thought: "This can compensate for the remaining 80 minutes." After this historic battle, our hero runs behind the bushes to weep, and the other calls Ray, calling him Jim for an unknown reason. <br /> <br /> Fighting on sticks, weeping nature, loving 40-year-olds and the name of the character will change to 3/4 in the film, Ed Wood will be proud. <br /> <br /> Although I again had to endure the last 10 minutes, to sum up, ending with a long taking of a pig, Why? who the hell knows. At one point, we see a pig graze, and the next time credits begin to play a role on the screen. One of the worst endings of one of the worst films of all time.
