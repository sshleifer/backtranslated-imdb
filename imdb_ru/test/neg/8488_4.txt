In fact, Mask's Son really made me laugh a few times ... mostly because of the cartoon jokes that made Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner so funny. CGI is very impressive and is widely used in this film. Garfield, for example, is far from being on par with the CGI, but I would have given him the same voice. <br /> <br /> Everybody knows the story ... which was not so bad for the KIDS movie. Yes, this is a KIDS film ... and therefore should be treated as such. Jamie Kennedy is not very good at his role. His attempts to act "crazy" are not very good, but in general the game is bad. <br /> <br /> All the others are not so bad. <br /> <br /> Basically, my 2 and 5 year olds watched it all without complaint. At least I was able to put up with it. <br /> <br /> This movie can't be worse than ** shivering ** Class of 1999 <br /> <br /> 4/10 for CGI and laughs a little
