While it would be easy and accurate to understand why Reba basically refers to many “family-oriented sitcoms” in the sense in which they break away from other top sitcoms, the real truth is that the series repeats itself, full of stereotypes from more fun and more revolutionary shows, and the lead star is completely out of its element. Although I am sure that Mrs. McIntyre can sing, and she has a fan base that supports it, being in a comedy series, shooting Zingers and calling her the next Ball Lucille, far, far from reality. <br /> <br /> Reba she does not have the presence that is needed here to establish the fact that she is exposed to the role of a woman over which her entire family is focused. Yet after watching a few episodes there is no real connection with the character. I did not care for her adventures, because her whole character seems to be the Ministry of Interior. Reba McIntyre has no on-screen presence, and the show around her seems very short-sighted and revealing to most “family-oriented” programs: to push a comedy series full of stereotypes “stupid men / women do everything” that nobody likes afford a cable. <br /> <br /> Shows are a waste of time. The only good thing is that he, at least, has better performance than your standard PAX robbery .... just.
