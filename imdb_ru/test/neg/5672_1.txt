Yes, we all know about Dan Schneiderâ€™s strange passion for creating shows with young children, and iCarly is no exception. See how young girls shake their toes, stick their tongues out in front of the camera and wear scanty clothes and bikinis. Yes, it makes you wonder if these shows were for teens or for some older degenerative crowd. In any case, the show is not so good when compared to Dan Schneiders, and other shows, such as the far superior Amanda Show & Drake and Josh. <br /> <br /> A show about a brother and sister (Carly and Spencer) who live alone and have to live independently while their father is in the army and the mother is oddly absent from their lives. Carly has a sneaky girlfriend called Sam, and they are doing a very well prepared, award-winning web show called iCarly with her little school friend Freddie. Episodes talk about how they lived in and around the web show, as well as how they play at school. <br /> <br /> Carly Shay is a young, all-knowing person / businesswoman / producer played by Miranda Cosgrove, a young actress who relies on speaking very, very loudly and quickly to get her thoughts across and make strange faces . Her brother Spencer is a slightly sneaky, dull and eccentric artist, played by Jerry Traynor, who is trying hard to be like Jim Carrey, and whose comedy style seems to be aimed at a youth audience that would like this type of Joy Gladstone humor. In addition, there is Sam Puckett, an unattractive, sneaky little deceitful thief of a guy who needs a relationship adjustment, played by Jeanette McCardie, who clearly wears hair extensions, so you can see them disappear and then reappear from scene to scene. And finally, there is Freddie Benson, whose network has a boring cameraman and technical adviser, who is very passionate about Carly, but, obviously, is not going anywhere with her, played by Nathan Kress. <br /> <br /> Other minor characters come and go, such as Freddie's Mother, Carly's grandfather, annoying teachers and many of their annoying little school friends to complete the cast. Most of the comedy is wicked, like blowing up a Libert janitor, like a gag, throwing a ball of water at a teacher and knocking over a table of young girls scouts selling cookies. All adults become complete idiots, and children know everything, and some main characters have absolutely no morality. Lies, deception, theft and violence - all this is acceptable in this children's show, created and written by Dan Schneider. Yes ... this is a baby show! What else can young viewers ask for? Well, with Dan Schneider, we can expect young girls to dress in tight clothes and bikinis and do some weird things, such as sticking their tongues out in front of the camera and eating bananas. <br /> <br /> A show like this is what the young crowd likes, although, I think, no worse than any other junk that Nick has popped to his young crowd. There will always be fans for everything that can be seen on TV, at least a little better than most of the things Nick saw on this terrible Naked Brothers show.
