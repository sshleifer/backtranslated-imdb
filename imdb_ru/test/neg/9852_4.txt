The telecast went slowly, and the “unusual” characters sometimes irritated. It was only through the miracle of fast-forwarding that I was able to do this in the first 2 hours. <br /> <br /> This article indicates that this is some kind of comedy / mystery, but I have not seen much. <br /> <br /> If it really works after the first two hours, let me know about it, because I doubt that the others will look without recommendations. <br /> <br /> It is supposed to be without spoilers, so I will continue in a vague, non-spoiler fashion. I found the two main characters uninteresting and not sympathetic. I found myself asking, "Will a normal adult do this?" The man with the hedge trimmer looking out the window was annoyed, and when the male leader talked to him, he looked pitiful. Would a normal adult tolerate someone as annoying as he?
