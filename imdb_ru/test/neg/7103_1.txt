Sometimes a film cannot be easily classified. Such a film is “Tank Girl”, partly a cartoon, partly a comedy and an excerpt from the film. I’m sure there is an audience for Tank Girl somewhere, but it’s very small, perhaps punk comic readers. Most viewers will be looking for an early exit or live with a fast forward button. The only quality of redemption is the short bursts of humor “find me a microscope and a pair of tweezers,” but these tiny moments of comic relief are far outweighed by sofomorian sequences of actions. There is no character development, which is not surprising since the source is a comic book. Do yourself a favor and avoid, avoid, avoid - MERK
