Well, everyone is so excited about this movie that I hardly dare to add a negative review, but I just did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I first saw the film in Russian, so I will miss it. some kind of dialogue, but not much. <br /> <br /> First nice things. There are some fun moments (for example, Elvis imitator). The actors seem to be well cast, including the Russians. Ephraim is gorgeous, and Goldblum is very good. Which brings us to the flaws of this film. First of all. There is hardly any story, and we already know the end: Yeltsin is winning. So without drama or expectation. They tried to solve this problem with the help of the emerging relations between the actors mentioned above, but this story seems to evaporate. <br /> <br /> More importantly, the film does not represent reality. The Russians at the level of politics and society depicted in this film are not funny, but serious and dangerous. I am ready to believe that the arrival of several medical assistants from the states helped Yeltsin to win his campaign, but the real interesting questions to be answered are: who financed the campaign, what did they get in return, how did the opposition separate from showing some commercials? <br /> <br /> So, we have a film that is poorly based on reality (but in a strange way avoids everything that can make a film historically relevant or just a very good political thriller) without a plot or plot.
