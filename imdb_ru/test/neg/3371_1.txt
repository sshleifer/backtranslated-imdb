Well, we start at the psychiatrist's office, and, apparently, not very well. The main character of the first Jack Frost is in the office of psychiatrists, performing random rhymes about Jack Frost. Gee, okay, my brother shouts: "Turn it off!". Anyway, back to the shitty movie. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist has a speaker on, and he lets the secretary and her friends listen to this heroic mad sheriff. I guess he should be a hero from the first movie, but he doesn’t look like him at all! Yadda Yadda Yadda, they laugh at the poor sheriff, Yadda Yadda. Now some people are digging up an ice snowman, Yadda Yadda, now we are in the laboratory with some doctors ... I do not quite understand how this should do something, but they stick out antifreeze / Evil killer mutant snowman with needles, heating him, shocking by adding weird and strange chemicals to it, as many as nine yards. Nothing. Well, they give up and leave it in the aquarium. One of the doctors leaves his coffee on the lid of the tank. A janitor enters, cleans things, breaks up an aquarium, and coffee pours a tank that revives Jack. <br /> <br /> This is the power of mocha! Now he is somehow ... uh ... I believe the Bahamas ... but this is more like Hawaii ... But this cannot be Hawaii! Unless they spent their entire budget on plane tickets. Bach .. I will not spoil the rest of this rotten film, so you have to rent it and watch it yourself ... Uh ... I wouldn’t advise you to do it, although ... Shish ...
