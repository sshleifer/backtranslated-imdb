The family (a teenager, his mother and stepfather), tired of city life, decides to move to the mountains to get away from it all and start all over again. However, their idyll is destroyed by three brothers and their powerful father, who are not kind to newcomers in their patch. While throwing objects out the window and threatening the street is just the beginning, the youth decide to worsen the situation by having a relationship with the sister of the terrible trio. Since the law does not want to do anything with it, and the violence quickly escalates, the guy decides to take matters into his own hands. <br /> <br /> Turning wildly between fun and abomination, this is one of the strangest films about exploitation. ever did. At first, you can laugh at some of the hammy acting games and funny dialogue with the characters, especially the worn out bad guys. But then you get completely unnecessary scenes, for example, when a mother is raped, when her son is forced to watch, or the sister of a gangster who beats up her brothers and sisters for daring to sleep with our young hero. In fact, the whole look at women in the film, which looks like they are pathetic creatures who shout a lot and cannot protect themselves, is rather disgusting. But, of course, there is an obligatory nude scene in which this time the young lady plunges into the pool without a bra under a very thin T-shirt. Who cares about the sequence of the plot, when you have a few ready-made young stars, ready to throw off the toads from it? Right ?! <br /> <br /> The climax is a teenager who still could not sneeze without jumping, suddenly turning into a Rambo clone and knocking his opponents to the left, right and center to save his stepfather, who is held hostage by a gang. This is completely implausible, but hey, like everything else in this movie ... so at least you can't blame him for inconsistency. So instead of trying to find logic in a place where the word does not exist, look at the IMDb pages for Janet Lane Green, Del Berty, Stephen Hunter, Jonathan Crombie, etc. Pay attention to the pattern that occurs here? Their career has reached a dead end. What for? Sit through it and everything will become clear. Remember, children, if you want to succeed in this business, hire a decent agent and ALWAYS read the scenarios they offer you. Please .. 3/10
