Stupid comedy removes the embarrassed Ray Milland as a British officer in World War II, when he flees from the German borders and engages in battle with a hungry Gypsy man played by Marlene Dietrich. Slow, too long and erroneous: the leashes are too old for this type of juvenile food, although Marlene shines in her solo moments. It took three screenwriters to adapt the book of Yolanda Foldes to the screen, but this material must have already seemed dated 1947 - it smacks of something that Ernst Lubich could have received in 1939. chemistry together. ** from ****
