Hollywood film industry is the laziest in the world. It only takes one blow to flood the theaters with the same old shit, reinvented again and again. Take, for example, superheroes, for every X-man and Spider-Man there is Daredevil, Electra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remakes are even worse. It took only The Ring, which was completely flawless (mainly thanks to Mr. Gore Verbinski) to bring a ton of horror women like women, for example. Ring 2, Eye, Dark Water (which was good, but meaningless) and discontent. <br /> <br /> The first Grudge was not entirely bad. Most of the way was scary, which was to be expected. Plus, the conspiracy had some brains mixing stories. Grudge 2 is exactly the same as the previous one; it may be okay, but hey, what kind of boy is Men in Black II? Was it good to photocopy the whole script and just change the villain? For Grudge 2, the critic goes the same way. <br /> <br /> Burnt fears, bad behavior (except Amber Tamblyn) and cliches everywhere. Three stories occur in different places and times. Aubrey (Tamblyn) investigates what led to the death of her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar); Allison (Ariel Kebbel), who is led by colleagues to the house where the incident occurred, depicted in the first film; and finally, the American family, witness strange things happening in the next apartment. I would be glad to say (and I mean it) that everything is connected at the end, but you cannot rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is just tiresome and boring. there is chill everywhere, a girl is alone in the lockers, someone who should not enter the house, others who dig too deep. Meanwhile, ghosts continue to kill, kill, and kill, which seems even more deadly than the ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic. Hey, doesn't it look like another bad Japanese remake called Pulse? Yes, day by day it becomes easier vindictive ... against Hollywood crap.
