I really entered this film with some expectations, not because it seemed to me that the film sounded especially good, but because I was a fan of Italian films and with actors in which Franco Nero and Telly Savalas play the main role along with Oliver Twist I figured it should be interesting, at least. Well ... RedNeck does have one or two positive things, but for the most part; This is a boring, lifeless film that is as ridiculous as it is meaningless. The plot simply focuses on two criminals (Nero and Savalas), who kidnap a small child (Oliver). The bottom line is that the child understands that he will be more fun if he is accepted into the gang. Telly Savalas and Franco Nero are two actors who have repeatedly argued that they can make a film themselves, and they do have some memorable moments in this film - although in fact for all the wrong reasons. Savalas, in particular, gives a silly image of a “bad” criminal. The plot does not flow badly, but since nothing interesting happens, it is actually not a positive thing and does not save mediocrity from the film. In general, I can not recommend this film; he may appeal to some for his cult value, but he has done nothing for me.
