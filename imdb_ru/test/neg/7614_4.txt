I am still waiting for this dark mappet film, where we will not know how it ends from the very beginning. I think Linklater could experiment with animation. This time I did not reasonably expect this, but I really wanted to. <br /> <br /> Joan Cusack sucks. She went to the level of "especially for television", idly playing the game with a snooty cynic. The dolls were more vital than she. Disappointment. <br /> <br /> But then the whole movie was, Pepe's Bar. I loved him. He was the only one who ever made me laugh (while Goldberg, like God, made me gasp and swear). If we can't see dark dolls, then how about at least PG: 13 with a lot of controversial Pepe jokes and characters with a metal head Animals, egg-chuggin. saw that even boring christmas carol knocks this one out. Dolls should avoid this due to commercial vacations. <br /> <br /> 5/10
