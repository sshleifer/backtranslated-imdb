This film doesnâ€™t really hit the mark on most fronts. The accents are ridiculously weak, acting and comedy are weak at best. <br /> <br /> They have a great idea, it might be especially nice, but for the reasons mentioned above. <br /> <The writer seems to think by inserting the word f * ck into each sentence, this will make him more ridiculous, and the main character seems to be trying too hard. He, of course, is not the best of the Brix. <br /> <br /> Next time, at least get an cast that can keep the focus on the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Compare this with movies such as Business, Lock Stock and Snatch.
