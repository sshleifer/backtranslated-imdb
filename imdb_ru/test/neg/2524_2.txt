I read reviews on the Internet, praising this obscure walk as a combination of terrible horror, bizarre black comedy and frontier art house; Of course, there are elements of all three in the film, but are they in the service of such an extremely stupid premise (the name immediately gives up the game) ?? and amateur production to load ?? what is his long-term neglect due to lack of proper distribution ?? mostly until Cult Epics picked it up for a DVD release 30 years after its creation! ?? there was not a big loss for the movie or even the genre (s). The bed was obviously created in order to adapt the demonic passion to the woman; in any case, the dying person who used this poster and even painted it is trapped in the wall behind the canvas (!) and gives an intermittent commentary on the “action”. Several people (from teenagers on the run to hiding gangsters) are supplying food to the always hungry bed; The latest trio of girls in the menu ?? one of which, however, remembers her longtime mistress and, therefore, the bed seems to be afraid of her! Seeing various items ?? from cigars to fried chicken pieces ?? and people who are swallowed (the belly of the bed is depicted as a vat of honey-colored liquid) sometimes makes the film a bit funny (especially when the young man’s hands come down to their skeletal formation, which he seems to take too easily in his step!) terribly boring, so even after a short 77 minutes, the whole meaningless exercise seems tense and completely desperate.
