This is a bad attempt to unleash the old yarn "cons will turn into good", which we have seen many times before. It actually reminded me of the American TV series “Players”, although not so well. Omar Epps is absolutely unconvincing, as the tough man in the group, as well as Ribisi, who tries to be a funny guy and gets lost along the way. Nevertheless, the game with the Danes was decent, and from this performance it is clear why she played in “Terminator-4”. <br /> <br /> MOD Squad is a film that is in a gray zone between a serious thriller and a comedy. Sometimes he takes himself seriously, but sometimes he tries to be funny, but he fails. The film has a sort of unfinished feeling, as if stretched to 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> You will be disappointed.
