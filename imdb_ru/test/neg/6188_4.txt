Eric Idle, Robbie Coltrane, Janet Suzman - it was almost impossible to go wrong. Of course, this one has a few funny moments - the scene in the soul when Robbie Coltrane repeats the terrible line of the werewolf of Lon Cheney Junior “I can't help myself” is funny. But in the end, the plot, script and direction are as flat as a pancake, and tired, like a 90-year-old nun after 180 "Hail Mary." When I was a kid, Carry On films occupied this niche a little better, which is a really sad accusation for a film with such a promising cast.
