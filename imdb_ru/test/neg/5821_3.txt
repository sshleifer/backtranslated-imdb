I saw this film at our Crossroads Film Festival and was looking forward to it, because it was filmed in Mississippi and filmed with Karen Black. I was greatly disappointed by the awkward scenario that never worked, and the obvious lack of effort by the actors and the director to understand something about the culture they were trying to portray. How did Lee and Griffin become such deep friends in five minutes? Which of these two fucked a girl under a tree? It was unclear. And there seems to be some sort of southern accents law in Hollywood, and you rarely hear anything approaching the daily sounds of the south. Despite the horror, “it should be as they sound, just soften the“ p ”approach to the dialogue, so often the actors lose it altogether. Alex especially sounded like a New York street, tough during the "emotional" scenes, and no one sounded like Mississippi. The character of Walt Goggins was supposed to be from the city of Morgan, Louisiana, but still did not sound anything like a mixture of this city with the new Orleans and Kajuna accents. Another unpleasant moment seemed to be the author’s desire to make us all feel that every man should have homosexual impulses within him. Before I start the firestorm here and am accused of homophobia, I have enjoyed many films with gay love themes, in particular, "punks", "when love comes" and "monkeys". But this seemed to be a kind of masculine desire for all young people. Well, Tennessee Williams already reviewed this topic and did a lot better. So, I wonder if the Cohen brothers can get regional accents and culture in films shot in Minnesota and Mississippi, why can't anyone else? What a waste of my time.
