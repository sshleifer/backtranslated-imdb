I am so glad that he was not alive to see it. This film is debauchery of his work. I agree with another commentator - this film was a terrible disappointment. I would give him zero, but I would have to give him 1. <br /> <br /> The story was weak, and she reminded me of the days when I was a young teenager trying to write a film, then looking back and understanding how terrible it is. Bad actors, family and friends, and someone stupid enough to fund, that was how it was done. It's really amazing how you can pull the strings to do something. If this film was able to show it to the general public, then it places great hopes on other independent directors, whose talent is worth the one who fights! This film made me laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. By all accounts, this was not supposed to be a comedy. A scary movie - the best horror game - this movie just sucks.
