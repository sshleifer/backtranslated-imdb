This should be one of the worst films I've seen. The general idea of ​​ejecting a coronal mass that hits the planet Earth by the destruction of electromagnetic waves is fair enough, but where did they get that people can survive at a steady 155ºF? The acting was so terrible that I got the impression that the actors just grabbed a handful of people from Santa Monica Boulevard and threw them in front of the camera. Honestly, I saw fewer wooden speeches from my ironing board. Sorry, but this film was poor, poor, poor.
