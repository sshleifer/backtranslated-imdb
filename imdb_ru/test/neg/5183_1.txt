This film is just awful, the film lasted only an hour, and about 25 minutes of the film were just useless random snowboard clips that are not even related to the film. The storyline is completely “backward”, my 5-year-old cousin could probably write a better script. I do not understand how someone can finance the production of such a film ... terrible. This is definitely the crappy most horrible movie I've ever seen in my whole life. I think the casting director just picked up random kids from the street to play in this film. Directing, acting, producing and writing this film are all really bad. I feel bad because of people who spend money to finance this garbage. You couldn't pay me to watch this shit again.
