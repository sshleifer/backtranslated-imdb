Let me start by saying that there really is no reason to watch this movie. I only sat because I tried to kill for a while before going to work. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this is your typical Sophia "comedy", designed for teenage set. There is nothing remarkable in this, except the complete absurdity of this story, not to mention the fact that it has large enough openings for the passage of the Carnival cruise ship. Obviously, this should not be a realistic film, it should be funny. Unfortunately, in most cases this is also not the case. I have to admit that I laughed a few times, but mostly in “holy shit”, I can't believe how silly this is. <br /> <br /> If you never watch this movie, you won't miss anything.
