This episode has just been released in the UK. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. The heavy touch of humor was rash, childish and distracted from what might be a pretty good plot. I can not believe that Jerry Bruckheimer allowed this episode. I saw every previous episode of this show, and even the episode in which Jack played himself, was far ahead of that episode. The lesbian kiss was a pitiful sensation. <br /> <br /> In the previous episode there was no continuity. There was nothing in the storyline that would investigate Martinâ€™s dangerous behavior or possible drug addiction. Similarly, there was nothing explicitly written about Jack's burgeoning relationship with Ann. Usually "Without a trace" copes well with such continuity. <br /> <br /> The next episode should be significantly improved.
