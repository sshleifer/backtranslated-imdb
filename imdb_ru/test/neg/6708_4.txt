This movie starts with this creepy song that made me wince, like the song used in "Nightmare on Elmstreet"! This immediately sets the mood! The sequence also shows what to expect! We are aware that the ghost is present! The mystery associated with this ghost is what keeps this film together! But the plot structure is so complex that it is hard to understand! The plot ideas are quite interesting! Only how it is told to us is too abstract! I understand that the director believed that he should have kept the secret as long as possible! The problem is that when certain things are revealed, you will never get a satisfactory explanation! The motives of important characters are not taken into account, and some questions raised in the film are not answered at all! As we do not study characters enough, it becomes difficult to take care of them! And as a result you will lose interest! Only some fears and perversions will save this film from total failure! The twist is interesting, but not a real shocker! An experienced viewer will see it! Some reviewers complain that this film is too much like The Ring and is not original at all! Well, it is true that some effects and fears are borrowed from this film! But there is a major difference! Waiting in the "Ring" was mainly based on this turn, when the viewer finds out how characters are killed !! In “Ryeong” (as “Ringu”), a twist is used as a creepy effect that accompanies another crazy twist! “Ryeong” largely depends on a complex structured plot and a turn that does not contain enough scares to keep your interest! Simply put: this is not a scary movie!
