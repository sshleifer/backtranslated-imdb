For all the actors and film crews who worked on this film case, another payday in Los Angeles. For any audience hoping for a fair return for the price of admission, a huge waste of time and money. The saddest aspect of this ugly exercise (for me) is that we are watching the extremely talented actor Pacino, who apparently plays a parody of himself. This is what remains with me as a complete mystery. I can fully understand the need of people in the film industry to work and thus earn a living. What I cannot understand is the talent of the artist Al Pacino, who prostitutes and confuses himself with this level of meaningless trash. I hope he will choose more profitable projects in the future ... and for the value, he will save your time and hard earned money. Miss it !! Let's send Hollywood and Alu a message.
