There is so much bad in this movie. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges has a strange accent. <br /> <br /> Rita is able to crack a password. <br /> <br /> The entire script <br /> <br /> The ending is especially the last scene, when two coffee is served on the table for Jeff, Rita and the publisher. J & R laugh and say, "We don't drink coffee anymore." Well, why did they order something ??? They obviously did. If they had not done this, and the waiter brought each coffee by default, there would be three coffee. <br /> <br /> Total Tosh.
