My tolerance for the shocking direction was overwhelmed by some of the options in this, perhaps really good, waste of time. <br /> <br /> When the “romantic” intervals were natural, to get me out of the story and in "How and why did the filmmaker do / what /?" mode, you must understand that there is something missing; I think restraint and taste. <br /> <br /> Brian Brown - a capable, sensitive actor - usually. I think he didn’t like the project or the people, and it shows. I don't remember anything the other guy was doing. I can not even imagine his face. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is not necessary to have fun; Some vignettes and turns are funny and even brilliant. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie (purchase for $ 2.00 at the video rental site) contrary to the advice of the screenwriter; I understand that he was tempted to remove his name from the credits. I bet it's a matter of pride.
