I finally managed to sit down through the whole episode of this show. I was very, very tired. Clear. I used to always have to turn it off because I thought it was so bad. Watching the full episode convinces me that this is really so bad. I could not even tell you what happened, but I clearly remember how I did not laugh. For people who think that this is a new “Everyone in the Family” or “Married to Children” ... Have you ever watched these shows? They are well written and well acted, and most importantly, funny! This show is not funny. You may think so, if this is the first sitcom you have ever seen. I can't see who else will be. I repeat all previous feelings about arrested development, etc. It may be my fault that I am disappointed with television and do not watch it, which allows stupid people to dictate what actually stays on air.
