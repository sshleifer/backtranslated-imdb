This film is strange even for a silent film. In fact, it follows the adventures of an engineer in post-revolutionary Russia who dreams of traveling to Mars. In this film, it seems that the producers KNOW that the Communists have really spoiled the country, but also seem to want it to look like they have achieved something good. <br /> <br /> Then we get to the "Martian" scene, where everyone on Mars wears blunt hats. They have a revolution after being inspired by Earth People, but quickly surrendered to the Queen, who takes their side. Except that this is all a dream, or it is. (And considering that the Russian revolution ultimately led to the Stalinist dictatorship, it makes you wonder if it was all an allegory.) <br /> <br /> Now I saw GOOD Russian cinema. For example, Eisenstein's battleship Potemkin is a good movie. This is just stupid.
