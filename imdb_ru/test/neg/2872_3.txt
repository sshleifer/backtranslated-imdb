this film was really bad. he has the quality that many indie films have: moments of humor filled with long spaces that are completely boring. Any diehard Margera fan prolly likes this film, but then again he is probably the only person to see it. someone gave me this film to watch, knowing that I was a Jackass fan and was a fan of viva la bam, until the script of this show became weak. To explain why this film does not work, I must simply say that the premise itself is played out. <br /> <br /> The guy who is with a terrible girl for him. And pretty much the whole movie, in which this guy whines Ryan Dunn, and Bam Magera jumps like a funny naughty kid. Dikamillo's performance is strange at best. This is a humorous little nonspecific Canadian French accent, which largely reflects his performance (mostly fun for 5 minutes, and then it sounds like, “Well, you already pretend that you are already quite foreign”) <br /> <br / > Maybe it is? would work if they went for a parody, but all they could do was make a film with an IQ of zero. I love toilet humor just like the next guy, but it's not even low, it's just silly. It's like the only humor you can get from this film, completely inside, and the audience, even those who know Magera and the company, remain outside the joke. <br /> <br /> Next time, when Mager is handed a bag full of money, let's hope he doesn't blow it up on some lousy pet project
