This should have been set in the “Belt of the Bible” of Northern Ireland. Well, as someone who grew up there and was a child in the era depicted in the film, it just didn’t sound true! Accents were everywhere - all except Antrim / Derry. The church is not like any I have ever seen. “The Church of God” is a Pentecostal denomination, but the one in the film, of course, was not Pentecostal! At first, an elderly minister was dressed in the mantle of an Irish (Anglican) church, and none of them would call themselves the "church of God." The minister was often referred to as the “Reverend” - they can do it in some parts of the world, but I never heard it when I lived in the area. The ministers were called “Mister ......” <br /> <br /> This film was very poorly researched and filmed - quite typical of Irish cinema - annoying! The film may have a great plot, but if it doesn't look authentic, it's rubbish.
