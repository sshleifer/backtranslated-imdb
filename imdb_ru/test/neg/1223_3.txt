I watched all three segments and was so disappointed in the storyline. Zahn spends so much time imitating Duval that he no longer does anything on the show. And Tommy Lee Jones will never be as weak as a young man, incredible yes, but never weak. We never see how or why they return to the Lonely Pigeon ... which is a dirty hole in the original ... why they leave Austin altogether, where they are heroes ... for not doing anything during the whole movie. .. By the end of the film I was rooting for “Blue Duck”, and he was completely mistaken. There is no warning about how many segments there are ... it just ends. This mini-series could be “someone” ... tragic. Looks like it was sent by Parrot and Jag
