Please review all 3 episodes and don’t watch this movie, the trailer is completely misleading, and the 3 weakest characters in the series turn a poorly thought out 25-minute TV episode into the most painful 2 hours of my life, a really horrible movie. there are a few minutes in it and Edward, Mickey has 1 line, and her sponge just exhausts the same old weary puns, and Mrs Briess’s accent changes only 5 times in a film of tons of poorly played extras, and indeed some laughs that they, it seems to be recharging for 2 hours, I honestly feel that this series was completely destroyed by this terrible piece of shit .......... Batman and Robin are all forgiven
