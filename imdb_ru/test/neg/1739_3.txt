Well, let me start by saying that this is not a horrible movie. This is just not good. I recall one poster that said that acting was not a walk, but just a nuance. No, I saw the nuances of Japanese and Asian acting. Sorry, you're wrong. This is a camp. <br /> <br /> Characters are not at all sympathetic, death is completely random and completely meaningless. The letter is bad. I'm fine with the suspended unbelief, I'm fine with the fact that not everything was passed on to me in terms of plot. But this movie has no plot. One reviewer stated: "This film takes place in a small town where people go crazy over whirlwinds and spirals." This is not an advertisement, this is the whole bloody movie. Congratulations, I just saved you for almost an hour and a half. There is nothing else. Without character development, without plot development, without explanation, without permission. And even the lack of permission is “Acceptable in the J-Horror Sphere”. Just nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the musical score was made by someone who clearly did not watch the film at the time, because it is random enough to cause a whip. Cognitive dissonance is one thing, and if done well it can be brilliant (see “Dark Water”), but here everything looks as if the score was designed to go along with another film. <br /> <br /> The best example is yes, it’s as if the Japanese remade the Evil Dead without any tricky bits or good game. It just falls. This is J-horror without horror.
