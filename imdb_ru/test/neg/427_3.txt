The American werewolf in London had some funny roles, but this one is not so good. Computer werewolves are just awful: the prospect is not at all like, itâ€™s like seeing them through a distorting mirror. An American guy says to a Parisian girl: "Is there a cafe here?" Instead of just leaving everything as it is, they should take a breath and answer the girl: "This is Paris."
