I was delighted with the girlish glee when I found out about this film shortly after seeing Spirits Within. <br /> <br /> After several years of waiting, they gave a November 2005 release date. Well, November has come. And set off. Following December. Oh, look, today, January 31, 2006. There is no release in the USA yet. <br /> <br /> Oh, I'm so glad that I had a friend with a subtitle copy with a bootleg. ; D <br /> <br /> Well, CG was great. Not as good as expected, but almost perfect. I, however, shrank from the unnatural movements that children made throughout the film. I thought we had already passed this. In addition, I did not really care about the anime look on their faces. I got the impression that they were shooting for a realistic look at the film, and yet most of the characters have more than normal eyes, especially girls. Although they had a personality, I will give it to them. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I am not a big fan of anime, I must say that I was impressed with the wild scenes of the struggle. They were wonderfully animated and made me hang on the edge of my chair. <br /> <br /> During the first two. <br /> <br /> And this is where Advent Children's biggest drawback is. Basically, it's just a bunch of hyper-styled battle scenes. <br /> <br /> The script of epic proportions FF7 promised over the years. Instead, they gave us a nice piece of computer graphics with a subtle plot to justify the fact that it lasts only two hours. <br /> <br /> Where Final Fantasy is famous for its tangled stories, this film falls short. You really won't recognize the characters. The only way to understand what happened in the movie would be if you were playing a game. We barely had time to see them before they fought with any existing threat. <br /> <br /> It is even more harmful for the fans that the awful cameos that most FF7 characters gave. They were nothing more than Cloud: “I will call if I need you, but I probably won’t,” I will support the singers. And, to add harm, each character individually threw a Cloud higher and higher. This small part was so tender that I almost turned it off. I would have been much more impressed if he had just jumped on his own, ricocheting off the walls to rise higher. <br /> <br /> It hurt even more when they reduced the Turk to a level lower than -Just comic relief. It was good for the game, but it's a movie. People do not behave like cartoon characters in a fierce battle. They took their dignity: / <br /> <br /> And, spoiler (yes, most of you probably already know). Who remembers how Darth Maul was spun in SW: Episode 1? Yes, now, imagine it, but with Sephiroth. Like this. He had about 5 minutes of screen time. Perhaps it. End spoiler: P <br /> <br /> If this film is made for fans, then the path to the Square. If this indicates which direction you are choosing the FF series, I doubt that you will see much of my money. I played your games for a wonderful story and great characters. <br /> <br /> You had a chance to do something epic. Something truly beautiful, a masterpiece that challenges all Disney CG films. <br /> <br /> Instead, you gave us a cute piece of flesh, and there was hardly anything under it to hold it together. Way. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure that if the rest of the fans stop for a moment and try to just pay attention to everything except computer graphics, they will understand what I'm talking about. Well, I would rate it 5/10, but, thinking about it, correcting it, I put 3/10, because they could do better. They did better. And this is just sad. <br /> <br /> If they are going to redo something, FFVII, they need to do it first.
