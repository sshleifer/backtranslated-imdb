I watched the 219-minute version and I must say that dollar for dollar is probably one of the worst films ever. Now I am NOT saying that this is the worst movie ever - but if you look at the price and how much the average person likes it, this is a very, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that the biggest factor making this bad film is the writer / director Michael Cimino. It is rare to blame one person. If he had not been so indulgent towards himself, such a bad film could have been easily made in about 90 minutes - saving the studio millions! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a completely unnecessary prologue, which must be installed at Harvard. The scene is huge, but completely out of context. You do not know exactly what is happening, and you do not know why students (in particular, John Hurt) behave so rudely. It is very difficult for me to imagine that the beginning happened in 1870, and it looks like it looks like 1970. It's half an hour when you have no idea what is going on, who the characters are or their motives. <br /> <br /> The next scene is 20 years later. It is inexplicable that two Harvard graduates (Hurt and Chris Christofferson) are in Wyoming. So, they went to the best school in America, and now one of them is just a lawyer who is somewhere in the middle, and the other ... well, what is John Hurt in the film?!?! He just appears here and there, and it seems that he is either a jerk (the prologue), or a pitiful and pointless drunk who hangs out with the murderers - although he is clearly against them! His whole character did not make sense. They never explained why he was a British living in the wilderness (it was impossible to hide his accent), why he bothered to come along with a mercenary army, IF he was so against their evil plan, or why he risked his life for the sake of which he did not believe at all. As for Christopherson, his excellent game and clearer character made his character more believable, although it made no sense to force him to move to Wyoming and risk his life for a prostitute. <br /> <br /> This raises the worst aspect of HEAVEN'S GATES. While the scenes are TOO LONG and need pruning, the worst part of the film is that the characters were like cardboard. John Hurt (a wonderful actor who has nothing to do in the film), Jeff Bridges and many other celebrities, but you don't know why. In fact, except for Christopherson, Isabel Huppert (as golden-hearted prostitutes are quite cliches) and, perhaps, Christopher Walken, EVERYTHING is absolutely one-dimensional. It’s hard to imagine a movie this time when you don’t know or understand the characters. <br /> <br /> Much of the film also seems anachronistic. Who would have thought that a giant ice rink would be built in the mid-90s? I am sure that it would be very, very difficult to just get the main reserves in this region in the West - and yet we must assume that trains filled with rollerblades and lumber arrived instead of FOOD. Perhaps, if they had not spent billions of dollars on building and visiting the skating rink on rollers, farmers could afford to BUY food and avoid this war because of the robbed cattle !!! And what about the guy on the roller with the violin? What does this have to do with the land war? <br /> <br /> The most obvious problem you’ve faced is that this is a movie in which very, very little happens until the end of the battle at the end of the movie. There are many scenes of dirt and flat non-existence. So many voids that at the time of the battle many viewers had already left the film or became so hostile to the film that it was inevitable that nothing could save the film. <br /> <br /> As for the final battle, this was done quite well, but there were problems. First, this little prairie skirmish lasted longer than the invasion of D-Day! Secondly, although the details of the actual events of the so-called “Johnson War” are a bit sketchy, we know that the characters played by Huppert and Christopherson were never there because they were both hanged BEFORE the battle. Thirdly, I can’t believe that Cimino actually killed animals throughout the entire film - especially during the final battle. Despite the fact that I am far from being hysterical about animal rights, his need to use animal guts and actually kill some horses is a low point in cinematographic history. Watching and knowing that some horses died to achieve the “vision” of Cimino in the film is very sad. <br /> <br /> Finally, after the big battle, we have an epilogue. Although it is blessedly short, it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague. We see Christofferson on a fancy yacht, so we can assume that he finally uses this education at Harvard to work for himself. We also see the woman Chris looked at a couple of times during the prologue. Most importantly, nothing is said, and you have no idea what the final result is. I read about it myself and found that the film often contains incorrect facts. <br /> <br /> In general, to say that the film was long and needed more editing was the same as saying that the Second World War was a “minor anger”. Well, I, of course, saw a lot worse, but if you take into account the cost of production, I really think that this may just be one of the worst films in history. <br /> <br /> Finally, when I’m warning parents about this sheer nudity. However, since no child CAN watch this film (even with the promise of sex), the warning is not necessary.
