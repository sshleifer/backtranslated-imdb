When a rocket from a government experiment on the effects of cosmic rays on animals falls in a small Texan town, people begin to die. The county sheriff is trying to investigate, but other government officials interfere with him. It turns out that at liberty to kill teenagers in the forest there is a mutant space gorilla. <br /> <br /> I like low-budget science fiction films and horror movies. I like monster movies. So I thought that there would be a good chance that I would like this movie. Unfortunately, I did not. <br /> <br /> I am not against a bad game, a banal dialogue, cruel music or giant holes in the plot that exist in this film. There are many films that have the same problems that I encountered and looked so bad that this is a good way. <br /> <br /> But the differences of others from this type and Night Fright are that Night Fright just has a terrible rhythm. And this is delayed because of this. There are scenes that just go on and nothing happens - the search for clues in the woods is just people walking in the woods for a long time; There are several seemingly endless dancing teenagers at a party in the forest ... but nothing interesting happens. If these scenes were shorter, the film might not be so boring (although I donâ€™t think that just cutting these scenes would save this one). <br /> <br /> I gave this movie three views to make sure that I gave him a chance before slamming into this review. Unfortunately, it was getting worse by the hour. The fourth will not be.
