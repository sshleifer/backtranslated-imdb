Well, number one - this “movie” is a version of a 70s crappy show that no one remembers! Number two - as soon as the movie began, I was confused, as if I had passed half the movie! There was no plot! It was very annoying! Horrible wardrobe! Call me crazy, but I just can not believe that the small skinny Omar Epps can pursue a large adult without a weapon and scare him before talking! This is an absurd "conspiracy." Sorry, but for me, kids these days can't even put on pants one leg at a time, let alone catch "evil, clandestine killers." I left the theater and demanded and returned my money! I do not recommend this movie to anyone over 12 years old!
