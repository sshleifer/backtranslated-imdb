If at all possible, try to view all five Mummy films of Universal in order, and not so much in terms of continuity between films, but in their apparent absence. Of course, it goes without saying that the original classic of Boris Karloff “The Mummy” should not even be mentioned in the same breath with the so-called “sequels”, which seem obscene or cult. <br /> <br /> This time it turned out that the mummified remains of Princess Ananka had gone to the United States. And once again, when your eyes are deceiving you, Haris Mummy really did not die a second time in the “Tomb of the Mummy”, but is alive and looking for her lost love, Princess Ananke, with the help of the rhetorical nine leaves of the tans. brewed during a full moon cycle. To complete the mythology, Haris needs a caretaker, skillfully filled with emaciated John Carradine in the role of Yusef Bey, who is entrusted with the task of Andhoheb George Zucco, the high priest Arkan. <br /> <br /> Haris and Ananka must be returned to their final resting place on the hills of Arkan in Egypt. But, as we have already seen, the assignment of the duty of the high priest is a sure bet of failure when the character Carradine falls in love with the reincarnation of Ananke, Amina Monsuri (Ramsey Ames). It is shocking when Yusef Bey and the tied up software get into a fight over the gorgeous Amina. <br /> <br /> Come and play with me in this - and in the "Tomb", and in the "Curse", Lon Cheney portrays Mummy with his limp right hand, helplessly folded across his chest. When he meets Amina fainted, he raises her in both hands without problems; as soon as he lowers her, his right hand returns to its ugly position. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is most noticeable - the monster gets the girl! But this is a short victory, as the Mummy and his abducted bride surrender to the marshy grave, the ancient Egyptian curse was fulfilled: "The fate of those who defy the will of the ancient gods will be a cruel and violent death."
