For a while I was fascinated by shows such as Ghostbusters and Truth of Destination, and the like, although I thought they were full of shit, I found them interesting and interesting, and that is why we watch entertainment television. It's funny to turn off your brain and believe that every shadow that fell on the camera is not just some kind of shadow, but some kind of tormenting spirit of some kind of insane prisoner or something like that, if later you can return to real world. <br /> <br /> However, as they say, in order to enjoy the paranormal state, you need more than just turning off your brain, requiring you to regularly consume lead in large doses during your childhood, then suffer from repeated injuries head, and then began painfully painted in adolescence. Then you need to get drunk and watch. <br /> <br /> The paranormal state is outside of pseudoscience (which I can possess with some degree of critical thinking), which you find on Ghostbusters (which I still find to be quite an interesting and interesting program), this is a pseudo ... everything. <br /> <br /> The show follows the adventures of a group of students from the University of Pennsylvania (not to be confused with the University of Pennsylvania) led by Ryan Buell when they pledge to cast out demons and spirits using ceremonies from any religion that seems the most dramatic at the time (from Catholic spells perpetrated by college students, to Wiccan spells cast by socially awkward goths, to the rituals of purification of Native Americans. credit, they are performed by Native Americans). If you believe in Wicca, a Catholic or an adherent of the traditional religions of Native Americans, I think you would like to have their cleansing rituals performed by someone who ... is not a perverted college student with some free time. I do not remember the scene of the exorcist, when the priests threw up their hands and said: “It is useless! Call the club after school from state college. This is too much for us. They probably read Wikipedia, ”an article on exorcism. "The show frankly insults the viewer's intelligence. In the first episode of the series, Ryan talks about PRS (Paranormal Research Society), saying that when he came to Penn State (note, you don’t see a show where the presenter says the same thing, but instead Penn State he says: "When I came to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology" or "After I got a degree in theoretical physics ..."), he found other people with a similar interest in the paranormal. He says that they are sometimes "warriors." I remember when I was pretending that I was a warrior, and I was fighting ghosts. I was six. Then the emotionless Ryan brings out the bright and unpleasant Chip Coffey, who pretends to be in trance and becomes obsessed with cursing at the cast. Awesome. I thought that people had learned something about how absurd the idea of ​​psychics and mediums was after the release of Crossroads. The show takes itself too seriously, because this small group of losers in society pretends to fight some ancient, cosmic evil. Production values ​​are low, the stories are boring, and, unlike Ghostbusters, who sometimes catch something anomalous (though probably explainable, but nonetheless interesting) on ​​their equipment, PS requires you to believe that noises and the squeaks they hear are evidence of demons, ghouls, and possibly gnomes. The only thing that is scary about this show is that there are people who take him seriously. The only paranormal thing about this is that people in it can do each episode, while maintaining a straight face. <br /> <br /> Call me exhausted, but I feel that the great secrets of the universe and the afterlife are too great to be solved in a half-hour TV show by an undergraduate from a public school. <br /> <br /> For all this, I strongly recommend everyone to watch this show at least once, if not for others. the reason than the apparent entertainment gained from watching a really terrible movie or TV show. Or you can make a game out of it. I think the second would be preferable.
