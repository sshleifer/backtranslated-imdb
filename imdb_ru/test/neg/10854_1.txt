Well, I was at a British university, I actually went to that one in this film, and there was nothing like that. This is a terrible, poorly made and filmed movie. Worst of all, it could be really good if they spent more than 12 pounds on him, in fact, if he really wanted to represent real British students, he had to act like one and take a loan of 15 thousand pounds. It says nothing about the life of Uni, where there were dives in the bushes, tea drinking until 4 in the morning, endless chats about group dynamics ??? Where was the variety and fun? Maybe I’m just romantic, but I don’t remember that “The Week of Freshness” was so terrible, and I just feel that way. And in the end the question still remains ... a bed or a wardrobe?
