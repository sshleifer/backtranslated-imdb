This early film directed by Bob Clarke ("Porky", "Black Christmas", "Christmas Story") did not really pump up my nasty things, as I expected. In fact, it just annoyed me. This is a theater troupe that floats to a burial island consisting of dead criminals, where they plan to conjure some evil forces and resurrect several corpses ... The leader of their group, a vain black magic enthusiast and perhaps a homosexual, is trying to call Satan to reanimation an exhumed body that fails, so they take the corpse to the nearby house of an abandoned caretaker and play with it ... Nothing interesting happens until the last fifteen minutes or so, when the undead finally appear from their grave and follow the defiler. The effects of make-up are fine, blood is VERY minimal (PG rating), and extremely annoying characters are focused on the path to the many that really get on my nerves. I suppose that having a group of horrible actors bickering for an hour should have been equal to some “comedy” status, but I didn’t find any humor in it. The whole concept is ridiculous - how these children are ready to dig and monkeys with a dead body as much as they did. The characters are stereotypical and soft, and the film is just boring ... Do not waste your time on this ...
