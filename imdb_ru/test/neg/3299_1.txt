I watched the first episode of “War at Home” because I thought it was worth replacing “Arrested Development,” guy, if I'm disappointed. It should be clear to everyone that this show was clearly broken from "Based on a Lifetime", "Titus" and "Married ... with Children", since they all are similar in plot and general mood. The so-called "raisins" are all repeated and formal, moreover, these "raisins" are not even funny, in my opinion, they are rather rough and coarse. The protagonist, Dave Gold, acts like a white thug who thinks he's funny and cool, but he doesn't. (Even Hillary (daughter of Dave) said so in the episode "Gaza Strip"). <br /> <br /> In the “Dreambreaker” episode, Hillary wanted to be a singer {but actually it was pretty bad}, Dave and Vicki then happily decided to crush her dreams by telling her that she was sucking. After that, she wanted to become a child psychologist and planned to go to Harvard, after Dave and Vicki said this and left the room, they both started mindlessly mocking her. In addition, in the first episode, Dave said about Hillary’s {black} guy: “Does she really think we will let her go out with this guy?” I would prefer to drink my own urine, ”this line has the dumbest feature in the history of television. And Dave constantly laughs at Larry (his son) when he breaks the fourth wall, because he thinks he is gay and a geek. Also, let's not forget that he also made fun of Larry’s (fat) girlfriend. Dave is a father, he must protect his son, no matter what. War at Home is undoubtedly the worst show for the whole family. This clearly explains why the show should be canceled, as it spreads racism and a homophobic agenda. It’s like the show wants to be funny, because it always inserts this silly track of laughter every time someone says something, but all the lines are somewhat forced, idiotic and pathetic young. <br /> <br /> Another reason the series is terrible, the actor, Mike Rappaport and Kyle Sullivan are terrible, terrible actors. Rappaport should always move his hands when he is in front of the camera, he not only does it on this show, but he also did it during his work with Boston Public. Sullivan speaks and acts as a kind of robot every time he acts (he also did this in Malcolm in the Middle). <br /> <br /> So, to finish it all, you have your own reasons that Wrong with this show 1. It’s unoriginal 2. The acting is crap 3. It’s not even funny 4. All the jokes are the same 5. It has a lousy script 6. Characters are pitiful and unattractive 7. Dad - Archie Bunker robbery <br /> <br /> FOX has to take this garbage out of thin air because everything is better than that.
