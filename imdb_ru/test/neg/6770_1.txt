I filmed this at the True / False Film Festival in Columbia, Missouri, and I was very disappointed. I was expecting a cool documentary about protest and revitalization around the NRC, but I got a largely erroneous, poorly acting, fictional, conspiratorial story in which they are poorly intertwined. I heard about her neo-documentary technique “mixing both the True and the False”, but I expected more according to a fictional plot line designed to better personify and create a sense of unity between the real interviews, but it was rather the plot of a terrible television movie created for conspiracy theories. <br /> <br /> On the whole, the game is terrible, with the exception of Rossario, which is not surprising, given that the filmmaker said that most of the main characters did not play the training, his excuse is that he wanted them to be real. This is a hint that real people cannot act, but actors can usually act real. <br /> <br /> It would not be so offensive if it weren’t obvious how much he wanted to promote this extremely radical conspiracy theory on us throughout the film, especially hysterical, when we get the scene where the director is shot and begins to rant about ridiculously stupid theories and secret programs. The film also copes with the ridiculous stereotyping of each role, which is why he tries so hard to romanticize these street activists and mark the big “good” or “evil” on each character. <br /> <br /> Skip this, maybe find yourself a good real documentary /
