You might think that a film about incestuous sisters who ultimately kill their employer could not be terrible, but then you would be mistaken. <br /> <br /> There is no plot. No character development. No redeeming visual beauty. <br /> <br /> This film is a waste of time. A study of how relations between the sisters are formed is zero, their sexuality is nothing but a grotesque, class relations are embellished, and the employer is a silly caricature. <br /> <br /> Heavy silence and vintage clothes are not equal to the depth of meaning.
