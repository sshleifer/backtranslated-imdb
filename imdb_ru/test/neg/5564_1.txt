I hate this movie !!!!!! I have never seen such a complete, full garbage in my life !!! I live in France, so it turned out that I was in the forefront to watch this horrible movie. At first it was cool, sort of like something about a damned forest that breaks people. Unfortunately, it turned out that it was something completely different: a good start with a girl who meets a guy and all that sort of stuff, then the girl receives threatening messages in the form of ravens trapped in her closet (funny), from this bit and on, the film begins to descend very quickly from a large number of desperate unrest in the process. The film ends with a sacrificial abundance of Druids and ancient ugly, smelly creatures returning from the past to kill several people. By that time I had many questions in my head: why the hell did they return this monster? Druids look like maniacs dressed in sheets? Why did they even bother to make this film? The “climax” of the film was so stupid that I laughed to the end: the “terrible” smelly monster fights with two young women (who seem to be experienced kung fu masters), and the professors are divided into two parts or so, What surprised me is that the monster was so slow and awkward in battle, should it not be the god of war or something like that? Anyway, the film in its death rolls was a pitiful sight. A brief condensation of the content of this film: Kung Fu chaos + Druid stones + mysterious a-la-thriller murders + ancient prophecies + worn ravens + old clumsy god of war without bones + crazy professor = full and full, sick, boneless, eaten by a worm , GODFORSAKEN, GODDAM, PROCESSED, SUPPORT, WANNABE, FUNNY SH * T !!!!!!!!! Things I learned from this movie: - Ancient gods of war are lousy in kung fu. - All young women who study archeology at the University of France are experts in kung fu. Professors are so stable that they can survive by being cut in half with a mass of lumber without any injuries.
