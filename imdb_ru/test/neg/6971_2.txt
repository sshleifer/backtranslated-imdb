I saw the biographical film Ed Wood many years ago. Tim Burton pays tribute to this extremely mediocre, but still enthusiastic director with love. <br /> <br /> Then I saw Plan 9, and he really didn’t tickle me. Stupid story, like bad production values, but still interesting and even funny. <br /> <br /> Then this. What can you do from this. Well, since Wood is reportedly a cross-dresser, it’s amazing to see a film that deals with this as a cartoon. Yes, there are some tricks in teaching the audience something to this, but basically this is some kind of really perverted self-parody. <br /> <br /> One of the problems is that she has hundreds of points of view. On the one hand, it is a call for tolerance. Another portrays transvestism as a disease. And finally, he tells the audience: “Well, if you're in shock now, wait until you see it!” The problem must have been that Wood had to compromise to make a film. You can almost feel it when you see the introductory name from the producer: Personally supervised ... So, where are we. This is not a serious storyline film or total shocker. <br /> <br /> The entertainment value is almost zero. A wooden voice-over is slightly funny, but only because it sounds wrong. This was done in the 50s, so it can be argued that it was safe to make a film that even mentioned the word transvestites. It all comes down to what the film itself is trying to do. Schock The rape scene, though light, is just for that. <br /> <br /> So sorry. This is a misfire, but the discredit is not only Wood.
