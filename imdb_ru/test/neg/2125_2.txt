The most disgusting of all the lousy robberies of Jaws was regretfully made by one of my favorite directors of all time; Lamberto Bava (here under the pseudonym of John Old Jr.). You know how it happens in these cheap European imitations, right? They only want their monstrous animal to be bigger, more painful and threatening, but this more than often leads to the opposite effect. The creature of Bava is a huge sea devil, and it is more than just a shark! It seems that we are dealing with a prehistoric monster, with the jaws and appetite of the Great White, but he also has tentacles like an octopus! Oceanologists who love dolphins have to figure out how this monster survived for all these thousands of years and why it was he who just started his murderous boom. The Monster Shark scenario has no meaning, and most of the action takes place on the mainland. The shark itself is an unintentionally ridiculous creature, and Lamberto Bava made the wise decision to show it only in vague and quick flashes. Acting is above average, and underwater photography is surprisingly clear and well-controlled. The plot twists are predictable, and you will probably be interested to learn detailed facts about the characters. For example: count all the beer cans that Dr. Hogan drinks throughout the entire movie!
