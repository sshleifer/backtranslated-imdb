The second work of screenwriter Steve Tesic (after the wildly exaggerated BREAKING AWAY) is a collection of clichés, matches and harsh melodrama. He may have lived a part of it; If so, then I am sorry to say that he was inexplicably unable to convincingly dramatize any of this. <br /> <br /> For the sake of justice, Arthur Penn, a talented director who has done a wonderful job in the past, didn’t help him here. (Bonnie and Clyde, a LITTLE BIG MAN) but cannot contribute any energy or credibility to Tesic's narration. <br /> <br /> Actors do their best to do their best, but are burdened with weak motivation and dialogue. Sympathy must be reserved, in particular, for Craig Wasson, whose dark performance foreshadows the imminent disappearance of his leading career, as well as the awkwardly untied Jodie Thelen, mistakenly viewed as an extremely unlikely “femme fatale” film. > Everything seems longer than it is, and any comments made are harsh and obvious. Watch Arthur Penn’s earlier talk on the 60s, RESTAURANT, ARTIFICIAL AND ELEGIC; that's all this is not.
