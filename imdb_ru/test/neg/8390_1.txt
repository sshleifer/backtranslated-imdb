If you do not want to be bored half to death. I have never been a fan of Gus Van Santa, and as part of what previous posters described as a new youth generation, I was very disappointed and slightly angry about the stereotypical portrayal of the characters in the film, especially because they were used for stringed funny storyline of the film, which to a large extent, it pushes viewers to the fact that skateboarders are social deviations and should be blamed for crimes. As a skater himself, I watch a lot of skate films and filming during skate scenes, which is obviously the main part of the plot, since the main character, a skateboarder, was terrible, and the slow motion technique was used in Bourne. give a terrible effect. This film is just full of ridiculous stereotypes, as evidenced by the emo soundtrack, which only adds to the myth that all skateboarders are white rockers. Just a very bad movie.
