Directly above the field in which I am now printing, I had to choose a number from 1 to 10 and evaluate this feature film. Unfortunately, there is no option for a number less than zero, and I have to deliver something. If I had a choice, I would simply not put anything, not a number, because there are no numbers that would express the futility of this film. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this movie even after reading all these terrible Reviews, make sure that there are no sharp or stupid objects in the area, this will help you not to try to commit suicide in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> I don’t know how this film was released to the public, it should be locked up and guarded around the clock somewhere in Fort Knox. I am angry that this film was even available for viewing. I feel deceived by humanity, I had no idea that people could be so cruel. Stalin, Saddam and Hitler did not get anything from this damn Cowell bag. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the cover of the movie. 1) No scarecrow, no one knows why there is a legitimate looking scarecrow on the front. 2) None of the characters on the back of the case even in the smelly film! 3) The slogan says something about a “new moon, more victims”, there were no damn victims, no one even died. We don’t know if the policeman died, and I guess the killer didn’t die, because it sounded like he had been hit on the head with a shaving bat. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and stay away from this film; it spent about 4 hours of my life. That's right, four, it took me an hour to watch it (I quickly moved through 4-minute zoom scenes that didn't show anything in the story), I watched TV for about an hour after it was finished, contemplating my life and After watching this shit he was going, and then I started crying for the next two hours, because I know that someone there, unfortunately, will see this film, and I can do nothing to stop it.
