The innocent innocent Indri finds himself in a house of prostitution, ruled by the merciless pimp MG. Indri is imprisoned in the private prison of M.G. after she refuses to make love to him. Of course, Indri and the worldly elite against Helga join forces and plan to flee. Blah Mamana Firmans, Pete Burnham’s boring and boring, talkative script completely undermines any trash vitality that this film needs to qualify as a nice piece of junk using “babies in jail”: a slow pace painfully drags everywhere, gratuitous female nudity nor was it (girls do not even show any skin during a compulsory group shower!), the expected torture and degradation are extremely tame and cool, moderate fleecy bleeding is also not It is impressive, and even the ridiculous sequence of fighting in cats has nothing to worry about. Thomas Susanto's pedestrian filming, ludicrous lousy dubbing, an agonizingly long 102-minute playing time, a juicy themed song and Gatoth Sudarto score add even more humiliating insult to the already terrifying trauma. Only a few decent actions on the last drum offer a bit of relief from excessively abundant, but at the same time, exhausting fatigue. Full itchy whipping.
