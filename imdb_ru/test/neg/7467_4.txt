Not a scary film - my 10-year-old boy loved him, and he would be a targeted demographic, so I think they hit the spot. However, quite boring for an adult. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to treat animated lego characters, even fashionable high-techs. <br /> <br /> I was thinking about choosing the three great virtues of Bionicle. The world was a bit strange - unity, duty and destiny. Am I the only one who thinks it sounds a bit fascist? Especially fate. What about freedom, equality, justice, etc.? <br /> <br /> Well then, this will sell Lego. Pretty boring for a movie, but not bad for a 74-minute ad. It could be much worse.
