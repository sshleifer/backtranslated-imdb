Please, if you are thinking about renting this movie, do not. If you want to watch a couple of downloaded clips, do not. If I had my own way, no one would even read this summary. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film was stellar, the film was still pathetic. The director was probably a sadist. Witty liners are what you expect from a room of high-paying, anti-social 7-year-olds who eat paint chips for breakfast. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is that it is trying to be a film like “Evil Dead 2” (in no case do not associate these 2 films), because it’s so bad that it’s funny. But he also tries to be ridiculous at the same time and cannot do it so much that your sense of humor remains too crippled to do anything except to derail the gag reflex in attmept to save yourself. <br /> <I could have gone much further by describing in detail how horrible it really was, but I think it would deprive me of the desire to live, just to keep thinking about it. If you need me, I will try to boil to feel clean again ...
