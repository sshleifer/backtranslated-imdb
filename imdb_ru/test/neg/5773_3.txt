Oh, dear, dear. It really gets on my nerves when a low-budget, senseless horror novel tries to look interesting in the credits, when a bunch of good names appear in the cast, only to attract each of them to the smallest, most senseless roles possible. In this film, we have Richard Lynch in one scene, an instant appearance from Martin Cove, a short spot for Vernon Wells, a little more screen time for John Phillip Lowe and a little time for Karen Black. This group of casual cameos doesn't really matter much, although Richard Lynch and Karen Black do cause some of the few smiles of this film to appear, and this is really very painful, since none of the main actors are very good. I could not help but think that if more scenes with any of the veterans of movie b were filmed above the movie, it would be much better, but since these are just a few teasing glimpses of good entertainment, when the movie would not have reached much entertainment value. Of the main roles, the only charismatic or pretty performances, in my opinion, were Steve Westell, since Axel and his girlfriend, whom I think was played by Elina Madison (never heard of her before, but she has some presence on the screen and she is well looks), The plot in this simple, angry miner undead pursues those who are trying to steal his gold, and this should bring a fun slasher, especially considering that its director John Karl BÃ¼hler, who made special effects for many of them. movies of this kind, including working on all three major slasher franchises (Halloween, Elm Street and Friday, the 13th) and such small pearls as the Mausoleum. Unfortunately, the film, unfortunately, lacks tension, attractiveness and satisfaction. I would say that there is one or two moderately bloody moments, but nothing is worth the effort to watch a movie. In fact, besides the aforementioned cameos, this whole film is really rather stale and rough with characters that cannot be made fast enough, according to my taste, and the unfortunate lack of any real interest. I did not even find it funny in the sense of a ridiculous bad movie, which is rare for me, since I like a lot of pretty dirty movies. I would say, avoid.
