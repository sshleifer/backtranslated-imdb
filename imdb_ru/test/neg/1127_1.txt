I quote Clark Griswold (in the original Christmas holidays): “OK? How can things be worse? Look here, Ellen. We're on the verge of hell. ”Chevy Chase knew little that he describes the“ sequel ”of one of his best films. Christmas Vacation II sets a new high (or maybe it should be LOW) in bad movies. My wife bought this DVD, thinking it would be a continuation of the original, but we were very disappointed. This movie is LAME. It bears no resemblance to the original, is an absolute waste of the film and embarrassment for other good actors who have had the misfortune to become part of it. He must have set an IMDb record for the worst reviews. I really think that we have a good reason to win a class action lawsuit in order to return the money that we consumers spent on this film.
