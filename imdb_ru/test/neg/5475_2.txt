My, my, my: Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasant must have desperately needed work to lend their talents to this turkey. Terribly confusing story about Satanism in modern Greece, the Country of the Minotaur (aka Devil's People) is a misfire on more or less any level you can imagine. He has very few scary things (always a small drawback for a horror movie, isn't it?); weak indicators; countless scenes where the characters foolishly roam alone or refuse to remain in the safety of the group; and some rather annoying editing methods that add nothing to the process. I was prematurely agitated by the prospect of Cushing and Pleasure working together 17 years after Flesh and the Villains, but this film is not worth calling; This is a huge disappointment and rather embarrassment for its much more worthy potential customers. <br /> <br /> In a remote region of Greece, strangers disappear, such as tourists and archaeologists, and local priest Father Rosh (Donald Pleasans) suspects that something sinister is happening. He writes to his friend, the New York private eye, Milo Kai (Costas Skuras), asking him to fly to Greece to help him figure out the secret. Meanwhile, three more visitors — Beth (Bath Revil), Jan (Nikos Werlekis) and Tom (Robert Beling), all of whom are personal friends of Roch’s father — go missing, looking for nearby Greek ruins. Milo eventually arrives in Greece, but at first he doubts that Roch’s father was convinced that the missing people were captured by the satanic victims. Milo and Father Roche were also joined by Laurie (Luan Peters), the girl of the missing Tom. Together, they reveal the activities of the Minoan worship cult of the devil, led by the terrible Carpathian exile Baron Korofax (Peter Cushing). These crazy cultists zealously sacrificed their sacrifices to the statue of the minotaur. In addition, they apparently cannot be killed in the usual ways, so Father Rocher has to use various religious artifacts in his fight against them. <br /> <br /> The earth of the Minotaur should have been much better than it actually is. The plot is so stupid and incredible that it has all the signs of a pleasant stupid cult / favorite camp. But the processing is just awful. Director Kostas Karayannis does not know how to link the narrative together, so everything happens as if it were compiled on a daily basis. He also has no idea how to convince the performers of his cast, so they can be embarrassed by either terribly Hammi (Pleasance, Cushing) or terribly amateurish (Skouras, Peters) performances. Worse, the narration does not make sense. Why should Father Rocher seek the help of a private eye, which is completely frivolous in its convictions? How does Rocher find out that victims only happen during the full moon? How can a minotaur statue speak? Why does one of the sacrificial victims during the vision receive instructions to stab Father Rocher, but only she herself will be able to strike several scenes later before he gets the chance to do it? And the most amazing thing is why Rosh’s father drags Milo halfway around the world to help him when all he needs is a crucifix and some holy water to get rid of the bad guys? These questions - and others - will appear during the Land Of The Minotaur .... but, alas, there are no answers. Disappointment, dullness and disappointment!
