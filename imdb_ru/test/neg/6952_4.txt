Not every lesbian gay and vampire movie that affects our favorite trash / cult genre is good. Unfortunately, in this film there is no originality, and the performances do not meet the standards of garbage. It seems that the creator's intention to make him a cult failed. Trash movies are trash movies because it happens. You cannot specifically create such films. I do not know if Mr. Kripo is a legend (I heard his name for the first time), BUT, if he is, then I wonder why ... <br /> <br /> Awful. Even lesbian scenes are pathetic, so lovers of erotic films about x-ploitation will not be satisfied, as there are thousands of films better than Barely Legal Lesbian Vampires.
