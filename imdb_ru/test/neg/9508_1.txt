<br /> <br /> The play was edited and the order of the scenes was completely confused. Acting is terrible (especially Helena Bonham Carter) and bad cinematography. <br /> <br /> The result is a slow, tangled, boring movie that instantly throws newcomers to Shakespeare from Shakespeare! <br /> If you do not see the scene, then at least look at the version of Olivier (1948) instead of this nonsense!
