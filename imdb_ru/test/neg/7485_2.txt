John Goode's wife (just one of the worst titles for a movie ever) or Red Right Hand (another absolutely horrible sounding title that means nothing and has nothing to do with the film), under which I saw it, is set in 'Salem, Mass. 1978' (by the way, the year I was born, which was probably the best event in those 365 days) when five old friends from college meet for school reunion, Bassoon-same-sex boy Roger Maser ( John Kunz, this is the last name for you say it out loud ...), Martha Alden (Kim Brock Ington), Rebecca Lawson (Jenna Stern) and her boyfriend Jake Staibler (John Doe), Alan Hobbs (Michael Kevin Walker) and his wife Sandy (Megan Rava) plus John Good (Mark Ardito, why is “John” different in the title? ) and his wife Sarah (Abigail Morgan). From the very beginning, an awkward tension is felt in the air, and when someone mentions his “missing” friend Kalef (Jason Winter), many unpleasant memories come back. Then there are phone calls, mysterious nosebleeds, hallucinations and guilt, as the true horror of the events of all those years ago is finally revealed ... <br /> <br /> Producer, executive producer, director and director Kurt Gioscha who also wrote this thing and Kurt St. Thomas, who also receives artistic guidance and, if that is not enough, they both also participate in the film! Personally, I thought that John Hood's Wife was terrible, I mean, she can't cook or something else! Ha ha ha, just kidding! Seriously, although I didn’t think about the film as a whole, for a start it is rather slow, and all the first 30 minutes is a continuous fragmentary material of a reunion, consisting of a multitude of overtaking and boring expositions on building characters. The film never explains itself that with these strange nosebleeds for God's sake, mysterious phone calls, the almost insignificant death of one of the group that could or could not be natural, and what the hell was Sarah in general? She is facing some curious, crazy sex, dirty chatter, shameless, bitter blackmailing know-it-all whore, who apparently sleeps with almost all the men she meets! Some of the dialogue she doesn’t have inappropriate in porn and it just seems to completely disagree with the rest of the film, which plays more like drama than horror / thriller it supposedly should be. Then there is an end, if there is a worse way to finish a movie, then just leave literally everything that hangs in the air, without a circuit, whatever I have seen. All of this was also very predictable, I mean, that someone watching this will not know that when they all mentioned that their friend Kalef went missing, there will be no more of it? <br /> <br /> Director Gioscia And Thomas makes a film that infuriates, in addition to predictability and annoying climax, there is Alan’s retrospective narrative, which I simply don’t understand, since he has no more or less significant significance than anyone or another, and at what point in time does he talk with? The reasons for this narrative are never explained or specified. There is no tension, because everything is in order. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is fine, but nothing special, and some places and clothes didn’t look particularly authentic to me, it never convinced me that it happened in the late 1970s. The game was fine, but what about the names of actor John Kunz? I suppose if his wife stood next to him, we could describe them as a pair of Kunz, right ?! <br /> <br /> I really didn’t really think about John Goode’s wife (the doll would have exploded better! Hahaha) And I’m not sure who will like it. Forget about any blood, horror, violence, fear, atmosphere or excitement, in fact, forget about everything that would make this film watchable, because it is not here. Not recommended.
