The guy Pierce is almost like Flynn, and this similarity is the only thing this film can claim. Nowhere in Flynn’s autobiography is there any mention of the character of Klaus Reicher, the homosexual encounter is a speculative fiction, and the film’s assertions that Flynn had a bad attitude to local work are groundless. Director Frank Howson has not made any memorable films, and I think he doesn’t care to slander Flynn in order to advance his unremarkable career. <br /> <br />
