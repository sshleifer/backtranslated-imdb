Title: Dracula, 1972. <br /> <br /> Director: Alan Gibson. <br /> <br /> Cast: Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Stephanie Beecham. <br /> <br /> capsules that take you back at any time. In this case ... our temporary capsule is Hammers Dracula AD 1972, which brings us back to the time when Austin Powers would feel at home. <br /> <br /> The story about this group of children (there was no gang! there was a group!) who love to hang out at a cafe-shop called "The Cave". One day, Johnny Alucard (hmm, strange surname ... wait ... this means that Dracula is backwards!), A new member of the group offers the group a new way to get their punches. He offers them a night of black mass and black magic. They also say: “Of course, why the hell can it be fun!” So in the blink of an eye, they discover that they are recovering Count Dracula from the ashes. <br /> <br /> This film begins with a noisy party in some rich house of crazy people. He does not know any of the people at his party, but there they all hold parties all night long in his house. Make drugs, look at and dance on the tables. The filmmakers made sure that this sequence was completely absorbed in what young people thought was cool at the time. Everyone says words like “exit” and “excellent,” and many of them end with the words “all this jazz.” So yes, it's pretty obvious that this is the 70s. To top it off, there is a band that sounds like "Jefferson's Plane" ... I mean, you will drown in all the 70s. And when I watched this, I kept asking myself the question: “What the hell is Dracula and his black cloak and is going to get up in all this?” And this is exactly what is happening. Old Dracula feels out of place among parties, rock and roll and drugs. Many scenes in the film are great ... but, unfortunately, the music, which they decided to add to the process, does not fit at all and completely takes you out of the mood. Something terrible or frightening will happen on the screen, and suddenly a loud handset and a congo begin to beat, and you just completely out of horror. It sucked the atmosphere of this film out of me. <br /> <br /> But on the whole, leaving aside all the distracting music of the 70s (a disease that Dracula’s satanic rites also suffered from), the film was pretty good. But I will mention this. The story was just a rehash of what we saw earlier in The Taste of Dracula’s Blood. In fact, this story is almost identical. Let's see ... a young guy inherits the ring of Dracula and the ashes ... check. Then he decides to bring Dracula back to life with the help of people who know nothing about what they get into ... check. Black Mass, to return Dracula to the desecrated church ... check. The list of similarities goes on and on. So this film is not very original, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Although there are a few things that make this movie useful. For example, the fact that a movie is a time capsule for London in the early seventies makes the movie interesting. I kept giggling and laughing every time someone spoke in 70 jargon. I could not believe what kind of clothes they wore and the cars they drove! It made the movie fun for me, but we were here to get scared, we were here to see Drac kill several virgins and take revenge on House Van Helsing. Did we get any of this? Well yes. There are several good episodes to satisfy old school fans. First of all, there is a sequence of the Black Mass, which was primarily Satanic! They mention the name of many demons and shed a lot of blood. This sequence was amazing, but it was spoiled by music at the most important moment. Then there is the actual resurrection of Dracula, which, I admit, was great from a visual point of view. A little mist emerges from the grave of Dracula, and slowly but surely, the silhouette and face of Christopher Lee emerge from the mist. Cool shot! I like it! We have Cushing and Lee face to face at the end. And I could not stop laughing at one moment, when Dracula hurls a piece of furniture into the air. I laugh because he did this in every film, starting with the movie “The Terror of Dracula”. This is a Hummer tradition where characters start throwing candlesticks and chairs at each other. And I think that they are not more exciting things than a bad guy throwing a candle at our hero? Well, okay, in any case, the death of Dracula in this film is very similar to all the other Hummer Dragons before the vampire is killed, and then we cut a series of shots until only the ashes remain. <br /> <br /> All in all, the unintentionally funny movie of Hummer Dracula. They were trapped in the 70s, and although they make them fun hours (and not as terrible as the satanic rites of Dracula), they still don't fit well with the Dracula universe we used to expect from Hammer. <br /> <br /> Rating 3 1/2 of 5
