This film must have looked like when it was being shown at the development stage, and the appearance of Redgrave and Jacobi on board must have excited people with money. All I can say is that they clearly had nothing this week. Jacobi camped in the way only Jacobi can do, and I thought that he seemed to him more like an actor whom he parodied in his cameo role in Fraser several years ago. Winnie Jones is not really bad, he just clearly not in himself as a leading person. He is really very kind about everything, and if it was a pilot for the series, he might have just been picked up. However, the work of the Skipta and the camera was terrible. Why this “journalist” and an employee of the press service of “Met” will work together is never explained. This, of course, could not be due to sexual chemistry, which is not. There is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and far-fetched plot that you can pass off as an original, but all this is so invented that these two stories simply have no meaning. It looked like two stories, embarrassedly edited into one to make two hours. Go see a little paint dry for several hours. Your life will be more fulfilling than watching this garbage.
