The version of "Mame" Lucile Ball, in my opinion, is one of the worst performances ever preserved in the film. After I saw Lucy in her various sitcoms more than astronomically, I can tell you that I really love Lucy, but this film is a fiasco of incredibly bad casting, music and dance. Robert Preston is the only saving grace with a small enough part to miss it if you blink. I don’t know what she was thinking, and I can’t imagine how the studio or director advised her, but I actually cringed at watching this embarrassing performance. I could be very cruel and offer to look at it with a laugh, but this is too pitiful to even claim it. Do not waste your money or your time.
