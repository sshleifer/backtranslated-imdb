I know that films of this type sell tickets and make money for filmmakers, but this will not be a film about Vietnam. Vietnam was full of horror for the people who lived it day by day. <br /> <br /> In this film, Gene Hackman, who is a Korean War veterinarian, was assigned to train a group of Vietnamese rags to return to this country in order to save a group of American prisoners of war in the camp. These people include a former tunnel rat, a crazy sailor dropping acid, a tanned blond surfer from California, and some inexperienced child (Patrick Swayze) who happened to have a dad killed in Nam. At first they train in some camp in Texas, and once they find us in Us and lose all their weapons. They can find a substitute weapon and continue on their way to free the captured people. Most of the men are found and saved, but the rag tag group is largely destroyed. <br /> <br /> This film played like a video game, in which you could find out what will happen next, and who will be because of what bush, and who was going to die and who was going to live. Vietnam, I think, was not like a video game ....
