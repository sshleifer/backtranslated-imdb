If you thought that the day after tomorrow was implausible, wait until you see it. <br /> <br /> Good, so in most disaster films, there is usually an event of 1 billion in size, which is exacerbated by other circumstances. In this case, even the union of two huge storm systems. Fair enough so far. Oh, but wait, no, an “event” is sabotage and the subsequent destruction of the power grid. <br /> <br /> Then add a lot of elements of interest to the person — in this case, the cheating husband, the psychotic gun ... he has a boyfriend, a rebellious daughter, a hacker to prove, a senator trying to push the agenda, a reporter trying confront the "man" and pregnant women stuck in the elevator. <br /> <br /> Finally, add a few tasting events to add excitement. God, if the director tried to fit into some more meaningless plot lines, there would be no less time for a real catastrophe, which, given the awful state of computer graphics, would almost certainly be the intention. <br /> <br /> God, if you can't even convincingly model a truck, you really shouldn't take on the twisters, blow up the power stations, tear down Las Vegas to pieces or destroy the oil stations. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t understood how terrible this film is, let me add that all three bad guys are being killed separately and completely disappointing, implausible manners that stink more of the moralism of this good filmmaking. <br /> <br /> I have no problems with the students of the first month, I write exhausted, beaten, scenarios, soaked in cliches, but for God's sake, this does not mean that someone should shoot them in the movie! <br /> <br /> He manages to make a terribly unbelievable 10.0 Apocalypse look less terrible. Avoid them both.
