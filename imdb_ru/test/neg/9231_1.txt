Sadly, some consider this film worth seeing. I am Russian, and I hate. In this film, there is nothing praiseworthy except cinematography. However, I am not one of those who find beauty in death or perversion. I think this film is poorly designed and directed. There is nothing more annoying and even annoying than shameless speculation in art (if you can call it trash art). Balabanov wanted to shock the audience with an all-pervading evil, and he managed to create a hopelessly gloomy film. But the biggest shock is Balabanovâ€™s primitive directorial work. I would never advise any of my friends to see it. Great disappointment!
