This is a really bad movie. However, itâ€™s good to laugh at terrible ideas and "special effects." The plot is centered around the EU space agency, which discovers the 10th planet that rotates directly in front of the Earth. They send a manned mission (they were on Mars and have not yet discovered this planet? Is anyone stupid enough to get on this?) On the planet, and you can believe it, this is a mirror image of the planet with which they came. From now on, almost everything is predictable. Honestly, from the title of the film you can guess almost everything. The only thing that is surprising here is the space program with a mane, which is led by the Europeans :) There can be no excuse for the concept of the plot or its execution. So it's good for a laugh or maybe if you are in an altered state of consciousness.
