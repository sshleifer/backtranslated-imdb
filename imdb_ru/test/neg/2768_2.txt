I couldn’t come up with heads or tails from this horrible film Noir. <br /> <br /> The plot was confusing, the acting was fine, but the image quality was terrible! Although I bought it at Gansters Double Pack (8 films on two discs) at WalMart for $ 5.50, and when you insert a DVD, it apologizes for the terrible image quality some movies may have. <br /> The plot turned around wherever I couldn’t understand it and had no idea what was going on ... then “End” surfaced, and the movie ended. <br /> <br /> What a waste of my time! <br /> <br /> I say: do not waste your money or time on it! Or, if you also bought this Gansters Double Pack, just skip this ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
