It's a shame that such a lame plot should be hung in such picturesque places, with some reportage of documentary style added for extra length. A shorter film may have kept the tension a little more, and the more charismatic leader may not have distorted his lines so much. The woman was also not allowed to do enough, which led to a good but boring business. It is being built closer to the end, but the main actorâ€™s own redemption is too little, too late and should have been revealed earlier in the film. Not terrible, just a pity. Uninteresting, but good enough to beautify the television programs of the early hours.
