There is a part of one sequence where water falls into a sunken plane, everything else that happens in this film is shots for airport 77. You can even see Jack Lemmon and Christopher Lee in some shots. Total rip off? Well, almost by definition. There may be more videos in this film than in Plan 9 "From Space". <br /> <br /> All new material telling the actors sitting on the plane is boring and terrible at every level. Dennis Weaver is completely useless in a low-career film, although this is true for everyone except the director of this film, Fred Olen Ray, who uses one of these many fake names to keep working. <br /> <br /> the level of meager professionalism that makes this film such a waste of time would actually be better if someone who doesn’t have technical knowledge at all, because Ray has enough knowledge about how to put together a scene in the worst of old school tv fashions that this film, like most of his films, is completely devoid of life. The worst kind of hacker work. The worst kind of movie. Boring <br /> <br /> This type of film is a waste of money, the thing is when a team at all levels is ghosts hoping to get any meager salary they can and that no one will see or know that they have appeared / participated in this robbery. There are so many people who want to make films, it’s disgusting to see Ray burning the money allocated to just making time. <br /> <br /> His commentary track is interesting in that it should start with an explanation. that he is really Fred Ray, since he is not credited to the film itself. This deceived me by seeing that it would not allow you to cheat.
