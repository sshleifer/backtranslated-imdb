I will not vote for this movie as terrible, mainly because I like it, I was one of those summer days when I was so uncomfortable, and I decided to rent a movie in the stupid part of the video store. Besides the fact that I didn’t sleep most of the night, and the film woke me up ... Let's just start the autopsy, well, the film has a strange plot, first isolation, expedition, they are isolated on the island because there is no gas on the boat, something in this way, there is no single convincing role in the acting part (for now), the main problem begins after the idea of ​​isolation, POV snake, then another, ... then another, then snakes that change, then false ghosts, many of them, and when we believe the film goes a good way for cloudless retention, it fails, by the fact that after ten or eleven ghosts we are not tolerated far away, the only scene that reveals everything is the scene when we watch a drunken lesbian show watched by snakes who seem to dance, after which it becomes not a horror adventure, but comedian film, part of the adventure is also discarded. <br /> <br /> For me, the problem in the film is the third act, this is the only section that is simply a film for an already guessed conclusion, or, if it succeeds, we will not notice it, like ninja smoke in our eyes, well ... Snake Island has a bad conclusion, everything comes to the "book" Ending, with a sequence of collision, pursuit and escape, was predictable at the moment when I rented a copy of the dam. Another real problem is the concept, the concept is very important, this is the reason you believe that dinosaurs come to life or a corpse full of stitches that you just want to live on, the basic concept of snakes who after decades want to avenge human torture. . civilization, well ... hmmm, just does not glue on the wall. One thing you enjoy (if you look at it with an open mind) is more bz-sequences, naked lesbians, several amateur cameras, a tribute to the brains with a grass cutter, a black dude will not die first, and that's all ... if you want see snakes, black guys and comedies, and prefer large budgets, go and see "snakes on the plane." <br /> <br /> Hasta movie lovers
