This must be the worst show I've ever seen. I always liked Chuck Norris in films, but why do we have to make these shows politically correct by adding a blow from the black side, just as menacing as Shirley Temple in Little Miss Marker. I also thought the show was limited, because how many times can you hit a guy in the face and make him interesting. I know an African American who looks like this guy from Trivett, and he is beaten on his buttocks about once a week, he is all set up. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris is a man, and he deserves all the accolades he receives, I think this show started great, but as time went on it was lost <br /> <br /> They had to throw a side blow to Chuck
