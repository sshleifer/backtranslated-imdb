Perhaps it was the excessive weight gain that Seagal gained. Or maybe it was a terrible game Vayanov in an action movie. Or was it a complete lack of chemistry between the two leading characters? These and other considerations lead me to conclude that Seagal should never have made this acting nightmare. True, the storyline was good. Nevertheless, being an avid follower of Seagal's career and experience, his appearance did not match his genre of the pure, clean, healthy life of Zen Buddhists, especially in his conversations on screen with waysans. (On the other hand, his real life romance with the “nanny” was also inconsistent!) <br /> <br /> If Seagal wants to become a more versatile actor, he must do the same thing as the character in Kindergarten .. . Add humorous material to the script or situations where the actor has no other choice but to react comically. Otherwise, leave wise cracks and vain attempts at humor from this, while pursuing a serial killer. Seagal is not the type of guy with natural humor. It did not work. <br /> <br />
