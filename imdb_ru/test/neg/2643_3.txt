If it were not for the very attractive Jennifer Jostin in the title role, I would have turned off Milo in the first 30 minutes. Nevertheless, despite the fact that it is so easy on the eyes, it is not enough for her to save this film, but not with a long shot. <br /> <br /> Milo begins with a group of young girls accompanying the “prospective young boy” in a yellow jacket to a house in the forest where he shows them embryos in banks. Apparently, the thing was that if he showed them the banks, Ol Milo would take a gynecologist exam for each of them. One member of the group voluntarily became Milo's “first patient,” and he leads her behind closed doors. After a few moments, the blood flows from under the door, and we are driven into our day. Enter the beautiful Jostin, who plays one of the girls who grew up these days. The deputy teacher, with little confidence, whose closest friend is a goldfish, receives an invitation to return home for a friend's wedding. Aha You guessed it. Go back to Miloville. Milo, who allegedly drowned many years ago, seems to be experiencing a dilemma: to remain dead and begins to terrorize and kill girls, whom he could not "examine" all these years ago. <br /> <br /> Milo, the character, reminded me of one of the mutants from Kronenberg "Brood". He could be scary, but how scary could a villain in a yellow raincoat be? The plot confuses even himself, and because of this conclusion, it took me 90 minutes ago. I'm sending Milo, an inept directorial film, standing in the corner!
