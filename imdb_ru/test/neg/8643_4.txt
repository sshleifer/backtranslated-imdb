I made this film because I noticed the cover in the video rental store. I saw Nolte, Connelly, Madsen, the time of the 40s, and thought, “Hm, it can't be too bad.” Unfortunately, after watching it, my impression was “not too good.” <br /> <br /> This is a kind of robbery from Chinatown, but the worst thing is that apart from Nolte, the other members of the detachment did not get enough time on the screen. But this is a decent film to see once, I think. And the role of Melanie was so small that she was not given a chance to become a nuisance.
