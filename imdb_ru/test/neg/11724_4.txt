Do not get me wrong. I have a significant weak point for the work of Charles Bend as a producer and director. But you have to raise an eyebrow when a person who wanted to put his name on "Dollman Vs The Demonic Toys", attaches a nickname to something. Like a bit of a bad funny movie, “The Head of the Family” is rather absent, although it acts better than you might expect. Jacqueline Lovell is a definite talent that deserves better than films of this type. J.W. Perra is also quite funny as a title monster, although for such a supramental being it is really easy to deceive him. You know, I'm picky, because the rest of the movie is so sharp and witty, of course .... And the main character is Lance Bogan? Good guys. We did not know that you Americans knew this piece of slang!
