When this show goes on the air, I confess that I was intrigued by the premise and setting. With an open mind, I watched the first two episodes and, naturally, rejected it as a maximum running half of the season for running. I recently watched A / E and witnessed an advertisement for this garbage, and I could hardly contain my surprise. I sincerely hope that people look at it with laughter and do not take it seriously. Characters are really one of the most ridiculous and frankly funny on television, scripts or something else. Obviously, it generates ratings, so I must pay tribute to the creators for creating and maintaining a fan base, but I seriously hope that no one is watching this under any serious pretext.
