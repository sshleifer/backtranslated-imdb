I saw it late in the evening on a small channel, and I put it in anticipation of a laugh or two. Martin Lawrence is a good comic actor, and I think he could be a good comedian / actor in the style of Richard Pryor. <br /> <br /> I could not be more wrong. This concert was terrible. He was full of racist comments directed against white people, Muslims and people from India (Muslims and Indians are the same in Lawrence’s narrow mind) and an incoherent, clichéd cod philosophy (Lawrence, like many black comics and directors, cannot resist the urge to preach when we are given a platform. Do we need a lecture about Martin Luther King and the fight for civil rights during a comedy show?). Then came his comments aimed at intriguing him with women, and this made my skin crawl while listening to him. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, the show was just not funny and I was bored. I flipped over halfway and lay back to find him who still preaches or continues and continues to tell about the birth of his child (in the history of the birth of his child there was no humor, and it was self-indulgence on his part). bore us with details. He obviously had nothing to talk about, otherwise he would have cut out this section of the show). <br /> <br /> This show was crap: Runteldat!
