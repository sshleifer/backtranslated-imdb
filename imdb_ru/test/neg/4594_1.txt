Where to start "Speck" - the true story of Richard Speck, the killer of eight nurses in the 1960s. Directed by Kate Wally worked on several films devoted to the release of the film "Full Moon", with a very low budget (for example, "The Rite of Birth"), and here works according to the scenario (at that time) of the usual player "Full Moon" Don Adams. Unfortunately, while the film seems to be an exact depiction of a horrendous crime, the script is not great, perhaps because the conversations of this Speck were not terribly interesting!? Despite all the efforts that have been made to make it authentic, he brings a cheap payment of recognized cinematographic films about serial killers of the same period (such as “Ed Gain”). Filmed in dirty brown, not quite sepia, mostly told by the star Doug Cole, the film is not able to convey the horror of the crime, because the story is annoying, the coloring distracts from the story and the crime, although it is terrible and distressing just to watch, and no editorial the work does not seem to have happened on the fact that it is largely a viewing of very poor quality video cameras at events. In fact, there is no study of the motivation or life of Speke, just a cheap shot at a terrible crime. Released in Full Moon, there is little evidence that the Full Moon turned out better, Charles Band ignores his own rule that his films depict fantastic killings (for example, dolls, monsters, etc.) And not quite knows what to do with this new reality. By the way, the group presented a special label for these films called “Shadow Entertainment”. The group said it regretted the release period of Full Moon with Tempe Entertainment (whose creator J.R. Bookwalter and the usual Danny Draven also speak very badly about the Charles Band). The Tempe era is characterized by its uniform editing on an Apple Mac and brutal shooting from a handheld camera, very much like a home movie. Speck retains these qualities, and while Witchouse 3, for example, managed to use them, Speck is just boring and rude.
