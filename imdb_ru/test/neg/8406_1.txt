I continued to watch it, because it seemed that the plot was going somewhere. When it ambiguously got there, I was very disappointed. I'm going to tell you what really happened in the next sentence. But perhaps I will not. Maybe I am just hinting that something will happen. The authors lacked imagination. This is not even the movie "B" - this is a film for television "B".
