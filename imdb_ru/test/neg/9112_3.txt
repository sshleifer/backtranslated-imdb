This film suffers terribly from its director, Julian Grant, and its incompetent leader, Steve Guttenberg, who is working hard to win in the competition of Bruce Willis. Writing a reckless Hollywood action movie; Sean Bean - one of my favorites - David Fraser and Kim Coates perform well. The film is definitely below average. 3 out of 10! I wonder what Hollywood studios thought, actually giving free rein to a weak director such as Grant? And I would say to Sean Bean: â€œWhat were you thinking, even taking into account participation in such a film, after such wonderful films as GoldenEye, Ronin and Patriot Games!
