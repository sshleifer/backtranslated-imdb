I was born and raised in Odessa and graduated from a “other” high school in the late 70s, Odessa high school, I had mixed emotions about this film. I no longer live in Odessa, but I will always be a Texan deep down. I didn’t like the way this city with a population of 80,000 was portrayed as a small city with dirty poverty. If I am mistaken, please correct me, but I believe that OHS also plays at the city stadium, and the sign “House of Perm Panthers”, which was shown at the stadium, used to be on the training field in Perm. I would like to see a small recognition of the rivalry between cities for a big game in the city - OHS vs Permian. I am curious as to why the result of the game was changed, although I think it would be just as dramatic if they depicted the real result. Overall, the film was fine, made me miss a little home, recalling the "good old days" of MOJO.
