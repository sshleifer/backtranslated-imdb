A great waste of time is all you get from this bag. I shot it in the hope of a stressful movie with several believable scenes, but damn, I was disappointed. I think the name should have been Camping 101, or something like that. Well, in any case, stay away from this movie. It is numb to death. Do not be afraid of a big leg, be afraid of this crap !!
