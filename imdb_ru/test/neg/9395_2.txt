This film was completely unhealthy, disturbing and unsatisfactory. Apart from a few good pictures of Italy, there is nothing to recommend this film. As usual, Hollywood draws the wrong conclusion from a ruined existence - the guy you meet, you sleep with, knowing a few hours, must be Mr. True. As for humor, there’s something in the film, but I don’t understand how someone would call it romantic _comedy_, since about three-quarters of the film is completely depressing! My recommendation? Skip it in cinemas, wait until it comes out on DVD, then skip it there. I want someone to give me back the two hours I wasted watching this nap, fool, dross.
