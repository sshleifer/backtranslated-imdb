While I am writing this, there are no user reviews yet, but there are 17 votes with an average of 4.8, so obviously some people thought that this film had its own moments. I didn’t notice anything, and even if I had, I don’t think I could stop rolling my eyes long enough to appreciate them. <br /> <br /> A common discussion among movie lovers is whether serious mistakes in science, police tactics, and the like, so common in films “B,” should significantly distract from pleasure. I tend to fall into the camp "Yes, this is a reasonable response" - especially when mistakes are central to the plot. With this film, I look forward to reading how anyone can protect this mess. They completely defile virtually all aspects of military tactics and strategy, police tactics, weapons, science, folklore, common sense, and human behavior (that is, outside of films “B”). In short, I can not think of any trivial thing that they got right. <br /> <br /> Any film will be deprived of its work when its central premise is a supernatural spirit, impenetrable to all types of small arms, capable of disappearing in another dimension at will, and yet apparently vulnerable to just a bigger explosion. . (They don’t make ghosts like they did before.) Combine this premise with every detail error, and you will have an unforgettably bad movie.
