This show was held live throughout the country with a variety of actors. I first saw him staged by Provincetown the first summer when he was in P-town (2001) - before, oddly enough, he was banned from this overwhelming gay resort (since then the codes that led him to closing, have been changed). Later, I saw it again at the all-around in New York. Strangely enough, the production in P-town was much better than in New York - fresher, more attractive, more energetic and funnier - but that was only in 2001; Subsequent attempts to clone production (“Naked guys in 2007”) were clearly the third. In this film, the cast of Los Angeles, and, as noted in other comments, he is not the best. I would appreciate it somewhere between the 2001 P-town first-class products and the P-town show of the third “Naked Boys” variety of last summer.
