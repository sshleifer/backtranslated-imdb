Although Charlie Chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910s, others didn’t quite do it right. Examples such as “His New Work” and “Shanghaiide” are remembered, and I would also call “Polohod” in this category. <br /> <br /> Charlie is mistaken for a department store manager (and vice versa). This manager is trying to steal money from the cash register and run away, and Charlie is just an honest client, but he is accused of missing some items stolen by other clients. <br /> <br /> There are not so many of them. laughs at this, except for the last few minutes or so with some wonderful scenes on the escalator. The rest is very disappointing. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
