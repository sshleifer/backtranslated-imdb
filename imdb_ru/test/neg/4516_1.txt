This is really terrible. I just received a copy of Disco Beaver from Space, having heard good words about it, and I must say that it was incredibly unfunny and bad, so you are stunned and confused by how it happened. /> <br /> I mean, what was that? Is this the typical humor of the late 70s? I do not think so. It's just so bad, and believe me, I don't mean "so bad, it's good." This is a collection of extremely funny parodies, as if you were watching cable TV. Of course, it was the HBO program, and to think that it could be considered innovative, scary. <br /> <br /> There is one pretty pretty girl in it, and there are some old NHL shots dedicated to hockey for the New York Islanders. a team that is interesting to see, even though I am a lifelong NY Rangers fan. But they even messed it up by trying to get the humor out of two ice hockey players, as if they were “dancing”, and, worse, turning the videotape of two ice hockey players, fighting to make them look like they had sex. Oh, how funny In one small trick there is an interview with a hockey player named "Chico", who reminds New York Islanders goalkeeper Chico Resh, but they even blew it up, forcing him to wear a Rangers jersey! Well, maybe it was intentional, who knows. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that Disco Beaver is just awful, so incredibly bad, you will definitely feel cheated after watching this and spending almost an hour of your life. You wonder what might have made the creators of this garbage think that they had something funny here, and you also wonder why these parodies can't even come close to the worst splash of Saturday night. Incredible. Just unbelieveble.
