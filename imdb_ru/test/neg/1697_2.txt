Forced, shy, formulaic. Do these adjectives make you want to run to rent it? Miriam Hopkins was gorgeous in the original "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." Several of her other early films, in particular, Drake Temple History, are never shown, but they are said to be great. <br /> <br /> Here she is cute, domineering and completely unattractive. Ray Milland, like the Greeniwch Village bohemian, is far from convincing. <br /> <br /> Two child performers are creepy and have no relation to the village, as it was then. <br /> <br /> Speaking as a Greenwich Village native, I find the setting ersatz, versatile and fake. Not that I had been around for a couple of generations, but my relatives were there in 1937. It's not funny. It is not truly remote. We do not care about the characters. <br /> <br /> At that time, many films were made about the fighting masses against the capitalists and made with Alan. "Easy life" comes to mind. This did not happen in the Village. But it sounds very true. It is ringing with a thud.
