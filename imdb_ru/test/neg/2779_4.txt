First, I'm over forty. Since childhood I have watched horror movies, so I saw a lot of variety. IMO, it's not as bad as a lot of people who gave it 1 or 2. <br /> <br /> Yes, itâ€™s a click of horror with a low budget. Dialogue sucks and acts tolerantly, sometimes. The plot of this film is actually pretty good. For those of you who are old enough to remember or fortunate enough to have seen them on DVD. This is very similar to the 1970s movie of the week. Just add to the blood and minor blood, minor T & A and swearing, without big names. That is, for T. I would rather watch this than Jason vs. Godzilla or something else that is there. Although not so good, EVIL DEAD was a LOW budget movie. At least pay tribute to these guys for trying. With a couple's MIL budget, this could be a pretty good click. My rating is watchable 4.
