Not very good. - Not at all. <br /> <br /> This issue tells about the origin of the killer in Amityville's house, who must see his past in order to get rid of Amityvilleâ€™s nightmarish terror. <br /> <br /> This is basically nothing. I bet that this movie was made for an extra quick purchase of money to buy a boat or something ... because this is just ridiculous ... Fortunately, it does not kill or destroy the series, but it simply does not affect the series at all. <br /> <br /> I have to say that only the fact that he constantly refers to an old, infamous house is probably the only thing that makes this house a little more tolerant than Amityville. A curse".
