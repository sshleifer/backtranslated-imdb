To be fair, several years have passed since I looked at the bile given to celluloid, known as “Here on Earth”, so forgive me if my memory of the film is a bit sketchy. I will focus on the main points that plague the soul of the unfortunate viewer. <br /> <br /> Scene One: Chris Klein, after being thrown out of the preparatory school (because he looks like a seventeen-year-old ... yes, very likely), gives me what I assume is his farewell speech. .. in field. Let me repeat that for you - the field. I think we should be touched by a combination of shame and eloquence that he cannot express. Klein has a delivery and facial expression from a cardboard cutout. He is a decent looking piece of cardboard, but a bit bigger. <br /> <br /> Scene Two: After some happy and teenage pyromaniac jokes, Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett cause some damage to the local diner, which is why he has to rebuild. Of course. Because who better will help with the construction than any random moron who crashed into it / burned in the first place. Better yet, let's say that a random jerk approached Josh Hartnett's girlfriend, Miss Sobieski, the girl he fell in love with ... her equally wooden delivery? <br /> <br /> Scene Three: Chris Klein's character deals with Lily Sobieski's character and decides to name her various body parts in honor of the states on the east coast. My soul is crying. Indeed, how can this scenario be good? Of course, you have to push several million people away if you mean that their home is equivalent to the more ... er ... feminine places of Miss Sobieski. Secondly, naming her breasts after New York and New Jersey causes some confusion as to whether Miss Sobieski is strangely disproportionate. <br /> <br /> Scene Four: Lily is running. She falls It gives her ... cancer of the knee. “We always knew that this could come back,” says her father (?). Right. Cancer of the knee. From stumbling. Maybe I missed something. As I said, several years have passed. Of course, I missed something. Is not it? For the love of God, please tell me that the girl did not suffer from knee cancer. <br /> <br /> This scream you just heard is the death of my soul.
