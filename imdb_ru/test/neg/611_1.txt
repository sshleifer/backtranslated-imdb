I am very diplomatic in my reviews and, as an academic writer, I try to give a creative license to television writers who are trying to explain a true story. This story about Karen Carpenter might have helped a lot, but because of the direction and editing, it doesn't help. <br /> <br /> In this case, the story is not fully understood, unless you read the psychological journals. While Cynthia Gibb portrays the realistic Karen, it's sad that so much has been edited ... Louise Fletcher portrays her mother and does an excellent job, with limited material and dialogue. In this case, I pay tribute to the actors for their survival in this project. <br /> <br /> Why are audiences not allowed to see causality factors? .... The American audience is smart enough, and if they have a telegram, usually educated. <br /> <br /> I sincerely feel that I could write a better story, would not edit the truth and allow actors to project reality. <br /> <br /> Richard Carpenter, as a director, seriously underestimated and insulted an American audience. Karen's story is important, and, unfortunately, we will never hear it.
