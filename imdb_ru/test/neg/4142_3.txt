This film was a full assignment. There was no development of the story. The audience was thrown into the plot without explanation and forced to try to figure out what was going on. The sequence of actions was fine, but confusing. They were not the Matrix and were not the Crouching Tigers. This movie is best left on cable TV, where you donâ€™t have to pay to watch it or convince a friend that they need to hire it, and then go see it. As a huge fan of Jet Li, I expected more. How can someone associated with Once Upon a Time in China put his name on this ???
