Let me say that this new cartoon He-Man does not destroy childhood memories, since I did not like the old cartoon He-Man. I liked the action figures, but I found that the cartoon was commonplace, and I hated the plot. was a barbarian, the Sword of Power was divided into two parts, and there was no Prince Adam, the premises of Shazam-robber and Orco). In any case, let's leave the old stuff alone. <br /> <br /> The new He-Man cartoon (or at least this pilot) is in itself a disgrace, as it represents the worst swagger of the old show, and the worst trends these days. I watched it because I heard that the morality of the old show disappeared (fortunately), and it had more sword playing and character development. But I was faced with a terrible jumble of the worst clichés of the genre, characters I couldn't help hating, and the sadly inevitable visual style in the Matrix style. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good idea to give a little background to the characters, as shown by the skeleton clearing in front of the face, but this is how far character development progresses, apart from the usual litter coming of age, which I I see in the next episodes where the teenager Adam will study the responsibility of his new abilities, blah blah. At least in the old show, Adam was not a spoiled boy! I found that I hate his guts. This is what we get when they arrange an adventure show designed for teenagers: cute faces and clothes “I want to be cool and look young.” I have to check out new episodes to see if N'Sync will appear in a special way. Dude, this show reminds me of the 1996 Gordon Flash Bomb! <br /> <br /> Dialogue? Ha! It follows absolutely every cliché in the book, from the good Randor in the initial scene to the immortal Skeletor "Oh, and he-Man ... I lied!" in the final. And the voice of Skeletor is still as high as in the old series. 20 years, and we have not learned anything. <br /> <br /> And, of course, in our time there can not be something that is connected with actions, but not in the style of Matrix. Leave anime to the Japanese guys, come up with fresh ideas. And to see the poses of the characters during the battle did not help either. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have the usual dose of PCness: Angry Lin (now I think about it, who the hell comes up with these names?) now has no yellow skin, but gray. Oh, so no Asian people will be offended. I bet jitsu will not appear on the show either. Again the shadows of FG 1996, where Ming the Ruthless was green, like a toad alien! <br /> <br /> People complain about Kringer's lack of speech. I do not think I would like it more or less if Kringer spoke, he is quite banal in that sense. And you have an extra supply of cheese with Orko! It’s shocking that probably many of those who (rightly) hated Jar Jar Binks can be huge Orco fans ... <br /> <br /> I watched a full-length pilot, and I’ve had enough of that. Leave the show alone. 2 out of 10.
