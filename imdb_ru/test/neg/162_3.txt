I just finished watching “The Edge of Love” (by the way, this is one of the worst titles this year), and it was like a routine. Seeing Kerae Knightley’s unsightly, skeletal-like character made me cringe even more in the rough movie. <br /> <br /> It took me four nights to watch this, it was so boring. The only good thing about this was Cillian Murphy. He is always good / believable and in many films is greatly underestimated. This, however, was simply not enough for him. <br /> <br /> In addition to unattractive characters, a boring storyline, the plot was also emotionally unsatisfactory. I felt like I was spending time watching this gift (which I did). I had to do a clever thing and turn it off, but I held it out of respect for Cillian Murphy and great cinematography.
