Disney's stupid film about a college student who accidentally discovered a potion that makes things invisible. Not a bad idea, and some special effects are pretty good. However, the script is VERY bad ... all the jokes fail, and the game is disgusting. Everyone is trying to be funny, but they are not. A real boring Disney movie. But it was fun to see Kurt Russell so young.
