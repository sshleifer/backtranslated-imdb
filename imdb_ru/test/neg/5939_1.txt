If Andrei Tarkovsky was a hacker, he would have sent Mother and Son instead of a Mirror. I am convinced that this is the most pretentious film, shot anywhere in the world. A son without a name takes care of his mother without a name. I think they love each other. No, I'm not sure. These are not characters. They are not even actors playing characters. At the very least, it can be beautiful, but even nature seems ridiculously corrected and modified wherever it was needed with a Macintosh computer. And could Sokurov come up with such a battered technique as a distorted aspect? You should have been born yesterday to buy this garbage. 1/10
