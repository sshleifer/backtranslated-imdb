It was good, but really a little disappointing, because I expected more laughter. Given the storyline and the main actor (Bill Murray), everything should be much funnier than it turned out. Only a part of this made me really laugh, for example, when Murray lost control of his convenience food and rushed along the road at a strange angle. (You have to see it in order to appreciate it.) <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was not just a nice person. Just look at the selection of names: Matthew McConaughey, Jane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yecch! The role of McConaughey in this movie “Tip Tucker” was just annoying. He was the worst. <br /> <br /> In addition to these people, there were some charming moments in the film, but on the whole it is not recommended. This is another Disney flop.
