I always wanted to watch a movie because I loved a novel, but I was warned because I heard that the movie was ugly. It. Fowles wrote the script, and I could follow it well, despite the fact that I read the novel more than thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is amazing - it makes noise, it rings and is completely inappropriate - it breaks any attempt in secret or mood in the film. I suspect that the director should take most of the blame, because even Michael Kane is terrible at this, and he did an excellent job at ALFIE a couple of years ago. <br /> <br /> “Secrets” caused by the book are not very well translated to the screen. I would like to see someone redo this.
