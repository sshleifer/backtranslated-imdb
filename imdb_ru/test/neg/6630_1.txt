Should I expect anything other than putrid from the carrot top? It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. This is the worst comedy I've ever seen. The “Chairman of the Board” did not add humor to my attitude; rather, it enraged me. That's right, Carrot Top is such a bad comedian that I got angry that this man is acting in a movie.
