Hey, if people thought Ed Wood was a bad director, they never saw the movie at all. I mean that there were gaping holes in the plot and under the cast. Cheesy special effects. I mean, I can't believe this movie came out of a Hollywood studio. A high school drum club could probably offer the best product. I mean, they had Erika Eleniak, great Casper van Dien and an actor with low marks. Their agents must be shot to ask them to subscribe to this dribble if they do not read the scripts. I still can not believe that the tiny lister survived in the film, which I constantly beat on the head, why he, and not a descendant of the Helsing van, was the last person to stand. I am a fan of vampire films, and this is by far the worst thing they have to put on the map so that he will never see the light.
