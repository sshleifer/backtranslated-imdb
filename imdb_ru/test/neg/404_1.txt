I watched this movie based on the comments of several people who said it was bad, but funny. But you must be warned that this film has the worst special effects ever produced. They make science fiction films of the 1950s look like works of art. Sometimes it's funny, but mostly annoying. And to exacerbate the problem with seriously pretentious special effects is the complete lack of logic that is characteristic of most of the events depicted. One of my favorites is when three characters fall hundreds of feet into the tunnel created by the arachnia and come to find it fully lit. Obviously, arachnias also managed to connect to the mains. Very impressive. But this is just one example. And no matter what it costs, the music sucks, acting sucks, two cute girls annoy, unpleasant guy annoys, the so-called handsome leading man is a geek, and the black girl who falls in love with him is a fool. Her father is the worst actor I've ever seen. I'm not sure that short moments of humor can make up for this experience.
