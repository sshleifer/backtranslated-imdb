Tired, distorted garbage. The chemistry between Argento and Madsen was as exciting as a wet donut. Their dialogue was completely uninteresting. The storyline was erratic. Acting forced. Cinematography lingered on not inspired. Lazy and senseless. Kim Gordon and her character had no reason to be there. No one else for that matter. I could not give two bunches for any of the "characters". Their emotions jumped and jumped like an addict who hates his heroin. Empty and boring. Why should I write here ten lines of text to express my point of view? I think I summarized it in the first three words. But obviously, this is not enough. I think this is the last time I spend time criticizing the film. Anyway, I saw “Clean” and thought that this was also rather inefficient. Again, I didn't care about the characters, whether they lived or died.
