The film sounds like this: run, run, someone is killed, worries a lot, and then one of the groups shouts “Get it together” or “Just calm down!” Repeat this as many times as there are characters left. In between these things, you get a blank black screen. It is not fast, but a few seconds. I kept thinking that the film was a waste every time it happened - yes, it happens more than once if you can believe it. <br /> <br /> I notice the other mentioned "Blair the Witch: and it really reminded me the camera was jovial. However, this film takes it to the extreme. Every time the characters move, the camera jumps. Sometimes it’s so that you can invent or talk about what you are looking at, leads us to the lighting, it’s too dark in some places, I understand that they are trying to make us feel that we are in a cave, but damn it ... I’m watching a movie here, it would be nice to be able to see. <br /> <br /> Then there is an end. I actually r romko blurted out: “Are you kidding me ?!” In this place of the movie you could see how the “monster” was picking at the nose, and that would be a minus the Idea “twist.” Really badly you were warned.
