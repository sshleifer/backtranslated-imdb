I wasted my time. This is a very pretentious movie. In the beginning you will think that something is happening, but by the time it takes about 30 minutes, you will understand that nothing is happening. I waited another 20 minutes, and by that time I was so upset that I started reading the reviews on IMDb and realized that the director had spent so much precious time. <br /> <br /> An incredibly boring, meaningless movie. Stay away. So many good soundtracks. I will give one point for the joke of a police inspector, because it worked for me. I laughed for a long time, but otherwise a very bad movie. Stay away. 1 to 10
