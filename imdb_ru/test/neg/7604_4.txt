This was a real disappointment to me. The original “Bride with white hair” is a great fantasy movie about kung fu, but this one was pretty weak. I was not at all worried about the new characters, who unfortunately dominated the screen, and the story was not well developed. While the first film was tragic, and with the participation of this was tiring (because I just thought the time until the end, when the ill-fated lovers really meet). The action was poor and in this. The battles were not very well placed, and kung-fi actually did not exist at all. Just a few weak sword fights between the extremely unattractive Louis and one of Lean's henchmen. Lin herself basically uses a kind of telekinesis to throw people at the walls, and sometimes her hair, which is far from an impressive show with whip and kung fu, which she showed in the previous film. I still gave this movie 4, because at least it was fast paced, and I really wanted to see what happened at the end, although I (like most of those who watched the first movie) predicted that everything would not go as before. and, having seen it, I found it to be anti-climatic, and I wanted them to either make the right sequel, or simply leave the story alone. I really recommend the first one, but as for the sequel, only fans of the genre and those who really want to see Linya as a bride can apply.
