No doubt this is the worst movie I've ever seen. And believe me, I've seen a lot of movies. The incredible twist of the film makes the transition from an extremely bad movie "Alien Life Forms Dwell on Earth" with a disgusting bad action to a film that the archihrians are trying to spread. I was stunned after 85 minutes of torment. Even religious Christians should be ashamed or angry to see how their beliefs are published in this way. I didnâ€™t know what to do with myself when I watched the terrible game that 7-year-olds could play Children. Simply disgusting. I am not a Christian and not very religious. But if I were, I would no longer fear hell. Rich Christian showed something much, much worse.
