Of all the bad comments about this movie and their addition, I feel the same. It may seem that the Australians are weak, not brave soldiers. In this film it was very terrible and too vivid. I did not see enough heroism, only more cowardice, which is embarrassing, because this is nothing I read. We do not need extreme violence, so we can use our bright imagination of what they went through. This is similar to the salvation of Private Ryan when the Nazi slowly pushes his knife at the soldier. For example, Mel Gibson is excessively directing his films not because of violence, but because of the level of historical inaccuracy. The Iwo Jima Letters was one of the war films that was fairly close to history (although I could be wrong), with the exception of our fathers flags and the bridge across the River Kwai. You better read it, it is an insult to the victims and the fallen, if you donâ€™t say it correctly, and the film drags on for too long, there was nothing interesting in the dialogue and there was not enough aussi retribution to kill the Japanese soldiers. Just read the story on the Internet, in magazines and in books. Films always kill a sense of realization. What they did with the prisoners of war in Singapore and the Philippines was terrible for civilians. I'm just proud that tidbits defeat villains, but such films destroy it.
