Was the college acting class shot and shot? Formula posture and stylized wacky horror series for people who do not like horror movies, but want to tell their friends that they really watched a horror movie. It even sounds music from the soap opera. <br /> <br /> Do books falling from library shelves scare? Is it scary to close the door? Then this movie is for you. Have you ever been abducted? Yes, most of us do. When you were raped, was it just ignored because the rapist was a cool kid? What is scary is not a film, but the directorâ€™s view of the world. <br /> <br /> And then the small corners are not even original. This is a film for people who have never seen a horror movie before, who do not want to see it now, and who want to see another film about how everyone is conspiring against a strange child.
