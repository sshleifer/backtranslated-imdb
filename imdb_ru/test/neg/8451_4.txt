** SPOILERS ** With the name of the movie with the name of the killer fish twice, more than once you expect to see them in battle, biting and playing almost all of the characters. Instead, you will have to wait until the movie is almost over, so that you can see as much as possible about Piranh. Even then, all you see is that the water is bubbling and bubbling around when the poor man disappears beneath him, suggesting that the fish eat him whole and alive. <br /> <br /> The Piranha Piranha movie begins with this. It is terrible to watch Piranha on the screen when the captions start to roll, but **** SPOILER ****, this is the only time in the movie you ever either you can see the killer fish or the fish that you will never see Piranha is a movie again. What you see is the journey of Venezuela, its inhabitants and the Venezuelan jungle along the Amazon. Together with many beautiful and breathtaking photos of the landscape, as well as people and wildlife, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> There is some story related to this great White Caribe Hunter, William Smith, which ironically means “Piranha” in their native language, where they say whether it really meant the name of the film “Piranha Piranha"? "Caribe Caribe"! In the role of Karibe, the legendary biker Hollywood Hell's Angles and tough guy William Smith are playing. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, this is a trio of American tourists Jim Pendrake and his sister Terry, Peter Bown and Ahna Capri. and their American guide, Art Green, Tom Simcox, head into the Venezuelan jungle to see the sights Terry takes to send home. Terry is terrified of a weapon when we find out that a young girl saw her father tear off his head with a pistol. Even when Art saves her life, using one when the C attack with a diamond rattlesnake six feet long Terry almost props him for having a gun; which he promised her he would not take with him on the trip. <br /> <br /> At a bus stop in the jungle or in a bar, three of them flee to the Carib, which we saw for the first time, catching monkeys in the jungle at the beginning. the movie. Caribe is most welcomed by his knowledge of the jungle and his semi-dry philosophy of life and death, as well as the ability to take them where they go to the local diamond mines in the depths of the Amazon. <Br /> <br /> Despite the fact that at first he is a bit strange, he is so self-confident that he doesn’t seem to notice that there are any people around him, and Caribe is a kind and pleasant guy, involved in and friendly motorcycle races through swamps and jungles from art. Caribe even shows Terry, who once in the film almost knocked out his teeth, the subtleties of hunting and wild hunting and shooting, which he believes do not actually die, but become part of him after he kills them! A little crazy, but you have to admit that this guy has an imagination. <br /> <br /> Much later in the film, for some strange reason, maybe it was a cheap drink he drank, Caribe suddenly goes crazy and becomes a murderer, attacking and raping Terry, and then killing her angry brother and feeding his deadly piranha. Trying to escape from a rampaging madman, and then being forced to fight him, Arta beats up the fiercely fighting Caribe so cruelly that he almost fainted. At that moment, when Karibe was finally going to kill Art, he was shot dead by Terry, who, having experienced what crazy crazy work was, finally decided that the weapon was really very necessary and should be used for murder in very rare but life-saving cases. br /> <br /> It is worth seeing, if at all worth seeing, just the landscape and nothing else. It's just a shame that the film should be advertised as a killer fish, or Piranha, a horror film, when, if he was honest about himself, it could be a more or less usual jungle adventure with Smith, he does have an assembly for it. playing Tarzan Venezuelan, not African, Jungle
