When I put this movie in my DVD player and sat down with Coke and chips, I had some expectations. I was hoping that this film would contain some of the strengths of the first film: amazing animation, nice smooth plot, great voice, funny comedy and amazing soundtrack. But, to my disappointment, nothing like this can be found in Atlantis: the return of Milo. If I first read a few reviews, I would not be so disappointed. The next paragraph will be addressed to those who watched the first film and who liked it primarily because of the moments mentioned. <br /> <br /> When the first scene appears, you will be shocked if you have just chosen Atlantis: Returning Milo from a shop window in your local video store (or somewhere else) and met my expectations. Music is perceived as a bad imitation of the first film, and the vocal composition was replaced with a less appropriate one. (Except for a few characters, like Sweet's voice). The actual drawings are not so bad, but the animation, in particular, is a sad picture. The storyline is also rather weak, as it looks more like the three episodes of Scooby-Doo than the one adventure story that we received last time. But don't get me wrong, these are not very good episodes of Schooby-Doo. I never laughed once, although I could laugh once or twice. <br /> <br /> For viewers who have not seen the first film or do not particularly care about such a sequel, here is a quick review of this film as a separate product: if you like schooby-doo, you may like this movie. If you did not, you could still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do. And I suspect that this may be a good children's film, but I would not know. Perhaps it would be better if Milo's Return was a three-episode series on a cartoon channel or on TV at breakfast.
