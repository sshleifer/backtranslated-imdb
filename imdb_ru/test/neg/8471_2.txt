I watched this cooking show several times before I wanted to pull out my hair. Only one question ..... Who CANNOT cook a slap in the form of a simple meal in 30 minutes, when everything that you need is already in hand in bags, sometimes pre-sliced, and you have very little left to do but cut some greens . In addition, almost every culinary show on TV lasts 30 minutes, and most of these chefs do all their preparatory work (with the exception of Sandra Lee) during their show. Yes, yes ... they eat nourishing too. <br /> <br /> I like the comment of the guy who hated the comment "EVOO". Add "DE-LISH" to my list of stupid words. <br /> <br /> Then you have the obvious .... A loud, sociable woman who really is her very best audience. She laughs at her unconvincing comments, circles too much for the camera, because she wants to convince us that she is as good as she thinks. <br /> <br /> NO, she is not the sweetest thing. She is a 40-year-old woman who is not in English.
