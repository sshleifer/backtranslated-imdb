I just watched Congo on a DVD. In most cases, I love such films, but this one is different. This made me write my first IMDb movie commentary. I was amazed how such a team of experienced directors could create this film. You can see that there was a lot of money for this production, but you cannot make a good film if you do not have a good script. And as a producer, Frank Marshall gave us a lot of great movies to watch; he should never have tried to become another Spielberg. It shows how difficult it is to make a good movie, maybe you have all the ingredients, but if you can't cook, stay away from the kitchen. If you can make an offer, do not spend your money on it. If you want to see it, first watch it on TV and decide for yourself.
