Pretty lame Tiny from Brisbane. While the plot is based on a fairly decent idea, writing is deeply lame, and two of the three main teenagers are ridiculously wooden. The problem is that in order for the children to fulfill their plan, they should be much more reckless than shown, but if they were so devil-may-be, it would be difficult for them to be pretty, so they ended up not really. Actually, I just started enjoying the movie when I started wishing for their death. One of those films where about a thousand places is the most reasonable option - call the police. I understand that we would not have a film if they were, but it would be nice if we could believe that they really would not. Avoid.
