As a geologist student, this film portrays the ignorance of Hollywood. In a scene where a dog grabs a bone from inside a burning house, it is less than a foot from the lava, the average temperature of which is 1750 degrees Fahrenheit. This nonsense is again witnessed when the “Stan” is sent to rescue Metro 4. His shoes are melting on the subway floor, while the rest of the team is standing a few steps from the current lava. And to end this film monster, they came up with the most illogical solution - to stop the flow of lava with the help of cement rails. Earlier in the film, the voice of journalists, who say that nothing can stop the flow of firemen trying cars and cement, is heard. Common sense dictates that this film is a ridiculous and crude understatement of human knowledge.
