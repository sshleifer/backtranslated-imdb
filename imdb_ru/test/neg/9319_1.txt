Well, I remember when the studio sacked Schrader and hired Harlin to make this film, they were absolutely right. <br /> <br /> Dominion: the exorcist's prequel is just a bad movie, it's boring, it really is. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice to think that the studio had set aside a psychological masterpiece and that all those who so loudly condemned Harlinâ€™s version and praised Schreders, even if no one had ever seen her, it would be correct. <br /> <br /> But they were not. <br /> <br /> In short, Schroeder has no idea what a horror movie should be, and it shows in a big way. <br /> <br /> Droll, boring, unintentionally funny in all the wrong places and a bad cast. <br /> <br /> Save your money and nerves, I do not see it.
