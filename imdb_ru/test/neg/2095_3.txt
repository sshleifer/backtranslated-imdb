Snakes on the train (2006, dir. Mallachi Brothers) The curse of the zombies imposed on a woman, because of which live snakes live in her. Brujo, who looks after her, is trying to take her to Los Angeles by train. After several collisions in the train, the Brukho snake collection manages to separate from its owner and go hunting. While all this is happening, normal, ordinary passengers relax, but they do not know that something deadly is going to meet them, and that they are not, they are not. <br /> <br /> After they looked at the amazingly funny snakes on the plane, “I had to check it out. I knew that it would be rip-off and that the film would look cheap, but what I found was the worst to watch. The whole plot of the curse was stupid and should never have been included. Special effects are not terrible, but do not look better. I had no idea about the ending. Watch was stupid and pathetic. The game was absolutely terrible and looked bad. They simply could not act to save their lives. If you want to laugh hard, watch this, otherwise you should really avoid it. <br /> <br /> “We have a runaway train. I repeat. We have a runaway train. ” - Conductor (Stephen A.F. Day)
