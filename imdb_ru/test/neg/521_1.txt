Boring, ridicule and stupid "flooded" waste of time. The shootings were a joke, real people do not just stand out in the open air without any cover, hoping to get the first shot! So much of everything bad or bad is not worth listing, except for one major flaw. At 500 miles per hour for 20 minutes = approximately 166 miles west of LA, and the water depth is 100 feet ??? Even so, none of the people would have survived decompression from the effects of 100-foot water pressure for more than 20 hours when they were brought up. Just awful
