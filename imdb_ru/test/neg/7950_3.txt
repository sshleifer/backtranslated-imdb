I found this movie in a XXX store for $ 1 on VHS. Interestingly, Camp Video bought the rights to it and added the 1986 rewriting date to the lists. In any case, quite strange facts. <br /> <br /> This film is absolutely not scary. Even to call this horror or “thriller” is ridiculous. There was no more than 5 minutes of what you would call horror in this 80-minute film, and that was action, because it was AWFUL! Not to mention the puns, the writing of this film was absolute garbage, just as the special effects and makeup were ridiculous. No wonder that this is such an obscure film, the director probably spent the last 35 years, searching the country for all its existing copies and burning them into one big pile so that no one else could undergo it.
