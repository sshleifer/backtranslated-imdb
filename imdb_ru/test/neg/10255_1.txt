I really don’t know why so many people love this film: perhaps it’s funny, good, but it completely destroyed one of the best novels ever written. As the author himself said, this film betrayed the book: not only the plot was brutally cut to about 1/3, but all the characters, all the complexity, everything is lost in the 80s fantasy / adventure film for children, Today we have effects, directors, new attention to books: I hope that someone (Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, Hayao Miyazaki ...) will someday become a director of a REAL infinite story. The great dead writer, a wonderful book, and many literature lovers deserve it.
