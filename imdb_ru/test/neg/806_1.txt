Who is responsible for these "backstage" things? Who are these actors? did they crawl out from under the rocks? "Jokes, lots of jokes!" not. not funny for me. only disgust and shame that I am a man. I have to look away from the set, it's so awkward. in fact, I changed the channel. <br /> <br /> I always had problems with non-stop Robin Williams ratings, I forgot about my current lithium diet, but at least it's funny once in a blue moon. looking at someone who is not funny at all, impersonating Robin Williams, is like slowly and sadistically pulling every tooth in your head without novocaine for all eternity. <br /> <br /> Please stop making these absolutely terrible TV movies. You are welcome.
