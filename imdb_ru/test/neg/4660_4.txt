I watched this movie about six years ago, and recently I did it again. If I remember correctly, I did not like it the first time, and I appreciated it a little more the second time. <br /> <br /> This film is clearly on a big budget. The effects are mostly top notch (with the exception of one or two “beats”), and the cast is impressive. However, there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the show. <br /> <br /> First, the one who decided that Peter Stormare should act like a crazy Russian cosmonaut should be fired. Being a Swede and a fan of Peter, I am sure that he can play a good Russian character. But his actions in this case are simply stupid, both with regard to the lines expressed and with respect to the actors. So ... something must be wrong with the script. Instead, I would like to see Peter as a professional Russian astronaut. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the action scenes that take place on the surface are so intense that it is almost unbearable to look at them. This is a complete chaos that lasts more than thirty minutes and is too short to catch my breath. In addition, the unfolding events are simply not credible. I would like to see a much more reasonable and trimmed version of this part of the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, scenes involving flying space shuttles are too biased. Shuttles maneuver as if they were a pair of MIGs, at a zero safe distance, bouncing off car-sized ice blocks, such as ping-pong balls. The director should watch Apollo 13 to learn about spacecraft limitations like these. <br /> <br /> I like music because it’s pretty dramatic, which makes it very touching. The overall performance of the actors is great. In addition to the things mentioned above, the story is interesting and fairly simple to track. <br /> <br /> With some minor changes, this would be a 8/10 film. I'm sorry not!
