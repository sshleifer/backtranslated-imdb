I remember this bomb, released in the early 80s. At first it sounded like a great idea. Retelling American classics using modern cinematic techniques of the day. There have been some unpleasant blows about handling the original Lone Ranger, Clayton Moore. Film studio threatened legal action if Moore continued to portray himself as a real lone ranger. (Moore spoke at children's hospitals as a lonely ranger for sick children.) For many Americans, Clayton Moore was just that; one single lone ranger. I always felt that the studio could do justice to both the fans and the legacy of a lone ranger if Moore were treated better. Maybe even a cameo in a new movie. Be that as it may, this was not the case, and many of the spectators were left out. Also the story and acting was weak. All this made up a large cashier, and rightly so. Personally, I am glad that the studio has lost a lot of money after being treated with a real single assistant. You do not treat the American icon in this way.
