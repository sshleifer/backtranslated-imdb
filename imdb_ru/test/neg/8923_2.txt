I usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as watching a movie, but with Today You Die, I feel that this would be a waste of my time. <br /> <br /> So, here's five minute chatter about how bad this film is. <br /> <br /> In the mid-80s there was a time when one glance of Stephen Seagal was enough to break the ribs; a complete frown can knock you off your feet. If he really took possession of you, he would break you like a sprig. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, although it is still capable of causing significant damage, it no longer looks like a part. He went to the seed and just does not know when to throw it. He walks as if he is being thrown into his pants, but somehow he somehow manages to look constipated, and he has gained weight. His signature long tail has disappeared, but his hair still looks stupid. How this person continues to work in the film industry is beyond my comprehension. <br /> <br /> Today you die - this is the usual mix of Seagal, consisting of battles on the bones, car accidents, shootings and pyrotechnics. Seagal mumbled his boring script, producing his lines with zero enthusiasm or believability. In this third-level film, he plays Harlan Banks, a thief trying to go straight, who is deceived in a robbery for $ 20,000,000. He goes to prison, runs away and seeks revenge. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There are pretty good car chases and shootouts scattered around boring things (of which there are many), but reading other comments on IMDb showed that they were actually borrowed from other best films. In this film, Seagal also doubled his body. <br /> <br /> Seagal is filmed in one of the worst performances in his career ?? and it speaks of something, given the lousy "action" in some of his recent efforts. His most embarrassing attempt at Ebonics (African-American street slang) is the most fun. “Yeah, man, sho,” no, actually, Stephen, you look like an ass! With a ridiculous scenario and storylines that will not go anywhere, this film is a waste of time, money and effort. And the last moment, when Harlan Banks rescues the Children's Home from closing, enough to make you blow up the pieces. <br /> <br /> Damn, I just looked at my watch. I liked to smash this steaming pile of garbage so much that I spent five minutes. It's time to leave this comment and start looking at something decent.
