Well, at first a good thing: if you saw the trailer, then you know about 100% of the “scary / nervous” moment of the movie. And yes, this is good, because you should just stick to the trailer, and not go watch a movie. <br /> <br /> Now I understand why Sarah Michelle Gellar did not stay alive in this film for a very long time; she didn’t want to associate her name with this work. I wish her all the best in The Return. <br /> <br /> In this movie you have to follow 3 different stories, and all of them are disabled (in time and value) to the very end. And even then it is a very bad climax. And God forbid even open the door to another sequel. <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie, Rage and Rage is in motion. You no longer need to visit the house, just stay close to someone who is inside and everything is ready. This is no longer a curse, it's like a virus. Go inside the house, get scared, go back to the USA and share your joy in your apartment building. <br /> <br /> It's not that difficult to follow him, but you just don't care about anyone. The plot line is small and you have a lot of scenes in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head ... Milking someone ?? Last summer I saw Ju-On 2 at the Fantasia Film Festival, a completely different story, but much better than this fool. This is not a remake, but this time, maybe they should have just done a remake ... <br /> <br /> If you need it, wait for the DVD.
