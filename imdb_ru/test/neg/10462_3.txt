Construction workers are destroying the burial of Native Americans of a large, huge skeletal monster who destroys his victims with his touch, breath or bone sword! The main postman on the resort project, Krantz (Jim Storm) orders his construction team to keep the skeleton results secret, as much will stop further development if the neighboring Katon tribe catches the wind, which has rummaged and disturbed. The aging Bruce Boxleitner, as always cute, plays the role of a half-blooded sheriff Evans trying to keep the peace between the team of Katonas and Krantz. At best, the world was tense, but because of the uncontrolled running of a skeletal monster, as a result of which his victims disappeared without a trace, Krantz soon wants to get answers to questions about why his team members disappeared ... Evans also begins to lose citizens. Evans is warned by Katona's Main Thundercloud (Michael's Horse) that the ancient demon, the Bone-Eater, was weakened and could only be stopped by a sacred war ax (... the ax was removed by a worker who discovered that he was left with a weapon dropped from the inside) is now the back seat of his boyfriend Kelly (Clara Bryant, who wears tight jeans and shirts to show how her daddy turned into a pretty bright lady). Evans must somehow defeat the demon if the killing stops ... and this must happen before Eclipse, otherwise his power will become too strong for anyone to win. <br /> <br /> A solid actor who hesitates in awkward horror, CGI, is not very good, although a monster could be quite threatening if he did with a better budget. He rides a horse made of dust, chasing prey, for Petesake! Some episodic episodes include: BAK ROGERS, Jill Gerard as Deputy Evan, Big Jim, Walter Koenig from STAR TREK as Coroner, and William Katt from HOUSE, Country Doctor, Healing the Wounds of Deputy Evan. None of these cameos last more than one minute or so ... true, true. Adoni Maropis as the signatory role of Katona is Johnny Black Hawk, who wants to use the Bone-Eater to drive the white man out of his tribe's land. Jennifer Lee Wiggins portrays Kayu, a delicious dish of Cato's woman who opposes Black Hawk's hatred of a white man and wants Evans to follow his Indian blood in order to do away with the monster eating bones. It may be worth it to sit down if you just see Boxleitner dressed in military paint and Indian clothing. Honestly, I felt like an actor, because Bruce tries to remain cool in such a terrible movie. In another over-tired and tedious cliché, Bruce's sheriff has an estranged relationship with her daughter, who is 17 years old, she is hot and wants to meet the “bad guy” ... although eventually it becomes a signed story, like most of the story about the killing skeleton and many poorly developed characters.
