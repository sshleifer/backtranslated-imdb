Director and playwright Richard Day adapted his own stage material for the screen, clearly inspired by the real dilemma of Rock Hudson of the 1950s: what about the screen idol who is secretly homosexual? Marry an unsuspecting woman to suppress gossip (and make it work). Thin and subtle idea, endowed with energy thanks to a good throw and retro design, funny reminiscent of a postcard from Step. The dialogue is not very clever, and at the very beginning there is some kind of nonsense that does not work (spits out food, etc.). Nevertheless, when a serious tone sounds over the final act, it is processed with great taste - and the viewer welcomes him much more than all this dirty nonsense. Matt Letcher works well as a movie hero / male slut Guy Stone, but is his experience enough to enhance his character, or will he return to the bar the next night? Cinema does not seem to know - or care. Day wants to break away from a few one-liners and one carefully written prog speech - a call for tolerance - but he has no other agenda. For viewers who spend their time and interest on these people, a sentimental bow on this thing may look like nothing more than a joke. * 1/2 of ****
