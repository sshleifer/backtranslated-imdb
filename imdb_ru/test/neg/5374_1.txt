At first I tuned in to Paranormal State, because I (more or less) find the paranormal search genre an interesting television, if not more. <br /> <br /> I really like ghost hunters, because more than half of their research leads to full disclosure, and find Most Haunted to be funny using mediums and curvaceous British women with monotonic Paris Hilton fainting from fear / demonic presence is all in beautiful green night vision. <br /> <br /> Paranormal The state does not have this appeal. It seems that it was made up of “leashes” that the Ghost Hunters rejected. The episodes ranged from trailer families and single mothers with emo teenagers who sat idle and scared themselves to an “interview” with a 5-year-old child about a monster who lives in his room (as they say, the monster becomes RAWRRR). All these people are calling for a college club to solve their problems. The whole show is about Ryan and his partner, his huge ego. He leads his troupe with cross-eyed students, except when it’s considered “too extreme” and orders them to stay at the Hahaha Hotel. Better leave it at the discretion of the professionals, that is, yourself. <br /> <br /> The unintended comedy of this show is all about how gullible the participants are. Ryan tells that they hunted him, followed him, and so on. D. The Demon, whom he first encountered when the Catholic Church recruited him to help him. Sorry, but in the Catholic Church there are people who can do this, they do not need a day shift manager at Quiznos to throw their 2 cents. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible show, the shame of A & E for the bank is this nonsense, trying to follow in the footsteps of some much better paranormal shows. It's almost unintentionally funny, except that Ryan is so arrogant and devoid of charisma that watching the show long enough to make fun of him is not worth the trouble.
