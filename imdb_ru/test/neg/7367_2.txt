Since the second the music has swelled (the second part of the film), and it was a hacker film, I knew that a very long trip awaited me. Terribly cliché - (I laughed a lot and knew how the plot ended WELL to the end) - they did not use Luisburg very well, and the suit and hair were terrible. (My favorite moment of makeup is that, as far as I can tell, the only way they age Depardieu is to wear a wig with straight hair instead of wavy hair). I could talk for a long time about the ridiculous unsuitability of music - the film could have been greatly improved by the 18th century. <br /> <br /> (ETA: AH, this terrible guy from the movie Patrick Doyle is responsible for the bill - say no! He MUST NOT be allowed next to historical films - he must adhere to the settings of the 20th century.) br /> <br /> “A visit to a famous part of the people” was also fun, especially his little visit to Madame Pompadour, which was not particularly convincingly played. <br /> <br /> I thought that the only actor appearing in this century was Michael Maloney as James Murray. He absolutely stole the show for all 30 seconds that he was on the screen. Unfortunately, he made you see what a movie could be. <br /> <br /> Love scenes were a little hot — the two roles were amazing together. <br /> <br /> The worst scene for historians is where they are at a big dinner in Britain before Wolfe leaves, and he picks up his glass and says the first two lines: “How is the glass around?” or “Why are the soldiers why?” like it's a toast. An absolutely painful failure in historicity, it is much better not to pay attention to it. Thousands of people know this damn song, and thousands more believe the rumors that Wolfe and company sang it (probably drunk, not everyone is as stuffy as this band). Daft.
