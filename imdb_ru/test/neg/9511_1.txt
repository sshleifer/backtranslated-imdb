This is one of the joys of Shakespeare, that there can be no final speeches - not one performance can be “right”, but some can be wrong, and this is so. There are at least two things in Hamlet that cannot be avoided: 1. His indecision and inability to take any action. For God's sake, this is what makes the game last as long as it does. If you had Othello instead of Hamlet, Claudius would be dead by the end of the first act. Any production should try to explain why Hamlet postpones, why he is incapable of action. 2. His sexual aversion. His complete aversion to the idea that his mother and uncle are in bed fills him with a complete aversion to all sexual things, and this means that any relationship with Ophelia is impossible. At the slightest hint of sex Hamlet throws up. So what does Mel Gibson give us? Lustful fighter. You could not get further from the character of Hamlet, if you tried. There are many ways to play Hamlet, but this is not one of them! What I don’t understand is that they managed to find such good actors for other roles - Claudia, Polonius and so on, why they couldn’t find the one who would play Hamlet. Marc Rylans in the role would make this movie gorgeous. This "Mel Gibson", whoever he was, completely disappointed the other actors. And let's face it, Hamlet without a prince really doesn't work.
