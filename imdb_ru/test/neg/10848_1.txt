Do not buy this film for a comedic film like me, I did not find it a little ridiculous, but, damn it, miserable and lame, this is incredible. I gave it to a friend for Christmas, and it was pretty funny (for my part). I recently heard that he was watching him and told me that I was a pit! <br /> <br /> There is nothing more frustrating than looking at an illuminated, dramatic, badly voiced scene in which the camera sits on a tripod and does not move ... the work on the film is really pathetic, and I can only say, DO NOT LOOK THIS FILM !!!! !!!!!!!
