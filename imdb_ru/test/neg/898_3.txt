I do not quite understand Barnens O ?? This is one of the strangest, which I watched. Was the soundtrack pretty unusual too ?? written and performed by Jean Michel Jarre - it makes the film more strange than it was. I have to admit that I was almost going to change it and watch another instead of making the film seem silly or boring to me. or confusing. Is there a lot of sexual references in this movie? through them, too, something messed up. Probably the only phrase that I will remember from this will be: “When you are alone, can you control something” ?? and "I will show them" - or something like that. The boy in this film was obsessed with not growing up ?? "last summer as a child" he thought once ?? and he is sure that he lived to the maximum. So if you have a few free hours, can you watch this movie? but you will not be greatly bored if you are not.
