At first glance, this film looked as if it could be really good - it is not. <br /> <br /> The cast was pretty good, but most of them seemed to embarrass it all. The real disaster in this film is not the flood, but the script. He is trying to include all the cliches in the book, everything is done incredibly badly. The ending is very sharp, but it is a hidden blessing. Congratulations if you go that far. <br /> <br /> All three main male actors (Carlisle, Courtney and Suchet) will most certainly agree that this is the lowest point in their career. I hope that they were paid a lot of money, because none of their reputations went to the beat. <br /> <br /> The special effects are pretty good, but the same thing was done for a better effect in “The Day After Tomorrow”. <br /> <br /> In short, a meaningless exercise. Do not waste your time.
