My God, this film was nothing more than filmmaking by numbers. A struggling salesman can't handle this in New York, a mentor with a heart of gold takes him under his wing, a struggling salesman moves to California and makes him big, then loses him big, then returns to simple life, then hits the bottom, trying to return to the top. I don’t think I can remember any part of the plot that took more than five seconds to develop. Case in point (spoiler?): When John Kapelos’s character calls to say that he and his girlfriend are going to Santa Cruz, and James Woods says he has almost no chance of coming, you knew with 100% certainty that they would come next scene or two. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Sean Young, of course, looked good.
