Stupid show in the spirit of the rest of them with terrible music and a track of laughter, which should be from I Love Lucy. I got rid of the television because of such shows, but I took the first season in large quantities for $ 3.00. Had to buy a Van Damme movie. <br /> <br /> If I were a conspiracy theorist who believed that a small group of people was working against real families and continued to invent this nonsense / propaganda to undermine the family values ​​that I would have pointed out to this show children, family guy, etc., but I am not the same as I will not. <br /> <br /> By the way, I am not a Christian, I love the show “The Simpsons and Peep”. I watched two episodes and thought that if such shows are popular, then who are they popular with? Then I remembered all those photos of people from Walmart that circulated around the network, and thought: oh! It is not surprising that our culture is a joke all over the world when it is the right time.
