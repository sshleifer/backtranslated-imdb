The first thing I noticed, which allowed this culture to stand out among the rest, was during wakefulness in Sole. Aerial photography is used to show how Sola blooms from kisses by a sea of ​​women. I believed that it was a comment about the closeness that women had to each other in this culture - those who held together for generations, separation and misunderstanding, and was still able to connect and rely on each other. In addition, the film seemed to glorify women as almost flawless people. By impeccability, I mean that they did not suffer the consequences of their actions, and they were treated as if they had no flaws. An example of this is shortly after Paula accidentally killed her father. Her mother immediately comes to her aid and takes full responsibility for this act, while Paula seems to have little regret for what she did. Again, another example of this is when each daughter (or granddaughter) had the opportunity to reunite with her supposed “dead” mother (grandmother). Knowing the stresses that this most likely caused in their family, each of them still hugs the mother, not caring about what she did, that is, kills her husband and his lover. In this light, women are portrayed as those who not only love each other regardless of the character’s actions, but also those who are not disturbed by the actions of their friends / family members. <br /> <br /> Another idea that, in my opinion, intrigued this culture, concerned their idea of ​​the supernatural. With the death of Raimund’s mother and Sole and her inexplicable return, the director creates the emotions of the audience, believing that this film will embody the supernatural. The people depicted in this culture seem very supernatural, that is, they really want to believe that life exists beyond the grave. Their aunt, longtime girlfriend of Augustine, a prostitute and other people living in the city of La Mancha, believe rumors that the dead are returning to family members to finish the "unfinished business." I thought that this was a mixed reflection of the religious faith of the culture (mainly Catholic), as well as their need to correct themselves with those who had no chance of being forgiven during the time of mortality. The faith that they held for the living being “alive” also had to give hope to the disadvantaged circumstances that they suffered in mortality. When the viewer is confronted with the fact that this film is not supernatural at all, it is interesting to watch the role that the mother continues to play. She is treated as if she is still a ghost (that is, hiding in small crevices (under the bed or inside the trunk of a car)). I believe that the director portrayed the mother in such a way as to reinforce the already existing supernatural beliefs adopted by the city. The character of the mother seemed to be a metaphor for the city’s long-standing faith in life after death.
