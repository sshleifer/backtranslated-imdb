Bad game? Yes, but it was not a surprise. Stupid story? Yes, so what? <br /> <br /> But why, tell me, Mr. Director, why all this slow movement? The fighting scenes were bad, very bad due to the slow movement and poor cutting. Not because of Seagal. <br /> <br /> "What if I just sped it up for 2 seconds and then slowed down the next 5 seconds and then ... Maybe I need to flip a coin to decide?" What were you thinking, Mr. Director ???
