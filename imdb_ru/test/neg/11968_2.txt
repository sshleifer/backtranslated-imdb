Unfortunately, me and my friend watched it !!! It was shown on Sky channel here under the name “Evil Horror”, which basically shows the B-movies 24/7 crappy horror films. It was a boring Friday night, so I decided to laugh and take a look at it. In addition to the brutal game, the terrible plot, terrible effects, poor camera work and the mind-blowing absurdity of all this, everything was in order, LOL !!! In all seriousness, it was a pretty laugh, making holes in it and laughing at stupid actors. There is a bit of nudity that has revived the film a bit, unfortunately it was “ugg”, which became topless, as my partner calls her: oD If you are bored one evening and it happens during the game, take a chance You might like it :)
