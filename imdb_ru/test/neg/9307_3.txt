“Mr. Accident” is a deliberate series of unstoppable disasters and near death events reminiscent of the Warner Brothers Brother cartoons on Saturday morning. Like the coyote, which falls off a cliff 5 times per episode, the “lead” (more like an overgrown child) always manages to postpone his meeting with the Reaper Grimm. <br /> <br /> This Australian "surprise" is insultingly unmixed, and sometimes even depressing. 2 (out of ten) are intended for visual tricks (some have never been attempted by anyone since Daffy Duck) and using bright colors (as in these commercials for high-end washing powder). <br /> <br /> there may be an age group where this “comedy” finds the following. I definitely passed this age a long time. The appeal of all applicants: here's a ha-ha!
