Obviously, this is not intended for the brain: the so-called "humor" is based on farting and every cliche about any ethnic genre you can imagine, including gays, of course, if they are not WASP. And Latino cowrote it? In addition, John Leguizamo has talent and charisma, but in such a condescending film is a certain waste. What is the point of trying to get ahead of Jim Carrey Jim Carrey himself? The film "Pest" in the title can be as funny as the film Bergman. Get ready to be annoyed, not fun
