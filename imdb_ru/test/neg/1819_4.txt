This film would like to be a shocking, cerebral and tense film that many others have successfully completed in its genre, but this is not true. This is confusing and absurd at best. When the twists and turns finally showed up, instead of saying, “Aah, I understood!” I mumbled something like “Okay ... anything.” In my opinion, when the film reveals a serious plot twist, you do not need to use a sequence of memories to prove that it gives some clues that will allow the viewer to see the truth for himself. But this film has a memory; and here is the kicker: he flashes in scenes that were not even in the film! <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotypical, non-sympathetic and completely ridiculous. I feel that the “paired” love scenes between the romantic leads were the most untitillating and unsexy that I ever had a scene in a movie that was not porn. It seems that the director was going to shock and pervert in love scenes, but they were just stupid. <br /> <br /> And don't even turn me on to shit accents and second-rate sets. I suppose the film was made in New Orleans, but, apart from the aforementioned accents and a few boring city shots, the film could have been in any city in the USA. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: don't worry!
