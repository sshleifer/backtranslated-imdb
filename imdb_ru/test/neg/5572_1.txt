Rented (free rent, thank God) this is supposedly filmed at CT where I live .... could have been filmed in a tunnel! Dark ninety percent of the time, and just a terrible attempt with a low budget, which can be good if done correctly. In a few words about a bunch of young people who are witnessing the fall of a meteor, and subsequently become victims of aliens on the island of the lighthouse, who are helped by the watchman and his wife. Analysis: <br /> <br /> - acting = awful <br /> <br /> - writing = boring <br /> <br /> - plot = done a million times earlier with different settings <br /> < br /> - production values ​​= everything is in order (lighting) for a budget <br /> <br /> - effects (being, digital, other) This. To add insult to the wound, the end of the credits has barriers to filming - really now ...... who cares! Distributed by Universal, shocked that they will even do it after viewing. <br /> <br /> Finally, as an alternative, try "CREEP". Low budget, but well written, well functioning and quite, well, creepy!
