Nothing in this film stands out as great or horrible. <br /> <br /> In the end, that's what kills him. Softness is just not good. I can't say I expected more from Will Smith, but I definitely did it from Kevin James from King of Queens - but, hey, lately I’m getting used to saying it a lot. This film tries to make its mark like a witty romantic comedy, but it never hits the bull's eye. In fact, he never gets * anywhere * within the target. The allergy scene is disturbing; the fact that Kevin James doesn’t know how to dance is something that wouldn’t take anyone by surprise, and therefore (in such a film) it’s not funny. This film is constantly trying to win your heart, but always with the wrong trick at the wrong time. Some parts are fine (but I'm looking for examples in my brain), but I really think that this film should be avoided.
