I suppose I should take something like that with a grain of salt. These laboratory films (and, yes, they spend a lot of time in the laboratory) always fail in one dimension: there is an understanding that lonely people fooling around have discovered secrets that no one before could understand. Of course, they pay the price because their experiments have the same drawbacks as Dr. Frankenstein. There is always something they did not expect. There are so many things, from pure science to fashion for young ladies, to outrageous concealments that do not work here. The young woman, of course, benefits, and the doctor cannot help himself, but he could be a little more careful or even try to hide from what he was doing. Everything goes wrong, and thanks to this intelligence, it acquires enormous power, including an understanding of how it appeared. Rock Hudson looks very good here. However, he never does this in that role. He wanders around with a lot of clich√©s and stupidities, which reduces the main issue. As soon as she gets revenge, a more suitable thing will suit her, which will allow him to find her and destroy her in some big way.
