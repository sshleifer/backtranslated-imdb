Although the version of Dune, written by David Lynch, is unstable, clumsy and incorrect the novel, it is visually thought out and works well. The best thing to say about Sci Fi’s attempt to turn Dune into a miniseries is that it’s ambitious. In fact, this is practically the only positive praise that can be offered. The actors (with few exceptions) seem happy to pronounce their lines with the least amount of emotion and least suitable accents. The costumes seem to have been designed by someone with a large excess of Mylar fabric on his hands and an unhealthy love for unflattering headdresses. <br /> <br /> In part, this mini-series suffers from living in the shadow of the already famous Lynch. efforts. However, he takes the elements from the Lynch film, which were not in the novel, and copies them almost in bulk (that is, the sequence of navigation of the Steersman Guild), and this only encourages a negative comparison with the film Lynch. And for effort. I will be for almost everything else.
