I saw this film solely on the basis of the fact that it was on the DPP Video Nasty list, and although I’m glad that I saw it, because now it’s “just another Video Nasty down” - essentially, Andy Milligan’s movie is really not worth it. There are certainly worse films in the notorious list; but it does not make it easier to see this. The film was obviously shot with a very low budget, and it was translated into a script; because Blood Rites is working on an idea that is often found in horror movies, and does nothing new to it. In fact, the plot focuses on three pairs that end up in the house awaiting the results of the will. Soon they begin to take off ... blah blah blah. For most of the film, nothing happens; and then, when we finally get down to the scenes justifying the ban of the film, they are so amateurish and stupid that they cannot be taken seriously at any level. It is very good that this film does not have a very long show time, because otherwise it could be used as a particularly unpleasant method of torture. It all comes down to a rather tedious finale, which also cannot be an epic scale. Apparently, this film is still banned here in the UK; but for some reason I doubt that this is because of its shock value. In fact, Blood Rites are not worth watching, and I personally see no reason to recommend it. Unless, of course, you have done your job to see everything on the Video Nasty list ...
