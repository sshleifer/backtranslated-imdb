When Family Guy first appeared, I didn't have a particular mood. Since the 1990s, containing many clever, surrealistic cartoons, why should I be? Nickelodeon produced Doug; Ren and Stimpy and Rockos Modern Life are among other beautiful cartoons (yes, this includes Sponge Bob). Everyone had a fancy, fabulous animation and surprisingly complex stories and dialogues. The Simpsons became an obvious phenomenon, perhaps not as brilliant as its biggest defenders claim, but a very good investment of your time and, of course, reject the false axiom that all television is rubbish. South Park began as a rude but cheerful attack on everything with a unique and clever satire below. He turned into a Monty Python show with outrageous concepts, cruel and harsh critics of society (such as protecting the dwarfs from noble cowards) and eventually became completely self-referential and “meta,” as the Simpsons did. unfortunately jumped shark. Family Guy looks like Simpsons and South Park. He pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality lovers. However, what he has in talkativeness, he lacks a true mind. <br /> <br /> The show is famous for its use of tricks, especially for memories. Many links to bad television sitcoms or commercials. Some are funny (especially from the first two seasons), most are not. Are the links really funny? I'm not sure, but they are basically what the show is on, given that his characters are painfully uninteresting. Where Homer and Bart have a charm, and Cartman has artillery of self-awareness and pure indignation, confirming his terrible behavior, Peter Griffin has no excuse. He's just a loud, disgusting pig. Something funny comes from his character only because the authors forget how to be unfunny on that day. Lois is also very petty and boring; Meg is a prop, only to be offended; Chris is backward on the verge and only sometimes funny, and the two main stars of the show (Stewie and Brian) are so inconsistent in their characteristics that all this is really meaningless. <br /> <br /> Other tricks that I cannot. Persistence is when a character clearly points to something and lingers on it for a long time. This often happens lately, and I can no longer bear it. Not only the often-mentioned chicken who likes to beat Peter, I'm talking about painful moments when they talk about pop culture and push it as if they were alien viewers. It is not wit or even ironic humor, it is absolutely boring and lifeless. <br /> <br /> Not that the show couldn't be funny, in fact some of the previous episodes made me move. Highlights include a pilot episode where Peter loses touch with reality after losing his precious television; when the religious fanatic Peters appears and wreaks havoc; When Peter becomes a drug addict in megs school, and the “pancake” episode begins. I suspect that these are episodes that accidentally included real human traits in their characters, or there were simply times when the authors had real comedic inspiration. <br /> <br /> Lastly, the show is not offensive. This is offensive only to those who will not watch the show in the first place, so it’s almost like a sharp jerk of the hipster choir.
