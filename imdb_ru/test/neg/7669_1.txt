WARNING ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The Lord knows that I have seen some bad movies in my time, and this one makes me just as angry. This is an insult to people who are looking for a bad movie. “History” includes a stewardess who discovers her boyfriend (the otherwise bad Robert Great Wagner) - a murderer, a thief, and simply a nauseous face. After Concorde’s takeoff, he sends guided missiles to destroy Concorde. Therefore, while Concord is moving at the speed of light, our “hero” (George Kennedy plays with utter nonsense) opens a window in the cabin, then sticks his hand out the window to shoot at a rocket! I am not an expert in rocket science, but it seems that his hand, at least, will be burned by the wind. Then, to the final "climax", when Concord moves toward a certain catastrophe, and everyone dies, the passenger turns to his fiancé and proposes marriage. It’s just that the priest is sitting in the next row and continues to marry them when the planes collapse! (I don't make it up) Wow, the guy who wrote the script must have sniffed the glue for a week.
