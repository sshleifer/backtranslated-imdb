Of all the children's films that I've seen over the years, this was probably the worst. I took four children, aged 7 to 11, and none of them liked it. <br /> <br /> The script seemed to be based on the history of the Willie Wonka style, but there was simply nothing in it. <Br /> <br /> If you think that this film is not wasting your time, this is bad. <br /> <br /> They are making a sequel, so itâ€™s probably worth seeing if they can even make things worse. a movie, but I don't think it is possible.
