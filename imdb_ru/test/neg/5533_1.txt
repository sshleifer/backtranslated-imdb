The image of Wakayama Tomisaburo, a fluent ex-Kaishakunin Ogami Itto, seemed completely natural. His behavior, his voice, his appearance - it all said about the displacement. When he entered the space, I, like the characters on the screen, felt that he did not belong there, and that his determination to be there meant problems. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that Mr. Wakayama really accepted Kendo training (Japanese fencing), and this explains his comfort with the katana, which was perfectly shown in every cut. If you watch movies, from the moment he draws, and before she sheathes his sword, you feel as if you have witnessed something inevitably ugly. He even quickly unwound the katana to shake off the blood before putting blood into it, and it will happen in an instant. <br /> <br /> The performance of Nakamura Kinnosuke looks like a performance. It seems that he tried too hard to be someone else or tell someone else's story. As a result, every time I tried to fight, I lost my hold, because HE seemed not to control himself. As if it was awkward for him. <br /> <br /> Fencing in the television series was completely old school and Holliwird. The camera shoots to hide Mr. Nakamuraâ€™s awkwardness with a katana, slow action, targets that are sitting motionless, etc. Extremely bad from the viewer's point of view. In the episode "Attack of the Castle Wall" there was a moment when Mr. Nakamura drew his sword like a child. It was awkward. He handled it as if it was hard! I almost fell off the chair. <br /> <br /> And let's be frank: the story of the superb swordsman. Period. Fencing is a problem. <br /> <br /> Realism, however, is not so: the sword playing in the films was excellent and the manga, as expected, I am sure. (The baby carriage was equipped with a set of automatic rapid-fire muskets controlled by a 3-year-old child? Yes ... in the manga style.) This is how the story smoothly intertwines historical cultural accuracy, mainly with the fantasy of a superhero, which makes films fascinating. (Read Mosashi Yoshikawa Eiji [% historical legend]%!) I could not sit on TV shows. They just felt cheap. First watch the films and you will understand what I am talking about.
