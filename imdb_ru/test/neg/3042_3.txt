While babysitting in an isolated home in Colorado, a teenage girl is terrorized by an elusive killer on the phone. <br /> <br /> The remake of the 1979 semiclassical horror film basically takes the first 20 minutes of the original film and stretches. this corresponds to 87 minutes! So itâ€™s not necessary to say that the plot of this remake is rather thin. In this film, little originality or interest. There is a lot of Camilla Belle in the dark house who wonders who is calling her and faces all sorts of false fears. It all gets boring and routine after the first 30 minutes, and he never manages to strain a lot on the way of waiting or chills. This, of course, never reaches the intensity of the original film, especially since it weakens and changes one important point of the plot from the original. I think we have a PG-13 rating to thank for that. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the impressive design of the scenery and some gloomy atmosphere, unfortunately, not too much is happening to save this remake from subpar. Belle's performance is also rather mediocre. <br /> <br /> This is just another impressive remake. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
