I think it is safe to say that if you really watch regular box office films or any premium products, do not worry about this film because you hate it. If you're an overly critical movie lover, don't worry. If you like sci-fi movies and do not care about the quality in which you glimpse the future, then you will have a little fun. Obviously, the budget for this was super-very low, but what they did with the money should be patted on the back. Some scenes of burning fire were pretty bad, and the evacuation scenes were terrible, but itâ€™s obvious that they had some good computer support, because the scenes on the planet and the images of aliens were very creative. The dialogue is not quite cheerful, but it does not behave badly. As for the story, I'm not too sure about what really happened to tell you the truth.
