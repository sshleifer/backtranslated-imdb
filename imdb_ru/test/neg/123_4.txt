First of all, let me say: if you haven't enjoyed the Van Damme movie since Bloodsport, you probably won't like this movie. Most of these films may not have better plots or better actors, but I like films like they are. This film is much better than any of the films that other guys from action (Seagal and Dolph) thought to release in the last few years. Van Damme is good at the film, the film is just to see Van Damme fans. It's not as good as “Wake of Death” (which I highly recommend to anyone who likes Van Damme) or “In Hell”, but, in my opinion, worth seeing. He has the same type of feeling as “Nowhere to run.” Good fun stuff!
