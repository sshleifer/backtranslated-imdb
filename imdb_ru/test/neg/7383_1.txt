Oh my God !!!! It was the first film "Broken Lizard", filmed by the group (although it only recently appeared on video), and I have never been more disappointed in my whole life !!! I tell you that if I watched this movie before I saw Super Troopers (which, by the way, is a $ 0 movie!), I would never watch it !! I read several reviews on the Internet, and also on the cover of the DVD, which delighted him, like “The funniest movie“ The Broken Lizard ”in the entire history!” stop but not with that. Let's talk about dryness. It took a good 45 minutes for the film, and by that time I was so not in the mood to watch it that it was not even worth it. Maybe you should be tall for it to be really funny? I dont know. I love these guys, really, but this film is definitely the worst they did. Club Dread was a pretty good movie, but this one is just wow. I highly recommend Super Troopers if you want to laugh, but if you want more romance, drama, with a few funny commercials, I would say go with Puddle Cruiser. Just my opinion, though, everyone is entitled to their own! :)
