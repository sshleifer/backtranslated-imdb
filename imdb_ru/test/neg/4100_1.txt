This is a pathetic movie. What makes it even more pitiful is the time, effort and money invested in the super predictable scenario and action. <br /> <br /> By the way, about some monsters and some insects. Do not expect an explanation of the plot. There's nothing here. This can work if there is something interesting or characters we can take care of. None Everything that happens to any person is as predictable as other Sci Fi movies. <br /> <br /> Don't try to understand what some characters are saying. They speak gibberish, a particularly annoying lead woman, whose accent is a kind of fat British who is harder to understand than any old British film you might have seen. She is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> A lot of money is spent on great scenery and scenery, and this is the main crime in this film, because it's not worth it.
