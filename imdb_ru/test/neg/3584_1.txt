Awful Awful Awful Strong, unimaginable, predictable - and with all the usual suspects. This is the film that the Irish film industry should not do. And with the added bonus of molasses finishes. A shocking example of how talent and originality are bypassed in favor of the almost aggressive mediocrity. Yes, the children are sweet. Yes, it seems to be done professionally. But this is the creation of a film by numbers, a direct clash and the seizure of what the director clearly considers "success" - a film that patronizes and despises the audience. Surprisingly, a Working Title would have spent Â£ 3 million on this trash. But then they paid for love really. Do not waste your money.
