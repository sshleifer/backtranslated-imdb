I was looking for a documentary of the same journalistic quality as Front Line or Fog of War (Errol Morris). Instead, I was shocked by this petty and naive story about a very complex and anxious man and his regime: Alberto Fujimori. This film should be called “The Return of Fujimori”. The director assumes that she made a “perfect” film, because it alienates both about and against Fujimori, when in fact it is a very biased and unprofessional work. <br /> <br /> There are several incorrect facts in the film: <br /> <br /> 1) It uses the so-called “landslide” elections of 1995, in which Fujimori was re-elected with 65% of the votes. As an example of massive support for Fujimori. But now we all know that this is the result of a very organized election fraud. <br /> <br /> 2) The film says that Sendero Luminoso (“The Shining Path”) killed 60,000 people. In fact, the final report of the Truth Commission states that in Peru there were 69,280 deaths due to political violence. 33% of them were caused by SL. The remaining 67% remain in the hands of the police, military and other groups. The fact that she uses the same misleading information that Fujimori has been using for 10 years is another example of how horrible this movie is. <br /> <br /> Fujimori is a completely unsurpassed manipulator, delusional character and ruthless egomaniac. Anyone who has some understanding of Peruvian politics and history. His regime was very far from democracy. He is still a threat to the Peruvians. Despite these facts, the director lets Fujimori tell a story. Not only does he want the camera to be located, but the narrative and the direction of the film seem to be part of his political agenda. It seems he always has the last word. There are no journalistic "cojones", just soft questions and undeniable remarks. Where is Oriana Fallaci when we need her? After the interrogation, the director did not hide that Fujimori was deeply impressed with her charm and intelligence. Yes, he was definitely fascinated by him, and you can tell by watching this movie. Obviously, it is very difficult for her to digest the many facts that indicate his responsibility for corruption, murder and deception, which have taken place. She assured a gasping audience that Fujimori was truly a “patriot” when a few minutes earlier one of the leading Peruvian journalists very firmly told us that Fujimori was primarily a “traitor”. She further said that, in spite of all the accusations, not a single bank account of his name, and so on. D. And so on. Not a single "dollar" was found. It was the same as to hear again the same gang of ruthless thugs, who ruled the country for 10 years, defending their master. It was a sad moment for journalism. <br /> <br /> This film is unfair to the story. This is an insult to hundreds of dead people who disappeared or have been unfairly imprisoned by the Fujimori regime. Not surprisingly, she later admitted that all Peruvian intellectuals had become friends with her, making the film feel betrayed to them. Objective? Instead, the words "opportunistic," "naive," and "denial" come to my mind.
