Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so I am happy to see any of their films. Ollie is recovering from a broken leg in the hospital, and he has nothing more to do, Stan decides to visit him and take him boiled eggs and nuts instead of candy. The chaos begins with the fact that Stan creeps out Olli's thread with curiosity, and manages to push the Doctor (Billy Gilbert) out the window, clinging to it, forcing Ollie to hang on the ceiling. When the situation calms down, Stan gets Ollie's clothes, because the Doctor wants both of them to go away, and he also manages to sit on a syringe, accidentally left by a nurse, filled with sleeping pills, which takes effect when he is driving. (which, as you can tell, is made with a machine in front of a big screen. Filled with a pretty farce and not too bad (albeit repetitive and slightly predictable) classic comedy, it’s not great, but it’s a black and white film worth watching. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy was number 7 in comedian Comedians. Good!
