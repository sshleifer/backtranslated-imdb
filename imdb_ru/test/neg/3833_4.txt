I just can't imagine any possible reasons why Madsen and Hopper wanted to be in this movie after reading the script. Perhaps they were blackmailed? Or are they so without money? The main problem with the film is boring. Conversations between the characters of Madsen and Hopper are meaningless, like bored conversations between two friends when they drank beer on Saturday evening. You never have feelings for any of the characters (although Madsen's psychokiller is very cute compared to other characters). Hopper has always been a good actor, and Madsen copes with the role of a serial killer, otherwise the acting is almost ridiculous. Throughout the film, there are three scenes where something really happens, each of which lasts about three minutes. Although the scenes of "talking and thinking about murders and the nature of the killers" would be interesting if they were scenes in a book. The whole concept would be interesting for the novel, but the film simply cannot imagine a story with such great inner thinking and such a small act.
