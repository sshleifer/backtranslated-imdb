Well, I have not read the book yet, but I must say that the main character was mistakenly accepted. How can I say that this is not read the book you are asking? It's simple. As a viewer of this mini-series, I was annoyed by the manners, gestures, and gaze of the main character, Fanny Price. To be a good person is one thing, and quite another to be a stick in a dirty creature who despises being able to look at someone in the face or otherwise meet his gaze. Besides the exaggerated profile of "Susan B. Anthony", she seemed resolute, refusing to look at another person. The scene where Edmond pours out his heart to her, she always looks straight ahead, forcing him to do the same. As a result, it was just embarrassing, and I simply could not imagine that someone was in love with her, not to mention Henry and Edmond. Many said that it was true about the book, and if so, itâ€™s hard for me to believe that Jane Austen would create such a character as her main character. You can create a character that was attacked by others, and who managed to win their trust and tenderness, but the image of this character in this mini-series simply did not help me.
