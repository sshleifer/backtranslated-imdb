When Jim Vinorsky first announced that he would be making a new sequel for my favorite series of all time, the series “Slumber Party Massacre,” I was delighted. I was waiting for a new installment literally years. So, the production began, and very small fragments and actors were filmed during the shooting, until the shooting was completed. Then the announcement of the change of name. This new sequel will no longer be called “Slac Party Massacre IV”, but instead “Cheerleader Massacre”. I was a little disappointed, but having a different title would be a very small price for the movie I had been waiting for. I was still extremely intrigued, and I was on the edge of my chair to see him. <br /> <br /> A month ago, some very advanced copies of the film were released for some extremely happy viewers who saw the film months before the release date. Several reviews have been leaked on the network, and judging by them, I began to fear the “Cheerleader Massacre” of Jim Wynorsky. <br /> <br /> Tonight I saw the film for the first time in full, and I I am still scratching my head. As I read in another review, “Cheerleader Massacre” is definitely NOT a new release in the Slumber Party Massacre series, but it’s just an impostor. And very bad. <br /> <br /> Before I delve into the specifics of the film, let me first say how big I am a fan of Jim Vinorsky’s films. I always thought he was a real camp genius, with the winner almost every time. Yes, his films are made on tight budgets and do not contain the most first-class actors, but nevertheless they are funny. They are what they are: hiking films that you watch when you want to have a good time. From Mortal House Sorority House II to Hard to Die, to Grinding Center, Jim created the goods more than once. One of the reasons why I was excited that this film would be his last project. <br /> <br /> “Cheerleaders Massacre” (in my opinion) does not reflect any of the films that I saw when this director / screenwriter created into the past. First, the production was extremely inexpensive, and the film was actually shot on video tape, which I had never seen before with Jim. The actors were mediocre, to say the least, and the story is almost funny. The killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your pleasant old grandfather than the escaped lunatic. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is littered with female nudity. We're talking about this Jim Winski movie, guys. But some boobs that can be seen here look like they were made on time. There is a very long scene in the shower with a cheerleading coach that seems to go on forever, and it largely reflects the scene in Jim's soul “The Massacre at Sorority House II.” The girl even bathes in much the same way. <br /> <br /> "Cheerleader Massacre" is also extremely scandalous, to say the least. The initial scene is literally what we all saw in hundreds of past clicks. The guy and the girl understand, on the verge of ending their relationship, when ... you guessed it. They are hacked into pieces. <br /> <br /> Brinke Stevens, whom I had never considered to be an amazing actress, also gives one of the toughest and most compelling performances in her little cameo. We are talking about possible maps here. She recalls some of the incidents her character carried the murderer, who was seen here twenty years ago, to the police during the filming of the original play "Bloody Party". Why were shots from the original film used, if it was definitely not a new “SPM”? I have no idea. This film also shows two explosions, which, I am almost sure, were reworked from other films. <br /> <br /> This film not only recycles FOOTAGE from previous films, but also recycles scores from other films. , Some of the music used in “Humanoids from the Deep” (which was also reworked before “The Coroner”) can be heard throughout the film. There are at least two more that I cannot identify, but I am sure that they were used before. <br /> <br /> After seeing the horrible game of this film, the ridiculous story, the non-existent bloody / special effects and the video camera As a quality, I have serious concerns about Mr. Winsky's career. The man who delighted the audience with movies in the past, completely lost his niche? Time will tell. Oh, and let's not forget his new film. A new installment in the films "The Massacre of the House of Sorority," now called the "Final Exam." I think I see a sample here ...
