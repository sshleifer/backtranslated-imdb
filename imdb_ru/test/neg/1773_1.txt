This film was absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. The plot could be made to work if the film was written better. The acting was one of the worst I've ever seen. I was very slow and made me want to leave / turn off the movie several times. I watched the whole movie in the hope that the end would be useful, but itâ€™s not. this film, I think, should be rated in negative numbers. (In my humble opinion)
