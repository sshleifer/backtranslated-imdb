On the one hand, he produced this film. This is similar to later films with international actors that duplicate. The opening credits tell us that it was filmed in Vienna. <br /> <br /> Bey admired the adventure films of the Universal of the 1940s. He was also great in the film, which I saw, probably ten years ago, but since then it has never been heard of: "Amazing Mr. X." Perhaps it was Dr. X. I remember him as an exciting and frightening film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is quite wooden. The plot is not easy to follow. When I realized this, I was still disappointed. <br /> <br /> Frances Lederer looks great as a concert pianist. He was a very handsome leading man ten or 15 years ago. He was never the main star, although he had to. <br /> <br /> This is not terrible, but rather difficult.
