On the opening day of the silent film festival in San Francisco, I was very excited to see historical and not-so-popular films. The guest speaker who opened this film created a sense of deception towards obscurity and how this film is underestimated. The science fiction part of the film was very interesting and fantastic for its time, but I’m not sure if it was due to the fact that it was shown right after the “Wind” of the 1928 Diamond or that the Russian cinematographers seemed to be after the novels are known (hundreds of characters, intricate plots), but I know for sure that the dramatic parts, like in parts on Earth, had absolutely no meaning, were boring, and I was lost in about twenty minutes. Perhaps it was an acting game, but I was convinced that this film was “unknown and underestimated”: it is boring, there is no plot or main story, and the game is terrible. This, of course, is not “The Battleship Potemkin”, but I will say that Russian films do not make much effort to light up life in Russia.
