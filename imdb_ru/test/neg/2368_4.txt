Doesn't that sound familiar? Oh wait, that's right ... 90% of the jokes in this movie have already been made on the show. You may ask, what's the point of repeating? This is for the benefit of Americans who have not yet seen the program? Have screenwriters run out of inspiration? Or, maybe, everyone on the set suffered a sudden attack of amnesia and forgot that they had already managed to cover this place? In any case, for those who completed the first three series, it was very boring. I had to turn it off during the "pills that turn your water into green." Yes, it is very funny, but for God's sake, give us something original! In fact, if the best new thing you can come up with is Leonard Rossiterâ€™s take on Saturday fever, you can forget about it. <br /> <br /> The guy they replaced the late Richard Beckinsale looks good, but not half the actor. Personally, I would cast out this role as a sign of respect for him. Or, better yet, they did not bother to make a film at all, but simply let the fun of the series speak for itself. But no, they could not do it ... not until it was possible to earn. It's sad, really. 4/10
