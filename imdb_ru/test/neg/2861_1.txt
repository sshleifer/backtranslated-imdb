It looked very much like CHILD'S PLAY films, with the exception of the much worse Lawyer trying to save the criminal convicted of killing his son from execution. She fails. Then the lawyer's daughter finds a puppet that the killer buried with his son, and immediately becomes attached to her. Then, after several people were seriously injured, they discover that the little girl is secretly talking to the doll, saying that she has not offended anyone. Throughout this film, I wondered: “Why do I watch this cheese?” Again and again. The end sucked so badly that I went and looked at the cartoon version of Disney right after that and slept with the lights on.
