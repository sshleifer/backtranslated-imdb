This show started well, but then turned into a nightmare. The worst part about it was the participants. Most of them were weird. They did stupid things to make a living, and they also did strange hobbies. In the second season, one guy said that he was talking to his pants. It is sickening and disgusting. Also, no one cared about winning money. All they ever wanted to do was make alliances, as if it were “Survivor” or something. Men have always feared that women get together. Women were the same. I just couldn't stand it anymore. I should have stopped watching this. It was truly one of the worst shows ever.
