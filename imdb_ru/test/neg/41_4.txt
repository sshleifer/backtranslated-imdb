The film begins with a cult leader trying to resurrect a dead member with his followers singing his revival when the sun falls on them in the desert. Reanhauer (Bill Roy) sincerely believes in his strength and is so excited that he has a heart attack. Unable to support him, all participants, doctors and nurses, were sentenced for an attack with the demonic spirit of Reanhauer, who invaded the tortuous body of nurse Sherry (Jill Jacobson with big breasts), targeting each of them, using her as a tool of revenge. Forced against her will, without the memory of causing such harm, the killing of the body of Master Sherry chose the victims. Fortunately, Sherri's colleague, nurse Tara (Marilyn Joy) begins a rather tumultuous affair with blind patient Marcus Washington (Prentiss Malden), once a star player, whose mother practiced voodoo. Thanks to the knowledge of Marcus, transferred from her mother, Tara learns about obsession and how to save Sherry, before she involuntarily kills everyone. Meanwhile, Sherry's lover, Dr. Peter Desmond (Jeffrey Land), is worried about her current condition and well-being. <br /> <br /> Well, this was my first Al-Adamson film, and I have to agree with his detractors that it seems that because of this, he seems to be holding them with Elmer's clips and glue. The animation with which we see how the spirit takes control of Sherry is terrible and quite ridiculous. A little nonsense nonsense as filler, some demonic obsession added to the mix (Sherry actually speaks in a different voice when she is obsessed), with a naughty behavior of a nurse a bit of violence / blood. The film is essentially made in tiny rooms with a boring dialogue from a rather down-to-earth cast. Sexual situations are not that complicated and Al often shoots them without revealing the whole thing. The film looks confusing cheap, but there is no thrill, although a scary assessment (which sounds like something out of dark shadows) helps a little. which he really doesn’t have, with enough chest hair to declare him a Neanderthal) It looks bad, and Adamson’s storyline, although fragile, is somewhat consistent (it seems that he rarely directs such films). In general, the film looks as if it costs 5 bucks, and Adamson simply cannot overcome budget constraints (or, in my opinion, create a rather unpleasant atmosphere because of the sometimes stupid story and tedious scenes that do little for the story) . John F. Goff plays the role of a hospital psychiatrist who wants to commit Sherry, not believing the idea that she is obsessed, he constantly quarrels with Peter over her. I looked at the cashless “lost” version, which, I think, is the real version for nurse Sherry.
