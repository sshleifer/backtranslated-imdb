I have long wanted to see an American werewolf in Paris because I loved his predecessor, but this film did not make such an impression on me as an American werewolf in London. In fact, to be honest, it didnâ€™t impress me at all. <br /> <br /> Tom Everett-Scott and his rogue buddies roam Paris and rescue the wolf in a ridiculous trick from the Eiffel Tower. baby Julie Delpy from death. Before you can figure out if the constant robbery and the lumpy dialogue should be comedic, the full moon has come, and the terrible CGI werewolves are chasing down Parisian sewers. <br /> <br /> The script is disgustingly poor, the actors were made to make this film, their terrible actions correspond to the status of the film. From start to finish, this film is never interesting, exciting, or even watchable. Honestly, I had problems watching the whole movie without vomiting for lunch. <br /> <br /> The scene from the movie is not exciting, the jokes are not funny, and the werewolves are not scary. In short: skip or be persecuted forever. <br /> <br /> I rate the American werewolf in Paris 2 out of 10.
