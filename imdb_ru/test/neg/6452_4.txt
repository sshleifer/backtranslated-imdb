An evil, abusive film studio manager manages his male assistant, tormented by ugly requests, holding the young man firmly under his thumb with constant threats of unemployment; after a year's office terror, the workers finally broke down. Writer / director George Juan may have bitten off more than he can chew here. His “Swimming with sharks” is not a diatribe against Hollywood and not a tribute to a hardworking subordinate ... instead, he removes tricks with a twist, a pony with one focus and tunnel vision. The setting does not look like Tinsel Town (perhaps because of a limited budget), and we never feel this stressful environment as a film director (this may be a realtor office in the Valley, for all of us we know). Presenter Kevin Spacey, who also served as one of the film's producers, gives a controlled and focused view of how a mad tycoon whose ego is out of control; he does a good job, and yet the character does not ring true. We know so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and high status do not correspond to what we see; who does this person answer? what makes him not only humiliate others for the sake of sports? What projects does he juggle, except for the one scenario we saw? The film is so emotionally backward and sparsely populated that it begins to seem like a stage performance, unfolded for a large screen - and at the same time a play that does not have enough characters or motives. Juan might have wanted everything to be simple, but instead his film looks like an unfinished project that required much more understanding, humor and atmosphere. ** from ****
