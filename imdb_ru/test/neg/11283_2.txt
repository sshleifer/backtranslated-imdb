Despite the fact that the film “Ice Cream” is advertised as one of the most sincere Turkish films with the amateur cast “Ice Cream”, it looks more like a caricature of sincerity. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a dream of Ali traveling on ice A seller of cream in the city of Western Anatolia, in which he sees himself as successful using the same marketing methods as the major ice cream companies. He dreams of playing a commercial for his product with beautiful bikini models dancing around him. When his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his giant wife, who refuses to have sex with him for 6 years for no apparent reason. Is it because he did not succeed in his work? Obviously, because he says he sold better in the old days, when there was no pressure from global ice cream companies. But this is what he says; in fact, we don’t see him suffering so much: he still sells well, travels to neighboring villages, while his pupil stays in the store selling ice cream to city residents. Ali blames big companies for using sweeteners and dyes, while he uses real "sahlep" (powdered roots of mountain orchids). Ali buys a motorcycle with a bank loan to be a travel seller, and advertises to a local television station that prefers to even broadcast a newsletter in a local dialect. His wife does not like his ways of doing business, they always quarrel, and Ali threatens her that he can do very bad things in a moment of madness. <br /> <br /> On a very good day, his lousy bike was stolen by the evil boys of the city. In search of a stolen bike, Ali goes to the police, accuses large companies of theft, but, of course, no one takes him seriously. Annoyed by the whining of his wife, Ali goes to the tavern and becomes drunk. One of his friends at the table, a local tramp socialist, gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism and, without a real connection, jumps on the topic of global freezing. Ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison. His wife wakes up and bothers him. The old neighbor sends him on a night walk and advises him about life. According to him, Ali may even sell a hot drink, sahlep, if the world faces global freezing. When he returns home, we suddenly see that his wife understands his value, treats him as a hero and praises his manhood. Meanwhile, the boy thieves got sick by eating too much ice cream. They confess to the doctor that they stole Ali's bike. Ali forgives them, and there comes a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the plot may look promising, story-telling makes this film insincere and funny. First, the director does not make much effort to tell the story visually; everything is based on dialogue. And the dialogues never stop showing us that cinema is actually a visual art. Even Ali's problems are not convincing, because we do not see it, we just understand it from his words. The director advertises his film as Ali's righteous struggle against major ice cream companies, but the film says nothing about big companies. We do not see their pressure enough. The film actually ridicules Ali for what he believes is that large companies are behind the thefts. And when his motorcycle is found, he solves all the problems: Ali becomes a happy and strong husband. Not a real criticism of globalism. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film is shoddy because of rude humor. Maybe people in this part of Turkey swear so much and make vulgar jokes in their daily lives, but vulgar language and rude humor are not enough to make the film funny. I could accept this if they were both vulgar and “smart,” but they are not at all clever jokes, they are just silly. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe Americans might like the oriental version of American humor in a pie style. But the American pie has never claimed to be an Oscar nominee or to have a political message! If you think you can laugh just by seeing the big erection of the man in his shorts (and we had to endure this joke twice!) Or an old village woman saying “f ** k you”, then you can find this movie funny.
