What did he think?!?!?! Like a sad actor, as incredibly talented as Michael Rapaport, who stole our hearts in “The Mighty Aphrodite” and fascinated us in “The Sick City” - sank to this pitiful level. The inscription on this comedic coma is a crust left on the bottom of the barrel after it has been cleaned. Shame on everyone involved. There is a trend: major movie actors, who are no longer popular, are turning to television, which often leads to disastrous results (see Stinkaroos on CBS and NBC; however, ABC has a hit with "Boston Legal" - a hip-hop piece and Bill's nostalgic use Shatner). To waste Michael Rapaport in this “Everything in the Family” plagiarism is an insult to the audience and mainly Michael himself.
