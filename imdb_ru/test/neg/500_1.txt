I watched this last night with an open mind. Sorry that is still bad. First, the film is too noisy, and you don’t hear what people are saying. Accents are bad, especially Richard Mazur. What does a french chick do in this movie ??? Error at worst. Walken's makeup is weird. Harvard scene is useless and not needed. The Christopherson character is unlikely, and I wanted him killed and gone. Meanwhile, the character Walken is killed too early and easily (despite the makeup). The settlers are all stupid. GET ORGANIZED YOU, a bunch of addicts, people are going to kill you !!!!! The John Hurths character provides several humorous knockouts. That's all. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to say about this nonsense. The only good thing is that it ruined the director’s career and killed United Artists. <br /> <br /> Still shit after all these years.
