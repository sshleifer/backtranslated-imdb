Bad bad movie. When I saw the synopsis, I was expecting something like a Ring with just a video game instead of a tape. Nothing like this happened. I admit that the idea is interesting and can be turned into a good film, but it is not. <br /> <br /> The choice of a real person, Countess of Batory, is a silly move that adds absolutely nothing to the story. Anyone, even vaguely familiar with her story, begins to wonder why and how this Hungarian noblewoman turned out to be in this film. Choosing a general vengeful spirit would be much better. <br /> <br /> Then there is the whole concept of "you die in real life, how you die in the game." As I said earlier, an interesting, ring-shaped story. But instead of turning it into a good storyline, it just flows without explaining the reasons why this game became what it was, why it was created, and so on. A waste of a good idea. <br /> <br /> And finally, in this film there are not even many funny parts that can, if not save, at least make the crappy horror films lookable. Deadly scenes are too fast, and the action is too wooden to be funny. <br /> <br /> Avoid if possible.
