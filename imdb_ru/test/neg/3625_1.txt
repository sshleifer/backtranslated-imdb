I really don't like this show. I mean, in fact, everyone in this school is perfect and rich, and I doubt that the boarding school will look just as cool. And why do they suddenly let girls go to school? Isn't that a bit strange? In any case, Jamie Lynn Spears can not act. She always has the same expression that annoys me so much. She's mostly unemotional, and all the guys like her. <br /> <br /> And shouldn't she tell her that she likes her? it's not that hard! really! None of this show is real life, and she is not a “girl like me” because most ordinary girls DO NOT go to boarding school, don’t have designer clothes and DO NOT live on the beach. <br /> <br /> Fake Fake Fake.
