!!!! SMART SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The essence of the matter is as follows: the store burned down, and Sergio's assistant asked the father of the man who started the fire to take the packaging with which Sergio agrees. <br /> So far, so good, but there is a serious lack of logic: Sergio agrees to do it in the amount of $ 25,000, but why? Guys, if you were a good looking white boy, would you risk getting a long spell in a tight prison (a very real possibility of arson) for 25,000? I know that I will not, and given that you have a criminal record, no employer will want to touch you with a barging bar, so this is $ 25,000 as much as you need to check your life and social security? There is also something else that seems to have passed without notice from the premise, since Mr. Lumpke told Sergio that his son made fire, he does not seem to know about the possibility that he may know too much. Do not alarm bells ringing in your mind that someone wants to calm you down if they tell you something? <br /> <br /> I suppose that we should not think about such details, since “The Love Story of Pyromaniac” is not an intellectual thriller, this is a frivolous romantic comedy film about tiptoes, probably best rated as a night for girls. Looking through this comment page, it’s obvious that the film has its own advocates, but, like a cynical man, I wasn’t too impressed, and William Baldwin is really not comfortable.
