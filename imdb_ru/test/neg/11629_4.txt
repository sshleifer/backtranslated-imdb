Let's see. I grew up in a Catholic family, in a very religious family and spent the same amount of time in the church and talked to the priests as I did at home. It was useful for two things: to make me a staunch atheist and give me deep, deep knowledge about the Church and its dogmas. And I say: if a Catholic priest becomes a witness to the murder and clearly sees the face of the killer, he CAN report it to the police, even if the killer later confessed to him. He cannot reveal what he was told in a confession, but he CAN talk about everything he sees outside of it, and confession is useless to keep his mouth shut. So, we have a movie entirely based on lies. And another lie is that there is no murder. According to the Catholic Church, there is a sin for any sin, as long as there is sincere repentance. So far, the biggest plot holes in this weak thriller. <br /> <br /> As people often say, this film would have improved if Bob Hoskins and Alan Bates had switched roles. Hoskins is naturally suited for playing gangsters (I will never complain that he lost Al Capone in favor of one of De Niro’s weakest performances in The Untouchables), and Bates’s functions would be perfect, like a priest with gray by the past. But, besides, I think that the film would have been much better if the real Ulster native Liam Neeson (then not familiar to a wide audience) played the role of Mickey Rourke. Not only is his face perfect for playing exhausted characters, he made us believe that the character is real and Rourke just can't do it. Back in the 80s, Rourke was not a bad actor (he seemed to lose his talent along with his appearance), but he was one of those performers like Brad Dourif, who is as good as the director with whom he works. . And, as a former IRA terrorist, Rourke looks more like a pimp. It's sad to think that this film was shot only three to six years later (when Neeson reached moderate celebrity status in 1990 with the pleasant Dark Man Sam Raimi and the superstar in 1993 with Schindler's List), while Rourke became largely forgotten already), Liam and Mickey could switch roles in order to gain more benefits (Rourke could play an effective role in Daughter's supporting role, but simply could not carry this film as a presenter). Another missed opportunity, and another film with the potential to be a classic, which has become an instantly forgotten price. <br /> <br /> It's quite funny that the often-criticized score (underrated composer Bill Conti) worked for me. I did not find it excessively melodramatic, but quite sandy and beautiful. It reminded me of Howard Shore’s account for Silence of the Lambs. This is the talent of Mike Hodges, who made “Get Carter”, yes, but do not forget that he is also the mastermind of “Flash Gordon” ... <br /> <br /> The film seems to have been killed in the cutting room (this shows that some parts are truly volatile and confusing, while others simply do not stick together), and the director's cut is waiting to see the light. Good, but I seriously doubt that this will make it a great movie, since we still have bad actors and a false premise. 4/10.
