Incredible. I have never seen anything like this. Everything is bad; really bad. From photography (many scenes without focus!) To acting skills (young woman is terrible). And what can we say about those helicopters that are made in Paint Brush ...? Really amazing movie B, I mean movie Z. <br /> <br /> The plot is bad, the clich√© and bad is written. The basics of script convenience seem to work. I can't even think that a young film student makes this film. Nothing justifies this. <br /> <br /> I recommend you not even think about watching this movie. Sleeping or playing alone is the best choice. ;) <br /> <br /> xxx
