Well, I went to this website before I watched this movie, read the comments, got pumped up - because they were pretty good for B-click - I watched it and was completely disappointed. The main characters, imitating the lonely rebels right out of the act in the Midwest, abhorred their stomachs, and don't even turn me on two cops, I mean, there is a bloody door in sight, look! The plot was completely predictable, the editing was rather limited, I swear the editor even dozed off at the end when he was making this film, and the direction was blurred by poor cinematography. Now, please, don't get me wrong, I love bi-movies, some of them are really good. <br /> <br /> Want to watch a good B-rated movie ??? <br /> <br /> Dave recommends <br /> "High Voltage" <br /> <br /> http://imdb.com/title/tt0338095/
