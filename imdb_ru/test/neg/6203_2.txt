David Dhawan copied HITCH and such an unofficial copy. The film is not even half as funny or funny as the original, it is boring with intrusive stories such as Lara's track about the birth of a child and without her husband. Plus, there is an unwelcome stupid Chota DON and David also tries to stifle the drama, but the film looks incoherent, boring. <br /> <br /> The songs just pop up, as well as romance and everything else, with the exception of Govinda’s funny scenes, dance to the interval, nothing more to mention. The last few scenes are pretty funny, but usually too long. <br /> <br /> David’s direction is as bad as MAINE PYAAR KYUN KIYAA, he needs to change his style or try something good. Music saves grace, some songs are good, but situations seem forced </ p> cabin and closer to the end <br /> <br /> Salman just plays himself and his nasal tone to the same his fake play style - a headache. <br /> <br /> Lara can be avoided, Katrina is just a fake. <br /> <br /> child replays
