A dull black BLACK comedy about a woman (Mia Farrow) who leaves her home on Christmas Eve when she learns that her husband (Tony Goldwyn) hired a hitman to kill her. She ends up husband and wife (Scott Glenn and Mary-Louise Parker) and then everything goes wrong. In fact, Farrow continues to run and constantly meets VERY strange people and gets into painfully unfriendly situations. <br /> <br /> This film was advertised as a good movie when I saw it for Christmas in its VERY short run in an art cinema, I found it sick, unfriendly and simply depressing. I like black humor, but it was too dark for me. What happens to Parker’s character was especially horrifying. Worse, Eileen Brennan later becomes a nun (!!!) and continues to chew landscapes with pleasure. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace was in the actions of Farrow - it is much better than this picture deserves. It was also a relief to see how the very talented Stephen Dorff appears at the end. The ending itself was quite pleasant, but it could not erase what happened before. <br /> <br /> Sick, painful, dark “comedy”. A 1
