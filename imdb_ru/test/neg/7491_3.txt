Class C cast and scenes with a bad transition, full of terrible acting, made me believe that it would make a good television-only release, such as an FX presentation of a smallpox outbreak. In my local blockbuster, however, about 9 copies are stored on the shelves, none of which were verified when I rented the title (I wonder why ....) In any case, this title was almost ridiculous in the director’s “fear factor” was going to. From time to time, the “number of deaths” at the bottom of the screen completely contradicted the plot, for example, when a helicopter drove over Angola, and the number of victims increased at a furious speed from 23 million to 24. However, after the film ends (perhaps in a few hours or even every other day) or so after the helicopter landed) the death toll counter is also reset, as was the case when the helicopter was approaching the zone. The end of the film left a huge whole in the whole plot, and God knows that no one expects to continue. In any case, do not rent it, I advise you to watch it only if you received the title without any financial loss, and you have the mood for a foolish unknown film.
