I simply fill out this comment because I could not bear the fact that a positive comment was posted on the "full details" page. I really think this is the worst movie in my country. This is not only because of the terrible conspiracy, crappy English language and the tension curve, as flat as our country. No, this is because it was a serious attempt to make a good fighter, to meet the Hollywood standard. It was supposed to be the European Fighter of the Year. For this purpose, they even hired Feid van Huet, an actor in the Academy's award-winning picture of Character, to do the work. I don't mind bad movies, I can even enjoy them if they are harmless b-films. but I hate movies that are terrible, but they should be movies like.
