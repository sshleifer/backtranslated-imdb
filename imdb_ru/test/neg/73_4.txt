A joint Italian-American co-production with Linda Blair and David "Hoff" Hasselhoff: how can any fan of terrible horror withstand such a pleasure? <br /> <br /> Well, based on the serene, extremely tedious, and completely pointless for the first forty minutes or so, I would say “very easy”; Fortunately, however, eventually everything becomes a little more interesting with the introduction of several inventive scenes of death, and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy, also a little nudity (unfortunately, my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material). <br /> <br /> Goff starred as Gary, a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) to a seedy hotel on a seemingly deserted island to take pictures for her latest project, a book about witches; while there, disappointed Gary also hopes to try to cure a bad case of blue balls, freeing Leslie from her virginity. <br /> <br /> However, his plans for Nookie are undermined by the unexpected arrival of property developers Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), son of Tommy (Michael Manchester), handsome nympho-architect Linda Sullivan (Katherine Hickland) and real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who came to inspect the Island Hotel. <br /> <br /> After explaining their unexpected presence on the island, the new home owners greet Gary and Leslie, and when a violent storm suddenly breaks out, which makes a return to the mainland dangerous, everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building. Unfortunately, without the knowledge of the new guests of the hotel, the spirit of the evil witch (Hildegard Knef) also lives here, which requires human sacrifices in order to bring itself back to life. One by one, the victims are drawn into a whirling red vortex (which is guaranteed to cause unintended laughter) before a terrible fate befalls. <br /> <br /> None of this makes much sense, and the actions are brutal (Manchester) because Tommy is especially bad, while Hasselhoff turns out to be one of the best performers, who talks a lot about others), but those viewers who survive the dull first half, are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of blood: Rose has lips stitched together before frying alive in a fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burned alive; Linda is tortured by the thorns and pierces the swordfish (!!); Freddie's veins pulsate and erupt in blood geysers; and Gary stabs in the back. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Leslie is raped by a lipless guy, and Blair becomes obsessed (again).
