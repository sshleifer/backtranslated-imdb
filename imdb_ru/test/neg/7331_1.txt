Simply put, these are all syndicated episodes, NOT the original uncut / unedited NBC episodes. This is NOT a full first season, all eps edited to correspond to 9:00 pm for syndication, which means that the jokes are cut, additional commercial disappearance is included, all Harvey Korman’s entries are not here ... very poorly done! Shame on the show I've been waiting for .... so long boooooooooooooooooo! If you’re a real mom’s fan, don’t buy it and go to http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/main/help/whv/customer_service.jsp and send them comments about why we’re unhappy with this meat job in the classic sitcom !
