Nothing special can be seen here, the animation is outdated, and the plot is a typical futuristic era. This film has an original story, but if there is no original plot or characters in it, then, in my opinion, itâ€™s not worth watching. I'm not saying that the movie was bad, it was just a typical anime story, and I thought I watched this movie a thousand times. So, if you are looking for something original, look different.
