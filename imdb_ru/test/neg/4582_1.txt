Bray Greyfriars was NOT West - Bobby was a sky terrier. The highlight of my day trips to Edinburgh was a visit to the Bobby Monument. I grew up on stories about a gallant and loyal little dog, as every child in my generation did, and I remember meeting my mother near the cinema - with many, many other children of Dundee and their mothers - to see the wonderful Disney movie. How could a film based on such a wonderful story be made with the help of Westie, for God's sake? It's like making a film about the life of Robert Burns and portray it as an Englishman. I say, bring back Bobby his breed!
