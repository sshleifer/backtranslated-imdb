This is absolutely the stupidest film ever made in front of a camera. I can't believe that was frivolous enough to rent this piece of junk. I saw some bad movies in my time, but it takes a cake .... Ice cream ,,, and Chips, too. God, I still can not understand how bad it is. The acting was a joke ... The plot was insignificant ... and camera work had to be made by a 3-year-old child. I have never seen a movie go nowhere for so long. I mean, the whole movie could be made in less than 30 minutes. I guess this guy had extra time ... (About 3 hours). And another 60 bucks in his wallet, and he decided one night ... (Hey ... Come on, let's do the stupidest movie ever made.) And they did just that. Give me a break. I am now returning to the video store to return my money to Ask. Anyone who watched this piece of garbage should do the same.
