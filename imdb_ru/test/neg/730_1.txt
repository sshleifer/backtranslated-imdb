This is an absolutely awful excuse for the show. People say it is witty and sensible? I do not understand how? Maybe because characters use fancy words? Perhaps because they scoff, use dry humor and have two-dimensional personalities. I went to Ivy League school, and no one behaved as disgustingly as these characters. In fact, if I met someone like them, I would probably have strangled them! Men behave like little emotional teenage girls, and all the minority characters are based on stereotypes ... Characters are not real at all. Simply put, they are like a trailer park family trying to be rich and complex. This show is another hit that prime-time viewers regularly eat.
