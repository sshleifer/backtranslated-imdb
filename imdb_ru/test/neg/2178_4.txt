* Soft spoilers * <br /> <br /> In this potential satire, Chaplin aimed at the evil of German fascism, playing the dual role of the Tomani dictator Adenoid Hinkel and one of his subjects, the unintended First World War. the hero and the Jewish hairdresser. Through events inspired by both Adolf Hitler and the Marx brothers, Hinkel negotiates contracts and declares war on neighboring Osterlich, at the same time finding time for many oddly flat decorations. A very famous dictator waltz with an inflatable globe is in fact completely heavy, depressed and unmixed. <br /> <br /> Of course, Chaplin deserves praise for paying attention to Hitler and for decisively speaking about celluloid - his spiteful finale is actually a bold, memorable highlight of the piece, but the film is just not sharp and funny enough to earn the praise often imposed on him and not require repeated viewing. The best jokes away from Hinkel's tedious posturing and involve Barber trying to avoid a large rotating bomb (a sequence that steals weapons from the Gold Rush from a fight) and later, with a pot on his head, accidentally tearing the board off the Roof of his store. <br /> <br /> Compared with the directorâ€™s silent classics, the Great Dictator is slow, wildly inconsistent and generally unsatisfactory, while barren periods of laughter are often long and difficult to read. There is no doubt that Chaplin was a genius, but even geniuses make disappointing pictures, and the Great Dictator is certainly considered such.
