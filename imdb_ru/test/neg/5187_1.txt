I think if you like snowboarding, you can enjoy viewing the beautiful landscapes and some nice stunts. but that's all the film has to offer. the storyline is missing, and any jokes that could be in the film were not funny, even at the level of sympathy. I also didn’t like the characters, the main actor (Adam Grimes) tried his best, and for a comedy that shouldn’t be too big, but surrounded by so many bad actors he didn’t hope to make this film good, but I shouldn’t be too harsh with them, because I know that they could have a great skill, but with a script that I could write in ten minutes, no matter what skills they had, they were hidden because of the fear of appearing in this film, My advice : do not look, I would never do that!
