This film had a very intricate plot and a very skillful setting, which I honestly could not follow, which is surprising, given that action and dialogue may have been only the product of the kindergarten letter. If you like Katie Ireland, you might want to see it. Perhaps the film was created in order to draw her into Hollywood, but if that were his goal, I would say that I hope that she did not invest too much money in his production.
