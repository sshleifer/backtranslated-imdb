Finally. Here is a film that does as much for the reputation of the men of Greece and Russia as “Gigli” did for the reputation of Mr. Affleck and Mrs. Law. FROM "THE EDGE OF THE CITY" tells about the sad and dirty life of some young Russian émigrés who live in and around Athens and spend their time robbing cars, sitting down on the ground, prying up immigrant women and prostituting themselves we don’t know, and if so, only once or twice. With the same guy, only the Athenian language adds a little bit of novelty - even then there is only a scene or two that are pictorial. Writer / director Konstantin Jannaris (“3 steps to heaven ") offers relatively common 95 minutes in which outstanding moments include how stupid, sexist and (in terms of appearance) most of these guys are irreparable. (Interestingly, the more fun a guy is, the more redeemable he looks.) What is really annoying is handling Women. It would seem that Greek and Russian men are making the Italians run after their money for this famous Madonna / Slut complex. Has the situation in Greece improved significantly for women since the times of Plato and Socrates? Need to wonder. <br /> <br /> If in this review I equate Russians and Greeks, then I apologize, but even the non-emigrants depicted here (for example, taxi driver) are creeps. According to another review on this site, the film (hit in his native land) was actually presented by Greece for an Oscar for best foreign film. What does it say about the state of the Greek film industry, I do not dare to think.
