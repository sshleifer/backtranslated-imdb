I know that so many reviews on IMDb are extreme when reviewers either praise the film or indifferently tear it into pieces. I don’t find any of these reviews helpful, and therefore I don’t give this movie a horrible review, which I’m going to do, lightly. The film is the worst-looking art fiction, dressed as a Hollywood blockbuster. Trailers attract you by showing you what seems like a solid plot, but in reality this is only a small part of a series of events that are deliberately misleading and which are never solved properly. I like films that challenge the viewer, and I don’t need to be fed with a spoon, and therefore my complaint about this film is not that it’s too loud. No - the movie is just awful. As the credits begin, you will feel real anger at wasting your time on Cameron Diaz’s wooden game and intermittent plot. Avoid.
