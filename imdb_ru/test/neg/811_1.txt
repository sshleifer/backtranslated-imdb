Established in 1945, Schenbarth follows a failed Swedish book editor who decides to catch a nonstop train to Berlin. Unfortunately for everyone around him, he is a walking catastrophe, causing chaos wherever he goes. The train also contains a man and his mistress who are plotting to kill the manâ€™s wife (who is also on the train), a soldier on his way home, two elderly gay gentlemen, an angry train conductor, two nuns, a handful of refugees and even more people. <br /> <br /> Keeping in mind the mixture of thriller noir (which he does quite well - at least for a start) and comedy, the film fails with both. It does not suit, because the film changes the tone with each new scene. And when the train rushes to its final destination, the film becomes more and more strange, ending on a truly surreal note. <br /> <br /> Good moments are lost in countless meaningless scenes and characters. Schenbarth is filled with famous Swedish actors, no matter how small the role. It seems that the filmmakers called everyone they ever worked with and offered them a role in the film. It is a pity that the performances are as bad as the script (play your own lines - do not read them!). <br /> <br /> A comedy is a more or less rude disturbance, with the same jokes repeated over and over. From time to time it is incredibly slow (quite often, in fact), especially on the stage, which lasted about ten minutes without a good reason. The screenwriter also seems to think that swearing is a good way to replace decent dialogue. The film looks great, albeit in a capricious black-and-white, but it is wasted on such inept shooting in any other department. [1/10]
