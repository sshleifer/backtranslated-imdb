Unfortunately, House of D is just awful, with a ridiculous plot, a terrible letter, some kind of mediocre game, and in fact almost everything else in it is not true. <br /> <br /> Tom flees from New York to somehow survive as the Lonely Child in Paris, and he manages to convince a beautiful Parisian girl that he will eventually marry that he is French, despite poor understanding of her language. She was shocked when, after years, he revealed to her his “secret”! Riiiight! <br /> <br /> Then he “gives” his story about grief to his son, and the one whom we must believe believes that this is simply the greatest birthday present that dad can give to his 13-year-old boy. If only such things were so easy! David Duchovny misses his own wife, Tea Leoni as his mother, and strikes him out once again. Leonie makes me laugh like a comic book, but she just isn't suitable for this role. <br /> <br /> One of the problems is that none of the characters sympathize. I just do not care what happened to one of them. I very much hoped that Robin Williams and his trademark “child in the body of an adult” would fall into a hole in the village, but, alas, this did not happen, and we had to endure his simple speech to the end. <Br /> <br /> Anton Yelchin and William Zeld's daughter were quite good, but I suspect that the enthusiastic reviews that others give them are simply because they were not as bad as everyone in this film. They were not good, let me say it like that. <br /> <br /> There are so many stupid and contrived aspects in this film - Erica Badu, a bicycle, a catholic school and a staff of morons, conveniently stupid characters, etc. - this review will last forever, so I’ll just finish by saying that “House D” is a very bad film, and I’m almost embarrassed for Duchovny. <br /> <br /> What really annoys me is that the online “friends” encouraged me so much when they saw it, that I had come a long way to do it. <br /> <br /> I wouldn’t be so annoyed that this film is so bad if I just spent a couple of hours down at the local cinema, but instead I lost a whole day and found that my so-called “friends” either stupid or dishonest because it's a terrible movie!
