The best part in this film, I believe, is the first one located in Sicily. Cryalese shows a good talent for photography, and the beginning of the film is amazingly surprising. The rest of the story is pretty boring. Crilez uselessly insists on stereotypical situations and characters, trying to melt the neorealist proposals and video-musical technique, Fellin's surrealistic memories and a very annoying and completely off topic soundtrack, leading all this to an end that gives you an overly long sense of story that ended abruptly. To be honest, this is a real overpriced film, and Crialese is a true overvalued director.
