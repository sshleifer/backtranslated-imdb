When I was making this DVD, I knew perfectly well that it may well be one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. But to say that it was one of the worst films I've ever watched would be easy. I wonder if some legal action could be taken against the persons who authorized the production of this film. I mean, the financing had to come from somewhere, someone had to put money into making it work !! ?? <br /> <br /> I would define several production values ​​that led to the failure of this film, but this film has violated all the production standards in the universe. I could not make it through the entire film, as I was dizzy from the terrible shooting techniques. I also cannot tell you how many scenes I have just finished zoning due to an inexplicably awful dialogue. <br /> <br /> I feel that I have forever scars for life. If you watched this movie before you received this warning, you should consider creating with me a support group for poor people who actually saw this monster.
