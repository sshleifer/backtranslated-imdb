Teen Tamara (Jenna Devan) is very rude. All the popular "children" make fun of her for being shy, bookish, awkward and because of her interest in witchcraft. All football players and fans are especially angry with her for writing an article on the abuse of steroids for the school newspaper. In addition, her father is drunk, her mother is not around, and she is secretly in love with her fellow English teacher (Matthew Marsden). Popular children make a cruel joke to humiliate her, accidentally kill her during a fight, bury her body in the forest and make a contract to keep quiet. To their shock, the next day Tamara returns to the classroom, looking seductive and dressed to kill. Yes, returning from the dead and ready for supernatural revenge against all involved. She also takes the time to get her sexually abusive ass to eat a bottle of beer and tries to seduce her English teacher from his wife (Claudette Mink), a school counselor. <br /> <br /> Acting and writing is strictly mediocre. You can also say that people responsible for this have seen films like CARRIE (1976), HELLO MARY LOU: PROM NIGHT II (1987) and THE CRAFT (1996), because he borrowed all three of these excellent films. There is some blood (the guy cutting off the ear and tongue and then striking the eyeball, probably the best bit), an unpleasant vomiting scene and a few watchful / witty unidirectional ones. In any case, this is not a terrible film, but there is not much originality in it.
