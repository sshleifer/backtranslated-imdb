Where do I begin? The box should have been enough to keep me from this attempt, but from the very beginning I was taught not to judge the book (or film) by its cover, so I ignored the ugly graphic quality of the box and still rented it. But common sense should tell you that if they can't properly make a single still image, how dark will moving images be later? Yeah. They were pretty awful. <br /> <br /> The actors in this film seemed completely unaware that they were being shot, because any expression seemed to work well, regardless of the situation in which the characters were or what they reacted to. <br /> <br /> However, a good story can make up for the shortcomings of low-cost industries. Good dialogue can carry an unsuccessful attempt from time to time. Unfortunately, this was not one of those times, since the story was as weak and non-existent as the other necessary elements of a good movie. <br /> <br /> There is simply no word about how bad it is. <br /> <br /> Maybe you can get a glimpse of my -2.3 / 10 rating from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
