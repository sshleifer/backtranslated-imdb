Harlan Banks is a thief at the top of his game, but after a successful career he decided to get a job with his woman and resign. However, he decides to get his last day job in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive the car, and it seems simple. Unfortunately, someone warns the police, and after a restless car chase, he gets into the helmet only to save himself and take revenge on those who betrayed and first of all brought him there. Then comes the typical action movie. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal plays himself (amazingly!) In a raincoat and a sports colt in 1911, along with his regular aikido, breaking bones. Colt and aikido were always with him, but the first thing I remember about him in a raincoat is “Alien.” This is not particularly impressive, but it adds a small mark to Seagal's deadly arsenal. Or it covers those extra pounds that it packs. Look at it the way you choose. His main friend throughout the film is Trijc (another new thing, the rapper in the action movie), and they both reveal a small plot of bad guys on both sides of the law and pay tribute to each villain. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film is that it hurts, and I really mean it hurts, non-original. Seagal just watches the catchy story throughout the film, and even he manages to get duller as the film progresses. Then in the final scene there is a transition from the boring to the completely ridiculous, when people who seemed to be dead, killing each other suddenly, for no reason, start talking. A groan suggestive in every sense of the word. The only real positive point here is a decent discovery - a car chase in Las Vegas, full of inverted police cars and, as a rule, entertaining chaos, but after this brief presentation you have already seen it all before. 3/10 Rated R: constant violence and profanity
