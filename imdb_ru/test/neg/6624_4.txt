People seem to disagree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time. People of the same type who watch the movie “Carrot Top” on the cover, roam the damn office and continue to watch the movie with serious expectations. Is carrot top funny? Of course not. Was this movie something special? Of course not. It was a stupid film, and everyone assumed it was simply based on what they know about Mr. Top. Such films, or Kazaam, or Killer Klowns From Outer Space, and virtually any film that Poly Shore has ever starred in should not be taken seriously, and therefore should not be considered as one of the worst films ever made. You watch them or expect a stupid film that is ridiculously bad, or you are six years old, and you sincerely think that Carrot Top is funny. <br /> <br /> Please, people, if you are ready to know that Carrot Top is retarded, and you want to watch a serious movie and take the trouble to write a serious review .... do not watch it. To choose in this film is like choosing a five-year-old child who does not know the alphabet.
