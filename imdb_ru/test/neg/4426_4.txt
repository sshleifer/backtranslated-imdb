Luo Wei's next performance, fully depleting young Jackie Chan's talents, “Kill with intrigue” is a strange mixture of Wuxi, melodrama, supernatural action and a simple old-school kung-fu fight that is quite boring despite the somewhat surreal moments of WTF and a lot of ridiculously bad communication. <br /> <br /> To protect his pregnant girlfriend Chin Chin from Killer Bees, gangs of ruthless killers who are about to attack his house, Kao Lei (Jackie Chan) pretends to be a heartless guy, driving her away and thereby saving her from danger . <br /> <br /> During the attack, all the relatives of Cao were killed, but the gang, the leader of which is a scar, remains relatively intact, the woman seems to have everything for him. Then Cao goes in search of Chin Chin, whose safety he entrusted to his close friend Chu Chuk. <br /> <br /> During the search for his true love, Cao supports the head of a courier company, whose precious cargo was stolen by the leader of the evil Blood Rain clan. In the end, after being wounded in a battle against members of the nasty clan (a funny scene with lots of stupid weapons), and then recovered with a pigtail scar (which shows his love, burning his face!), In the end, Cao learns that He is a lousy judge of character: his friend, Chu Chuk, is none other than a hungry Khan of the Blood Rain clan, who plans to marry Chin Chin himself. <br /> <br /> Take part in a protracted battle, when Cao was hit in the face several times, before finally strangling his traitor to death with a scarf. <br /> <br /> Even die-hard Chan fans will find this job hard. in order to survive, only in the final fight was it possible to demonstrate some of the star's amazing acrobatic abilities. Fans of common Asian strangeness can dig up the terrible appearance of Killer Bees at the beginning of the film (with one character inexplicably demanding to cut his arm back!), Or the moment when three people swim through the window to attack our hero, but for most this film will have very limited appeal.
