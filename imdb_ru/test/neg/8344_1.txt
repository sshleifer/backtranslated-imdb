I saw this movie, and I thought it was a stupid movie. What is even more stupid than someone who thought there should be a volcano in Los Angeles? The fact is that there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles. This film should not be shot in Los Angeles, it should be shot in Honolulu, Hawaii. There are volcanoes in Hawaii, and itâ€™s a real fact that this film should be shot in the state capital of Hawaii. This film should be shot in Hawaii, because this is a real idea, not in Los Angeles. There are earthquakes in Los Angeles, but no volcanoes. Honestly, this is incredible nonsense and very stupid. In conclusion, I will not worry about this film, because the volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but stupidity.
