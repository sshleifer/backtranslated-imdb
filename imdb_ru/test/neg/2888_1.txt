This movie is worse than terrible! He took a good plot and turned it into a schizophrenic movie. The photo is extremely amateur. ., It seems that the project of home cinema of the 5th class is filmed with defective 8 mm children's cameras. It seems that the editing was done by someone with psychotic memories (while on drugs and drinking), with short scenes followed by other unrelated scenes, and then fragments of scenes are inserted. , completely unnecessary and useless nudity. missing scenes Daytime scenes inexplicably turn into night scenes, and then suddenly return to daytime. There is obviously no continuity. The good acting skills of Tom Skerrit, Wendy Hughes and James Mason, as well as the talents of the “key” cast, are in vain (forget about Anderson's villain and women - a very amateur acting game). This film is a good candidate for a remake, even with Skerritt and Hughes. .. just do it professionally this time.
