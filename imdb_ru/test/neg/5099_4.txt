As can be seen from the above, this film did not impress me. It is pleasant to look at, the landscape is magnificent, but the details of the story, in particular the characters, are absolutely incredible. Films should not be believable, but such films with political advantage and social commentary do. <br /> <br /> Similarly, I have no problems with commercialization as such, but, again, such films should not make casting decisions solely on the basis of box office. This is absolutely true for Sutherland, who frankly trash like Doyle. His accent was far from genuine, but he fell into the biggest trap of all, his accent is his performance, and as a result we get a caricature of Irish people who have no personality beyond his nationality. I consider it completely implausible that any of those present thought that he was the best person for this job. In general, this is a clear case of commercial interest in quality, and when you try to become a Mission, such things ruin your chances of success. <br /> <br /> Speaking of accents, there were a couple of problems, one of which was the striking modernity of Boy’s accent, which dispelled the feeling of transference at another time. Even more surprising was Samantha Morton's Irish accent, which at least was variable. Her voice wanders between strong north and soft south, even in those voice-overs where I would expect such discrepancies to be found. <br /> <br /> However, these are minor gaps compared to Sarah’s motivation and actions. She never seems to be at home with the British and almost instantly feels at home with her son and his tribe, the dilemma between life she knew and the life she suggested just seems easy. Perhaps a lot was lost in editing, perhaps it was a three-hour film or mini-series in which these things could be revealed, but I can only judge what I saw. <br /> <br /> Now the biggest problem, Sarah (Morton )’s relationship with Doyle (Sutherland), is incomprehensible. The fact is that her attachment to him is not transmitted in any way until she has to choose between him and her son, the conflict she goes through at that moment was frankly funny and killed the film for me. <br /> <br /> You guessed it. This film did not work for me, but to watch it at the highest level, you really will not see anything more amazing in terms of scenery, there are some good performances, and my wife liked it.
