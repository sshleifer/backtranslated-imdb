It could be the best game ever !! But the creators of the game just screwed up after 3 kills and finals !! This is a combination of Prince of Persia, Hit-man, GTA and Age Of Empires II (Saladin). <br /> <br /> Yes, these four games mentioned above are considered one of the greatest games ever created. <br /> You unite the four, and you get this game !! It has all the good aspects of four games, such as acrobatic skills, secretive murders, an open world and HISTORY !! For the first 3 kills, you feel this game is the best !! But after the third event, it seems so repetitive that you hope the GAME WILL END. <br /> <br /> I played this game on a PC, and the PC version is terrible with glitches and stupid side missions. meaningless. <br /> <br /> MY advice to everyone. This is a good game, but get it for the XBOX360 or PS3. DON'T GET it for PC. <br /> <br /> Finally, this game came from the creators of Prince Of Persia. Of course, the producer is hot, but the game is not hot, and it is NOT better than the four games mentioned above !!
