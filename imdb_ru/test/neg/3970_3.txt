Parts: Clonus' horror is not so bad in the film. I have the MST3K version on tape, and it's funny, but it's still not the worst movie I've ever made. I would say that it was better than 80% of the films they laughed at. The concept could work if they had a better script, more money and decent actors. He could have become a classic if he had not been so boring and had a little more excitement. Unfortunately, it was put into production and ended up on MST3K.
