Some films you watch and say: "Well, it does not make sense." And you don't mean that. You just say that everything was too complicated or slightly meaningless. <br /> <br /> "Bread and circus" does not make any sense. And I mean it. And this is not because it is surreal. From the very beginning, it's pretty clear that this is a weak excuse for doing special effects. There is no script. There is no plot. There is no history of any kind. One event does not lead to the next — that’s how fundamentally bad writing is here. <br /> <br /> So what? I mean, there are many films that fall into this category. They want to show you blood, they give you blood. Why even talk about it? <br /> <br /> Because in this case Circle Bread gave me hope. Well, there are some surreal elements. Vagina, in the ground - people crawl out of them. Earth in space, two legs on both sides. These kinds of images are great, funny, weird, crazy. But the film does nothing with them. <br /> <br /> Something happens, the film ends, and all this is very unsatisfactory. I suspect the script was made on the fly. Very bad. If there ever was a story of ANY species, it would be much more fascinating. <br /> <br /> The film is very similar to the beautiful car you would like to have. Then you raise the hood, and there is no engine. Just a little man who trades on a bicycle. <br /> <br /> GRR!
