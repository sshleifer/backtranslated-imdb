I saw this film more than 20 years ago, and I still have quite pleasant memories of it. Having caught Cinemax again this month, I realized how little insight I had about the films of that time. These are completely ordinary spaghetti westerns, in which there is nothing remarkable. Scenario, directing, acting, photography - all this is a great blah. Stick to westerns Sergio Leone!
