This film is enjoyable if you like poverty poverty, public films of the first half of the 20th century, or you like to make amateur films. The film combines public domain thrillers with recently filmed scenes in which the “actors” (with the only exception when Redfield almost died on the river Lugosi, all the “performers” are terrible!) Trying to interact with the Video. "New" frames are covered with digital scratches on the film, as well as some of the already low-quality old videos (?? !!). As far as I can understand, the plot is somehow related to the fact that a bunch of strangers gathered on the island for a testimony reading (?) This film, although it boasts a creative background called “The Dead Do Not Wear a Plaid”, this is a technical and creative crash. In one terribly long sequence and a wounded sailor on a ship describes an unsuccessful trip to the “Island of Mists”, whatever that may be! Then the "memory" incoherently links together the old shots of completely different eras and completely different quality of films. Unrelated scenes from The Lost World (1925), The Most Dangerous Game (1932), The White Zombie (1932), Bela Lugoshi Meet The Brooklyn Gorilla (1952) And Some Others productions of the poor. This is made in an incredibly bad voice that sounds too loud, as if the sound was recorded on a cheap home video camera. <br /> <br /> It seems that the filmmakers pay tribute to the great actors of the past, giving the characters the names of famous actors (Carradine, Tsukko, Ouspenskaya, etc., etc.). This tactic was made cleverly and also subtly in the “Final Destination”, here it is just disgusting! Freakish and painfully unfunny jokes about Spiderman, Dracula and Superman abound. It even uses the old as the dirt lawyer of "Dewey, Gitam and How" - he was old and tired when the "Three Puppets" used him in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Movie and audio stock, do not match the scene with the scene, and dozens of different sources are used for Lugosi. The final effect is that he seems to be getting older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger and older again and again, every minute. Oddly enough, the film did not use this as a story comedy story and misses a good chance of a comedy. <br /> <br /> Although, truth be told, it was a lot of fun to watch it late at night in bed. Maybe this is what they wanted to happen!
