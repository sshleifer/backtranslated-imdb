Kate - an exhausted young woman who has problems with meetings and meetings with guys. Throughout the film, you meet with several of her losers. And throughout the film, you are under Kateâ€™s cynical negative view of love and relationships. This negative viewpoint is preserved and presented as the Ultimate Truth. I had a real problem with this. Why would anyone want to be taught about love, life and meetings with someone who is obviously so confused? It would have worked if it was a joke, but it is not. In order for the jokes in the film (which are neither funny nor original) to work at all, you have to believe what Kate says: that all relationships inevitably end in bad or not sex, that the highest level a relationship can develop is when you can fart in front of your partner ... you have an idea. <br /> <br /> Lately, there has not been a single film that upset your belly so much as Love and sex. Why did the filmmakers spend their time on such garbage? Every joke in Love & Sex is something that I experienced in another movie or in my own life. In the plot, production or style there is NOTHING original or creative. It is cynical, stupid and meaningless. Consciousness numb!
