I'm not sure what the meaning of this film is. It looked as if it had been made by some historical society for display in your local Pistol Pistol museum. At first it seems that this may be the beginning of a Mad TV or SNL sketch. But then the joke goes on you, when there is no zest, and you understand that someone takes it seriously. The story wasn't bad, but the inclusion of SASS members seemed to be a trick (that worked) to get me to watch a movie. I swear, the trailer listed each character in the movie before Dead Cowboy No. 5. The reason why westerns are so funny is the atmosphere and the characters she brings. It just seemed to me that I was watching the actors of the civil war, dressed like cowboys. Not even worth the digital video on which it was recorded.
