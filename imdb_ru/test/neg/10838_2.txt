It was one of the worst films Sandra Bullock starred in. Ben Affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts. This is definitely his forte, but acting is not. In fact, I lasted 54 minutes in this film before I was so bored that I had to leave the theater. This is a bore from the beginning to, well, still 54 minutes in the film. The package "Guess what happened to me on the way to ...." was done again and again to death. For some reason, there is simply nothing funny or romantic about people cheating on each other. Parents should be aware that this may not be the right movie for your teenage children, especially the impressionable, who might consider Sandra as a hero. There is a scene where scriptwriters / producers / directors think that it would be nice to show how “acceptable” to smoke a cant ... while driving ... and then have no consequences when they catch it. I'm not a bigot, and I smoked my share when I was younger, but I guarantee you that I won't take my teenagers to see it, and they are solid A & B students. If you want to watch a good Sandra Bullock film, rent "The Net" or "Hope Floats", which, I believe, are her two best works.
