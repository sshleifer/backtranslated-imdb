If she had not been married to a producer, Jennifer Jones would not have been the most obvious choice for the leading female role in this tragic story about a romance between an American soldier and an English nurse against the background of the First World War. Her British accent is not perfect, and in the fifties it was unusual for a romantic woman when she came to the actress in her late thirties, even as attractive as Miss Jones, especially when she was several years older than her lead man .. At that time Hollywood had many wonderful young British actresses, such as Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Gene Simmons and Joan Collins, who could be more convincing in this role, but Miss Jones had one important attribute that they were all missing, namely, witness The marriage with the name of David O. Selznick on it. In the end, the film turned out to be such a turkey that they were undoubtedly grateful that it was not in their resume. <br /> <br /> The film details the romance between Frederick, an American volunteer serving in the Italian army as an ambulance driver, and Catherine, a nurse from the British Red Cross. After the Italian defeat in the battle of Caporetto, Frederick was mistakenly accused of being a German spy and sentenced to death. (The film paints a very harsh picture of the Italian military justice; it seems that Italian military courts had the right to impose the death penalty after a trial that lasted for thirty seconds without hearing any evidence and not allowing the defendant to be legally represented or to defend him ). Frederick manages to escape and cross the border into neutral Switzerland, accompanied by pregnant Catherine. <br /> <br /> When filming, Hemingway novels were not always successful. Howard Hocs managed to create a good version of “To Have and Not Have”, a film that is significantly better than the book on which it is nominally based, but this is because he largely ignored Hemingway’s story and turned the film into a remake of “Casablanca”, established in Martinique, not in French Morocco. Like the 1943 version of For Whom the Bell Tolls, Farewell to Arms is too long and deadly slow. This is also wrong. Jennifer Jones never makes Catherine come to life. Regarding Rock Hudson, his intended Christian name may unfortunately be appropriate. He could be as hard as a rock, but just as impassive as he was, and in this film his Frederick seemed to imitate a great stone face. Despite the passion and emotions inherent in the plot of Hemingway, the emotional temperature is always too cool. The picture has little to do, except for some attractive picture postcards with views of the Italian and Swiss landscapes. It is not surprising that this was not a success, and that his failure ended his career as a producer. 4/10 <br /> <br /> Fool. Shortly before the battle of Kaporetto, an Italian officer declares that Russia has already concluded a separate peace with Germany. This battle began in October 1917, when Kerensky’s Russia was still fighting together with the Allies. The Russian revolution did not occur until November; it was only the “October Revolution” according to the old Julian calendar. The new Bolshevik regime signed a truce with Germany in December 1917, but the separate world was not signed until the Brest-Litovsk Treaty in March 1918.
