What I hoped for (or even expected) was well-known images of “stop motion” and extreme slow movements, extreme scales and all the fascinating looks of a fish eye. In short: the art of a) find interesting visual events and b) capture them as the human eye is not capable of, reproduce so that the human eye can see. The stuff that made other Katsi hits. <br /> <br /> I just wondered how the creation of the whole would correspond to the name. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I had a feeling that the focus in this third part was on the message, and not on the packaging. This is normal, especially since the message is valid. But I already knew the message, and it turned out that I had nothing left. More than half of the film was solarized, colored, posterized or transformed through some other filter. It looked very much like the effects of your camcorder, but you never used it. Many images would be more beautiful without filters, such as chasing giraffes and zebras. You could say that “technology or some malicious source based on man has distorted our beautiful nature”, but why use these seventies effects to symbolize it? At that moment when this cheap effect lasted more than 10 minutes, I was ready to leave. The hope that the others could not be so bad made me stay. But then there was a slow motion: slow motion is good, because it gives you time to analyze the moving image. But if no more than 24, or maybe 50 or 60 frames per second, then the movement is simply not enough to slow down. Please record the movement that needs to be slowed down faster, as was done with beautiful shots of foaming and splashing water (some of them) of laughing people and singing singing songs. I admit that archived images cannot be redone, but in any case I have already seen a lot of footage, he could do without it. It must have been a lot of search work in archival material, and the effects could not be as easy to use and streamline. In addition, most of the work was mixed with each other. This shows that the creator was not going to lengthen the film or to feel sorry for himself. But I didn’t like the mixed material a bit ... The idea behind it was sometimes good or even clever, but the implementation was insufficient. Computer-generated images did not bother me much, although they were outdated. The flow of "bits" through the channels (in the first part of the film) looked fresher and was pleasant. Mandelbrot is always fun, the fractal mountains were smaller. I was pleased to hear the cello playing the main role in music. A little less vibrato at certain times would be appropriate with Glass's music, but this is a matter of taste. Like all of the above, of course. I very much hope that another Katsi story will appear soon, where computer images will play a less significant role, and this will inspire someone to get back on the field. <br /> <br />
