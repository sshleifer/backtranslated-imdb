I know a lot of people who like this show, and I apologize to people who find this show to be awesome, but this is the worst show ever created. Of course, I’m sure I would be a big fan of this show if Jeremy Clarkson hadn’t been on it. I mean, I think testing cars and doing things like see if a car can beat a plane is great! But Jeremy Clarkson is just pathetic. Here are the reasons why I hate this person: He thinks it would be nice to trick speed cameras, which measure average speed, measuring distance and time, driving 200 miles an hour along the road and then resting for two hours. He clearly thinks he is better than Richard Hammond and James May. He has my best friend who says pathetic things. He screams at the kids just to take a picture of him. Sorry, but Jeremy Clarkson is crazy.
