Is Norris playing a Chicago cop who stumbles upon a devil's apprentice? who wants, well, create Armegeddon. He eventually kills the creature, getting it, throwing a golden 24-inch spike, not very sharp, about twenty feet, tough enough to penetrate the chest. Unlikely? So the rest of the movie. Much of this consists of CN and his assistant driving cars and talking nonsense. An Israeli (or Arabic) child supposedly humanizes CN. OK. Does not work, does not make sense, and promotes the plot, the so-called, not a step. In addition, none of the policemen ever receive an invitation from the country to interview other police officers. This is ridiculous as a prerequisite. All this is bad. Unfortunately, it is not so bad to be funny bad or hiking. Just bad. But - you can see how Norris tried to find his way to the successful Walker: Texas Ranger series.
