Sad in all aspects, this is a bad excuse for career Connery was neither one nor the other, as Warners wanted. This film and RoboCop-2, lasting 20 minutes and filled with embarrassing moments for all participants, are proof that Irwin Kershner had no real control over “The Empire Strikes Back.” Connery has not been in shock since he bowed to Bond in 1971, but this did not return him at all.

Imagine that - Roger Moore Bond is not only better than the simultaneous release of Connery, but also surpasses it (and compared to "Never ...", "Octopus" is on par with "2001". <br /> < br /> The Bond's worst themed song, even worse than “The Man with the Golden Gun”, meaningless scenes that drag on meaninglessly (the worst example is the ridiculous sequence of video games - MY GOD - WHO CARES?!) and the worst collection is not talented As for the legendary “Bond Girls.” Someone SERIOUSLY thinks that Kim Basinger is attractive. in this film?

The two actors never seemed so clumsily tied together - look at the scene where, to avoid local authorities, they undress to their boxers and pretend to train - I can't imagine another scene in any film that tried so badly to laugh
