Although I think that reviewers who hated this film encapsulated exactly what he was doing wrong (everyone!), I had to add my two cents. If you want to get a long version of how awful this movie is, read the review on coinlightning. <br /> <br /> Here is the short version: the shameless use of the actors МЕН names to promote the plot, and not the use of their talent (no one has led to this “game”), blatant commercialism (I suppose Pepsi can afford to insert ads - or 40 - to the movie now), and the plot (???) that was so confused with the "rock star" says that it was completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you this. I was thinking about Wayne's World the whole time I watched this movie, but I wasn’t laughing! Every time you try to add Steven Tyler (Aerosmith) to help your plot of the film, you have a SERIOUS problem. <br /> <br /> PLEASE warn your friends and family - this movie sucks.
