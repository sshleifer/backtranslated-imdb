If you saw Atlantis-1, you would know that this film is truly magnificent - brilliant animation and a good script. This film was SO casually drawn and animated. The story is also sluggish. I was so disappointed with this semi-dry chatter that I could not get through the first hour, and MAN tried! The only thing that was in this film is that it expanded the “mole”, making it more attractive and three-dimensional. Take it from me, judge this stuff from the cover on the video box. A Disney slok is badly drawn on the cover, clearly grabbing a light dollar from an unsuspecting parent. If it was a lonely movie, it would not be so bad, but riding a coat of a brilliant figure, such as Atlantis, makes it completely unjustified.
