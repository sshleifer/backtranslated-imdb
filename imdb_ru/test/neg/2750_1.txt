This film is all but the true story of Phulan Devi. Director Shahar Kapurâ€™s allegations are opposed by the fact that he shot the entire film without even meeting Phulan Devi, on whose life this film should be based! The excuse is that this meeting would prevent the director's concept of history! The film is wasting the possibility of raising public awareness of the plight of lower-caste women in Indian society and ends with a stereotype depicting Phulana Devi as an evil woman whose only motivation is revenge. Not surprisingly, this film Shekhara Kapoor was successful in the west, as he cared for their non-Hollywood tastes!
