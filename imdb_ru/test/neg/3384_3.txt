Don't get me wrong, I love bad movies ... no, I adore bad movies, Troll 2 ... Oh, it hurts, Manos Hands of Destiny ... just watch the Trade, Guru Mad Monk leave ... traffic noise medieval background? Well, this is understandable, but this is one of those films that clearly tried to become something better, but could not do it. Why not? Well, it would be easy to blame the plot, but hehe, we saw worse, there were not too many holes, and hehe, I know that there’s not much originality, but then it shouldn’t kill the film. The effects are not bad (if you completely ignore the last scene), the monster is fine, the truck is rather formidable, so where did it all go wrong? Well, I would like to blame this for Chris Moyles Harley ... so I will! Comedy and horrors are hard to mix, bad comedy and horrors are even worse, and there is a problem. I hated this guy from the moment he stuck his head (literally), the constant beating of the overly meek Adam becomes annoying, so annoying that you lose faith in the fact that the softest of people will not react by pushing him out of a moving car. the door ... and I thought it was the monsters that the director had to convince us of. Why are bad movies more fun? Well, you have a lot of fun when you peep at them, laugh at the script, fight, etc. This film is not in the coveted category of “Worst films”, because it’s just bad because of its intrusiveness. Do not worry, go look at something else, and you will become the best person for this ... I promise! (The chants of Torgo Torgo Torgo disappear)
