This movie has one or two little interesting jokes, but they are NOT worth the wait. After an inexplicable dispute between two guys who collect garbage in the cinema by car, we leave for a family! Hollywood and driving behind the wheel, driving their caravan on the screen again and again when meaningless dialogue sounds. At least, I think this is a stupid, terrible song that accompanies this montage, mixed so loudly that it sometimes makes the dialogue almost unintelligible. <br /> <br /> Finally, the van arrives at night at a gas station where the family goes, and once again fusses before leaving. Then the camera turns, showing the actor we have just seen leaving. He speaks directly to the camera, and we understand that he is the director of the film that we are watching, about him and how he came to make the film. <br /> <br /> A good idea that ALMOST (but not quite) makes previous episodes justified. <br /> <br /> When the film unfolds, he is confronted with two characters that we met, collecting garbage at the beginning of the film, and they all form a film company. <br /> <br /> All kinds of not-so-funny and awkward comedies happen when they put together a film crew and try to raise the money they need to get started. <br /> <br /> This film was obviously compiled on a string and a promise, and there is a great little idea here that struggles to get out, but the execution is so irrelevant that the idea is lost. Comedy is more than just falling things, and everyone is talking (or shouting) at the same time. Several actors shout out such a part of the dialogue here - Robert Altman can do such things well, because he has the script, the rehearsals, the decent sound engineers and the editing tools. Everyone who shouts at a single microphone, which, by the sound, was hidden in a dustbin in the next room, does not provide clarity.
