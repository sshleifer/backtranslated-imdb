Wow. I was watching “One Night” at McCool yesterday, and all I can say is “Wow.” <br /> <br /> Here I am. BASIC SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Would you like to summarize the plot, just to see how stupid and meaningless this film is? I would never tell anyone to watch this if I didn’t want to hurt them. Anyway, here's a glimpse (or a huge piece) of the plot. <br /> <br /> Randy works in McCool’s bar. He meets this woman named Jewel, who unexpectedly convinces him to have sex with him. Her ex-boyfriend ends up trying to rob them and die. Randy, his cousin and detective at the crime scene all fall in love with Jewel. She, being a talisman of stupidity, uses each of these guys to get what she wants using a DVD player. Randy hires an assassin to kill her, and eventually the detective was murdered by the ex-boyfriend's psycho-brother, and the assassin and Jewel flew away. <br /> <br /> Seriously. That's all. I left almost nothing out, for a few more sex scenes and almost-pornographic scenes of Love Tyler, like Jewel with a hose, to flaunt my sexuality, except. <br /> <br /> What is the meaning of this film? Honestly, I think that producers and directors could show their male beliefs. Which I consider absolutely inappropriate and just silly. When I watch a movie, I want a plot. I want characters. I don't care about a sexy woman flaunting everything they can have. For God's sake, something has to happen in the movie. This is as bad as Fight Club. <br /> <br /> It gets worse. John Goodman is a detective dedicated to a higher being. I myself wondered why Goodman was playing into something so ugly as miserable as this, but then I remembered that he was in “Brother, where are you? also. His reputation has just gone down. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler was an amazing actress in the series “The Lord of the Rings.” In this film, she is nothing more than an unreasonable slut who wants nothing but her way. Her reputation has fallen seven or eight steps to me. <br /> <br /> I’m amazed, just POSTED that people work so hard to do something so stupid. The music is absolutely trashy (playing “YMCA”, while the character John Goodman is being killed is not quite suitable), the characters are absolutely incredible, the plot is one of the dumbest people ever conceived, and, finally, it doesn't even fit into one . The closest he gets pornographic comedies. If it was even funny. What was not. <br /> <br /> I think now I have finished speaking. But let me assure you that no one in their right mind would ever want to see this movie. Unless they crave Liv Tyler like heroes, that is.
