Anyone who complains that Peter Jackson is making films for too long should go through this CBS “event.” About 45 minutes of the story are complemented by 2 hours of unnecessary scenes, which demonstrate soft television series clichés. Bad science is a staple for films about catastrophic weather, so I'm not going to complain about it. Foolish science can be fun to watch if it is done in a fun way. What kills this film is its 10 plots ... all of which can be removed without destroying what should be the central plot. The only character interesting to watch in category 6 is Tommy Tornado, despite the fact that he is a very annoying stereotype. <br /> <br /> Please note that I also did not comment on special effects. Their quality should not come as a surprise. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
