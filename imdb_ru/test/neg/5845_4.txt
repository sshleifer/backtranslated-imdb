This story had the potential of a good movie. Difficult choice of love versus money and longing and regret for doing the wrong. However, the film was spoiled by Robert Redford's terrible mistake as a villain who offers $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Demi Moore. How Redford should pay for it. The boyish beauty Redford and the all-American charm simply do not consider him an incredible, menacing boor. Redford's acting skills are not enough to make his character threatening. I see it now, $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Robert Redford. Ok, says the lady, but you have to give me some time to raise money. Jack Nicholson would be perfect as a scoundrel.
