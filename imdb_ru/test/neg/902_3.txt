Some films are extraordinary, but enjoyable, but many films are just overwhelmingly weird. Motorama does not fit well into the latter category. Many seem to like it because of the endless appearances of the guests and the complete lack of meaning, but these two things can only take the film, and “Motorrama” simply has no other virtues. <br /> <“Motorama” admires incredible stories. His main character, Gus, a 10-year-old swearger traveling in an imaginary country, is trying to collect game pieces to win $ 500 million. When interacting with adult figures, none of them notices and is not concerned that he is 10 years old. At first, this is incredibly funny, but it quickly becomes just incredible, especially considering the people he encounters, and the fact that he seems so indifferent because of the many disturbing (for the same age) images occurring around him. Gus has no depth, and being an antihero who has no problems with others bringing their gaming chips, it’s hard for him to feel sorry for him when he faces a problem. <br /> <br /> This problem is due to the sheer number of guest appearances, each of whom mistreated Gus. In addition to the fact that the already worn plot became even more incredible and less enjoyable, the characters share the lack of depth of Gus and are equally memorable. The character's actions may become a little interesting, but the actors themselves add nothing to them, which negates the whole point of getting big names (anyone could play them, and the character would be the same). It seems that these guest appearances are signed more for the tent than for anything else. <br /> <br /> “Motorama” should be interesting - this is a unique idea, but in the script there is too little similarity of meaning for it to work. Incidents that should have a lasting impact on the anti-hero and the viewer will not occur, since the film moves quickly from incident to incident, in the hope that something will ultimately cause the audience to experience Gus' regret or understanding. This never happens, as nothing is allowed to connect, it just jerks back and forth, as if on a conveyor belt, one incident after another. With such a meaningless story, it ceases to be enjoyable, and the main character, who never develops to take care of herself or anyone at a higher level, “Motorrama” has little to offer except for the lousy sneaky and trying to get rich. Why should we care about this?
