I have read almost all the major books about the Manhattan project. Most people know what it was, but few understand the depth and breadth of the project. Its scale was immeasurably enormous - it was rivaled in US history, perhaps, only with the space program of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> In many areas (in most cases they were MILLIONS of people) participating in all walks of life (most secretly) throughout the country, each of which is involved in a certain and different aspect of the project, which they could not talking with the person sitting in the booth next to them, and even more so with the family. Logistical support is enormous, especially given the considerations of communications, security, and wartime transport in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> As an example, my colleague’s father was a carpenter who worked for a company that had a contract with the federal government for the Manhattan project. His job was to oversee a team of about 30 other carpenters who were responsible for making molds for casting concrete for massive research facilities in Hanford, WA. This is “everything” he did six days a week for almost two years. These carpenters needed food, shelter, sanitary facilities, hospitals and materials just like Oppenheimer and his crowd at the top of the pyramid. Just think about it! That, as they say, is simply impossible to pay tribute to in a two-hour film. However, in defense of loffe, I would say that they had an impossible task, especially because he decided to have a diverse scenario with several plots, several corners and several characters. What exactly did he think, and how could he be so arrogant as to think that it would work? This is probably Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Fatty and the little boy have so many flaws that they will need a book to list them. Terrible casting Scary (and politically motivated) letter. Bad science. Images of Groves and Oppy are particularly inaccurate and frank. Despite the script program is too obvious, it is still incredibly soft and sloppy. <br /> <br /> These shortcomings were listed elsewhere on IMDb, but I was particularly struck by the fact that scientists had so much time on their hands - softball, horseback riding, parties, semi-formal dinners, ballet and t ., not to mention the romance, and, of course, circulating political petitions. According to FM & LB, if these great brains took off their dudes and actually spent some time in the lab instead of seducing Laura Dern, we could win the war until D-Day. <br /> <br /> One final fight - - FM & LB mentions that “Fat Man” and “Little Boy” were the code names of two atomic bombs, but it does not mention that these names were a half-blow at Groves (“ Fat Man, for heavy stature) and Oppenheimer ("Little Boy", for his small stature). Another reason Paul Newman should not have been in this film ...
