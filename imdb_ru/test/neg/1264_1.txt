Viewers of Czech cinema may have liked and appreciated this film because it was Czech, but I found it banal, tedious, moronic, boring and tasteless. Again, I suspect a "foray" to increase the sales of this dog movie. Amazon describes this film as a couple of guys who refuse to grow up, but I will go even further - I think it’s about two guys who have entered dementia and are doing things that nobody wants. I was told that one of the film’s actors committed suicide after the film, and I would have believed it. When he saw his speech, he probably realized what a damn terrible job he had done, and realized that the only way to avoid utmost embarrassment was to make a “big way out,” which I am sure was much more dramatic and much better than did in the "Autumn Spring". Do not waste your time and money on this pitiful idea. This is nothing like a dog in a manger.
