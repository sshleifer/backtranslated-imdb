Who wrote the script for this film, the staff of the studio Disney ?! This is the most inaccurate adaptation in history! I wanted to laugh at a few scenes and cry over others, and it was only because of how sorry it was. We must pay tribute, there were some funny scenes, but I could spend more time with my evening. Very rarely, I turn off the film only after a quarter of the way.
