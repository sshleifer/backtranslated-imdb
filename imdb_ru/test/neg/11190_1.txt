The man kicks the dog 2 'in the air. <br /> <br /> A woman kicks a cow out of bed. <br /> <br /> A man kicks a violin on the sidewalk. <br /> <br /> A woman sucks a statue's toe for 15 seconds. <br /> <br /> A man kicks a blind man in the stomach. <br /> <br /> Jesus rapes a young girl. <br /> <br /> That's it. I just saved you the hour of your life. Of course, there are those who would like this “shocking avant-garde cinematic expression”. But I discovered that this is no different from a childish, torn video that I shot with friends in 9th grade. Except that we never had a real cow. <br /> <br /> Hearing endless sermons from art experts on how important this film is, I thought it was worth it. Make no mistake, this is crap. If I hear another man calling Bunuel “the father of cinematic surrealism,” I think I'm going to hit someone. In any case, he took a big step backwards from the onset of surrealism, begun by his elders Fritz Lang (Metropolis), FV Murnau (Faust) and Robert Wine (Caligari) 10 years earlier. It made a joke out of all this, as if Buñuel did not have the confidence to truly accept art without sarcasm, sans l'absurdité. Bunuel will need another 40 years to turn his style into something amazing. Skip the early stuff and jump right into 1970 if you want his work to make a greater impression on you. <br /> <br /> I’m sure he will agree. In 1977, Bunuel himself declared that he would be happy to burn all the prints of his old films. In this case, I would be happy to pour lighter fluid.
