This is a polarizing film. People either love it or despise it, it seems. I, I despise it. The film comes from the same context as the Lindsay Anderson film “Oh, the lucky one”, but although it is a masterpiece, it is simply terrible. <br /> <br /> Both films take Kafka’s unfinished novel America for inspiration and a shared ideal. America is a surreal story of young people's travels around the country. Kafka uses this character as a pure observer, one who does not change during the entire journey (although the book is about 300 pages and it seems that it is only a quarter finished, so we will never know). Allowing Kafka to focus and comment on absurd / surreal situations and situations. “Oh lucky man,” he follows the same pattern to show Britain through the eyes of Malcolm McDowell, and Weekend does the same for France. <br /> <br /> Both films are also very Brecht, using various techniques and techniques to emphasize the fact that this is NOT REAL, this is confabulation, etc. But the difference occurs when “Oh, lucky ”Uses the created film to convey the absurdity of life and the class system;“ Weekend ”uses the created film to beat us to death with ideological controversy. As Godard goes further than Anderson in his Brecht principles, we get two main characters, in which we don’t invest at all. We had to spend 90 minutes with them, but we didn't give a damn about them. Deliberately so. But at the same time, Godard leaves us with a film entirely dedicated to his own message, which is presented in the first half of the film through steady and domineering symbolism, and in the second half through a series of long speeches aimed at the camera. In combination with unpleasant and unnecessary scenes, such as a truly horrendous murder of a pig, it is much worse than any of the collisions in a car-crash off-screen. <br /> <br /> The end result is like listening to a student political apprentice many times about his views, while repeatedly kicking you in the head so that you get a message. The problem with Brecht is that if you push the audience too far, then you push them away from what you are trying to convey. It always seemed to me to be taken for granted. <br /> <br /> However, the film does contain details that represent the contrast between the extremely sexually explicit verbal description of the three of us at the beginning and behind the scenes. comic rape in the middle, which, even if it can be considered as allegorical, completely destroys the film’s faith in himself and his characters, which was not enough in it at all. This is so in French with a capital F, it hurts. <br /> <br /> See "Oh, lucky one" instead. This is the work of genius. Weekends are pretentious work. <br /> <br /> Two stars, and only for the scene of traffic jams and the piano, which are only hints of genius, although in fact they make the end result more frustrating and unsatisfactory, as without this bad film of the worst and most pretentious director in the world, it’s obvious with them that this damn good technical director is shooting the most intellectually pretentious film in the world. Somehow it is much worse.
