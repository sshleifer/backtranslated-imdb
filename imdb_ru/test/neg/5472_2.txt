Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasans are legendary actors, and director Kostas Karagianis was the man behind the successful Greek thriller Giallo-esquire Death Kiss in 1974; and yet, when you combine three talents, all you get is a full load! Only God knows what prompted Peter Cushing and Donald Plesance to play a major role in this cheap film about devil worship, but I really hope they are well paid, because no one deserves something as amateur as it is in their resume. The story focuses on a group of devil worshipers who kidnap some children, forcing the other group to chase them. The plot is very slow, and this ensures that the film is very boring. The plot is also far from being original, and anyone who is at least fleetingly interested in the horror genre will see something like this, and will undoubtedly be much better. An obvious lack of budget is felt everywhere, and the film cannot overcome it at any moment. This is really a depressing and pitiful time, and even a little decent ending fails to raise the rate enough to raise this film from the very bottom of the barrel. Very bad stuff and definitely not recommended!
