Ted Nicolau has shot many great horror and fantasy films. I'm looking for all his films to see. I could not find this one for 3 years, until I suddenly found it on YouTube. Honestly, I wanted to see more ghosts and less talk here. It seems that in 1999-2001, Ted had a crisis, perhaps in money. His features of this time are more like real low-budget trash movies with garbage. But I am not saying that he is a bad director this time. Anything happens. In the finale there are some nice and creepy details, but the whole film was a long boring dialogue. <br /> <br /> Only for real Ted fans. <br /> <br /> www.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab
