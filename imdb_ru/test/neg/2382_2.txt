Ugh. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. None of the characters is remotely cute, which makes this film difficult to watch. All of them are unhappy thirty years who are not responsible for their dirty life. I could only do it in half an hour of the movie, so there is a chance that things will get better later, but I doubt it. I can not imagine that five people were so immersed in themselves, as they could be friends with each other for ten years. <br /> <br /> The three sex scenes in the first half hour were also disappointing, as they had no relation to the plot, and obviously it was an unjustified (unsuccessful) attempt to revive this boring movie. <br /> <br /> Save your time and money and skip this movie.
