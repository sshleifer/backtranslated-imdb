"What symbolism!" exclaimed the woman when we left the theater after seeing paeng Polish brother Ingmar Bergman. With some symbolism, everything is in order. But a little. "Northfork" is an excellent game, weakened by dull cinematography, which cannot make a coherent statement and a tangled story that is more annoying than fascinating. <br /> <br /> Northfork is a city that disappears after a new hydropower plant goes into operation. In the early and mid-1950s, a detachment of equally dressed state agents all look as if they have just responded to the casting of The Untouchables, busy relocating recalcitrant residents who cannot assess both their immediate danger and the proposed reward for moving. . An impressive anti-development film is always possible, but let's make it a reality: the electrification of rural areas is one of the greatest achievements in providing decent living conditions and a vibrant economy in American history. Dams can be built without forced relocation? Not in this country. <br /> <br /> But this film is not so much about the plight of homeowners, as about the fantastic work of the escaping fantasy of a dying boy. Nick Nolte is a priest who is inclined towards a guy, and much of what he says could be interesting if the sound was clear enough to be heard. <br /> <br /> Alternating between agents for evacuation in black suits (working on the “shore of the lake” “Earth when the dam creates this valuable area) and a phantasmagoric collection of eccentrics, the film does not develop a coherently or even interesting theme. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is bad. Blurred, muffled and depressed color permeates the entire film, almost without creating dramatic goals. There is no reason for this huge landscape to be depicted so gloomy. Indeed, the contrast between practically untouched natural beauty and the massive and grim durability of the developing dam and power stations would be very effective. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
