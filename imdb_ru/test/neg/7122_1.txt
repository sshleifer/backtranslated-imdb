For starters, I did not bother to see The Grudge. The previews of this film did not make me jump, did not scare and did not entertain me. But when a group of friends asked me to watch The Grudge 2, I accepted the invitation, a little curious about what this film will be like. I basically drove because of my friends. Even after 5 minutes of the movie, I realized that I threw away $ 7.50. The game from the beginning is terrible. At first, schoolgirls look as if they have never acted in their entire life. Then the plot of the film takes over. Let me tell you, I could not stop laughing this whole movie. This is so stupid. I'm sure they tried not to do it scary. They don't force anything to jump out or anything. He shows the children, and then shows them "attacking". It builds up to this, it is not a "sudden" thing. And even in the middle of the movie, the essence of the movie, acting is still terrible. There is so much time between dialogue that someone can add to their comments. This film is, frankly, one of the funniest horror films I've ever seen. A poorly written, terrible play, a horrible script, a terrible cast “unable to act” and a terrible concept. The film darkens and changes situations more times than you can count. Each piece ultimately loses, and then links at the end of the film. I would never pay again to watch this movie. I would not even watch it on cable for free. This movie is a joke. Please don’t waste money on this movie!
