This is one of the best books of Crichton. The characters Karen Ross, Peter Elliot, Munro and Amy are well developed, and their interaction is fascinating, complex and dynamic throughout this impressive novel. <br /> <br /> And about 99.8 percent of them lost the film. Seriously, the script and the production were terrible and clearly made by people who could not understand what was good in the novel. I can't blame the actors, because, to be honest, they never had a chance to make this turkey fit the original work of Crichton. I know that good novels, especially those that have science fiction, are difficult to display on screen so that they match the original. But this may be the absolute worst quality mismatch between the new and the screen adaptation. The book is really very good. The film is just awful.
