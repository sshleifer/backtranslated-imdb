A terribly bad movie about an alleged dealer who wants to become a writer and the incidents that make up casino life. Moves at the pace of the snail. Boring, boring, boring! Virtually everything in this film is amateur and unconvincing - with one very notable exception: the performance of Clive Owen, like Rolls Royce, purring in slums. Tips on casino sequences were said to have been provided by a professional, but judging by the way they are treated, the director completely ignored them. Although casino employees may well be a different breed compared to the rest of the world, they are far from such reckless and foolish as the characters represented in this scenario. Chances and shortcomings have been added to the script to provide a convincing background, but it looks like it was recorded on a cocktail napkin list. For anyone who makes a living in the casino business (like this writer for the last forty years!), This is a poor image of their world, which even in the most remote and darkest parts of England never had such a desire! A terrible, insulting mess in a film that is stupid, stupid, and fooling around to an idiotic and unconvincing final. American critics liked it.
