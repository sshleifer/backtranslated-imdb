French movies sucks! Down with all these psychotric visions with their cultivated views “My God!” Mor in the vain, symbolic language of cinema and impenetrable slate! I will no longer be mad for this! Leos Carax, have you ever thought that the dialogue in the film could be natural and bright ??? Maybe I'm too ordinary to understand you? Or was your task to confirm all the French cliches? Guillaume, who must be a guillotine, comes to his house-palace, madam. Denyov, not in the picture, plays the flute: “Here I am, dear!” At that moment I knew that she was in the bathroom, and we would soon see how she lay there. Do not misunderstand me, I am not a hypocrite, but the culmination of the film is incest-sex. But this, in Berlin, we say “etepetete”, which means something like “être-peut-être”, snobbish, smug, and, worst of all, that I often see in French films! Another example: she, beautiful and ready, looks at herself in the mirror, combs her hair, and her wild bearded, dirty young guru bursts into the room, holding her breath: “There is no way out, no way out!” Forty years after the existentialist Sartres and spouses - what's new, what do you care about? My God, there is this woman, and she loves and admires you, what would be more natural to be happy in your life? And when not, please explain much better why !! Born in French means that you have to live in extravaganza, and not in flight, is this the point?
