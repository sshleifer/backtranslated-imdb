Once upon a time, Teresa Russell made several decent films, so I continue to hope that one of her efforts over the past ten or two years will receive at least 6 or 7 (out of 10). However, DARK WORLD - only the last of a series of disappointments. The first 90 minutes is very hard to watch. The lines are delivered by the leading actors as if they are being read at the first rehearsal or even at the casting (in which the actors do it for the sake of their agents, but in reality they don’t want those parts for which they are careless) reading). The sets and supports seem somehow “off” (which police department would allow the detective to have an entire wall in the living room filled with card holders?). The screen is constantly cluttered with meaningless time and date lines that appear for no rhyme or reason. Now, if the screenwriter stood here after the lights turned up after the film festival was shown, they would no doubt shout that all these flaws are REALLY clever tips to the plot, which turns into a coup in the last five minutes of this misfire. Well, for those viewers who only have other films - TV: movies and surfer, dude; they can be tricked to nod in agreement. But it's hard to believe that ANY who has seen 10 or more films in his life — and not a close friend or relative of the cast of the DARK WORLD or team member — could fall in love with such a lame rumor. Despite the fact that d.v.d. The box may make you believe that this film is about as similar to SUNSET BOULEVARD (the device of the dead storyteller) or Hitchcock (the device of the schizophrenic protagonist), because Jim Beam’s dried urine bottle should be drunk!
