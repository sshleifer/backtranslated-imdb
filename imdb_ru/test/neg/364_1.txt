First of all, let me begin by saying that I have been a devoted follower of the career of Thomas Howell since the Outsiders and the Hitcher. He was a rising star in the 1980s with hits like Soul Man. For this young actor, the future was bright, and he had the potential to go ahead and really express himself in Hollywood. Let's just say: Tom Cruise took part in the "Outsiders", and Howell was in the lead. Look at Cruise today !!! But the choice of material like this nonsense will only further cloud Howell’s career - if that is possible. Why does he choose such things? A small role in the main film would be more useful to him than this garbage. <br /> <br /> In fact, this story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where everyone lives underground, where chaos reigns. Howell - Shepherd, protecting a flock of various religious leaders, killing all unwanted. In other words, he is a hired killer. <br /> <br /> The sets are so bad that they don’t look out of place in the Thunderbird episode. The use of time-lapse without the need to repeat throughout the entire film, but well supported by a bad game (and a bad word is a good word), lack of continuity, scenes that are added for no reason, cars that look as if they were made out of a box of corn cereal and uncut style, bordering on stupidity. Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too. <br /> <br /> I hate to write bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad that I don’t believe for a second that anyone could be proud of it. I am not a director or a director, but I would have hidden my head in the sand if I had spent so much money and time on this film. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a monumental waste of time and energy, and I would not recommend anyone to NEVER see this film. He came out for free with the DVD player I bought, but I still turned it off halfway because I was embarrassed because of Howell. Come on, C - take credit for yourself and get rid of these unpopular miracles and try to knock yourself off and get a good role - even a small one. <br /> <br /> 1/10 - and only because there is no setting at 0/10.
