The ruins are for the Tourist, and Deep Impact is for Armageddon, the worst version of the frivolous film, with the exception of the much worse one. It is assumed that one of the heroes goes to medical school, so why are they all mentally retarded? "You can not continue to cut." The best line from this movie. This is a terrible movie. I like horror movies, but I fully understand that most of them are terrible, but had high hopes for this movie after watching the reviews on IMDb. The situation in which they find themselves is stupid, and how they deal with it makes them stupid. It's terrible, the only thing that makes it somewhat palatable is the cool Australian background, despite the fact that they spend the vast majority of films in one place.
