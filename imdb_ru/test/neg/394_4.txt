Indeed, the average is the only word that comes to my mind when you see it. <br /> <br /> The action was average (maybe a little above average), camera use was average (actually below average. The image was so shaky and the colors were grainy and blurred.) The plot was good, but moved at such a slow pace and was not used to good use. <br /> <br /> It could have been a lot more if it hadn’t been in the rhythm of a snail, and we saw more backgrounds of characters. <br /> <br /> All we see are Alice’s memories and how her home life is so “bad” (her mother is a working-class woman trying to make ends meet for her and her daughter.) remembering her when she was in high school, and her friend tells her: "Tell your mother to cook better food" and "everyone says it's your mother." Yes, it is embarrassing, but why should you run away from it. <br / > <br /> I could definitely see if her mother was drunk or someone insulted her, but everything was in order with her house, except that she was embarrassed. matured 9 years.) Months.) It really could have been much more. Perhaps Alice, offended by her drunk mom, could go to Florida with her friend, but then became a prostitute. Or something like this other, and not the real story This film (that is) Alice, a girl with family life, probably 90% of America’s population (WORKERS THIRD CLASS) runs off to Florida, but then gets distracted, turning into a prostitute. <br /> <br /> I don’t understand why he won an award in Sundance (it was probably against some very weak competition to win this award.) <br /> <br /> Also, Alice’s accent in Boston / New England seemed forced. It did not seem authentic. (I should know, I was born and raised in Boston, but now I live in Georgia.) <br /> <br /> 4/10 In my opinion, not worth your time.
