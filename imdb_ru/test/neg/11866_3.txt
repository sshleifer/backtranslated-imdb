Yes, this is your typical movie for direct action. And, of course, they are doing everything possible to change it a little, but they miraculously fail. Snipes demonstrates his impeccable performance, which he always does. Colloca proves that you do not need some talent to star in the film, but just sex appeal. The worst thing is that it did not cover my bad movie fundamentals, which are: 1 ?? Cheap looking villains. 2 ?? Perfectly calculated one-liners. 3 ?? Intense car chases with massive explosions. four ?? Hero connects with hot chick. five ?? Lots of naked or poorly dressed women for no reason. OK, so I lied, it covers those, but it does it terribly.
