It's hard to say how bad this movie is. Even in the 1950s, when the intellectual search for the meaning of life was fashionable, and the rejection of physical comfort, clean clothes, haircuts, etc. Was a common reaction to the self-righteous manners of the middle class in the United States and Western Europe, this film was smelly. The plot is a confusion of several dei ex machina (if this is the correct Latin grammar); the action consists of deadpan looks broken by random tantrums (the leadership of a man as well as a woman); unreasonable view of Catherine Deneuve’s breasts (or someone’s) worthy of the Budweiser advertisement; Repeated rehearsal of a cacaphonous orchestra in an abandoned building is, I am sure, a heavy sense in the director’s head, but for me it’s just another stupid character thrown into this meaningless movie - I scold because my time was wasted on watching this scam sorry for the feature film. The scenery is beautiful, and the sex scene is hot - but under this clothes this king has no meaning.
