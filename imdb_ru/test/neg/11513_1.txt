With actors like Depardieu and Richard, it's really hard to make a boring movie. But Weber is a master at a slow pace and creating supposedly funny scenes without any mind or depth. There are a lot of stories in this film, but few characters. You will never recognize any of the characters except the surface farce. Unfortunately, Weber has no idea what a farce is. His style can be described as hit and miss. Of course, some people laugh when they see someone slipping on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor on this lot. It's a shame how badly he uses good talent. Many good French comedians were wasted by mediocre directors.
