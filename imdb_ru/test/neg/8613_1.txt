Well, I watch tons of movies, and this one really sucks ... GREAT TIME. I’m sure that we are all tired of the low-budget trick of making vampire films using films like “The Martial Arts Teacher”, in which the role of an actor was played. I'm also so tired of a guy who knows some form of combat equipment, and then is able to get through a somewhat boring movie. I forced myself to watch it, and one of the main reasons was that the lead actress was pretty sweet (Haha). Well, I hope that this helped a little, and if you have time and you want to give your brain a rest, look at it !!! Well, I hope that one day this type of film will not be released, but then hey, where all low-budget actors will go :-) <br /> <br /> There are also many Bloops in the film, but I will leave you searching, because adds a little fun while watching, and also, if you're a bit of a perfectionist, it will bother you ;-) Hooray!
