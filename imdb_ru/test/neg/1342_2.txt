“The Women of Kyukor” by George Kyukor remain one of the brilliant gems of 1939, the most golden and golden years of Hollywood. The film crackled and flashed, and its absence of men was a subtle touch, barely noticed because of all the wonderful entertainment. <br /> <br /> Flash forward. We see Fifth Avenue in New York before Sachs. Large crowds scurry along the avenue ... but something is wrong. The picture reveals only well-dressed (attractive and young) women. Creepy than me, the legend, the visual concept continues inside the store, and then in a large fashion show. What fashion show in New York doesn't have at least 5 gays? The “no-man” rule tampers us in the throat, creating an alien world that is unbalanced and distracting. <br /> <br /> Enter Meg Ryan, whom you first saw in your garden, wearing a ridiculous outfit combined with her retro curls and waving her arms. I immediately sympathized with her husband and understood why he looked in another place. Later in the film, she turns into an older image of Jennifer Aniston and holds her hands at her sides. It seems deliberate, as if to say "Look! I can still be relevant! ”Ryan's character is loaded with a coven of unsatisfying friends (insert“ Sex and the city ”here), which, if it were real life, would despise each other. Annette Bening plays an influential bitch who, during the film, realizes that the dream of her life does not make her happy. Jada Pinkett Smith is an influential lesbian, everyone is diligent and useless for men who are not there. Debra Messing is a kind of children's factory that eats a lot. Eva Mendez is a strange choice for a bad girl, if not more. She looks fake, behaves falsely, and any humor she tries to demonstrate fails. Here someone commented that she looked like a transgender. Other various stars appear to rearrange the furniture on this Titanic. <br /> <br /> The only thing that would save this would be the brilliant casting of Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. They could call their price, firmly sticking their tongues in their cheeks and do something very clever and profitable. But no, Hollywood thinks of itself too high for such exploitation. Instead, they give us this thing, which clumsily clumsily with it. Entire sections of the dialogue from the original rise and fit into the scene with terrible results. At some point, Ryan exclaims something like: “This is not a 1930s film!” No, Meg, it is not.
