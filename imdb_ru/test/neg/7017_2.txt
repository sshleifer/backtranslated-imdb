I'm a big fan of "Aunty Mom" ​​with Rosalind Russell. She really was the perfect actress to play this character. <br /> <br /> I heard that Angela Lansbury was very good on stage in Mom, but it's hard to imagine anyone defeating Rosalind Russell. <br /> <br /> Lucy was such a wonderful comedian that her comic beats saved her performance in this film, where I think she was mistakenly accepted. Indeed, they should have called her singing voice - listening to these songs, performed at a faster pace, and with strong voices really changes the whole effect. <br /> <br /> I just saw a stage renaissance in Washington, DC, and I think Christina Baransky was very good, since Mom Harriet Harris, the nasty anti-chain agent on Fraser, played Vera, and she was especially good. > <br /> Both would be good actors for the television film of this show. Maybe if this production hits Broadway, they will think about shooting it. <br /> <br /> I also think that Tracy Ullman would be as good as Agnes.
