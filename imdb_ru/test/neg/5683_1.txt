I have never heard of "zero budget" author "Neil Johnson before I saw" Battlespace "on a DVD on a Hollywood video. After a few minutes of the film, I realize that this is not bad. Like many other science fiction films, this film is dominated by bad special effects and a constant parade of pretentious science fiction concepts that do not create a plot. <br /> <br /> Spectators are tormented by a textual introduction of a religious sound, then an oral introduction, followed by the narration of the protagonist’s daughter. To me, it looked like a smoke screen to disguise a film with militantly ugly visuals and a character’s zero accent. Some people here seem to be too ready to take this film seriously and swallow it in a seemingly new era of messages and sinker. These positive reviews must come from the same people who may be deluded by thinking that things like “The Land of Battle” were a brilliant film or that Shasta is as good as Coke. <br /> <br /> Those who were attracted by the creativity of raw covers can expect a lousy game (in small doses, at a distance of long quarters from people who do not speak), rotten computer animation effects (in very large doses) and annoying speakers computers What you don't get is excitement, emotional stimulation, unforgettable dialogue or a good story. <br /> <br /> “Battlespace” is an impenetrable bull, and a constant annoyance of the story proves it. True science fiction, hell, real filmmaking, about characters and their dialogues, not about special effects and boring predictions. It's right there with a similar straightforward science fiction video, like "Cl.One" and "Recon 2022". If you're looking for the boredom of “Strange Horizons” and “Alien Visitor”, by all means, watch this shit. If you love good storytelling and hate fake lens flare, you are better off with a real movie.
