This film was shot in my hometown, and I met many “actors” in small commercials. Most of them were students of the local karate school, and even during filming, we all knew what kind of filth it was. However, it was interesting to see how this is done. Most of the places where he was filmed no longer exist, such as a nightclub, a pizzeria, and so on. "The World Premiere" took place at the Akron's Civil Theater, and we all hysterically laughed at how silly it was. I personally think that this is the worst movie that has ever been made, but it brings me many pleasant memories. Watch this movie for a word of advice ... enjoy what it is ... a very low budget, a poorly done one, click on karate.
