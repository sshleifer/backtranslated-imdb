Monster will look very familiar to you. The same will happen with the rest of the film if you watched half a dozen of these films about teenagers trapped in the forest. So, this time they are not teenagers, but they can be the same. Three couples decide that it would be nice to check an almost abandoned ghost town in the hope of finding the gold that people killed over a scanty century and a half ago. One would think that with a name like “Miners' Massacre” some interesting things might happen. They are not. In fact, only about 1/10 of the film takes place in the mine. I assumed that the teams of frightened miners, running after their lives in the cavernous boundaries of their workplace, pray for the Black Lung Disease to get them before the Grim Reaper carried out his terrible revenge, but instead I got the earthly twenty with something then fornication people - and, in one case, defecating - in a forest gang of morons with a collective IQ, it will be difficult to pull the plastic ring out of the box of Cracker Jacks, much less buried treasure from an abandoned mine. No anxiety, no fears, and many embarrassing actions give this turkey 3 for nudity.
