The detonator is installed in Bucharest, where some former CIA government agent named Sonny Griffith (Wesley Snipes) tracked down an arms dealer named Dimitru (Matthew Leitch), although things are going badly, and Dimitru finds out that Sonny works for the US government. After the big firefight, most of the men of Dimitru were killed by Sonny, about whom the local Romanian police are unhappy, the supreme man Flint (Michael Brandon) decides to send Sonny back to the USA and at the same time protect a woman named Nadia. Kominski (Sylvia Kolloka), who is also sent back to the United States. However, it turns out that Nadia is wanted by Dimitru and his football club, boss boss Joseph (Tim Dutton), who needs her, to complete the gas bomb deal they are about to launch in Washington, killing millions of people ... <br /> <br /> This joint US-Romanian co-production was directed by Po-Chi Leong, and The Detonator confirms without the slightest doubt that Wesely Snipes has joined the club of fighter stars who are forced to make generics. In Eastern European countries, yep Snipes joined celebrities like Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Dolph Lundgren, Rutger Hauer and Chuck Norris. I pay tribute to Snipes, since he lasted a little longer than the others, with an excellent Blade: Trinity (2004), still fresh in the minds of many moviegoers (every movie he has done since then, got straight to DVD) but it should it had to happen sooner or later, as many of the titles I mentioned, Snipes lived thanks to the reputation of several great films, and if you look at his career, he starred in worse films than in good ones. Like the recent JCVD ​​and Seagal films, Detonator is pretty awful. Martin Wheeler’s scenario is as predictable, boring, and numerical as everything else. “Detonator” is the movie that you expect to see on an obscure cable television channel playing at 2 am. The detonator is full of clichés, Snipes is forced to protect a woman, and at first they don’t love each other, but by the end fall in love, his closest friend in the CIA turns out to be a traitor, and the nasty book boss that no one likes is actually a pretty decent guy, character Snipes is allowed to run around Bucharest, shooting, killing and blasting people, as it does not matter, and he is never arrested, the action is boring and forgotten, the bad guy owns a football club, so there is a lot of annoying football terminology and not even funny, single. <br /> <br /> Directed by Leong does nothing to revive up, the Detonator looks cheap with a car chase in which two cars never seem to exceed 30 mph. OK, the fighting scenes are relatively well organized, but they are few and completely forgotten in “the bad guy shooting Snipes and misses, instead of Snipes shoots the bad guy and kills him.” Half a decent car crash and explosion, but quite a bit. It seems that part of "Detonator" was shot in a Romanian football stadium, I think I would prefer to watch the game for 90 minutes, rather than this movie. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 15,000,000, “Detonator” is fairly well done, but not much is actually happening. Filmed and filmed in Bucharest in Romania. The game is not so good, Snipes is just not interested and feels that he is just for the money, in which I don’t blame him at all. <br /> <br /> “Detonator” - another poor man. The main role of the clichéd fighter is an actor and director in Eastern Europe. Why does Sony keep doing these things? Would not recommend, there is a much better fare fare action there.
