Root canal without anesthesia is more fun. This film is exciting and meaningless. There is absolutely nothing believable in any of these characters or storyline. What, in the name of God, did these people think when they agreed to star in this film? The acting in this film is incredibly bad - even from actors who are usually pretty darn good. "The In-Laws" is a funny movie. Birdcage is a fun movie. The Big Lebowski is a humorous film. This movie is just dumb. I can't even understand what a sick mind it takes to write the “novel” on which this film is based. I honestly can not think of a single pleasant word about this film. It just doesn't make any sense. People, please - I beg of you - do not watch this movie. You will regret it for the rest of your life. This film is not the worst ever made, but it is definitely on the top of the list.
