The author of the script of this film did not see the other three? I loved the original, I thought that 2 was the best, I suffered 3 (it was good, nothing special). But I hated it. Who dared kill UG? It was, of course, not the corner that was almost like Charlie's brother in number 2. Remember his speech? Charlie said: "You would not leave me on Earth, would you?" Ug replied: "Charlie, the bounty hunter", saying that now he is one of them. How dare the authors ignore this particular connection between them and turn him into a villain Charlie kills (in a particularly awkward scene) only because they understand that the film is getting boring. In fact, during the first 20 minutes we get a new cast and have to wait so long until we again find out what happened to Charlie, who was the hero we were waiting to see. I kept waiting, saying, “Come on, when will Charlie appear?” Angela Basset must be trying to deny that she has ever been to this Turkey. Transferring it to the future eliminates the possibility of seeing a sequel with the original composition or in our time. I think the writers decided that their film will be the last, and they can do whatever they want. This film does not correspond at all to the first two. And it doesn't even seem that it was written by the same people who did 3.3, at least they had humor and could easily be noticed by younger children. The fourth is simply ugly and vile (Eric Dahr) is especially cruel and unnecessary. I hated this movie. Hated, hated, hated it. I hated the fact that someone might like it, and I hated the fact that he ruined what was one of my favorite classics in the camp. I start it simply because IMDb.com will not allow me to give it a zero.
