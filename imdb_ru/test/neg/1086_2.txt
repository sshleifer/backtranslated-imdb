I am very surprised to see the good ratings of this film. <br /> <br /> I watched a movie 9 years ago, and I still remember how angry I was sitting in a cinema and watching this mess. I am a big fan of the works of John Boorman. I really like his films. So I went to "Beyond Rangoon" with high expectations. But I felt I was watching a stupid, cheap jungle film about Chuck Norris with all the scenes cut out. Even the soundtrack was very annoying. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that John Boorman was the director because this film was so poorly made. I think the Burmese people deserve the best films to illustrate their struggle.
