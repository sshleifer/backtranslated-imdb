If you like silly jokes and a horribly predictable storyline, then maybe this movie is for you. Courtney Thorne-Smith, Jack Warden, and several other cast members actually have a talent, but he was completely overwhelmed by the script on thin paper. This is generally a boring and joyless waste of film time.
