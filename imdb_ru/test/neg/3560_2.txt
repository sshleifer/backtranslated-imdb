I saw this film by virtue of the only positive review, and I can only imagine that this guy was sewing. <br /> <br /> Actually, the actress plays the main role, but the whole movie is so painful. bored i could barely come to terms with it. This is the definition of stupidity. <br /> <br /> So far, this film is rated at 8 out of 10 by 7 votes. This should mean that the director, the director's girlfriend, the producer, the actress and the drinking buddies gave their own film. 10. For everyone else who just wants to have fun or enjoy a good story, avoid it. <br /> <br /> This man on the street should give him 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> FDA note: while this film can be used as an assistant to get a good nightâ€™s sleep, no medicinal value is implied or not offered.
