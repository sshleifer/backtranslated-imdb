If you go to this film to learn something about depression, forget about it: you will not learn anything, except to not write a script on this topic. I understand that the goal was to show how severe depression can turn an ordinary person into a complete crash, but the result is the one-dimensional character I have ever seen in a Hollywood film ... a considerable feat. Christina Ricci in the role of Elizabeth conducts this entire film, screaming at the top of her lungs, viciously insulting someone, bursting in tears or in some combination of three (the only exception is a quiet sulk at the beginning and end). There is not the slightest hint of what she can be WITHOUT depression ... not the slightest glimpse of any other aspects of her personality ... she just screams. At some point, her roommate tells her: “Lizzy, you're such a funny person to be around when you don't have depression,” and my reaction was: “Is she?” It seemed strange that the authors included this comment, without giving us any examples, but this scenario is a lesson of incompetence. He has no noticeable structure or flow at all; instead, it consists of a series of awkwardly woven scenes with Lizzie’s screams, and then ends. Character development? No ... Scenes of her daily existence, so on. Going to classes, can it be important details? No ... Scream at maximum volume? CHECK. I'm afraid that's not enough. 1/10
