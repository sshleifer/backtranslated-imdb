What should I say? I only saw this film for curiosity, and it is really a shame ... I grew up in Brittany with stories of Celtic legends and spent 5 years in Rennes, the city in which, as they say, this film takes place ... Shame that not a single actor, Neither the camera from this film ever came to Rennes. They could, at least, choose a probable city or a probable forest, but nothing but BRETHANI or Rennes, not SAM ... And calling it a film about Celtic legends is really silly for the public. Besides these details, it could be a good movie, but this is crap. Stupid script, stupid characters and no originality. Definitely to avoid.
