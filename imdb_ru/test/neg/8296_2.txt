Uggh! Hanna-Barbera 60s and 70s! What lousy and invisible cartoons that were imposed on us by these hacks! This is truly a shame, since in the 1940s and 1950s, Hanna-Barbera meant quality - because they produced so many wonderful cartoons about Tom and Jerry. However, thanks to the major cost-cutting efforts in the late 1950s, cartoons in general began to look rather meager, and budgets were cut. In fact, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were fired by MGM and replaced by a team of Czech animators who never even saw the original cartoons! So, in the late 50s, the team was left without work and decided “if you cannot beat them, join them” - and began to create horrible little cartoons - with awful animation, backgrounds and writing. /> <br /> Unfortunately, the production of the lousy cartoons team worked too well - they made them the richest and most successful cartoons from the 60s and 70s. At this time, again and again bad production values ​​were their norm, and a long list of VERY forgettable cartoons was created. In this case, the surprisingly bad INCH HIGH PRIVATE EYE is a completely unfunny and silly idea. If you want to know what was going on, the title speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> Rotten to the depths of the soul and convincing evidence that the crew completely despises us children!
