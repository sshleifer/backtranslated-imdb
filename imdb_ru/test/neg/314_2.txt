Jack-O (1995) was a really bad film, weâ€™re talking about a snoozefest x 100, no entertainment value, no budget, no blood, Z-class actors, etc., etc., etc. This film was a terrible addition to the horror film industry and should not have been done !!! The only reason I bought this film was because I knew that Linny Quigley was in it, and, of course, she arranges her obligatory scene in the shower, which is very nice. <br /> <br /> But as for the film itself ... ...... I fell asleep at the 40-minute stage and had no desire to finish it at all, it's just cool, okay. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, I am an avid fan, a massive fan, I love low budget horrors, I love all this, but I hated this garbage, so I think he will tell you everything you need to know about "JACK-O". <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2/10, "2" for the 2-minute scene of Linnaeus soul, the movie itself is a complete ZERO !!!!
