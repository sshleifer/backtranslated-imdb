Technically disgusting (with audible “pops” between scenes) and amazingly amateur, “Flesh” requires a lot of patience to sit and probably turn off most viewers; but the dialogue sounds surprisingly plausible, and Joe Dullesandro, who exposes his body in almost every scene, also gives a completely convincing idea. It is curious that the curiosity, but the more polished “Garbage”, made two years later, is a definite step forward. I suggest you watch this instead. (* 1/2)
