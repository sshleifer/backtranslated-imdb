Although everyone works decently in this film, I agree with another comment: it is too loose and scattered, too much like an experiment without scripts with really talented actors. Thus, it is not enough to hold your attention. Having said that, there are a few really funny moments, one involving Dylan McDermott and a burning glass, which I think anyone who was so drunk would have found as funny as I was; the other is a split second with an inflatable dinosaur. Crispin Glover plays his usual crazy guy with a cheeky fist and does it well, Harry Dean Stanton makes his usual crazy patriarch (Repo Man, anyone?) Etc. Just a few gems, seconds.
