Sorry if I disappoint anyone with what I am going to say about this for a television movie. But I paid the money for the film, and it turned out that this film was a disaster. Directing is really terribly bad. But, looking at the information here, I realized that there could be reasons for the poor quality of direction and production. Maybe they don't have a budget, but in any case, Ang Lee had little money, but it turned out to be a hit. The director in this film did a very bad job telling the story, and the film itself was unable to maintain a rational sequence. It continues to pull me out of the scene. Maybe someone needs to work hard on the storyline / board. The sound sounded too bad. My God ... Usually, I would appreciate every movie, because behind it lies the ideas and fantasies of man. but this time I'm just angry: "I really want to hit something heavy." ... Just don't do the work if someone cannot do it at its best. Bad art (itâ€™s not even art, what is it?) It really hurts people.
