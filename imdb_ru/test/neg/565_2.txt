Devoted death and gloom Peter Watkins goes slums all over the pond to capture the American justice system around 1971 with this priceless piece of the spirit of the times that leans so far that it constantly falls. Watkins is a pure tourist, collecting this tragedy of our gang with clichés, hippies and black revolutionaries fighting happy police and military, as well as at the court of a kangaroo court, consisting of disapproving calcified adults who make bad fashion statements. Talk about revolution. <br /> <br /> In the Park of Punishments, we have a radical youth and corrupt system, since those who disagree, who are convicted of crimes, are given the choice of imprisonment or a three-day trip through the Park of Punishments (Death Valley) and freedom. Of course, law enforcement officers who are watching their journey are not going to play fair and, combined with the stifling heat, the fate of our main characters looks sealed. <br /> <br /> Kafka’s elements and plot are present in the punishment park. The tests are carried out under a large canvas tent, where shackled prisoners shout out insubordination to tough love or leave a group of inquisitors (such as members of the Quiet majority for peaceful America) who grumble in response. Neither group spends much time listening to each other, and litigation sometimes leads a struggle between parents for the keys to the appearance of the car. Basically, only one side says what is wrong with America, and the other says what is right when no one offers solutions for change. Meanwhile, the martyrs of the Park of Punishments stumble endlessly about the dessert, and the policemen with weapons act like twelve years old. This is similar to how some of my student lessons in the cinematography of the 70s, when we were younger and knew more than now. <br /> <br /> Peter Watkins has always been on the side of the disadvantaged and simple people against what he perceives as a corrupt power. Culledon was a strong indictment of an 18th century war crime in Scotland, which still resonates. The war game is a rough sobering look at the nuclear consequences that should be viewed by all. The park of punishments also has its value, but not as intended. Watkins' vision today is an example from a textbook on the left, in complete contrast to the paranoid culture of the 70s, and, given the times (Vietnam, Kent, Chicago 7), such bright hysteria seemed not so far from the truth. But 35 years later, the fever subsided, and the Punishment Park, with its impetuous narrow point of view, is a rather stupid trip.
