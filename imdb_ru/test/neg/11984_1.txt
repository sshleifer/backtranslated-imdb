Unfortunately, this film corresponds to approximately 1% of the advertising created in 2004, and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. For fans of video games, bookworms and movie lovers, there is nothing more disappointing than a movie based on an original concept (whether on paper or a game console) that does not deliver. And not only that, goes well under the brand. Far Cry, a video game released in 2004, created such a cult, after which making a movie from the content should have been easy, and many players would flock to watch the movie. If you are a gamer who played Far Cry; don't watch this movie. Anyone else who has not played the game; it will still look like a class B movie, played by a / class B movie. Uwe Boll, put your head down in shame ... it should have been easy to turn into a blockbuster. The plot of the game was incredible (it seems that the Jurassic Park meets the Alien), and yet you still managed to take it and turn it into your own horrible vacation of instant classics. Video game companies should be warned - if Uwe Boll knocks, lock the door. Oh, and Til Schweiger ... I look forward to meeting you in Inglorious Bastards. What were you thinking about taking it upon yourself? Sigh.
