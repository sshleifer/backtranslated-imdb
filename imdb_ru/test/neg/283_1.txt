Unfortunately, I think this is one of those films that if you or I took it to the studio and said: “Can I make this wonderful movie with my friends Mary, Mungo and Midge from school?” The studio would you on the place kicked out. However, if a group of massive Hollywood names says, “Listen, I like walking with friends in Italy, how about this?” The studio writes a check. <br /> <br /> We start with the casino boss from Ocean 11 tracking down the robbers who ran off with his money, and then Brad Pitt fucks Catherine Zeta-Jones, and then some monkeys around in Amsterdam and Italy, and the like, and then it somehow ends. <br /> <br /> The film, however, shows the most shameful moment in the career of Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis, which is cinematic. precious stone I almost vomited into my lap, and I tore out my eyes when Julia Roberts, who plays Tess in the film, pretends to be (you guessed it) Julia Roberts! Bruce Willis is clearly wondering when he will be able to leave and how much a check will cost. <br /> <br /> Well, honestly, I would do it for money, so I suppose I can. 'I really criticize the poor, but I'm sloppy, not a Hollywood legend. I think that really annoys me in this film is not that it is boring and meaningless and has a horrible story, but that I think the actors probably all had fun doing it! I think that all the work of an actor is to project emotions out ... I feel I paid to go to the party, but I had to stand outside in the rain. Booo! <br /> <br /> Watch this if you like Como, or you love CZJ or something else, but otherwise go for a walk.
