Just finished watching 2FTM. The trailers intrigued me so much that I actually went to watch it at the weekend, which I never do. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. The story has so much potential, and it's frustrating that it screwed up. I really feel that the issue with the film was directed by and Matthew McConaughey. First of all, I'm not a MM hater, I thought he was great in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star. I enjoyed his playing in those films without seeing him shirtless 3-4 times. Yes, we all understand that he is a cute guy with a good body, but I think that most people knew about it 10 years ago when he came on the stage at “A Time to Kill”. Showing him shirtless, pumping iron, like a sweaty madman 3-4 times in a film, is completely unnecessary. I think that once would be enough. It would not surprise me if they threw these unwanted scenes at such girlfriends and wives who would be willing to tag along with their significant friends, not a single woman wants to watch a movie about sports gambling, if ... this, let's enter his role. I feel that his game was very forced, and he seemed not very comfortable. I know that his character was supposed to be this charming southerner, but his features were banal and tender. As if he had referred several times to Days and Confusions! In short, I did not like his character, although I had to. Accent, his shirt, banal lines, weak sales. His character was too big a tool, like Brandon or Jonathan. Pacino and Assante were great, but this is not surprising. Piven is fun to watch as Arieh .... ooo, i mean jerry. I just feel that this film was very commercial and badly composed. It's a shame that they can take a great story and add crappy ingredients to try to succeed at the box office. 1. A funny story that a man likes 2. A naked Hollywood actor for women (make sure he has a lot of scenes with a weight-lifting shirt) 3. Al Pacino with 4 magnificent speech scenes and 25 magnificent liners 3. Every character must be dressed in costumes for a thousand dollars and have a very dark tan 4. Jeremy Piven will play the same character he played in Entourage and Old School 4. Throw in Armand Assante to make a deal 5. The plot, good writing, character development and intellectual castings are not needed <br /> <br /> This will be Enough for most people, but not for me! Anyone who disagrees with me, ask yourself. Will this film be much better if: A. Directed by Sodeberg B. De Caprio or Ed Norton as Brandon instead of MM <br /> <br /> I’ll probably be part of a minority, thinking this movie is crap. I realized this when a woman next to me started crying during a ridiculous final scene in which Pacino shed a fake tear hugging Rousseau. The financial success of this film will provide one. A film that goes public receives what the film wants, which is published on a large budget.
