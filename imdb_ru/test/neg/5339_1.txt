Recently, I watched a lot of Asian horror films, but this one should be the worst so far. It began quite interestingly, but lost momentum after the first 15 minutes of the film. Added drama scenes, sequences of memories, and serious holes in the plot left me alone. What really happened in the tunnel? Just "something awful" ??? Who started all the killings if it was not a ghost? What did she want to return to her ????? No answers at all! In general, this is not very scary, and filmmakers should come up with much better ideas than this ... <br /> <br /> One positive thing is a pretty actress, but that's all. <br /> <Not recommended.
