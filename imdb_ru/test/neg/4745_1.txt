This film and the first AvP film throughout the Aliens and Predators franchise. <br /> <br /> These are terrible movies, poorly made, poorly written and terribly made. They simply seem to someone a desperate attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original films about aliens and predators, but instead of creating well-designed and high-quality products, they came up with a predator. <br /> <br /> The original Aliens / Aliens / Predator / Predator 2 films were great, they redefined the horror / thriller genre, they invented these insane (and still believable) creatures that took on the role of a serial killer not human <br /> <br /> These films only milk the franchise and do nothing except to cloud its name. <br /> <br /> Aliens vs. Predator comics were great and had a wonderful story. They were faithful to the myths of Alien / Predator, did not accumulate in the original stories, etc. Why did they not turn the comic into a great movie? Because Hollywood is an idiot, that's why.
