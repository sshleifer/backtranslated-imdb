This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen! The plot revolves around a man named Luther, who wears metal dentures, bites people by the neck and walks, flicking like a chicken, without waving his arms. He also thinks he is a chicken. <br /> <br /> Sounds strange, right? Well, for me, the stranger and stranger the better. The more blood, the better and so on. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the board of directors deciding whether they want to release this maniac from their institution. They mention that he created several dentures in prison, which he bit people in the neck. He also cracks like a chicken and THINKS he is a chicken. <br /> <br /> If I had such a patient, I would never let him go. <br /> <br /> First, Luther heads to the supermarket and attacks the old woman on the bench and leaves. Then he sneaks into the back seat of a woman’s car, and she drives all the way home. <br /> <br /> While at home, Luther ties the woman to the bed. When a woman’s daughter and her daughter’s boyfriend return home, Luther hides. <br /> <br /> A policeman comes to the front door later in the film and asks about the mother. You can clearly see that the daughter is scared and she is crying, but the officer keeps asking if everything is alright. She replies that everything is in order. The officer finally gets in the car and leaves. If I saw a woman who constantly cried and looked frightened, I would like to at least enter the house to investigate a little. <br /> <br /> The ending is also stupid. While the woman is in the barn, she begins to pop and excites Luther, so he starts walking, clapping and snapping like a maniac. In the end, she shoots him and just sits there for a minute before finally finally clicking. <br /> <br /> Loans then roll. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most stupid movies I've ever seen! Nothing happens in a woman's house! NOTHING! <br /> <br /> I sometimes like traveling films, but this one really bored me. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Good idea, bad leadership!
