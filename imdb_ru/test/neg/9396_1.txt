This film was supposedly based on scientific literature. I'm not sure which book the script writers have read to write their adaptation, but this has absolutely nothing to do with the true life adventures of Francis Mace in Italy. On the contrary, it is an uninteresting story, which at every stage requires freedom to beat people. Check out the following examples: <br /> <br /> ************************************ * ******************************* <br /> <br /> SPOILER DESCRIPTION <br /> <br /> * ************************************************* * ***************** <br /> <br /> Strike number one: Lane's husband cheats on her, and her marriage ends in divorce. <br /> <br /> Beat number two: Lane goes to a local Italian city and is immediately invited by every man on the street. <br /> <br /> Strike number three: Lane is rescued by charming gentlemen from excited city dwellers. She falls in love with him after completing the day of lovemaking. Later, she learns that he is already attached and cheating on her. <br /> <br /> Bash Number Four: To do this, you need to expand your horizons, because the link is definitely in the film. Her lesbian friends decided to have a baby by fertilizing invetro (sp?). I am told that in most lesbian relationships, one person plays the female role, and the other - the male. In the film, after the female became pregnant, the “lesbian” decides to improve the relationship because she cannot cope with it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film has nothing to do with the book on which it was supposedly based.
