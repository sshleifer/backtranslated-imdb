The show is at least partially fake (so it's not a reality, just pretending to be reality), which makes me believe that at least any person without a blurry face is a fake episode. <br /> <br /> Evidence in the episode where he pretends to have been stabbed to death. There is already a film crew on the boat, and before he gets there, you can see his boat approaching. <br /> <br /> Actors playing the role of “ambulance officers” did not take off his shirt and didn’t expose in any case to work on it, which would never happen. <br /> <br /> They also parked the ambulance in the parking lot and did not drive up to the emergency entrance (which makes no sense if it is not fake and they will not be allowed there)
