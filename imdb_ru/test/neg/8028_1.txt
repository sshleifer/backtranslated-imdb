<br /> <br /> I made this film on June 20, 2001 and watched it for about 45 minutes. I came to the conclusion that watching a blank screen would be amazing by comparison. In the cast, there was not a single person for whom I would shed a tear if hell had opened up and swallowed up a whole bunch of them. <br /> <br /> So, I emailed all my friends and relatives to warn them, and I take the time to convince everyone who can see this note to avoid this film like the plague! At one time I saw some really bad movies, but NEVER was so bad.
