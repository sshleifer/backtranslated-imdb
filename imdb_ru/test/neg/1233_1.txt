I just watched Lone Pigeon, Return to Lonely Pigeon, Laredo Streets, and Dead Manâ€™s Walk. All perfectly. This pathetic piece of junk is made cheaply and does not work well. <br /> <br /> In the previous series, Captain Cal and Gus McCray act as respectable, respectable cowboys. Despite the fact that in the Caption Call every actor plays every time, everyone quickly conquers me. In Dead Man's Walk, boys are believable as young versions of experienced Texas Rangers. In Comanche Moon, they are just a couple of plump cattle. I had to stop looking. <br /> <br /> I suspect that many of the glowing reviews of this show were written by the people who created this stinking pile. This is the sad end to a great franchise.
