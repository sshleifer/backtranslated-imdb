Well, Ann is too old. Wentworth looks younger than her, and he should not. Louise is too young and cheerful. Oh, sister Mary is too sweet. She should be average, not beautiful. When this actress complains like Mary should think only that she is too beautiful to be a complainant. Lady Russell is too old. This is madness. If you are reading a novel, she is Anna's more mature friend, maybe as old as Anna's mother, who would be about 18–20 years older than Anna, so she’s about 50 NO 70! This is crazy, not suitable. Why is Anna so damn happy in the beginning? She smiles when she says, “Oh, the worst is over, I saw him, now the worst has passed,” yes, that's right. Well, if anyone saw the 1995 version of the Roger Michell, you can't compare these two. It is right. It is far. Read the novel, and you will understand what I mean.
