Jason Connery is not an actor; he is the son of an actor. His Macbeth is the worst I've ever seen. Oh yes, he kills King Duncan, but he also kills William Shakespeare. His wife is worse. Please give me the DVD version of Polanski so that I can forget this monster. John Finch, Orson Welles, Lawrence Olivier, you have actors!
