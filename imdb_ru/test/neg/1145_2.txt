I’m a fan of several vacation films, but when a film franchise shifts from a large screen to a TV screen, you know that it’s not in the spirit. Television-produced National Lampoon films do not succeed on television. This film is another reason. <br /> <br /> I think many of us were excited when it came out, but we also had to look into reality ... this is a television movie. Randy Quaid as Eddie's cousin, but better in the supporting role than in the lead role. Dana Barron sets the story as the first actor to re-play his role as one of the children of Griswold. She is just as beautiful, but it does not help the subtle scenario. <br /> <br /> Why was this film shot? This is probably because NBC recently picked up a few more years to represent the Christmas holidays. There is nothing wrong with action. It's all in the script. It's just not that funny. People need to think before writing things like this. This is one Christmas movie that I do not recommend.
