Why the instant noodles were not instant, it was a puzzling problem that I put on my knees on a one-legged angry Sherpa; he angrily objected that the noodles were not his bag, and I replied, “What bag?” He looked even more puzzled. <br /> <br /> Some of you will wonder why the sherpas have only one lower appendage. <br /> <br /> Sherpa, whom we will call Sherpa 5, to protect the cause data, which has damaged the toe. "How!?!" I hear you asking, I will continue, as we learned from the review of Donkey Punch (2002), Irene with the help of cunning pushes, dirty winks, etc. I tried unsuccessfully to teach all the checkers to the evil features of checkers. Sherpa 5, which is known only for its cruel tirades against democratic principles during the post-revolutionary years of the United States of America, and this has a consistent influence on the thinking of its population in the post-modern empire, which now exists through invasions of countries less than he, carried away by because of his misunderstanding of drafts. According to an eyewitness, he jumped like a useless banjo string into Mardi Gras, holding a stick with a nail, after a struggle in which 5 llamas followed, each of them did not have a left testicle, it was found that 3 Sherpas fall under the gooseberries in the bush and Sherpas 5 was a big nail in the big toe. <br /> <br /> Sherpa lifestyle is as modest as that of nuns, only in elementary medical institutions at an altitude of 15,000 feet above sea level. Accordingly, when the first aid hut was opened, only a single receipt for a spam bank was discovered, and some sleeveless jackets were found. Sherpa 5 jumped around in agony, like darkness on a loop, until Irene broke free, like a member from a chicken coop, and offered to wet her discomfort in the lama of a llama. Sherpa 5 agreed to a procedure to calm him down, a bottle of 100-year-old Glenfidich was made, some say that it was left by an evil Scot, who is considered the ancestor of evil Sherpas. One under the influence, toe bathed to the crest, dressed in a slightly polluted Irene diaphragm and a little blue nail. Some of you may think that this procedure will not benefit the Sherpas, and you will be fully justified in keeping this point of view. Only four days later, it was established by gangrene, and after a week the leg was removed with the help of even more dense rubber bands.
