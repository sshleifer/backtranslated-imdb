I just saw this at a local independent station in the New York area. The cast showed a promise, but when I saw the director George Cosmotos, I became suspicious. And, of course, it was as bad, just as senseless and stupid, like every George Kosmotos film I've ever seen. He looks like a stupid man, Michael Bay, with all the horror that welcomes promises. <br /> <br /> There is no point in conspiracy, in the immediate problems that motivate the conspirators. We are left to ourselves to connect the dots from one graffiti on different walls in the film to the next. Thus, the current budget crisis, the war in Iraq, Islamic extremism, the fate of social security, 47 million Americans without health care, wage stagnation and the death of the middle class - all this is associated with a clear graffiti terror. /> <br /> A truly amazingly stupid movie.
