In fact, everyone who is responsible for this thing should be whipped, pulled out and hung! IF this is what Eugene O'Neill's great drama looks like, I never want to be a victim to watch her again and again. There are so many things WRONG with this feature, where to start? First, Elmer Bernstein’s pompous score is present throughout the entire film, even in quiet scenes where background music takes away from the character’s motivation. Secondly, these characters are NOT pleasant people, and although some reviewers may like the fact that I personally do not like all the scenes in which Ive ate the scenery, but that is how his characters were written: do not like. W / loren is it just never clear, is she good or bad ?? and all her chatter about how she is going to change things back to what they were before the baby appeared ?? ok i saw that was clear. Perkins was wrong, and then he plays the role of warming up Norman Bates (whom he played two years later), even wanting to blame for the murder at the end. Hokey! Thirdly, this film is a studio production of a sound scene, and it suffers because of it. The story would benefit from on-the-spot shooting to develop a sense of “place” regarding the farm (for which all the main leaders are fighting). Because it is filmed, the property has no sense of value, because the film has a studio sense of a scene for which it is not convincing. This is really a horrible movie.
