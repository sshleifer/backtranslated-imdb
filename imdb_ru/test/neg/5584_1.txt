The positive reviews on this page are laid out by the filmmakers and their friends. This film is amateur from the point of view of directing, acting, in fact, in all aspects. If IMDb allows filmmakers to dictate what is written about their films, then this is a very sad thing. This film has a market premise, but it is made absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> The film is subjective, so everyone has their own opinion. But this film is on par with the work of Ed Wood, but without any charm. To think otherwise is a bad taste of the highest order. <br /> <br /> This is not a private matter. I do not know anyone associated with the film. I'm just a movie buff who thinks that the reviews on this page are completely inaccurate, and so I felt the need to correct the balance and give a more accurate overview of the film. This is very poorly done, and the direction below is even shooting a movie by numbers. Acting is the worst movie ever made. The best thing about this movie is the poster and the cover of the DVD. In addition, it is not worth the time.
