Godwin-Austen Mountain (also known as K2) is the second largest mountain in the world, and if you believe the evidence presented in this film, this is the most difficult mountain to which you can successfully climb without killing yourself. “K2” is, in essence, a film about friendship, which takes place in the excitingly dangerous world of mountaineering. While street photography takes really amazing landscapes, the characters facing all these magnificent landscapes are a terrible bore - and this is the fault of the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Self-confident lawyer Taylor Brooks Bean) and his quiet married friend Harold Jameson (Matt Craven) spend their free time climbing. During one of their trips, they meet with another group of mountaineers, funded by the rich mountain enthusiast Philip Claiborne (Raymond J. Barry). Claybourne's team is preparing for the upcoming shot at the infamous K2, a mountain that Taylor and Harold both wanted to fight, but could never afford it. However, during training, two of the Claybourne team died in an avalanche. Taylor and Harold have put forward themselves as potential replacements. Despite initial reluctance, Clayburn nods approvingly to them, and the couple discovers joining his team in the Himalayas. Harold's wife, Cindy (Julia Nixon-Soul), is concerned that her husband is about to make such a dangerous rise, especially since he recently became a father. The tension in the climbing team is growing, as Taylor is constantly confronted with another member of the group, the same brash and arrogant Dallas Wolfe (Luka Berkovichi). Meanwhile, Claburn himself is becoming more and more sick, because altitude sickness is damaging his body. Will the guys get to the peak of K2, or is their quest destined to end in disappointment or even death? <br /> <br /> “K2” spends an excessively long time introducing its several unpleasant characters. Especially hard to like Bien as an arrogant, persistent, adventurous type, as well as Barry as a die-hard millionaire climber. But on the other side of the coin, Craven is so boring that it becomes hard to believe that his wife may not care that he is going to climb K2 - hell, it will be better for him if he never returns !! The main character is completed by the main character, Berkovichi, whose characterization as Dallas Wolfe is just as agile and excessive as any other role he has ever played. The story itself is completely manual and disposable ?? just straight yarn about guys trying to reach the top of the mountain. There is a bit of a masculine connection, but the whole story about Harold and his wife is zero, and personal clashes between Taylor and Dallas sound completely false. "K2" values ​​its few virtues exclusively from Gabriel Berastein's stunning cinema ?? during the Himalayan sequences, the scale and awe of the mountains are pretty well sealed. I fully agree with critic Kim Newman, who cheerfully stated in Empire magazine: “K2 climbing could not be harder on this testimony than sitting through it!” That's right, Kim, absolutely right!
