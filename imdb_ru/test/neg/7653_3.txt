Last night I watched this movie with a group of friends at a Halloween party. I must say that the sarcastic comments never ended, and I must say that they were well deserved. Although I felt the direction was good, the madness in their dialogue was just too much cheese. I think it took me about an hour before I even began to understand what the matter was that they were trying to go home. You understand pretty quickly that this whole family is rather strange and something is wrong with them, it's just too slow. This film could easily last about 45 minutes and be much better. The only thing that made it bearable were two bottles of wine that I drank during the click. Attract people who remove slasher, because at least I know what to expect from them. It was not my business, too much dark humor, and the subject material of cannibalism was a bit frank and rude. I have to say that Randy Quaid played the role as well as I could, and I will give him props for this, as I usually see him as a drunken thug or a beaten fighter pilot who loves to kill aliens. <Br /> <br /> In conclusion, I give this horror / comedy film very generous 3 out of 10.
