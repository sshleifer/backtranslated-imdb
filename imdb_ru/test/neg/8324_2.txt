(This review is based on the English version). <br /> <br /> The legendary unfinished epic of Orson Welles was simply unfinished. It should have been left as such, and not combined in this clumsy, boring selection of any material that was available. <br /> <br /> Although I am sure that this was done with the best of intentions, the filmmakers not only failed to pay tribute to Wells’s vision, they also managed to discredit it by imposing this version on viewers. <br /> <br /> The first thing that amazes the viewer is the amateur sound quality. Not only are the recently voiced voices rather poor performances, they are also contradictory - Wells' original recordings (using his own voice, as he often did) were stored in several scenes, and they do not coincide at all. There was not the slightest attempt at consistency. Add to this an extremely empty sound mix, which has only a minimum of sound effects and atmosphere - a long sequence during a huge festival (including running the bulls) sounds like it was recorded on a deserted suburban street, where about three people make the sound of a crowd should be in the thousands. <br /> <br /> However, the real problem lies in the inevitable fact that Don Quixote was incomplete, and this is obvious from viewing. The film consists of several scenes, connected together and stretched to a ridiculous length, just to make up the run. A case in point is the sequence in which Sancho seeks for Don Quixote in a city that goes on forever. It’s just Sancho approaching the people in the crowd, asking them the same questions over and over again - Wells could never use every single double, but what appears here is. It lasts more than twelve minutes, whereas in reality it most likely lasts about two minutes of the absolute maximum in the proper finished version of the film. <br /> <br /> Although the beginning of the film is relatively complete and fairly well done, the rest have massive holes that simply cannot be filled with the endless overlay of a Spanish village and even more pictures of Don Quixote and Sancho back and forth. There is also no end. No resolution, no conclusion, no zest, no point. <br /> <br /> Although there is material in private collections that was unavailable to the filmmakers, he could not explain what it would take to make this into a complete, well-coordinated work. Wells just didn’t finish the shooting, mainly because his main actor died before they could finish. <br /> <br /> However, leaving aside the fact that it was not completed, and never can be, one would think that it would be enough to see a collection of footage from this masterpiece that could be . Unfortunately, if you put it all so modestly, the person will have a very negative impression of the film as a whole. In particular, the fact that it was clearly amazing performance of Akim Tamirov, because Sancho is completely spoiled by a new voice and long, drawn-out scenes, which ultimately cause him simply irritation. <br /> <br /> Orson Welles' vision of this film was something much more ambitious and complex than a simple retelling of the story of Don Quixote, but this is what was undertaken here, and, as such, the point is lost. The only person who could collect all the material into something worthwhile would be Wells himself, and he did not. <br /> <br /> Videotape could be used much better in the documentary chronicle of the entire saga. Wells is trying to make a film. Wells himself even came up with the perfect headline for such a document: “When are you going to finish Don Quixote?”
