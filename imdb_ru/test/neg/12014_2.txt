The only good film “Problem Child” was the unification of Amy Yasbeck and the late John Ritter. In addition, the films are just as demonic as their hero. In this, essentially, unnecessary sequel, the newly separated Ben (Ritter) and his young adreser (Michael Oliver, who never needs screen time anymore) are moving to a new city filled with willing bachelors. In the end, Ben chooses Lavender (played by the most underrated original SNL-er Larayne Newman), whose trends Blanche Dubois does not suit Junior at all. To add to Junior's torture, it seems that this city already has a small fire starter in the form of a younger girl with Trixie, who, by coincidence, has a sweet single mother, played by Yasbek, the same actress who played the first terrible mother through Junior adoption. You can see where the plot goes from here. Finding my favorite scene is like pulling teeth, so I think I’ll go with the cherry bomb in the toilet gag that makes James Tolkan Return to the Future one of the many adult victims (this guy always plays for school authorities numbers). Jack Warden and Gilbert Gottfried are returning as parts from the first film, but unfortunately there is no appearance in Bow Tie, I mean Killer (Michael Richards), who made Problem Child even more fun. Seriously, I am sure that these films, regardless of whether their offensive parents saw them or not, have done wonders for the red-haired children of America. Let us also pay tribute to these proud American films for their amazing promotion of adoption. Oh, and jokes about a dog poop - there should be jokes about a dog poop ... Damn.
