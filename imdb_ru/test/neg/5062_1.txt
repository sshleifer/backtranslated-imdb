This is really a nasty show. In fact, this is an example of how low television has fallen since the "reality" has become stylish. Tanya is pretty, but very rough and with terrible taste. Does the house show a place for sex appeal? Apparently, some men like the show, because they find Tanya attractive. The other boss is not cute, but he is just as rough and he has terrible taste. Unfortunately, so many houses need to be shown while someone else lives in them. Most people who supposedly inspect these homes before making changes should move to completely new or completely empty homes so that they won't offend anyone. Most of them ... like the "team" ... you need to learn manners. I can imagine how horrible the British show is, because British reality shows tend to be even worse when it comes to manners and taste. <br /> <br /> What happened to the Arts and Entertainment channel? When it began (and for several years afterwards) it was filled with pleasures. Now this is one big trash can.
