*** Minor plot spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I must admit that Wayne Crawford had a weak spot. I know little about him, but he seems to have a lot of enthusiasm to compensate for his lack of talent. In his films, he usually performs multi-tasking — any 3 from the lead man, the director, the producer, and the screenwriter — solving the storylines from the basement. Despite this, the final product, as a rule, is a pleasure for those who are not discriminating. <br /> <br /> In The Evil Below, Crawford plays the role of a captain in decline, a bit like Bogart. in “To have and not to have” - the similarity between the films ends there. <br /> <br /> The story begins with an underwater scene in which two divers search for a sunken ship and then are attacked by an invisible creature - something like the beginning of Jaw 2. It turned out that this collapse of El Diablo, which occurred several centuries ago. The ship was staffed by heretical priests who fled from Spain, with a load of stolen church treasures. This allows you to enter various relationships with supernatural forces with the participation of Lucifer and Armageddon. The name of the film refers to this sunken devil ship, and not to any evil sea creature. <br /> <br /> Whatever disadvantages the film is (and there are a lot of them) it is interesting to watch and competently filmed. You can not help loving the movie, which in the last 5 minutes copies the famous scene on the beach into “From here to eternity” and the final line from “Casablanca”.
