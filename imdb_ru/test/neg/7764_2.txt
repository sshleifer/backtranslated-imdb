I know that this show gave a lot of liberation to women in the late 90s and early 2000s, but come on! You have a whiner, a noisy murder and an excessive analyzer. This show really made women look bad. I can't STOP Kerry analyzing every little thing on this show, and this is what really killed it for me. In addition, Charlotte's nagging about her nonexistent difficulties hurt my ears, and Mirandaâ€™s cynicism was a complete buzz. I mean, can't she just be happy? Samantha was the only one cool on the show and the only one worth seeing. There was also a good episode when Nathan Lane was on the show, but it was the only one worth seeing - the rest were much the same. Humor was more dry than a bucket of sand, and not a very interesting storyline. In general, not a very good show, and I'm glad it's over.
