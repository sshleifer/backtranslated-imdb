The third in the series finds that Paul Kersi (Bronson) appeals to the bandits in order to take revenge on the thugs who killed his old friend. I do not know why this film pushed me to this, but somehow it happened. I found myself cheering for Bronson to wipe the floor with these punks. Every time he blew away one of them, I felt good. This film does not take himself seriously, but what if it did? There is a good preparation for the final of the fireworks in which Bronson is furious. But as for acting and plot, this is not true. If I lived in the area, I would get out as fast as I could, but people seem to be asking for trouble. I know that there is a mentality that we need to save our streets, but there is a limit. I had to give him 4. Of course, there are good scenes to “blow them up,” but that's all. At the time, Bronson was 64 years old. I’m sure that if these thugs really wanted to, they could in their own way with Bronson. Bronson takes the place of Schwarzanegger or Stallone in this film. This movie gives you a sense of joy. An ordinary person can save the neighborhood, save the day. Summing up, we can say that this is far from the original “Deadly Desire”, but not bad if you are just looking for an hour and a half to shoot them.
