At first the premise stinks ... a little boy likes to dress in clothes for girls. It reminded me of Norman Bates in PSYCHO or Ed Wood in ED WOOD. The jokes are lame and old, you saw them in a dozen films of the 50s and 60s. The whole act is wasted. I bet people signed up just to be in the vehicle of Shirley MacLaine. Please, someone will tell Shirley that she shot her best comedy in the movie “Two Moms for Sister Sarah.” Look ... if there are no Andy Griffith repeats.
