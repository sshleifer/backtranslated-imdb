I really like Salman Kahn, so I was very disappointed when I saw this movie. It did not have much conspiracy, and what they had was not so attractive. Salman, however, looked good in the film, looked young and refreshed, but was worth the price of this DVD. The music was not bad, it was quite nice. Usually Indian films last at least two to three hours, but it was a very short film for an Indian film. American actress, who played in the film, from the TV series "Heroes" by Ali Larter. Her acting skills had many desires. However, she looked good in the Indian dresses she wore. The whole movie didnâ€™t have much of what was desired, and I hope that Salman will cope much better with his next film. Thank.
