I entered this film, hoping for a creative twist on the Second Coming. Boy, I've ever been wrong. BBC - stupid people who go to the movies, complete idiots - create tension, fools - create intensity. And this film is no exception to the rule of how much BBC sucks. <br /> <br /> Ugh, a hurried and time-consuming, time-consuming dialogue was just painful to put up with. The first 30 minutes felt like 2 hours. I continued to look at my watch, wondering when pointless monotonous nonsense would end. They have wasted a perfectly good actor in the title role, because the material is so lazy and carelessly written. Everything that happens just kills time. <br /> <br /> Out of 155 minutes only 15 minutes are interesting (controversial final). What a disgrace. Read the story summary more interesting than watching a movie. The sermon, “I am God,” endless blah blah blah blah, stupid, like boughs of miracles, boring wonders ... Wow. <br /> <br /> DON'T LOOK THIS COTTON
