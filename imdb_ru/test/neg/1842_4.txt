Worst Korean movie! The plot is ridiculously complex, incredible, and the film does not cause a single shock. It accumulates tension well enough, and then leaves you excited, without giving a shock or a nervous moment. Whenever a frightening moment comes, it does not bother you, as you are still trying to understand who is who and what is happening! Like this: a model company recruits 4 people for a model career. but the owners are not what they seem to be, they have models of all dolls, and a strange girl is visible, walking around the place, and the owners do not recognize the girl. It turns out that everything is there for a reason, and this is as much as I could understand. The end is a bunch of murders, and you don't know who the real doll is and who is dead! I do not recommend it to fans of Korean / Asian horror films.
