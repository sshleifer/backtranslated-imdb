The film begins with an interest in a teenage son of his age. Shy, apparently, Kleiberg's husband dies in a car accident when she prepares to go to Rome and sing like a diva. Matthew objects, but comes. He again contacts the young girl, but this time Matt takes cocaine. His excellent voice, sweet, impetuous mother is in the center of attention. She doesn't know how to handle Matt's addiction. The film is delayed in search of the plot. Clayberg plays the wrong role, and Bertolucci may have kept his head on the moon when he directed the picture. The moon has a great symbolism. <br /> <br /> Save your time. Perhaps I'm too generous with 4 *.
