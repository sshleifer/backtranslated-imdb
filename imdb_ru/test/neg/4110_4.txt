(Synopsis) In 2055, the rich can travel through time and hunt living dinosaurs at a huge price. Sonya Rand (Catherine McCormack) has developed a machine that can get people back in time. Charles Hutton (Ben Kingsley) took this technology and opened a business known as Time Safari. Anyone who has money can travel millions of years ago and shoot a dinosaur. Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) leads his team along with a big game hunter on a floating path to a place where they can kill a dinosaur. The protocol of the trip is that they must remain on the track and not disturb the ground or anything around them. Unfortunately for humanity, one hunter comes and kills a butterfly. This minor act has a major impact on the Earthâ€™s climate and creates new species of wildlife. The course of evolution in the form in which we know it, is now changing in time. Travis and Sonya try to stop the process of change before it becomes permanent, and the person will die out. <br /> <br /> (Comment) The film was a bit slow, and the concept of returning in time and changing things was a bit exaggerated. The death of a butterfly, causing huge changes in the atmosphere and evolution of the world, is ridiculous. They changed the skyline of Chicago to look modern, but the new cars of the future looked stupid. You can wait to see this fantasy on DVD.
