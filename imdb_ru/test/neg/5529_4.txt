Victor Jory never became the main star. He is more known for the later roles of the characters than for his earlier roles. But he was very handsome and a great actor. <br /> <br /> His love scenes with Loretta Young in this romantic adventure thriller are passionate. Their kisses look very real. And very modern. <br /> <br /> Vivien Osborne also stands out here. She plays a woman with a reputation. But the character has a good heart. <br /> <br /> The fingerprint that I saw was fuzzy. But what a joy that such rare films appear! And they are still intact in some watchable condition. This is nothing special. But if someone wants to watch movies of his era with the same intriguing titles, he will probably find some excellent movies.
