When I went to the rental store to watch a movie, I saw it and immediately thought it would be funny. The picture made him look like a classic comedy film with the participation of teenagers (for example, a trip), which I think would be worth seeing. When I turned on the movement, I was disappointed, because the jokes were terrible and cheesy. The only thing that the director would have thought was funny would be when someone slips onto a wet floor. This is not a joke and will not make people laugh. I actually thought that you could turn this film off halfway. I was annoyed by this film because it was just a waste of time and money renting it out. When creating this film, not enough attention was paid, and there was not enough time and work for it. I also found that acting was pretty bad. The only time I laughed was over extremely bad 'jokes' or actions that were really not funny !!! I rate this movie 1/10. I hope you found this comment helpful.
