... I usually hate puns, but this seems to be the only suitable summary for the Stockyard. I suspect I'm not the first. And I am sure that many, MANY comments concern the bullish idiocy with udders. It definitely bothered me right away. But in this film there is much more wrong than the fundamental lack of knowledge about how mammals work. <br /> <br /> Personally, if I were a parent, I would be annoyed by the violent turn at the end of a showdown with coyotes. (Although for me this, at least, brought a little action.) And from the usual point of view of writing the screen, you can expect the coyotes to play a more important role in the conflict (Gee, you have a widow cow .. Maybe her "husband" was killed by coyotes? No ... there is a more stupid explanation.) And what kind of farm is this? Otis vows to protect all animals from harm, but there seems to be no threat from humans. They refer to the fact that the farmer is a vegan, but why does he grow pigs? In all the children's animal stories - baby, Charlotte's web, you call it ... the reality of farm life, at least, is affected. Perhaps our friendly farmer manages a kind of rescue shelter (there is some mention of this, but this is never explained.) But all that the farmer gets in return is horse cruelty in a scene that should be funny, but left me seriously , is he going to be buried in a shallow grave behind the barn? And what the heck of a wild Mike deal? It was like a gimp scene in Pulp Fiction without a gag. <br /> <br /> Add a truly awful attempt at emotional scenes, an almost complete lack of laughter and THOSE POLY, and you get the worst children's movie I have seen in recent years. I usually write in IMDb only to highlight a film that is not so well known - so as not to give up the current box office hit number 2. But this film pissed me off. It took place in my local theater, a space that could be used to show something worthwhile. This summer there was a lot of good family entertainment - in fact, at least 2 more films were played in the same multiplex. But I’m not allowed to see something like Little Miss Sunshine, so Viacom can deceive families from an extra $ 30. At least I had a free pass. <br /> <br /> I know that when I was 35 years old and I had no children, this film was not intended for me. But there is simply no excuse for such a lazy, terrible children's film as Animal Farm at the age of Pixar. I was bored from the Ice Age films, but they certainly didn’t make me angry like Animal Farm. “Shark Tale” was a weak attempt at street moderns, but she had a lot of laughter. In this regard, you can turn on Nickelodeon at any time of the day and see something more interesting and clever, so they should be ashamed of their name on this garbage. <br /> <br /> I was giving him 2 out of 10, just because Pip's Mouse was at times amusing, and Maria Bamford had a few funny lines as the farmers' wife. Well, not the farmer's wife. Some other farmer. They really did not explain who she was. They did not explain much. Especially not because of Sam Elliot - the most outstanding "man" - there was a rocking of the udder. Terribly.
