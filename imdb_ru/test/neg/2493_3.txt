I watched it on TV a few years ago when I got sick (I don’t know, I tend to be more pleased with watching TV when I am sick; I suppose too much effort to use the remote control). <Br /> <br /> From what I can remember, every aspect of the film — actors, actors, writers, directors, etc. — is rash at best. I could have forgiven historical inaccuracies if this film had created a sense of what it was like to work on Trinity; but it is not. There were attempts to humanize scientists, but they were insufficient and never went beyond the caricature. <br /> <br /> I didn’t know much about the people involved in the Manhattan project at the time, but they were so cartoony about the images of the film that I became interested in learning about real personalities. And I did. So, I think this horrible movie has brought very little benefit. <br /> <br /> This is not a comprehensive review, but the FMLB does not deserve or require it. You might like it if you're a fan of bad movies.
