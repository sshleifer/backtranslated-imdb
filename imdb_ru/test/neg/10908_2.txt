Another first: this French film is my acquaintance with the world of Eric Rohmer. I may be in a hurry when I say that this is probably my last film about Romer, but I was immediately turned off by how Romer relies on monotonous philosophical conversations that never get to the point. There is a scene in the film where the characters discuss love, which I thought would never end. Honestly, no matter how hard I tried, I could not understand why Romer was so highly valued among moviegoers. He seemed to me one of those disgustingly arrogant people who are full of hot air. If this is a sample of what his films are about, I'm not interested. I don’t care about French cinema (usually thinking and speculative because of wine), so maybe I’m biased.
