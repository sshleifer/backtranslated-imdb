Personally, the book was very well written, amazing, exciting part, which was not brought to justice in the film. Watching the film at 12.01 in the morning to see that the main parts of the book were left out, upset me because it affected the “other” outcome of the film. In this film there was something that could be desired, but in general he lacked the plot. <br /> <br /> For those who did NOT read the book, I could see how this film would look attractive and entertain with its polemics and uncertainty. However, for the loyal reader who read it seven times, I did not see a close connection between these two concepts: the film and the novel. <br /> <br /> There are no main characters (for example, Maximilian Kohler) and a sudden turn in the plot with the survival of the last cardinal in preferences, the plot of the film was slightly scattered, which led to a different view of the story. Hassassin was also portrayed as an ordinary white man, compared to what he portrayed in the novel as a Muslim; his motives in the book are based primarily on his connections with the Illuminati, but in the film his motives are based on money and were more like work than a personal connection with the task.
