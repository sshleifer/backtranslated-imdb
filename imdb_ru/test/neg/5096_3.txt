With an interesting premise (in the conflicts between Europeans and indigenous peoples, sometimes the front lines were not so clear), it should have been a good movie. But this story is sabotaged by the director’s incredible passion for his own mind, combined with a very bad script. <br /> <br /> Yes, the natural setting is beautiful, and yes, the film is authentic for the 19th-century historical setting, But the director continues to glitter the lily over and over, adding layer after layer of unsurpassed musical accompaniment, not to mention completely unnecessary dubbing, to the soundtrack, which ultimately suppresses the viewer and, drawing the attention of Themselves, subtract from the story. <br /> <br /> It was clear to me that the director with his microscopic close-ups and endless repetition of the musical motive “Danny Boy” (of all things!) tried to make a New Zealand version of the epic film about Sergio Leon, something like “Once in the West". But, given the seriousness of the story (most of Leone’s westerns were mocking), not to mention that it was not 1968 anymore, he manages to make a parody of one of them. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
