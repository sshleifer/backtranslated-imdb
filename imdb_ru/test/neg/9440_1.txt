... I can not believe that there are actually people who recommend this film ... This is such a slow POS, which is not going anywhere. Oh, yes, well, it goes somewhere, but you see that it comes from many miles. Acting: Really very bad, perhaps the bartender was kind of ok. Editing: bad! I suppose the editor was told “we need at least 90 minutes,” because half of all the scenes could have gone into the bin. Music: don't get me to this, the most disgusting account I've ever heard. Who sings this in the last scene for a loud cry ?? Direction: oh my God, IMNSHO, David Lynch sucks, but someone tries to copy it, sucks even more. Skip this.
