Eh, he's not really as good as other dragonballs. The villains are in fact robberies of other villains Z, such as Cell, Frieza and even Majin Buu. The child is a Frieze clone, the Super 17 is a Cell clone, and the Shadow Dragons are a clone of Buu. The story is also very bad, as it relates to the reduction of Goku. REDUCTION !! He deals with the fact that he shrank like an eight-year-old boy, just to get started. Let's not forget how weak characters become. Gohan can no longer become a mystic and even weaker than Pan (this is sad, I know). Speaking of Pan, she was so cute at the end of Z that now she lost all this attractiveness and became an irritable, tearful little girl whose only goal in this series is to get in the way. Goten doesn't even have a goal on the series and chests ... well, I don't know what to say about chests. GT is just an attempt to milk the popular Dragonball franchise. If you really like Dragonball, then avoid this series. It doesn't even look like a dragonball. I will be honest, though, since the ending was really good and rather sad (at least for me), and the ending songs and finals are better (Japanese, not American). Perhaps it would be better if Toriyama San worked on this.
