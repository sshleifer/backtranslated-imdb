My God, I suffered from having to watch this film FOUR times in my sister's house, and whether it was a horrible story about sex and weapons and a very cheap inexplicable acting game, if you are not told to watch it, avoid it, Ja Rule just proved that he can not act. Ving Rames also gave the most awful acting game in his films. No part of this movie made me laugh or make me jump or feel any emotions. I would be surprised that people really enjoyed it. I saw some horrible movies in my life. but it would be in my five worst films, ever, the music in it was not good, and the storyline, I think, was composed by a couple of guys who ordered pizza and just sat down, wrote ten bullet points and then turned it the film is absolutely terrible
