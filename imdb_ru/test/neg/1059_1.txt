Well, this film shows us that Mark Griffiths and producers think that we are all idiots. If not, then how should we understand this: <br /> <br /> American pilots take off on the MiG-29. Suddenly, all the planes turn into an F-16. Ha, the magic! After the action ... Migs land. Magic again! <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention that the F-16 had Israeli markings? <br /> <br /> Another magic: clearly unarmed L-39 simulators are bombing enemies. <br /> <br /> And the magic: although all the films are in Europe, we can see the desert in almost any flight. <br /> <br /> The director may have spent all his magic on all of the above, because the fighters are incredibly chaotic, and the explosions look awful, as if the pilots bombarded Molotov. <br /> <br /> OK, OK, this is a movie. I have to write about my story ... wait. Story? Yes, there is a story in this movie. And this is terrible.
