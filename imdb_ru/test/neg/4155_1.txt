If I guess your palabra, will you let me pass? - asks William Geld, Tim Robbins, who continues to behave as if told to him a fantastic joke, and he tries not to laugh. <br /> <br /> He is trying to get into the restricted area. The woman who stops him continues to chat: “Your palabra is Carrefour. <br /> <br /> - How did you find out? - asks the lady in surprise. He answers in the name of Wisdom: - I heard when you did not speak. : / <br /> <br /> Yes, that defines the film. This is exactly. It doesn't matter if Carrefour is a “road mix” in French, or whether the Future is coldly bureaucratic and mixes languages. Or, if Samantha Morton has nothing, nothing in Spanish (Maria Gonzalez is her name in the film) with her Irish, Scottish tone. <br /> <br /> This is boring and boring. If you fall, believing that there are a lot of characters, you will buy the strangest, disgusting love relationships that have ever existed and that can come in seven seconds. I can guess the palabra of this film: it will be “painful.”
