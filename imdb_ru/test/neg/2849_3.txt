Terrible. Absolutely awful. Long, confusing and not profitable. After about three hours of this agonizing mess, the ending really is the last nail in the coffin. Even the gorgeous, sexy, beautiful goddess Francesca Annis cannot save this poor adaptation of the work of Agatha Christie. The plot stretches and stretches, and time flows slowly, and suddenly you realize that you have no idea what is happening. In the end, even with the usual explanation of the villain, much more remained unexplainable, and then ?? its end. A complete waste of time and, without doubt, one of the worst devices to bear the name of Agatha Christie.
