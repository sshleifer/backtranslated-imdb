this show is just awful. I enjoyed watching Drake and Josh, it was great, and before this show, Amanda was fun too, but it's just HORRIBLE. In my opinion, looking at it was like watching these films from Zeltsberg, painful and ugly. these are about 3 stupid children who make a stupid web show (while Ithing is being stolen), while their retarded brother makes sculptures (he has no life). the cast is shit, Megan is from Drake, and Josh is Carly (ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh), the ugly batch is Sam, and some kid that they shot from the street plays Fred. all I saw from this (uggs) are random “jokes” in which there is a brother who makes a clay film, he also played an arcade game called “PAC-rat (genious)”, Sam and Carly in their web show - retarders, and Fred. Being a jerk is the only episode of the saw (I can not remember the name), where Fred was not lucky if he did not send an email. I find YouTube videos funnier than this trash. and damn it, they get YouTube YouTube, Fred, ask AVGN to cancel the show with their little mouth. just skip this show.
