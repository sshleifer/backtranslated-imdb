I watched this movie tonight, and I need to say it's awful! I expected it to be great because, you know, usually we don’t have so many Asian vampire films mixed with Asian culture; but at the beginning everything started badly: acquaintance with the film seemed to have no end! The plot is very weak, and if you remove the fights and soundtrack, you really will not have anything useful! The director of this film does not seem to have important ideas about how much time to spend, for example, on intro and flashbacks (not to mention some other things). <br /> <br /> For people like me who want to watch a great movie about vampires, I highly recommend watching “Lost Boys” or “Interview with a Vampire”.
