The first half of the film is not so bad. Although the characters do not have much depth, the story is quite funny and generally normal with the potential for improvement, and this is not so. <br /> <br /> In the second half, everything starts to change for the worse, not only for the characters of the film, but also for the viewer, who will basically wait for the story to come to its obvious end. <br /> <br /> In the previous user comments it was mentioned: “This is a love story, a road film, a thriller, a comedy with mistakes, a film of the 80s and, most importantly, a film by Jonathan Demme. "<br /> <br /> Well, please let me rephrase that:" This boy gets the girl's story, it happens that they drive cars, the thrill has disappeared, because it’s too clear how things will evolve, in this film there was not a single scene that could be loudly laughed at, she really has a small 80s feel and yes, Jonathan Demme really was the director.
