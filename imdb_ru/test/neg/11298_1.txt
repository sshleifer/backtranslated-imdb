Hannibal must have been the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Actually, I want my money back. What a waste of time. No plot, minimal character development, dubious motives, poor dialogue, not a standard game. What else can I say? If you have not seen, do not worry. I would not even rent a video, and if you accidentally see it on TV ... change the channel. The only reason someone might want to see this film is to see if unreasonable violence fits all deception (and, frankly, that is why they added it). If you want to see how some Google eats its own brain, then we will be transferred to this bit. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of this film? It was as if someone had just asked, “I wonder what Hannibal is doing these days,” and we just went for a walk. He is free at the beginning, and he is free at the end. Between them is a lot of self-indulgence on the part of Anthony Hopkins and directors. Julianne Moore valiantly tries to breathe life into her Clarice, but they gave her a non-standard script, and, as I understand it, she was determined to fail. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is just a very very bad story in every sense of the word. The only reason he made so much money is senseless violence, which they added, which ultimately makes you feel more contempt than horror that you should experience. <br /> <br /> I give it a big fat raspberry!
