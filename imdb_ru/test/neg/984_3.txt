I always think it would be nice if you could somehow preview some of the old films that were re-released on DVD before you buy them. So you could save time, money, and a certain degree of aggression when you feel completely disappointed. <br /> <br /> “The Buddy Holly Story” is such a film. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to go into the characteristics, or the holes in the plot, or the mess with the historical facts that cover this film, because I had already come to terms with them twenty years ago, when I first started watching it . <br /> <br /> I recorded it on an old (Monaural) Beta car back in the early 1980s, and I liked it so much that it became a favorite on a regular basis. The best part, in my opinion, was the performance of Gary Busey in the role of the young Buddy, as well as his almost perfect vocals and playing the guitar. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to the day when I would be able to play it ... STEREO ... and this is where disappointment comes. <br /> <br /> This DVD version is (presumably) remastered in both audio and video, according to the shell information, but I’m afraid this left me sadly disappointed and looked at my watch, wishing it was over. <br /> <br /> The sound is muddy, bordered by incomprehensible and so unprofessionally mixed that it made me crave the crystal clear vocals of my old beta tape! <br /> <br /> Despite what you think about the images, the plot or the characters, the real draw here is MUSIC ...... and if you can't hear the vocals, because they are drowned in cymbals, or auxiliary harmonies , or other associates, then not much is left, is it? <br /> <br /> I'm going to convert my old beta version into a (Mono) DVD for later viewing and share this, where it is, along with the garbage! <br /> <br /> “Extinction is a rule, survival is an exception ...”
