“Love and human remains” directed by Denis Arkan - terribly pathetic film, as it is completely different from those films that he shot throughout his career. Making another film is beyond doubt, which is disturbing, if the film from the master is completely upset, then this is a really bad event. The film begins with a good note, as some uncertainty is created. However, as the film progresses, what is shown is only a vain attempt to create something meaningful, as Arkand shows us half a dozen eccentrics, weird characters, whose lives are intertwined with each other. Homosexuality and lesbianism here have no consequences. What is even more disturbing is the feeling of guilt associated with the characters, who rather accurately relate to their feelings towards each other and sexuality. Such a film may be of interest to those who want to watch another film by Denis Arkan. all, of course, there would not be many takers for this film.
