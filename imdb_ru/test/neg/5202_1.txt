This is a terrible movie from almost any point of view. Since a lot has already been mentioned in previous reviews, let me focus only on the “Serb” and “Delta Force” guys in this film. <br /> <br /> 1) The uniform that Serbs wear is not Serbian. And helmets are also wrong. <br /> <br /> 2) The actors who play “Serbs” do not speak Serbian, even in a language close to Serbian, unlike “In the rear of the enemy”, where Czech actors acted. It is best to speak the language and add at least some credibility to the film. <br /> <br /> 3) The gray-bearded “Serbian general” looks and behaves like an idiot, firing a pistol whenever American soldiers call his name: <br /> <br /> - A US soldier: “Gravik! Give up! ”<br /> <br /> - Gray-bearded idiotic general: (shoots from his AK-47) <br /> <br /> - American soldier:“ Gravik! Get out! ”<br /> <br /> - GBMG: (shoots from his AK-47) <br /> <br /> - American soldier:“ Gravik! You're surrounded ”<br /> <br /> - GBMG: (shoots from his AK-47) <br /> <br /> Guy:“ Sorry, Mr. gray-bearded general, see, we have no forms, and I sent the boy to buy more, but he has not yet returned ... "<br /> <br /> - GBMG: (click) <br /> <br /> 4) Since when did the army issue the AK-47 Delta forces? I think they could not find enough M4 workers in Bulgaria, but there were a lot of old AK-47s and training blanks;) Maybe they should go to some airfields, they are cheaper and would not damage the credibility of the film anyway. .. <br /> <br /> 5) In a scene where a DF officer hangs on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist, he keeps his finger on the trigger all the time. No sane person with any weapons training or just common sense will ever do that. I believe that the actor realized that his level of steepness increases, the longer he holds a weapon in this way. <br /> <br /> This film is an insult to common sense ..
