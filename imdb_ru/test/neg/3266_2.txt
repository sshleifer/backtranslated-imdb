Caddyshack Two is a good movie in itself, but compared to the original, it does not add up. Robert Stack is a terrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while funny just can't compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is funny being the only character from the original. Most of the other characters in the film lack the original effect (for example, Henry Wilcoxon), with the exception of the hysterically funny lawyer Peter Blunt, played by Randy Quaid. Each line he says reminds me of the original humor, especially the scene in his office (I donâ€™t deal with lawsuits or petitions. I find out where you live, come to your home and knock your door off af ** * with a baseball bat , make a bonfire bonfire, maybe fry this golden retriever (arff arff arff) and eat it. Is there an understanding?). However, his small role is compensated by Dan Aroyd, who is clearly not a substitute for Bill Murray. His voice is beyond any irritation, and everything he does is not even funny, just silly. In general, Caddyshack II is a good film, but compared to the stunning original, it simply did not cope.
