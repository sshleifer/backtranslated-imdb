This movie upset me! When I think of a cat in a hat. I think about the cat in the cap of the book. You know, the one that a few years ago parents read to their children. Well, I think this movie will be very similar to this! But, to my great surprise, there was nothing like books! Insted is more like a young movie of humor for adults. In one part the cat speaks with a garden tool (hoe), the cat speaks to him as if it is his hoe (agin adult humor). I still had to call his car a little unpleasant for children's films. under the rating you will find: gentle humor and a few twins. In short, it means humor for adults. I would like to return this movie! Wal-Mart said they would not, because the film was opened. If you are thinking of buying this, I suggest renting before you buy.
