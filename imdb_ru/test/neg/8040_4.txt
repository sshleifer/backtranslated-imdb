First viewing 10/29/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Deer-John Stevenson): An easy entertaining story of a group of five children who are forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight and work in World War I as England entered the war. They are told not to go to the Uncle’s mansion’s greenhouse, which, of course, they do again and again, and they discover the sand fairy who they desire daily to last only until the sun goes down. This "IT", mentioned in the title, created by a group of Jim Henson and voiced by Eddie Izzard. The problem is that their desires usually cause other problems from which they must learn. This part of the film is not done very well, because it is obvious that children, first of all, Freddie Highmore's character, do not learn from them, but instead continue to return to “this” to solve their next big problem. "THIS" is not as funny as it could have happened to a comedian, Eddie Izzard, who was not given a special opportunity to improvise, and Kenneth Brande was wasted as an eccentric uncle, although he is the best character. Children are fine with their acting skills, but the story would probably be much better if they entered the fantasy world, but they also had a human story, which probably caused confusion among the filmmakers. So overall, it was a good movie, but it could have been a lot better.
