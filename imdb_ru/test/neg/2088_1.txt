This film is bad, yes, but if the producers used REAL KANGARU, he would have killed the actor with whom he boxed. I am an Australian, and I saw two males of Roo seven feet tall fighting each other, this is not a very pleasant sight, since the goal is for one or the other to kill their adversary (this is the way to protect the herd of females). ) and there are cases when someone put a kangaroo in a box, was injured or killed, so when you see a kangaroo on TV or in a movie, it is most likely to be a woman or an animation, as this is a good idea - not to hurt the actors (they may be irritated by the loss of the ability to breathe). There is a strange idea that Australian animals are cute and cuddly, which is false, many of them are dangerous (10 of the 12 most deadly snakes live here), and most of them are just ugly (koalas are soft, like stealing wool). So, if you come to Australia, BE CAREFUL !!!
