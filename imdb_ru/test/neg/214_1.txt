This film is sooooo bad that he forced me to create an account in IMDb only to warn others about it. <br /> <br /> I have been using IMDb for a long time, and many films approached me to register to praise or beat them, but no one has ever been so worthy. Still! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Matt Dillon. All I could ask myself in this film is “how did Dillon choose this script”? really. I mean, there are more holes in it than Vredefort. <br /> <br /> I mean, this is a modern robbed film, not one of the seventies. Even if the child cries out loud, he knows that armored trucks have GPS tracking and the like. makes you wonder what you need to create a script in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I could go on for ages, but I will not. believe me when I say it. save time and miss it. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Matt, I'm still a fan, but this movie sucks.
