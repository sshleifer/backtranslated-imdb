It is a fact that this is the first Saudi feature film to be shown in cinemas, but not in Saudi Arabia, for the simple reason that we do not have cinemas in our big kingdom ... not just one movie theater! The government banned the opening of cinemas after Islamic extremists OR religious police (or both) asked to close it in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Blaming the 7th art in the promotion of improper sexual relations and the like ... I do not see no good reason why we do not open cinemas !! ... we have a lot of video stores throughout the kingdom, we watch movies on TV from some satellite channels, we can set up Showtime channels, and in the end, movies in general seem harmless in many ways. I know how many people go to neighboring countries just to watch a couple of films. I personally went to Bahrain several times just to watch movies in cinemas, because watching it there is very fun, unlike watching a home movie. Saudi residents pay the most expensive movie ticket in the world, we go to watch movies, while in the rest of the world there are cinemas throughout the city. This is one of the problems that we have !! .. <br /> <br /> The film was made and presented by Rotana Filmed Entertainment, a large company owned by Saudi tycoon Prince Alvalid bin Talal (the eighth richest man in the world). <br /> <The name of the film means literally "how are you?" but it also means slang “what happened!”, sometimes used as slang to say “bad” about something, and sometimes it is used as slang to politely tell someone to go about their business and not interfere in other people's affairs . Anyway, I think they meant (like you) and (what happened!) At the same time, I could be wrong. <br /> <br /> Male actors from Saudi Arabia, such as Hisham Abdulrahman, who is very famous and has some popularity after winning the 1st prize in the Arab realtor show, more like “American Idol”, he works in some TV programs such as the Arabic version of Cash Taxi. Another famous actor is Khaled Sami, who has a funny and very good sense of humor ... other actors like Mishal al-Mutayri, Turki al-Yusuf and Ali Al Sabei are less well known and they are working on some TV shows. The female actresses are not from Saudi Arabia, and they did a very good job speaking Saudi accent. Jordanian actress Mais Hamdan in the lead role and actress of the nascent power of Fatima Al-Havsani ... it’s not that we don’t have Saudi actresses, but they are few and not so good. <br /> <br /> Saudi critic Rja Al-Mutairi, who writes for the newspaper Alriyadh (the most popular newspaper in the kingdom), wrote about this, saying: “You shouldn’t expect much from the first Saudi feature film. He was born in unusual circumstances, so we cannot judge this by ordinary standards, like any other film. It is a fact that the film achieved tremendous financial success in its first days of discovery only in the Kingdom of Bahrain. The film is fresh and about the Saudi family deals (interacts) with fresh controversial issues within Saudi society, such as: women driving a car, small thoughts about art, custody in a society from a certain group and the differences between being conservative and being extremist . Ideas are good, but you feel that you are lost in the middle of a movie. One of the advantages of the film is the excellent musical score of Raje Davud, which was good, but sometimes it does not correspond and does not express what is shown in the picture. Turki al-Yusuf did an excellent job ... his performance was the best along with Mais Hamdan ... the biggest loser was lead actor Hisham Abdulrahman, who came after support actors Mishal al-Mutayri, Ali Al Sabei and Khaled Sami, who did good job within their roles. <br /> <br /> In the end, "Keif al-Khal?" even with all its flaws, it's still a good film, and this is a very good 1st pitch of Rotana ... and the film has become a speech of people and streets, which is the golden goal to provoke strong debate in Saudi society about films in general until they realize the importance Seventh art and other arts. "<br /> <br /> PS: there is another Saudi director" Abdullah Almohizen "who claims that he shot the first Saudi film called" Shadows of Silence ". <br /> I have not seen the movie yet .. I hope I helped.
