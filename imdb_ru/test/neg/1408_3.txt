The combination of serious drama with adequate comedy is tiring at the best of times. IN SEARCH OF A COMEDY IN THE MUSLIM WORLD, everything turned out thanks to a pressing topic and a fantastic scenario; not to mention the superb image of Albert Brooks. But the MAN of the Year can not be compared. This is a dirty message made up of forced jokes and a perverted love story that is absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> The original premise initially seemed very promising. Advise the president of the United States, John Stuart, like a comedy, and see what happens. This independent runner is Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams, RV), a successful television personality who is pressured by his audience. His manager Jack (Christopher Walken, CLICK) and his writer Eddy (Lewis Black) come with him. It seems that Tom Dobbs has very little chance of a successful race, and he surprisingly wins the election. <br /> <br /> But is it? Eleonora Green (Laura Linney, Exorcist Emily Rose) is a computer company in a company that developed new e-voting software at polling stations. She discovers a glitch in the system that quickly disappears under the carpet of the company owner and his dark attorney Alan (Jeff Goldblum, DAY OF INDEPENDENCE). Ready to lose billions of dollars, if they find out about this, the evil people of the company decided to discredit and / or kill Eleanor so that she would never tell anyone. But Eleanor can get to the elected President Dobbs and finally shed the beans (this is where the flowering of an incredible love story begins). Dobbs goes on a Saturday night live and explains to the world, thus removing himself from the newly elected president and ending the career of those working in a computer company ... and saving the life of Miss Green. <br /> <br /> Does any of this sound funny? Comedy is wedged into history and often awkward. Robin Williams burns for several minutes during the debates, but quickly doused as heavy as he became president advancing on him. <br /> <br /> That particular interest is owned by presidential candidates. I am sure that there is an essential truth in this, and if you wanted to make a film about it, you could. If you wanted to make a comedy about yourself, you could. But Man of the Year is not like that.
