The start was decent; the finale was fine. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film suffers from the full and complete superficiality of the characters, unrealistic clashes / battle scenes, the absence of someone smart outside the shuttle. It makes for a terrible average script. <br /> <br /> Look for things: too obvious shadows, fast healing cuts, excessively smoky lights, funny seat belts, delayed reactions. <br /> <br /> I gave him 4, not 0 Because at the beginning of the film there were some nice elements of happiness and development of the main characters. The relationship between the main dark-haired girl and her bride is briefly affected, and the location of the blond friend's influence on this relationship is present, albeit awkwardly. Discovered at the end of the business is becoming more massive and decent, although, as noted by another commentator, this is not a surprise. <br /> <br /> ~ viper ~
