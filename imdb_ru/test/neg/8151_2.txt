They gave him two stars, because the DVD cover was good enough to make me buy this piece of horse manure. I paid a dollar for it on the local DVD market and I want my money back. I have a couple of good films (at least, I think they are good) that have never been seen inside the video store. Seeing this, I am really offended by this. Light years are the worst thing I've ever seen, I can't even recommend it as an obscene, playful movie. It's so bad, instead of making you laugh, it makes you angry. How did this horrible movie find any distribution? I can only believe that it was independently distributed, as a DVD amateur author would assume. In order for the producers of this “film” to go out of business, you obviously have no talent for it.
