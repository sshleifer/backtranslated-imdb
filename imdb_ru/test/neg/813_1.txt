I was given this film, and I must admit that I am glad that I did not pay for it. <br /> <br /> The back of the box makes it look like some kind of sexy triangle with a woman trying to seduce her. But the reality in this film is far from that. <br /> <br /> In fact, the main theme is the victim of cruel and sadistic rape by two other characters. In this there was absolutely nothing that would have seemed interesting to me. <br /> <br /> Even films like Silence Of The Lambs and Wild Things (with which the box is trying to compare this film) were exciting due to unexpected turns and suspense. <br /> <br /> But Jedd has nothing. It focuses on rape and a sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them. And a videotape that can prove that the story of the victims is true. <br /> <br /> Although this shows that same-sex rape is possible, the film is not worth watching. <br /> <br /> If at all possible, transfer this film at any cost.
