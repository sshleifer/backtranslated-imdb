Of all the adaptations of the books of Alistair Maclean, I feel that this qualifies as the worst, but do not blame Maclean! It would seem that everything that this film shares with the novel has the same name. We have no expectations, no foreboding of secrets, no chance of truly empathizing with the main characters. We spent the entire duration (or at least me), waiting for Charlotte Rampling to throw off her clothes (for Charlotte, this seems to take a surprisingly long amount of time!). However, looking at Charlotte Rampling’s boobs really cannot save this catastrophic film. Macklin was again thrown into the gutter to withstand the shelling of those bitter hackers and cavils who seem to blame him for all the troubles that occur when trying to shoot his books. Poor old Alistair must have climbed into a corner and whimpered when this one came out. At least “Bear Island”, which also uses the name of McLean, but apparently none of his novel, was a LITTLE exciting. The excitement here is in anticipation of the final loans.
