Just like the whole cast and crew, they know everything about shooting a movie. <br /> <br /> This film tells about the adventures and difficulties of the modern vampire cockney killer, as well as the age-old quarrel with her seemingly exhausted vampire. lover. This story itself smells of clichés and promises of boredom when there is such a small film like this one, and this is exactly what you get. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that in no way do I reject films, because these are films B, in fact, some of my favorite films are films B, such as "Jesus Christ: The Hunter on vampires, ”but this film does not reach the mile mark. <br /> <br /> Anyone who understands low-budget films will know that the game is rarely exciting and emotional, but Razor Blade Smile creates a completely new dimension, forcing it to play on the screen. Some of the so-called acting games are simply indescribably bad: the characters spew raw lines that fall, and the discourse expresses as many emotions and beliefs as the terminator after a pair of tranquilizers for horses. <br /> <br /> A huge part of the film is also occupied by vampire characters, in particular the main character, unnecessarily slapping their mouths, showing off their ridiculously large vampire teeth and breathing out very loudly. It literally has to happen in almost every scene at least once, and quickly became annoying and meaningless, as if these many glances of weak jaws, supposedly scary vampire faces, were used to simply fill in a bit of time and sketch the rest of this sandwich with poop movie. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what some other reviewers believe, I feel that this film (in particular, the director) is really trying to take this film seriously in many parts. It seems to me that a huge amount of overly dramatic action films and extreme close-ups indicate that the director really wanted people to feel this film and make it legitimate in its genre, rather than deceive it, and it fails. Attempts to presumably tasteful sex scenes turn out to be comical and stupid, and the sequences of actions are sometimes just stupid. <br /> <br /> The ending of this film was one of the weakest and most pitiful conclusions I have ever seen a film, film B or not. When such films force you to sit for hours, and then they are rewarded with “Oh, it was a game,” and this is actually disgusting. This conclusion of the “plot” is reminiscent of the late thoughts of the director, which he found out on the last day of filming, because they reached the end of their meager budget. <br /> <br /> But I did not rate this film as one star, despite the all-consuming crap, and this is because of the only advantage that I can really give this film. Intentionally or not, it was funny. I’m pretty sure that the pieces that I thought were humorous weren’t intended, and I found that most of the efforts to create real jokes are useless, but when watching with friends, this is a good movie to get Mickey out.
