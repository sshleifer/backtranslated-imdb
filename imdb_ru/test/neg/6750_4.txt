It was clearly a low-budget film. This is visible in every scene. Nice to see where this was done. Most of the film was filmed in Columbia, California, in the Sierra Nevada, near Sonora, California. Part of the film was also filmed in Jamestown, California, near Columbia. Jamestown has a railroad museum, and they used some of the old trains in the photo. High Noon was also filmed in Jamestown, as was Back To The Future III.
