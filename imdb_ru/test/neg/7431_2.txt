Robert Downey Jr. in a 17th-century wig and dress was enough to make me shudder, but I could not believe that such a great actor like Sam Neal really took part in this film. It was all incredible. I especially like Merivel’s “medicine” for insane people. They dance ... and hey presto! everyone is happy and they are all better! I think I just didn’t really like Merivel’s character. Therefore, watching the whole film about his supposed transition from a shaman to a great doctor was exhausting. <br /> <br /> In addition, I’m not quite sure, but I didn’t think that the plague and the famous fire in London occurred at the same time.
