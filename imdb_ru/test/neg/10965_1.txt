Created by Nott Entertainment, this movie "nott" is very good. I spent the first 15 minutes of the film before judging that the acting was bad, the casting was bad, and the camera work was bad. Since I’ve heard that this movie is being downloaded online, it’s not even worth bandwidth. <br /> <br /> Up until the time when I wrote this review, the average vote for this film was 8.5, which pushed me to watch it, and on average it was 10%, for which liars and shills clearly voted . This movie is "Nott" for everyone. Or parents, if you want to punish your children with this horrible movie, ask them to watch this Halloween movie.
