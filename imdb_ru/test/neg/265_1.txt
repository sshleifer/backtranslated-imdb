Twelve Ocean: just stupid, bad and nothing compared to the other two. <br /> <br /> Artistic robbery. 10 famous actors, at least. A weak script and a very slowly developing idea. That is why I described the film, which saw only 20 minutes. Don't get me wrong, you might like it. But I like the films of “Ocean” just because of the topic of the robbery. If Ocean 12 is not about Heist, then what's the point of seeing this? I am glad that Soderberg saw his main mistake and bought himself out by making a film that was far superior to the first one. Glory for that. <br /> <br /> Steven Soderberg is not a very good director. In addition to his hit "Sex lies and videotapes" ... nothing more happened so great in the career of this director. Shame on him. But only his fault.
