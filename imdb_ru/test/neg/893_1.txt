I have never seen the first three, but I know that they are all better than this ... trash. This is about some kind of child who is having a party. Wow. It sounds awesome (sarcasm). It? Nooo! It begins with a child lying in bed and his mother woke him. So the child is pretending to be sick, so he does not need to go to school. He goes to his uncle's house, gathers people and throws a party. I did not laugh at all when I watched this garbage. I can not imagine anyone sitting and recording this dialogue, thinking: â€œDude, dis! Makes me wonder if they have a script for this movie. I watched it, knowing that it would be bad, but, as a rule, watching a bad movie makes me feel good, because it gives me the opportunity to make fun. This is just disgusting to me. INSIDE TWO LAMPS!
