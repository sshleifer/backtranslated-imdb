My friend loves sticky horror films, so I often see such budget things. This, however, is the first time that I was forced to write a review of one of them ... <br /> <br /> Simply put, this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen! Even worse than Boggy Creek II! <br /> <br /> The entire budget of the film seems to have been spent on a short stage in the middle when Dr. Klaus is standing in this chamber space and turns everyone into a vampire. <br /> The only good thing to say about this is that it was fun after a few beers (but for all the wrong reasons).
