This show sucks. on Fridays, he was set up on a roller coaster, and although he undoubtedly destroyed the main theme of Friday's programming, I will judge it rationally ... yet I think it sucks It's really super lame. Zoe and her stupid friends are weak characters, and the pot sucks and really limps. <br /> <br /> Lame continuity and bank sucks, and I believe that the dialogues and jokes are weak. Weak humor and slop slop characters suck, and the whole show frankly disappoints, you should not watch. It sucks and really, very lame. It really should be one of the most high-profile shows on television, really not worth watching. I mean, how weak and lame can a show be before it gets fired?
