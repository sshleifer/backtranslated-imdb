Well, I don't want to upset those who liked this movie, but it was a really bad movie. The way the scenes were edited and the acting made me cringe in some moments. I really tried to enjoy it, but it looked like a student film, they must have had the smallest budget. I really liked the storyline, and the characters were pretty, but the whole movie was just awful. In addition, why in almost every movie with lesbian characters one of them must either commit suicide, die or turn right?!?! This sends the wrong and unreal message. I gave him 3 stars and, considering everything, I think it was very nice of me. Watch this movie only if you want to laugh at how bad it is.
