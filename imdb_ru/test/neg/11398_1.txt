In fact, I still doubt if there is anything in this film that I like. As for the story: unrealistic and very exaggerated. The game was too bad in my opinion. It is unlikely that Anthony Kamerling will receive the status of Rutger Hauer. Some people expect it anyway. First, let him work on his English pronunciation. If you are watching these actors' “trip” to Paris (DVD-extra), you will most likely want to find out. Beau Dorens advice: stop your acting career, you will never get to this ... For 2 main actors: mature, please Being generous, I would give 4 out of 10. <br /> <br
