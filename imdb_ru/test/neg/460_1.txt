The stranger was superb. Many writers tried to copy it. They all did a bad job (or almost). But Dead Space is the worst alien replica. Bad actors, bad special effects, bad script and other bad things (it takes only 3 pages to tell everything that is bad in this film. The film was not very long, and this is a very good thing (only one). You can't laugh, because it's too serious ... it's bad, because in almost every science fiction B series movie, you can laugh all the time. Sometimes it can be amazing, but watch this nonsense instead, just watch Alien or Event Horizon ... it is much better !!! I give it 1 out of 5.
