The first film I saw from these people was Grave's Children, and when I heard that this film was coming, I thought it would be good to watch mainly because Waverly is a real place that is rumored to be . This documentary / movie was terrible! There were too many fake comments from producers, directors, cameramen ... they had to hide their faces from this film. It was rumored that Waverly had been persecuted for a long time, but if someone who doubts it watches this film, they will undoubtedly start to believe that every story about the place is as false as this documentary. Paranormal evidence was terrible and almost did not exist. I heard the best EVP from high school students with tape recorders in the bathroom! They tried too hard for everything to become scary, and in the end there was nothing terrible. No stories, not blurry too dark to see anything videos, no pictures, no tape recordings! The “grave children” were also bad, but at least there was some substance and some creep in them. The only reason I put this 3 on is because the historical part of the show was very good and informative. Finding out how the hospital originated, what its daily life is like and how it ended is the only thing worth this two-day piece of shit.
