Set in the mid-1800s, when the British clean the desert of New Zealand to create colonies. The daughter of the surgeon of the British Army, Sarah (Samantha Morton) falls in love with the son of one of the Maori leaders. Maori is an indigenous tribe and a dangerous people for Europeans. By the time Sarah’s child is born, whom she calls "The Boy," his father had already died. At the age of six, “The Boy” is abducted by his father’s family, and Sarah begins her search with a man (Kiefer Sutherland), who is deeply in love with her. <br /> <br /> Twice Nominated for Oscar Morton is definitely the star of this film. Sutherland is a waste of time. Also starring: Cliff Curtis, Stephen Rea, Temuer Morrison and David Raviri Penet. This film is rated R for some sexual content and violence scenes. I find the name RIVER QUEEN very misleading, and the cover of the DVD with only Sutherland, forcing you to believe that he is the leading star, should be a crime.
