This film had such a good prerequisite for a start. Suspension, slasher, secret society, and you really couldn't understand who the bad guys were until the last quarter of the movie. <br /> <br /> But he had so many stupid cliches from the worst of the old American slasher / horror movies. Now I love slasher / horror movies, but there are all the old clichés that have long disappeared from American cinema. For example, the old "I hear noises in the basement, and I am alone at home, and the light in the basement does not work, so I will go to explore" the cliche. <br /> <br /> Three examples of these clichés just infuriated me endlessly: <br /> <br /> 1) When Pent finds out that a secret society working in the matter of living bodies can work in a medical school, telling ALL - very publicly. In fact, she says: “I recognized you. Come and kill me, because I am telling your secret to everyone. ” And then she wonders why she finds blood smeared all over her bed and brings her roommate's severed finger in a towel. <br /> <br /> 2) Even after one guy she met two weeks ago finds herself on the autopsy table and she finds out about this secret society, unraveling living people, she goes to the lab, where all the corpses stored 2-3 more times INDEPENDENTLY, NIGHT, to conduct an investigation. <br /> <br /> 3) Her neighbor is killed. She is being pursued by a murderer, whom she knows, does not report him to the university or the police, and then leaves home for school to visit her parents. Then she returns to school, obviously thinking that this guy who tried to kill her will let her past go and will not try to kill her, although she knows his secret. She, of course, was wrong. <br /> <br /> For a man who was supposed to be so smart (she studied for a doctor at the best school in Germany), she behaved like a bimbo cliche in a horror movie. <br /> <br /> All of this made a potentially good movie very disappointing and made me want the ending to come even earlier. Halfway through the movie, I stopped walking after her and wanted her to be on the opening table too.
