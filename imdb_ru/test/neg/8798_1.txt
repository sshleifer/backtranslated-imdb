Well, before I delve into this, let's continue and remove the warning: this film is the typical “cinematic” definition of SLEAZE! There are films that can definitely shock or disgust this film, which have WAY of greater artistic significance than can be said from this cartoon film. So what makes him so sloppy? Let's take a closer look at “Wet wilderness” ...... <br /> <br /> Created in 1974 almost for nothing, this “rough” does not have a real genuine “conspiracy”, about which one could say, except portraying what will happen if the FAMILY goes to the desert to relax and spend the day while she is attacked by a fat dude in a ski mask with a machete in search of blows ... that kind of thing that everyone is forced to have sex with each other, while systematically killed creep in mask. Therefore, those who are sensitive to topics related to incest are recommended to look elsewhere. Then, in order to really add a level of surrealism or simply to demonstrate complete incompetence in the art of filmmaking, the group’s “daughter” runs away, having to have sex with her brother, and finds a random black guy (!) Tied to a tree branch ("... this fat bitch left me here for 3 days ... ") with little or no reasons! Is he saved ..... or is he? Of course not!! They are caught before they can escape, where our killer also forces them to have sex, forcing the mother to join, ending with the dead black dude (courteously provided with an ax through the chest), when all is said and done. Then our killer makes her daughter and mother give him oral sex when one of the women grabs a machete ........ and the film suddenly ends !!! Just! No warnings, no tied ends ... it's just the end. MAYBE be the appropriate ending for this film (I honestly don’t know), but I only saw an extremely rough version of Alpha Blue Archives. In their version, the ending is either completely cut out, or the way it ends. If this was done intentionally, then in “Film Production 101” I am sure that there is some rule of thumb HOW to finish the film, but it should not be done like IT! Fans of the film "Psycho" should be happy to hear the soundtrack music, because it's all through the movie! I would be willing to bet no rights were licensed or anything. In addition, despite the fact that this is a “violent” film, there is not so much of it, so the potters will not find anything useful here. None of the violence is shown graphically ..... only the results (one of the victims is hit with a machete directly over the vaginal area). In addition, sex is one of the most disgusting sex I have ever seen! Interestingly, this movie is too ugly to work as effective erotic porn or to include everyone except those with a tendency to like sloppy, nasty and ugly things, but not enough violence to collect any real fame from those who are looking for for something really cruel, like "Cannibal Holocaust" or other similar films. Only the “notorious” thing about this steaming pile, that violence was added to the adult film, a rather new concept at that time, especially considering what porn chic was all the anger and grindhouses that filled 42nd Street played things like this to the most tormented group of porn maven. It was not and is not “mainstream” porn at all. <br /> <br /> If you were in a shooting school and there was a list of films making “Etiquette”, this film will be a prime example of this lesson! This cinematic litter demonstrates what happens when directors with brain problems are given a “budget” (in this case, probably about $ 142 ..... because it looks like this!), Ignoring all the “don't do” and turn them into “Do” "..... yes, this film is so bad !! One more thing: those who are offended by racial epithets are also advised to watch something else. The black man in the film constantly insults his color, and the killer is clearly a racist But in the early 70s there was no political correctness. I’m not sure that such a film could be Oh, to do today. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this is not “shocking" and will not overwhelm, except for those who are ugly. In fact, I was bored. Sex is so ugly and ordinary that it is difficult to watch with any sense of erotica, so if you risk it, you will thank God for the fast forward button! “The game”, if you want to call it that, is at best amateurish (I mean, this is even bad for Porno!) Without a single reason to take care of anyone or anything in it !! If you just have to see it anyway, then download it, since you really feel like a heel if you buy it. Some things are just useless ..... and "Wet Wildernes" is. The only thing more unpleasant than watching this movie would be to watch this movie while sitting in the theater and looking around at other people who also watch it and suddenly feel in danger. Probably not the largest collection of the society of thinkers and intellectuals. But if you are for some stupid but sloppy porn trash, give it a crack. It's 54 minutes and yet, it feels MUCH longer! Crackheads will love this! On the other hand, maybe something is wrong with me in the search for this in the first place ...... LOL! Be watchful, sloppy lovers !!
