The 1935 Enchanted April version is both tedious and casual. It is difficult to show the transforming magic of Italy, which only removes stereotypical Italian behavior in the studio. The transformation of four strangers who left London, is instantly in the section from the first day to a week later. Instead of evolving, the script clicks the switch, and the characters <br /> <br /> are different. <br /> <br /> Husbands are quite boring in memories, not returning, even if their presence does not set in motion four women return to their shells and / or fighting. <br /> <br /> Jesse Ralph gets the most pleasure (moving instead of chewing the scenery <br /> <br /> completely), and Catherine Alexander has some keen charm outside of her <br /> <br /> her husband's shadow (and away from his disgusting buzz). Anne Harding is not remarkable here <br /> <br /> (with the introduction of the production code). She had <br /> <br /> the corresponding line in the earlier (before coding) film “When Ladies Meet”: “You are not worth a single minute of one uneasy hour, which any of us has given you,” but in “Charmed April "can only look offended, jump out and declare loyalty to her lost husband.
