This film failed as a comedy and in general a film. It was a very slow movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message, but the message was a cliche, a hopeless mess to begin with. This film sets a shameless point of view on the environment, even setting a complacent goal to destroy the SUV and promote the Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> Sitting in this, I could not help but notice that Steve Carell no longer received than one really funny line. The only thing that could hypothetically mark it as a comedy is a pitiful attempt to give Vande Sykes comic lines of help. Her character gets frequent, unprofitable lines where they are absolutely not suitable. <br /> <br /> Away from the brilliance of Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty is balancing his entire record budget for story devices with special effects, barely advancing the plot. The film is the first half of the construction of Evan's ark, but by the end we learn that the ark was completely meaningless, and the whole plot was just a vessel for silly jokes and even more stupid messages. The film ends when we learn that the whole ark, the deluge and the gathering of animals were only a weak political statement from no one but God. Yes, God tried to influence politics.
