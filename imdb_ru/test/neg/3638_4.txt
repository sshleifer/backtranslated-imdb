I have seen this program several times, and the more I see it, the less I like it. Jamie Lynn Spears came to do it because she is Britney's sister, and I'm sorry to say that this is obvious on the show. They created Zoe's character to be all that people want to believe that Jamie Lynn is smart, original, smart, pretty, popular, etc. The characters around her are just to make her look better, smarter and more popular than they are more desired by boys than they are. There is nothing original in it, and it is flooded with money, so every child has the coolest fashion and all that. I also have to say that for a 13-year-old girl (or how old she is, she cannot be much older) she wears very mature clothes, these short skirts are too short, it makes young people want to wear them, and all this makeup, this adds to the growing problems of why young girls get into such a big problem. The only thing Iâ€™ll say is that Jamie Lynn sings the opening credits and, considering her age, is not bad at all, much better than her sister anyway when it comes to vocal abilities. Sorry, he is too old and too stupid. This does not work well with predictable plot lines, and there are too many stereotypes.
