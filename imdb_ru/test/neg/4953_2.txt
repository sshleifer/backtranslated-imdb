Jack Brooksâ€™s quirks are, at first, somewhat charming and amenable to the deliberately picky feeling of the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> I felt that I was becoming more and more angry and angry when I was deceived upon seeing this movie to the end, in the hope that the gain would have been very tedious. <br /> <br /> The climax cannot compensate for the entire installation. <br /> <br /> Usually one can expect small characters from this genre. But the fact that the waiting time index before the action is so high should mean that time will be devoted to the development of some interesting character. <br /> <br /> Not so. <br /> <br /> Although this film was not without its original charm, it ultimately infuriates and disappoints. <br /> <br /> I would like to return all this setup time to reinvest it into something that pays off.
