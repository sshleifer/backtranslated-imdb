I was looking forward to seeing this film, and it contains very interesting perspectives from Iraqis throughout the country, and not just in the main areas. <br /> <br /> However, as the film went on, and as it seemed, Becoming more and more one-sided, I began to wonder who edited the film. To reduce the time from a few hundred hours to as little as 80 minutes, it is obvious that a decision had to be made. <br /> <br /> I would really like the film, which shows how every day Iraqis feel on all issues, but with the headlines, unlike what people said, and, finally, everyone the film had the same opinion, I thought it was obvious that the editing was done with a predetermined bias. <br /> <br /> This could be such a great movie.
