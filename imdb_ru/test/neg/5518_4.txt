This film cannot be called “good,” and can be assembled from cheap film, music, and ideas from recycled material. But for me, when I watched it as a teenager, it was pretty funny. (I did not know before that BATTLE BEYOND STARS.) Looking back, he is experiencing something nostalgic about the SF wave of the early eighties and the special effects of this time. His trashy old-fashioned look and his naivety provide a certain appeal. To enjoy this film, I recommend concentrating on the parental relationship between the characters of Vince Edwards and David Mendenhall. In addition, I liked the idea that a bunch of scoundrels discover their heroic qualities after they unwittingly encountered the problem of caring for a child.
