Awful <br /> <br /> Despite Ed Harris' good performance, Diane Kruger and a big budget (3 stars), the film is the worst thing I've seen about the composer and the worst. edition of a musical masterpiece. I agree with some fictional things to update the biography, which otherwise could not be so "charming." This was done in AMADEUS with the best results, but this copy of B is a disadvantage here. Beethoven was a strong personality, but he was a sensible artist. Here in this movie, however, he looks much more like Mike Tyson! It is also interesting if, despite his deafness, he heard all the whispers in the last scenes (perhaps a cochlear implant?). I prefer to listen to the ninth on a CD with some cute maestro. Today, most of them are conducted by modern Wagner orchestras. By the way: I gave Amadeus 10/10!
