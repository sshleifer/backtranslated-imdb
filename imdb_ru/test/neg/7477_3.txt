Perhaps the best part of the show is the fact that it creeps in right after the fans of Conan O'Brien and “Night at Night” suddenly suddenly see Carson's show. Carson Daly can't hold a candle in front of Leno, Letterman, O'Brien or any other late night talk show host, and Last Call seems to miss more than just a hit in this genre of hits and miss. Shows only the quality of the ransom that is so short. But I wouldn't call it shit. Carson Daly is sincere and makes no secret that his show is not great (honesty is really useful here), while some parodies and Last Call materials seem stolen, sometimes they still find the brand. In fact, some of the montages of Carson were quite interesting, and parodies sometimes have moments of decent comedy. <br /> <br /> As an interviewer, everything is fine with Carson, even with one guest, not quite late at night, but still above the level reached by the AV High School team. However, he doesn’t have the acumen that makes Conan so fun. I do not like his musical guests, but this is more because I am not a fan of such music, so I do not hold it against him. <br /> <br /> On the home group. I do not know the Joe Firstmans group and would not compare them with the CBS Orchestra, Tonite Show Band with Kevin Eubanks or Max Weinberg 7. Even Cleeto and Cleetones are better. But in my opinion, band mates Firstmans still show the show. Especially the player Alto Sax, who sometimes appears (he has long dark hair and sunglasses and he always plays in the upper register), in any case, I watch the show for him, I do. <br /> <br /> In general, this show is not even worth the whole bag. But he has an audience, and she is more attracted to the young “mtv generation”. If you don’t have a cable and you are connected at 1:37, there’s really nothing to choose from, and surprisingly, the situation is even worse during this time. So if you are waiting for Poker After Dark to appear, 30 minutes of Last Call will not kill you while waiting.
