YOU BELONG TO ME (1941) - this is an example of the “Comedy with ScrewBall”, which began in the mid-1930s and ended after the war (World War II). Some of these films have retained their status. Others earned undeserved praise when they were initially critical and box office failures. Like raising a child (1938) or mr. & Ms. SMITH (1941). In addition, there is a value whose value continues to fall. <br /> <br /> Why is this happening from the script / story. It breaks trust from the start, betraying an excellent composition. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to millionaire Henry Fonda, who is terribly jealous. He would be pleased to sit with his millions of dollars and love her, she would like to keep her profession as a doctor. She wants him to become in her eyes a useful member of society. This conflict should cheer us up. He cannot be saved by either the principals or the auxiliary staff. <br /> <br /> The flaws in this scenario can be clearly laid at the feet of DALTON TRUMBO. The HENRY FUND character is written in such broad strokes that any viewer has an instant dislike for him. BARBARA STANWYCK simply has nothing to do except respond to every idiotic situation of jealousy. Trumbo must have spent a lot of time outside the studio, being a “useful idiot” and then being at work. COLUMBIA, obviously, did not receive its money from him, maybe ROBERT RISKIN should take responsibility
