"Season on the Edge" is one of my favorite books of all time - a penetrating, unshakable look at Bob Knight and his Indiana Huzier. And Dennehy is one of my favorite supporting actors. So I decided to watch this adaptation. <br /> <br /> She was disappointed in every level. Dennehy's performance was less than inspired, and he seemed not to be ready to play Knight - as if he had accepted the role shortly before the shooting. The rest of the cast is not much better. <br /> <br /> And it was obvious that this was the first ESPN movie. It was badly directed, badly removed, and the lack of a budget was evident whenever games were modeled (smaller sports halls, empty seats, etc.)
