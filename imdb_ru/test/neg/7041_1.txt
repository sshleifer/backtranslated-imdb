I am an Indian living in the United States. Why India continues, like a stupid animal, to imitate everything that an American is behind me! The main problems with the film - not so much a meaningless plot and stupid comedy. The fact is that in this film there is a lot of sex, touching women who dress like trumpet on the streets, and a lot of curses that are not shown anywhere on television. <br /> <br /> To the producers and directors of this film. I have the following message: You continue to weaken the strong family values ​​of our nation by creating such garbage. You continue to allow young women to think that it is normal to have a feminist attitude and not have morality. You continue to make dance songs that belong to the lowest of adult clubs and bars. I am ashamed to be an Indian after watching such films. <br /> <br /> In 2003, the United States government suggested that the best way to destroy Iran was to “send miniskirts there”. No need to do this for India. We will destroy ourselves with similar garbage.
