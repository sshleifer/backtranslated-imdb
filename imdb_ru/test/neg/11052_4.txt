Fortunately, I have not seen this movie in the movie, on the big screen, just on a small screen on the video. I doubt that I could sit in the cinema and see all the violence in the film. After watching the first 30 minutes, I became disappointed and interested. <br /> <br /> Disappointed because of the complicated storyline, incomprehensible screens, a huge amount of aggression - I still do not know why I was shown that Daesu (the main character) was pulling the teeth of another person from his head on women, his tongue carving. And it is also curious to see what the film will say as a conclusion, what is the final summary of all this cruelty. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, although the film was not boring, I did not get any response to all this cruelty, which I had to watch from beginning to end. In my opinion, if you want blood and want to laugh, there is “Kill Bill 1-2”, if you want blood with more meaning, you can take any recent military film, and if you want an oriental film, there are much better names there. of this, I will be more careful in assessing the ratings of the Cannes Film Festival, since, although Oldboy received a lot of praise from the jury, I had nothing to say, and I only had 4/10 on my scale. <br /> <I am eager to see something beautiful, harmonious, with true feelings and a clear message.
