I liked Half-Life. I'm still a fan. It was scary, clever and difficult. I do not say any news that this is one of the best FPS ever made. Maybe I'm a hardcore Half-Life fan too, but the so-called Half-Life 2 is not Half-Life 2. <br /> <br /> And I have a question: is this the next chapter of Half-Life? Maybe the creators of -Valve- think so, but I do not. Where are clever enemies? Where is the frightening atmosphere? Nowhere. I believe that they wanted to do a little different Half-Life (instead of a different research station history), but they didn’t just do something completely different, they did something that was connected with Half-Life, such as Quake, to Doom. The whole game is so unsightly and unreal that it is almost abandoned. <br /> <br /> Although physics is really great and has some good levels, the idea of ​​creating revolutionary, physically controlled gameplay has completely failed. When you get a Gravity-gun that can move objects, you can use it as a weapon with rights, which will turn the schematic gameplay of FPS upside down. The truth is that you cannot use the Gravity-gun as a real weapon. What for? Because the best thing you can do is throw boxes and barrels that do not do much damage. If you want to keep an object in front of you for protection, it can fall from about 3 shots. If you want to throw an exploding barrel to an enemy, it can explode in your own "hand." Gravity gun does not work as a weapon. The best use is to solve some physical puzzles. I ask Valve: why? The truth is that you have to use your boring, schematic FPS weapon to the end (except for the last level). The weapon does not make the original Half-Life classic. If Gravity-gun had always been at the last level - a real weapon - I would have admired what Valve did. But not this. It is disappointing. <br /> <br /> So if you want Half-Life, then you are looking in the wrong place. You might like it, but I repeat: this is all, but not Half-Life, and not even the right continuation of this. This is the biggest disappointment of all time. Valve showed that they, too, can make terrible games. They succeeded.
