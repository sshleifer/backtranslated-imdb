It must be one of the weakest plots in the film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> However, this is not all that is missing in this film. This film has the worst acting, screenwriting, directing, special effects, as you call it - it is the worst. <br /> <br /> I strongly advise you to spend time on decent films and not spend your time on it. garbage. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous post that the “women” were definitely dredged men, and this made me laugh, I continue to try to understand whether they were obvious in relation or if they really tried sexy women. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is worth watching! <br /> <br /> To sum up: a terrible game, a horrible script, a terrible idea for a movie. One and a half hours of my life I want to come back right now !!
