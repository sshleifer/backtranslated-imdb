This is by far the stupidest thing I've ever seen on celluloid. I mean, we started watching it, suggesting that it was “a click of T & A Skinemax”, but apart from a couple of boobs, that was all. I mean, I’m filming stupid films to show some sex scenes, as they are the only reason for making such a film. This film, however, does not have sex scenes, and in fact does not make any sense at all. There is no linear time, the scenes move like a bunch in the wind, people appear for no reason, then they leave, and this is never explained, the plot never moves forward, and nothing happens. I have never been so stunned by how bad the film was until I saw it. Was the director even in the film school? Has he ever seen a movie? I don't know, but apparently, he seems to have pleased some jerk with this piece of shit, since it still works. I literally walked away from this movie dumber, but I still recommend watching it, since it should be shown in every film school in the country as an example of what should not be done when making a film. Navigate through Plan 9 from Space, you have a new contender for the worst movie ever made.
