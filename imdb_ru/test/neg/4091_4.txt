I really liked Bruce Almighty, but the minute I learned that there would be a sequel without Jim Carey, I realized that it was bad. Although Steve Carell was hysterical in the first movie (chatter is one of my favorites) and, in my opinion, deserves an Emmy for his role in The Office, he is rather weak in this boring comedy. I am curious how much work the writers wrote, because we could do without history. But even if we discard the huge holes in the plot (why elephants and lions came to the aid of Evan when the flood affected only this particular area of ​​Washington), the film is just ... not funny. I never laughed once, and as far as I remember, comedy should make you laugh. Or at least giggle. Not this one. <br /> <br /> However, there is little hope. Evan Almighty says “family,” and perhaps family viewing can be enjoyable (children can be entertained by a variety of animals and stupid jokes), but for me Evan Almighty just doesn’t cut it off. I give him 4/10 and I hope that Carell will be more careful when choosing his roles in this function.
