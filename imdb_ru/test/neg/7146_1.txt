This film infuriated me because of the fact that it was made only because Shepard was gay. The people who killed him are clearly evil. What happened to the poor was truly terrible and tragedy. However, where was Hollywood when, just two years ago, four religious white children were executed in Wichita, and two years ago they were forced to commit many sexual acts on their murderers and each other? Celebrities give birth to a camera only when it serves a political purpose. In addition, this pseudo-documentary portrays Laramie in a bad light, which, of course, is hardly surprising, because these are backward hooks that all-knowing and enlightened Californians must train. Nevertheless, it is always nice to see Laura Linney.
