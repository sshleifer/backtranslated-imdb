I just visited a preview of this movie. He did not have a masterpiece of documentary filmmaking. Fully absorbed in its theme, the film becomes unable to even out any critical comments about Miss Fay. Feigned and juicy, the only redemptive quality of the film was the use of puppets in an attempt (albeit unsuccessful) to structure some story. But the most terrible experience occurred when the credits closed. The audience rose and applauded. Like moths on fire, Americans in the 21st century are still drawn to freaks. The story of the misunderstood monster is getting pretty tired.
