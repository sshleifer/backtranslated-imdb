It was like watching a trailer for an upcoming movie, except that there was no movie. The film is so unsatisfying and clearly unfinished that it seems almost ridiculous. The plot of this film is a very short amount of time, and, to be honest, nothing special happens in more than 90 minutes of screen time. I was hoping for the final Australian film about our soldiers in World War II and how they fought incredible chances in terrible conditions. This is definitely not the case. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the acting was superb, and the location was authentic. It could be a great movie if he had more money and time, but itâ€™s not even mediocre, and I cannot recommend it.
