WAIT, until you have watched most of the other films ever released, wait a year, and then watch it when you're ready for something with such low production rates that do not cause anyone to imagine. <br /> <br /> I Agree that those who rated this film as a ten-star production should do this in order to distort the data. Anything above 8 would be weird. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see very young Sandy Bullock in her lush hair for a short time, which she showed, although she replayed a New York accent, but sometimes her southern (Virginia NC) accent made her way. Ancient history for this experienced actress who has grown so much since the release of this film. <br /> <br /> On the DVD that I rented, there were two bonus features: the mini-bio section, which included only Sandra's biography - literally taken from IMDb. He also had a quiz quiz as a bonus - 3 questions. I hope you understood correctly!
