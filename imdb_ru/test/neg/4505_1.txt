Evil is a big house in which an evil spirit is unleashed to torment everyone inside. What a blur the movie! There is not a single scary scene. Not alone! Richard Crenna plays no role. There are several lively ghosts, electric sawing and rape. Almost nothing much happens for almost the entire movie. Evil incarnates in ... Victor Buono. Big! Where did the filmmakers realize that Buono is scary. Looks like he was on his ass to get a guest salary in the lead role. By then, it's too late to turn it off, because the damn thing is over. I wanted to throw the videotape out the window. Please avoid this junk! I hope he never sees the light of the DVD and disappears into obscurity.
