I'm kinda like jag. He has his charm, but lately there is a lot of propaganda in it. For an outsider (non-American), a patriotic feeling can be a little big. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t like that Rabb and Mackenzie go from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of television to show) to become super heroes who stop wars and save whole continents. This is almost the same as watching a video about recruiting from the US Army. <br /> <br /> I still watch the show, so it's not so bad. But I would prefer more episodes when Rabb and Mackenzie investigate war incidents and do not save the world in the future.
