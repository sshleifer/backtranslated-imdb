This film is a bit interesting, if not to take into account its numerous inconsistencies of the plot and the apparent lack of credibility. Bruce Willis in the role of "Jackal" never justifies his reputation as a cunning mastermind of the underworld. Instead, he wanders in broad daylight, flaunting a cluttered disguise. Why this person has never been captured (or even identified), I can not do. Never the audience is impressed with his mind or courage; considering the price he demands for his services (an exorbitant $ 70 million), his methods are clearly low-budget and stupid. <br /> <br /> As far as pursuing him is concerned, they are at least as ridiculous in their behavior. They do not show any experience, instead relying on an unfinished conjecture that forces them to cross the entire country on a whim. Incredibly, these far-fetched guesses (perhaps he bought a boat, maybe he was in Chicago, etc.). Invariably lead them straight to the Jackal, who again avoids their awkward capture. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere, whose Irish accent, as a distant radio station, disappears and disappears, plays the inexplicable role of an imprisoned person who is released from prison to work with the FBI. He actually makes a compatible partner, if only because his funds are just as amateur and inept as his professional friends. At some point, he actually confronts the notorious Jackal, but unfortunately the FBI, although they trust him enough to leave him out of sight, is not able to supply him with weapons or any means of communication. What kind of operation are they doing here? <br /> <br /> The film also seems to be overly dependent on violent violence, which is completely unnecessary and does not give any expectations. Allegedly secretive Jackal acts more like a crazy and senseless serial killer, driving people to play sports and writing blood on the victim's cheek. <br /> <br /> Plots of the film are predictable and unreal, and many moments are ruined with melodrama. This film is poorly executed on many levels, the only bright spot ever seen is Sydney Poitier. Avoid this movie if you have the mood to think when you watch it. <br /> <br />
