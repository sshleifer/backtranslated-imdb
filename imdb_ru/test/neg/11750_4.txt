The most disposable film in cinema history? This is a strong contender! Why spend so much money on such meaningless, useless work? The only difference between Hitchcock's classic and this poor imitation is the color, wide screen and Leyla's Walkman !! The film, which should cause thrills and fear, leaves me completely indifferent. <br /> <br /> No, you will not tell me this will prompt the younger generation to see the original "balderdash!" This "crazy 1998" is a giant spoiler. <br /> <br /> They could have done something else, for example, by playing the actor closer to Bloch. Bates, fat man. They are content with a disgusting binding! Bail on it! Long live Alfred Hitchcock!
