Now I'm a big fan of zombie movies. I admit that zombie movies are usually not so good, but I still like them. Despite the stupid game and the useless dialogues that are found in almost all zombie films, this film is definitely the worst. You see, there are a few basic rules with zombie movies. 1. Zombie suicide. Tactics are rarely used, and NEVER act as a boxer. They do not shy away from a blow to the head, they take it with an ugly smile. They are not trying to hit you in the face, they grab your hand and bite! 2. Zombies can't talk. Only in Evil Dead. Otherwise they DO NOT SPEAK. 3. You do not fight with zombies melee weapons. You lose in melee combat with zombies. Firearms used. However, in this film, hand-to-hand combat is a path that is incorrect. Very wrong. <br /> <br /> He has NO redemptive qualities. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie about zombies, watch a movie with an average score above 3 on IMDb.com
