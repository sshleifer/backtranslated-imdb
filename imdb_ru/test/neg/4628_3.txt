It was very hard for me to watch this movie. If you really are not a supporter of adultery and do not like to listen to how people talk endlessly about their sexual exploits, I can not understand how you could enjoy this film. Damn it - most of the main characters behaved like routine caresses, and their boasting about their MANY infidelities became tedious. The only element I appreciated was the disgusting scene where one character was urinating and blood was squirting everywhere because he picked up an STD - BIG SURPRISE!?! Hm <br /> <br /> If you want a GOOD movie, take a look at the barbaric invasion sequel. Despite the general unattractive nature of many characters, the sequel is VERY fascinating and more realistic - worth your time.
