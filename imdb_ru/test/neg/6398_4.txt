“Blame it on Rio” - a romantic comedy in the style of the 80s, for 101 minutes of which more than full eyes are full of sex. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns two middle-aged men in crisis, one of whom goes through his divorce, the other deals with the possibility of the same perspective. Both good friends, they decided to take a vacation in exotic Rio de Janeiro, each with a daughter on their side. Complications begin when one of them contacts the daughter of the other. <br /> <br /> This potential rebellion of the story is pretty funny, and there are some good lines, but it never becomes as fun as it could be. Any attempt to seriously deal with the moral problem also does not work, and, perhaps, the director Donen had to adhere to humor in this situation. <br /> <br /> A good movie, but what really destroys it is terrible Michelle Johnson playing the role of mischievous little seductress Jennifer. Although she uses her body to the full, this is the only thing she has. Acting Michelle is poor. It is not surprising that we did not see her in anything else. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 7, 1994 - Video
