Well, where to start the description of this celluloid smashing? You already know that the big fat NADA runs as a plot, so let's immediately note that this is so PC, that it is offensive. It's hard to believe that Frank Oz, the same guy who made us laugh, like the Little Shop of Horrors and Bowfinger, made this messy mess. <br /> <br /> So, this guy does not know that he is gay until this actor shows this out. Yes of course. If someone says that I am gay, I will know the truth, even if at present I love girls more than George Luke, $ likes a dollar. <br /> <br /> How can I find out the true nature of my sexuality? Well, if I like classical literature, dance and Barbara Streisand, I am gay. If I dress like a blind man in a hurry (half of his shirt is loose), I'm straight. O, sure. <br /> <br /> And here’s a big cliché: no matter how you look, there’s always a very attractive Hollywood actor who will adore every bit of fat under your skin, or a top model you like your zero IQ your ugly face and ears. If all these fun common areas were not enough to piss me off, then so it was. In the real world, everything looks material, guys, and I know for sure. <br /> <br /> I see that this happens: now you will say: “Relax! This is a comedy! Do not take it seriously! ” If comedy gives something “carte blanche” to suck out loud, I think the world has a serious problem. Wouldn't it have been much better (and funnier) to make a film to undo these old tiresome cliches, instead of increasing them over and over? <br /> <br /> So, one of the worst films I've ever seen. 1 out of 10. If this rating is somehow related to my sexual addiction, please let me know. I am interested.
