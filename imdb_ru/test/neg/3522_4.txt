This film is so soft! I tried not to expect anything more from this film, but still it was a big disappointment. The main idea of ​​the story is interesting and potential. It could have been much better. Characters are really simple, without depth. It is a pity that the previously talented performers Tiina Limi and Petteri Summanen did not do the already poor characters better. The director simply does not allow the viewer to emotionally get involved in this piece of cr * r. <br /> <br /> And a chase sequence at the end of the film. It's disgusting !!! <br /> <br /> Why should this decision be so stupid and old? <br /> <br /> This is too much of an used item with an even more horrible way of shooting it. OH NO!
