Just an hour ago, I finished watching this, my friend. As Dragonball fans, we think this movie is so bad it is good. Let's say one thing: without a beer of six packs, there is now a way to survive in this film. This movie is worth watching for many Dragonball fans to laugh it off. The best character in the film is Lord Horn, his makeup, his laughter and behavior are unforgettable impressions. What we liked about this film is that Turtle Island was the same as in the cartoon version. We believe that the only character that looks like a cartoon character is the Turtle. He is also a sex maniac and an idiot.
