The Cheerleader Massacre was supposed to be the fourth edition of the Slumber Party Massacre series; if this is what they did (what she sees as ONE actress from the original return to a small role in a cameo), then they failed miserably and did, of course, the worst part of the "quadrology". The Cheerleader Massacre flawlessly combines a bad game, a terrible plot, a stupid killer, a boring and boring death, boring scenery and terrible camera work, making it one of the worst movies ever made. Did I mention how bad it was? Don't get me wrong: this stupid and belated excuse for a horror movie is not as bad as Napoleon Dynamite, but this is undoubtedly a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The Massacre at the Fans is the exact opposite of the original massacre at a party of dreams. Stay away by all means! This movie is bullshit!
