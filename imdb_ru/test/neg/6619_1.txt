I did not get this movie because I am not a pervert like you, who is engaged in lesbians. <br /> <br /> The girl in the red wig is trying too hard to be funny (her lips are SO silicone!), but she is really lame and insecure. She tries to break away, like a surfer guy (better than a whore, but still strange and definitely unfashionable); the film does not explain why she is trying to impersonate a man. Oh, right, to "get" a poor, stupid girl. I forgot She makes all these stupid inventions that aren't funny, and she is really a lousy actress. Besides, this impartial look is so good! <br /> <br /> This stupid blond girl from Melrose Place plays (surprised) stupid blond. <br /> <br /> She thinks the girl in the wig is a guy! They even make out! Ewww! I think this part was pretty funny.
