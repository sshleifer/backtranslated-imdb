I have no idea how someone can give this film high marks. I did not give up, thinking it would be the next big horror movie, the next big horror movie or the next big low-budget horror movie. Obviously, this should not be frightening, but one fatal flaw in the production completely deprived of the joy of viewing. Sound editing was terrible. I had to work the volume control of the entire movie. You can imagine how difficult it is to get involved in something - even in a low-budget parody - when you either turn the volume up or down, or try to predict the next time you have to do it. Normal dialogue is very low, and all the screams, noises, etc. VERY loud. We are not talking about switching between 5 and 7 on the volume control, finding a happy environment at 6. We are talking about switching between 2 and 9 at volume, when it is almost impossible to leave the volume alone. Again, this film may be a worthy example of how it should be, but you will spend so much time adjusting the volume control that you will never have the opportunity to enjoy it.
