What a waste of time to watch this movie. Poor picture quality, poor sound, bad play and definitely not based on real facts. The deputy "girl" beat so much, like the sheriff, that it was more like a comedy than horror. The MP is trying to make an emergency phone call by dialing 911 ... PROBLEM ... in 1957 that there was no emergency number. This is just one example of glaring inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> The “terrible” aspect is underestimated. It just didn't look so terrible. <br /> <br /> I really thought that the actor playing Gein did the most wonderful acting work in the whole film. I could see mental disturbances in his image. <br /> <br /> Sorry ... this one just DOES NOT UNDERSTAND !!
