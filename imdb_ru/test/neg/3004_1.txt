The disappointment of such a film with a real potential of greatness is that it almost likes to be tough. We are talking about allegory, about metaphor ... but the truth is that it is impossible to bypass the fact that there is absolutely no plot or real character. <br /> <br /> At some point we know most about who these people are ... even if we never understand where they are going. Violent pretentiousness drove me crazy every time I tried to comprehend the truth in this film. <br /> <br /> Calling it beautiful, cool and awesome ... I just call it "cheating." The whole style and no content. Of course, this is a matter of taste ... but I would never accept a tangled modernist mixture of symbols and bursts of spiritual clarity by Jean Cocteau or Renoir. But if it works for you, I'm all for it. Art is a personal thing, I think.
