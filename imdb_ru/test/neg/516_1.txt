You should see this movie, this is a big footnote in the history of the movie. When this film was shot, the American film industry reached the bottom of sucking. Watch this movie, laugh, and you wish you spent the last 2 hours of your life. This is the worst acting game I've ever seen, and even worse directing. The villains laugh as if they were taken from a circus clown, and if the guys who starred in the “Scary Movie” want to make a parody of superhero movies, they only need to take a script from this movie and make a remake called “Black Scorpion III” really bad movies that somehow manage to lure producers to continue suicide.
