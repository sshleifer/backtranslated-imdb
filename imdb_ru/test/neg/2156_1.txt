I like a good western movie, but it was more like watching a performance on stage or a show at a local street carnival show. I could only endure 38 minutes in the hope that it would improve, but it only got worse, and I had to finish it. Each actor (s) set forth the lines as if reading directly from the script or control charts. There was too much predictability of lines and actions, and not as a natural occurrence or conversation. The wig on Rachel Kimsey was obvious. The actresses playing the sisters of Native Americans could play a non-native role and should have played. Native American wardrobe could be better and look a little more authentic. If in the future I decide to watch it with friends, I will do it not for the sake of waiting for a good western film, but with the expectation of watching an amateur comedy film.
