Carlos Mencia is just not funny! His show is painful to watch because of this. His sketches / parodies are all very terrible, and it really looks like a filler for the Chapelle show, which, although I'm not a big fan of it, is much funnier than this garbage. Carlos Mencia makes foolish speeches, and he too often depends on ending his monologues in a backward voice and going "der, der der." It's just not funny. He often, talking with others, makes puns. They are terrible and painful. When people don't laugh, he blames them ... why someone laughs, he's not funny. He has an immature sense of humor in everything he does in this show, it's amazing that everyone but three-year-olds are watching. One of my least favorite things he does is water every topic and make a joke out of it! I hope that this racist idiot will be removed from the air as soon as possible, because he is jamming the station, which he no longer needs to jam.
