This film was made before. This is basically a non-original combination of "Napoleon Dynamite" and "Sordid Lives". There are some funny pieces, but otherwise itâ€™s a bore of cliches. This is a good first attempt at a film, and the director (who also plays the main role and wrote the film) shows many promises. But the letter was partly unstable, and the story was not very original. I swear, I heard some lines in other films. However, the acting was very good, and the film was shot in an interesting way. It's also nice to see that gay movies are not so bogged down in political correctness and weary stories of fear. The main character seemed pretty well adapted for a gay teen in rural Texas, so without saccharin coming out here, drama!
