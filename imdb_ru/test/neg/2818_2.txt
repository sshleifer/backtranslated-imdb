Could have been better. In fact, maybe so much so that if the director hadnâ€™t even tried as hard as he, it could have been better. <br /> <br /> On a good note. The lighting was good enough. But almost nothing was missing. Shaky camera is working. (Yes, yes, I know it must be a style now.) Bad sound. And editing that looked like someone had watched too many Ulli Lommel movies (which are some of the worst edited movies). To summarize, the film seemed to be a rationalizer for the director / screenwriter / protagonist; to strip some young women put them into fake slavery and grope them by saying "threatening" things.
