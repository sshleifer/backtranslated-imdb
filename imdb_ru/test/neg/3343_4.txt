(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> Oh, of course, this is based on Moby Dick. Totally obsessed, and it will destroy him. This is complete nonsense. The film begins quite well, but by the end of the film all the others are destroyed, and the main star's mind remains empty. <br /> <br /> Prospective half-sister is never convincing. Some very bad light effects. The music is interesting. But little else. It took me more than a month to finally finish the damn thing. I suppose if you like Being John Malkovich, you might like it. But when BJM was a great movie that I just didn’t want to watch again, Pola X is a movie that I just hate in hell. The only possible excitement in the film is a gratuitous incestical sex scene near the end of the film. (I hope you don’t think about Katherine either.) <br /> <br /> This film is very boring, depressing and badly directing. Not very recommended. If you like french movies. (look at the Crimson Rivers instead) <br /> <br /> 4/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 1/10 Repeat: 0/10
