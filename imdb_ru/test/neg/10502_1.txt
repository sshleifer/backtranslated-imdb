If you came here, it’s because you’ve already seen this movie and you were curious about what others said about it. <br /> <br /> I feel for you, I * really * do. And I, as a Canadian, apologize (because this is what we do) that this film has ever come into your eyes, at least for a moment. I heard that there is no cure for retinal hemorrhage in a dozen cases. <br /> <br /> I, like everyone else, made this film, believing that it was some stupid case with Blade, shot in the B-movie. I thought, "Of course, I could laugh at a stupid movie." I will give the creators of this film ONE positive comment about their “creation”: Thank you for removing REC XX / XX / XX from the bottom right corner of the screen. I see how this could divert attention from watching this movie. <br /> <br /> And for the record, I * saw * the film, but did not watch it. The dialogue was inconsistent, and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother's trailer, I swear to God. <br /> <br /> Know what? I no longer write about it. It just hurts too much.
