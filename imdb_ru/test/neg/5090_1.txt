This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! And if you do not believe me, see for yourself. <br /> <br /> The film begins slowly, the storyline makes no sense. People fighting do not make any sense. I could not understand what they were talking about during the film (in most cases I was not even worried). It gives you nothing to watch the movie, the only advantage was cinema. New Zealand looks amazing. Everything else just sucks. <br /> <br /> Actors try their best to keep us awake, but, unfortunately, you will fall asleep instead. <br /> <br /> Do us a favor, even if it receives "on demand", do not watch it!
