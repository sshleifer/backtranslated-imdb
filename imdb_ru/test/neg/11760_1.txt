You cannot blame the filmmaker for glorifying Che, because the industry is money. Most of the stories you hear about this "freedom fighter" are an absolute hoax, invented by the Cuban communist government after Che's death. Che was a scumbag from day one. Here is a list of the great things Che did for Cuba 1) He executed thousands of innocent Cuban men, women and children to satisfy his thirst for power. <br /> <br /> 2) Destroyed Cuba's economy and good position with the rest of the world. The Cuban peso used to be equal to the American dollar. Now it is mostly useless. <br /> <br /> 3) Constantly fail in everything related to diplomacy, the economy and the armed forces. He never finished his first year at Medical School, and he was only in one real battle in which he surrendered with a fully loaded weapon. <br /> <br /> 4) He seized the largest property in Cuba to customize for himself. He had a yacht, a 60-inch TV, made to order from America, a pool and an ocean view. So much for avoiding the materialistic way of life. <br /> <br /> Today Cuba is an absolutely impoverished country, and you have no one but Che and the Castro brothers to thank for it. If you go to Cuba today, you will not be allowed to leave the tourist areas. He will find slums, beggars and prostitutes. <br /> <br /> If you think that something of what I am saying is not true, then go and study a little. Compare Cuban exports 1950-1960 with today, talk to people. who survived or who had parents in the so-called Cuban “revolution” of the 1960s, read all the reports about killed innocent people, read reports of people who served under Che and Castro and fled because of how evil, disgusting man he was was was. <br /> <br /> And please, please, always remember to read or watch EVERYTHING objectively. Stop taking everything at face value and THINK ABOUT IT.
