Ugh, bad, bad, bad, but I saw the worst, so I gave him 2 instead of 1. I just finished watching this movie, and I thought it was as rotten as the flesh on Dr. Chopper's face. The worst line of the film should have been: “I would like to introduce you to someone ... to meet my inner figure”, which consisted of a lone survivor from a fantastic group of 5 people throwing a bin into Dr. Chopper and then falling on Level. The second worst line is: "I am a park ranger who will seduce you" What, this freak is not even a police officer ????? Has anyone else noticed how everyone instantly dies from a magical bowel strike (no one dies so quickly from a bowel strike, I know that, because I often see them in the operating room), except for the super-park caretaker. Dude, like a bucket of blood, from this wound, squirms a little on the floor, and then enters the final to make a farewell shot at Dr. Chopper, while the inner hole lies on the floor. And if it does not beat everyone, he doesn’t even have enough decency to die, like everyone else. The inner bullock helps him limp outside and keeps telling him not to die while she runs for help, because he is like her only friend who is still alive now. Since when have these two become friends? I do not think that an insane meeting in the forest where he tells you to go to the city qualifies as an acquaintance with your time, but it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you have nothing else and you have nothing to do with your time.
