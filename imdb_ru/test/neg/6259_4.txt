Like CURSE OF KOMODO for the game creature genre, Jim Vinorsky's CHEERLEADER MASSACRE is a straightforward parody of slash movies like SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE. The psychos who escaped from his soft cell ((he was sent to an insane asylum because of the killing of eleven people), works in the mountainous countryside of Bobkat district and attacks anyone who is within his reach. A van with a group of fans, their teacher, with two arms, the driver and the driver go to the competition when their car runs out of fuel and he goes along the supposed short way to avoid turning back. Fortunately, the group finds the house in front but becomes the victim of a killer who attacks I give the victim one by one. A madman in the county could not kill one girl because she was in the cheerleader's dressing room when he was somewhere else, which means that one of their number was the culprit. Meanwhile, the county sheriff and his deputy find out the whereabouts of his psycho while trying to find the whereabouts of the missing squad of fans. After taking off cheaply on video, Vinorsky does everything he can with a limited budget, you have to look for smart ways to kill characters behind the scenes without luxury properly ktivnyh special effects. In other words, a lot of melons were slaughtered, the sound effect used to inform us that some of the victims, carried away into the dark by the black gloved hand, died cruelly. Vinorsky includes a scene from “A LITTLE PARTY OF CULTURE” in which character Brinke Stevens Linda is chasing the killer with a drill (... this killer and Linda were both dead, but I think Vinorsky wanted to associate his film with this film, although it's pretty bad ) .. yet it was nice to see her, even if it was a famous cameo. Tami Sheffield, like Miss Hendricks, a teacher of students in distress, bathes in her soul for a long time, soaping her naked body and artificial breasts. The girls who make up the cheerleaders are a little unconvincing, because they are clearly in their twenties. Aging soft-core porn star Samantha Philips (.. as a police officer who is being attacked by a psychopath she searches) and Nikki Fritz (.. a tourist who is being stalked while jogging over a dangerous bridge) are surprisingly not to undress, Veterans of Vinorsky Bill Langlois Monroe Sheriff Murdoch) and Melissa Brassel (as a detective who helps Murdoch in his case) participate in the search for serial killer John Colton MacFerson. Interestingly enough, the McPherson story serves as MacGuffan, since, in truth, the main part of the film is about the support group and their dangerous situation. I'm not sure that slasher fans will accept this film, because it takes too much time to break out a murder, and when they end up in the picture, the violence is not powerful or shocking to satisfy it.
