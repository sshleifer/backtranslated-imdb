I was attracted to this film by its original, restrained, real life. This means that in the Big Apple, more than twenty guys flop and return home to live with their parents and an even more flexible brother. It may have worked, but there is a problem. And this problem is called Casey Affleck. <br /> <br /> Casey Affleck is almost catatonic in this film. His acting mantra should be “make as little effort as possible at all times”. Or "why talk when you can mumble?" Or maybe “plunge into a coma as soon as the camera starts to rotate.” Do lips move when talking? It did not pass. Facial expressions? No one. Muscles in the face? Atrophied. Something? Nothing. Anything? Zip
