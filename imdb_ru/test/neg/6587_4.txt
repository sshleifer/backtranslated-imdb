I borrowed it on a DVD from a friend the other day. I really did not know what to expect. I have not seen many Russian films, and I do not think I have ever seen a Russian military film. Perhaps this made me expect something else, something larger following the pattern of an imaginary Russian mentality. But whatever those expectations were, they were dishonored, as this is a fairly ordinary military film. <br /> <br /> The whole formula - to follow a few young people from recruiting, training, deploying and some fighting, is well known. We saw it as many years ago, and more recently (as with Jarhead). Of course, there is a difference, because the film is about Russian soldiers, and not about Americans, as is almost always the case. But overall, this could be a film about Vietnam. I think this only underlines my sense that Afghanistan was the Soviet Union, Vietnam. The country that was supposed to be the impetus for the superpower made the war drag on for years with the terrible death of both soldiers and civilians. <br /> <br /> In this film, it seemed to me that good moments were good photos (some beautiful pictures of the atmosphere) and decent effects for what I thought was a pretty budget movie. What disappointed me was basically the story itself. I just can not make me any emotion. Mainly because character development is lousy. And to really feel something when people are shot, you have to make them people, not just faceless cardboard cutouts. They fail to do this in this film. In addition, it is too long, and this seems to be a trend lately. In my opinion, a film that lasts more than two hours should have something that he can offer, and this film does not concern him. There is also disturbing music that is put on like a wet blanket on every scene. Especially in action scenes, this is very disturbing, not that you need action music, but something more than just slow keyboard music would be nice. Otherwise, the production figures were quite good, and that was not the problem. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to watch this movie. As a reminder that no matter where you are, war sucks? That Russian directors have already watched too many American war films to make something original? Regardless, this film is rather clich√©, it lacks spirit, and although it has acceptable technical qualities, it lacks the development of scripts and characters. In the end, it just becomes another of those war films that do not make you think and do not add something to the genre. I have seen much worse, but much better. I rate it 4/10.
