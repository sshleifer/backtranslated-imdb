One of the commentators is wrong. This is not the only Pat Patterson film, and he did not die two years after it was done. He made a film called Electric Chair in Pineville, North Carolina. He took it off a few years after Dr. Gore. Patterson died in the late 70s. I know this because he used my house and left a cat there !! That sucks too. It was a big deal when the movie came out. No independent horror movie was made in NC. This film did not help questions. Patterson usually did blood effects for H. G. Lewis. He was also good at magic. His bloody scenes in the body shop were actually well made. The film was shot in a building where 7/11 were also located. You can see the top of the walls in some scenes. The budget was less than $ 20,000, and the script looked like it was written by a child. Only Patterson could understand this. Yet ... this is entertainment and this is a classic.
