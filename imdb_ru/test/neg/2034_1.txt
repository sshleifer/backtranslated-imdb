This is the early morning of our displeasure, and some of my friends and I just watched Wind. Truly a film about the disaster. Not in the sense that the forces of nature sow chaos on unsuspecting people, but rather on a terrible film that sows chaos on unsuspecting spectators. To give you an idea of ​​how hard it was to watch this particular bomb, I will give an example given during my first torturous viewing. If I were given the opportunity to watch this film a second time and, say, boil, I am afraid to say that the choice will not be immediate. But instead of just advering “ad peliculam” with lousy one-liners, I'm going to find out why it was my friends and I who panned this particular film. <br /> <br /> For starters, I like low-budget horror films. I even like fancy, low-budget horror films. I liked Cold Hearts, Midnight Mass, Jugular Wine, etc. Films that were ambitious and bold, even if they lacked production value, performance, and even acting skills. As a rule, an interesting premise, an unusual camera technique, or just a well-made scene or two will save the film, which is a bit rough. Bearing in mind these conditions, I would like to finally say that I hated “Wind”. <br /> <br /> The film was probably the most disappointing in the sense that it was incredibly difficult to watch. From the actions of the main characters, to the stream (?) Of the plot, to the big omens that the hole hints at, which ultimately tended to dust (and did not even associate itself logically with what happened in the rest of the film, and left the viewer, waiting something more, with a sense of much ado about nothing). The dialogue was spotty at best, wooden and completely unreal. By this I mean that in none of the situations in which the characters were located, no one would have reacted as much as the characters, and would not have said what they said, the way they said them. There was an obvious lack of vision and direction that would correct this problem. <br /> <br /> The interaction and character development was terrible. Claire, the "ferocious sex goddess," or, as they think, the aggravating, passive-aggressive lamasters in the film, was so frank in her manipulations that she might just as well bump into the characters. Nevertheless, she was a bright star of the film. The other main characters (with the exception of Mom Milf’s mom, who was not terrible) are so fuzzy that they could well have been played by the same actor. Let's see if I have missed something: a borderline personality, subordinated assholes with deep feelings of sexual confusion and inadequacy, incited to attacks of childish rage in the ingenuous orchestration of a bandage on lips, suddenly and without skill turned into Caligari. No, I think about cover. <br /> <br /> Lack of opportunity was also problematic. As those who participated in the creation of this film, expect the casual viewer to know that this was the beginning of the end of the world from this amateur, incredible, ill-portrayed lustful pentagon (well, how would you call it?), Which occurred mainly in the forest in the backwoods? There were no witnesses to the atrocities. There were no witnesses anywhere in this movie. <br /> <br /> Likelihood problems caused by a lack of attention to detail were common even from the moment when the plot begins to hurt. Case in point: if this guy Bob went this way through the forest to get home from the gym, and here's the key, **** every day ****, there is a very good chance that someone else would be around to to see something later, while the criminals were arguing loudly about the crime scene. One would have thought that with the murder of a young man in the forest, he said that the city would have been in a noise, the characters would have been interrogated, and so on. But instead, not a single witness could be seen (except Earl, a secret psychopath without an internal monologue ). We also suggest that there be no witnesses for this film. <br /> <br /> As regards the existing quasi-homosexual convolutions, I have no problems with them either. This is not as if they were a surprise, considering that we were shouting about the article in the closet for most of the male characters from the second scene. Again, not problematic in itself, but added for the wrong reasons. It was completely unnecessary, added for pure "shocking" and / or "dangerous artistic" values, and neither shocking nor dangerous artistic from any point of view. Instead, we had an awkward attempt to make a boring, awkward film with a boring, awkward plot. Poorly hinted at sexual tension, which was hinted only harshly in anticipation of this sluggish scene with guts, only pushed this film further along the totem pole from “critics justifying mediocrity” to “a film that sucks so badly that it lacks its inherent grace to suck out enough to properly make fun and laugh. "<br /> <br /> This is the case with most of the film, a lot of artistic clumsiness, a very small amount of meat and a lot of aggravation. It’s not that we don’t understand it. Oh, we understood it well. We Just don't want this. Listen, the fact that we hailed the beating in the final scene as the only * only * scene that made sense on her face indicates that something was terribly wrong with this film. Instead of move fast as its name implies, this film is languid lie sweeping along like a sweat trail down your nose until your hands are full Argh. This feeling sums up pretty well the agonizing frustration you feel while watching a train wreck. There is no breath of fresh air in this film, only a stale miasma of bad ideas is bad implemented, decaying before they come true.
