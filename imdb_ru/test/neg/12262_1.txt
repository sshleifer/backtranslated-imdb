This film could be great, but it wasnâ€™t. Among the cesspool of untalented hopeless and friends of filmmakers who wanted to help, there are some light talent speculations. The main star of the film plays a good main role. He is persuasive and has these terrible Italian eyes. Nevertheless, he teamed up with the worst outcast actors who have ever met. The first scenes of the film - one of the worst and embarrassing. Looks like gay porn. Fortunately, no one broke. The constantly rape scene of rape is rubbish. The prison sequence was the best part of the film - although it doesn't matter. The soundtrack to the film (if you can call it that) sounds like a teenager's first attempt to use Coolit and some samples. It's boring, repetitive and extremely lame. In fact, the whole movie is lame. Get out while you can!
