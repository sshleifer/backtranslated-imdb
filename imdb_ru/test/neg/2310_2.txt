I really should have rated “Sex is a comedy” as one of the worst pieces of gloom I have ever seen. The film inadvertently demonstrates those that are the worst aspects of the French, or at least how stereotyped they are, narcissism, snobbery, and pseudo-intellectualism. I am a French Canadian myself and I am a little ashamed that the creators of this film belong to the same culture as me, and this should give you an idea of ​​how bad this film really is! Not so much watching this film, how many are torturing him, there was a complete lack of humor, and it seemed to me that the whole film was a documentary interview in which people who were neither famous nor talented were shot, as if to celebrate never happened from the beginning. Instead, why not watch Auberge Espagnole, Happenstance or Je t'aime ... a la folie, three fantastic contemporary French films.
