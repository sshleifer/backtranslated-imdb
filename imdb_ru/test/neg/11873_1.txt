it’s easy to get started. I am by no means a true critic, and films that genuine critics, friends, family, and newspapers may find terrible, can even be fun for me to watch. <br /> <br /> However, not this one. <br /> <br /> I got it, since it was the newest Wesley Snipes movie in my DVD store. I like snipers, but it was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> bad story, bad actors, interruption of continuity, crappy sound, depressing locations, pseudo-cool snipers. film. <br /> <br /> they even left some marks on the frames where the car should have stopped. <br /> <br /> and I’m not talking about a “small production company / Young director / low budget” - this is bad when you can ignore some mistakes because you feel sympathy. <br /> <br /> You want to be a fighter who has been disappointing like no one else for a long time.
