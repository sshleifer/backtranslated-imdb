I think this is a disappointing sequel. I miss many of the old characters (King Gator, Anne Marie, etc.), and I don’t like it because even half of the original voices are back to make characters. Charlie lost a big personality, and the villain Red is not even twice as bad as Carrif in the first. If you are a big fan of ADGTH, like me, you should see how the story goes, but don’t expect it to be 5 stars in your book.
