This very important, confusing b / w "movie" looks like a baby on a very bad trip with acid. You are dealing with something that reminds you of a piece of rotting lettuce that accidentally fell out of the back of a garbage truck: no one cares about touching it, because it is likely to be washed off down the drain. There is no place for a plot when you have “visceral imagery” and a “subtle” allegory. It seems to me that the director is trying to shoot the next great feature film, asking for intellectual praise. I also did not bring my beret. Watching this, I felt almost offended, as the “film” does such an effective job, distancing itself from you.
