Another sadistic and ultra-lazy film about revenge of the late 70s - early 80s ?? Wes Craven undoubtedly launched a popular trend with his “Last House on the Left”, although “Terror Express” is more like robbery of other robberies, such as “I spit on your grave” and especially “Night murders on the train”. According to the plot, there is absolutely nothing new in this film, so the director Ferdinando Baldi can only multiply the meanness factor by a thousand! This is actually just a soft core porn movie that gets a little rough near the ending. Three hopelessly weak-minded loser come out of the night train from Rome. They provoke male travelers and sexually harass women. Everything gets out of control, and the traveling convict comes to the rescue of a prostitute, which all three of them screw up. This is a very boring movie, and there wasn’t even enough money to buy a couple of bags of fake blood. This type of film is usually notorious because of cruel rape and discriminatory behavior towards women, but sex in Terror Express is not at all disturbing. On the contrary, these “rapists” spend more time verbally, delighting their victims, than by acquiring them themselves! The music is excellent, the dialogues are unintentionally funny, and the characters are the most ridiculous ones I've ever seen. The villains are weak, and the train passengers are so immobile that they look like part of the set. If you like your exploitation, how ugly it is, then this is your movie. However, your hunger for blood and controversy definitely will not be soothed. "Terror Express" should be in the porn section videostores.
