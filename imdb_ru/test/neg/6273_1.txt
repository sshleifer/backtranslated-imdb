My paraphrase above the slogan on the back of the DVD box summarizes: this film was much worse than horror. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I have ever seen. My wife accidentally rented it, thinking that this is a version of Tom Cruise. Ridiculously coarse special effects on the menu screen should have warned us. Unreasonable nudity already in the debut scene made us more suspicious. <br /> <br /> But as the film went on, we were stunned by clumsy actions — both excessive and insufficient — inconsistency in directing and editing, banal writing and crude special effects. We surrendered in half an hour or less; after it all started badly, it could not improve. <br /> <br /> As I despise reviews without any details about the product, here are some examples of particularly awkward moments in the film, even if they boil down to spoilers. : <br /> <br /> - The presenter says goodbye to his young old son, since the latter is going to leave with his mother, the latter is barbed, because they have a wedding anniversary, but the leadership does not come because of a sudden affair. The son quietly worries and asks : "Will I see you again?" Perhaps this should sound like a premonition, but instead it looks like inappropriate behavior for a child at that age. <br /> <br /> - A huge alien spacecraft fell to the ground and found itself in a huge crater. Nearby is a crowd of people looking uneasily at her, but in general they look completely indifferent. One woman finally says: “This is monstrous!” <br /> <br /> - After this craft ruined the village and its inhabitants, the leader and the witness, they are now alone near their houses and trying to load their cars to escape, share something like this, in a quiet puzzled tone: <br /> <br /> "What was that, anyway?" “I don't know ...” <br /> <br /> - A crowd trying to evacuate through the bridge is blocked by the military because part of the bridge is destroyed. When an alien ship shoots him with explosives, the crowd starts to run away, apparently only because the director told them so, and not because they were scared or in real danger, not to mention unusual circumstances. <br /> And so on ... the movie entry does not match the experience of watching it. But please, PLEASE save yourself from anxiety, even if your painful curiosity is offended! The film is so bad that it cannot even be called unintended humor (compared to, say, Solomon and Sheba, King Vidor in the lead role in a wig with Yul Brynner). Life is too short to waste time on such nonsense. There must be something more productive and enjoyable, such as walking a dog or cleaning a bird cage.
