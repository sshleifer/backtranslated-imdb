Another of these contrived stories in conjunction with the most forgotten musical numbers. Powell and O'Keefe, as struggling publicists, are quite easily forgotten. However, there are two highlights. Hubert's castle is the most incredible tightrope walker you've ever seen - his “drunken walk” over wire should be the most exciting piece of balancing ever recorded on film. He must be seen to be believed. The other is Sophie Tucker, making a turn closer to the end of the film. Her magnetism, her professionalism, her obvious talent for being herself - well, charisma has not been studied - whether you have it or not. A great lesson for all future cabaret artists. Sad note: W.C. The fields in his latest cameo movie are completely forgotten.
