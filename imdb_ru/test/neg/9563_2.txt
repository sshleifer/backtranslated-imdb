It goes without saying that you need to make a small discount when the true story adapts to the big screen. But if you shoot a fairy tale that has nothing to do with what actually happened - why call it “Bugsy” and make the audience believe that this is half true story? The Godfather Trilogy handles a lot of real characters and events, once in America, too, but they do not pretend to tell true stories. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> In the film, Benny has a grand vision of the player Eldorado; in real life, Lansky had to convince him to go to Nevada. Benny thought the idea of ​​Monte Carlo’s colleague was idiotic, and he would have preferred to continue his life as a playboy in Los Angeles. Only much later did Benny warm up the idea. But, of course, he is the hero of the film, so naturally, the idea should belong to him. <br /> <br /> In the film, Benny wants to use Count DiFrasso to get close to Mussolini to kill him, because he was. After all, Hitler's partner and Hitler killed Jews in gas chambers. Obviously, we should like Benny, so the screenwriters invented this nonsense. In real life, at that time no one knew about gas chambers, primarily Benny, who was completely uninterested in politics. In fact, he used the Countess’s liaison and visited Mussolini, not to kill him, but to sell him explosives. He even met with Goebbels and Goring during his stay in Italy. <br /> <br /> Greenberg’s entire subtitle was meaningless. Greenberg did not turn a pigeon into a stool, he did not seek refuge with Benny, Benny did not kill him (this was before Albert Tannenbaum) ... at least they understood the name correctly. <br /> <br /> I guess it should have been very romantic for Virginia to return to Benny, offering him the money she stole. The film even goes so far as to tell us through text panels that she regretfully returned the money to Lansky after killing Benny. Let me just say that revisionism is not becoming more arrogant than this. <br /> <br /> This list is by no means exhaustive - the problem is that the Benny family does not live in Los Angeles, as Benny deals with Draga and Adonis, the image of Costello (an unpleasant corporate type), Lansky (cute teddy bear), Benny himself (an aging talker who would not have reached the age of 12, if he regularly became a buggy in situations like the one in the film and, moreover, who has no attractive appearance, Neither the charisma of Benny Siegel, nor many others. Apart from a few irrefutable facts, in this the movie is nothing right. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS END HERE * <br /> <br /> In general, this is the only film about the mafia that manages to be even funnier Bad than Harlem, New York. But honor is where honor: it is a feat in itself.
