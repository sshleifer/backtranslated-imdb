Found this film for one dollar (1 dollar) and the film became a waste of time. Reb Brown (Mark Hardin) played a military adviser in South America and succeeded in capturing the leader of rebel soldiers operating from the dense jungle. However, Mark joins the opposite side after some terrible torture was used for both women and men. In one scene, when Mark drinks at the hotel bar, his eyes notice the sexy long legs of Sandra Spencer (Shannon Tweed), “Dead Sexy”, 01. Mark and Sandra love each other and even make passionate love on some very hard stones not having time for the comfort of the bed. This is a terrible movie, and you should not spend time even on IT.
