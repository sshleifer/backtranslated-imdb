For a good look at the clock of the Roman Empire, the excellent BBC mini-series "I, Claudius". It just sucks. The game was pathetic, and you could almost see the actors watching the camera. Hans Matheson was annoying. The cheese factor was so high that it contributes to constipation during repeated viewing. Even Caligula was tame. I think this film was silently supported by "religious" groups that should remain nameless;). The open tones of Christian favoritism and persecution were obvious if it gave a hint. Stay away from what you are doing - the time it takes is so long that I could read the first Harry Potter book faster than the time it took to watch this prank. <br /> <br /> Italy has achieved more - do not let the sweet face of Hans deceive you. He is not a great actor ... he is a great bore.
