I was consumed with big names. Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, Burt Reynolds and the fact that it was an independent film. Incredibly slow start: 35 minutes, two melancholy songs and a spoiled breakdown. I was not worried about the characters, and the plot never made me even pretend that it could be realistic. I can not believe that this is what makes it on the screen. I loved watching this movie because it was so good when it was all over.
