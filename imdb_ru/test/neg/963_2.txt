DANGER: Watch out for falling spoilers ... <br /> <br /> Boy, it was a bad movie. I know that they fought for “true love, which conquers all,” but there were about 3 (which was more like 9) hours of my day about this entire conquered film, and I will never return. The film tells about two young lovers named Kai and Hertha who live in a remote city in a fantasy world. Kai is a very offended messenger at a hotel owned by Hertha’s father. At first, Hertha ignores Kai's successes, but in the end she warms him strongly to disgust (You guessed it!) Father Hertha. As if this obstacle was not enough to overcome, the evil snow queen shoots a piece of glass in the eyes of Kai, and he becomes a stingy man, mistreating with Gerta. Kaya is eventually sent to the Snow Queen's fortress (which is the same as the hotel just covered with ice, because the good people in Hollmark love with all their might), and Hertha is sent on a mission to return Kai. Along the way, she encounters 3 other seasons that are evil in their own way, but Hertha avoids them with the help of some sad and forgettable characters she meets along the way. (All the time you will want to turn it off, but you cannot bring yourself to do it. These are probably the most evil and most effective spells created by the Snow Queen). In any case, I will save you from the final, because everything that you can Come up right now is probably better than how they finished it. So in conclusion, “The Snow Queen” is an incredibly boring film that takes a fan out of fantasy.
