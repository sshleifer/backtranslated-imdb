A malfunction in space knocks astronaut Neal Stryker (Glenn Corbett) off course and heads for something from a parallel world called Terra, which revolves around the Sun directly opposite the Earth. Because a creature from space is a threat to order in this world, Stryker is held until a decision is made on what to do with it. Stryker, however, is suspicious of his surroundings and runs away. With the help of a sympathetic nurse and an old scientist who opposes the government, Stryker will try to get on a spaceship and go back to Earth. <br /> <br /> Stranded in Space (or The Stranger, if you prefer) is another of those 70s films made for television that were to be turned into a regular weekly show. In this case, it is easy to understand why this failed. First of all, there is nothing new in the show setting. It was undoubtedly designed to follow the same formula as the Fugitive, the Incredible Hulk or the Planet of the Apes. You know, a stranger who is constantly traveling, moving from one city to another, getting employed in any casual work that he can, is always pursued by a government agency or a newspaper reporter. This is a formula that was made to death. The second strike on Stranded in Space is its leader Glenn Corbett. Can this guy meet anything less likeable? I rooted for him to be caught. Without sympathy for the main character, this kind of show will never work. Finally, it must be science fiction. Just because everyone is left-handed and someone has hung three false satellites on the horizon, should I come to the conclusion that this is some distant planet? So it's just a coincidence that they all speak English, dress like people on Earth, and drive the Plymouth Furies? Yeah, right. <br /> <br /> The highlight for me was the inclusion in the cast of Cameron Mitchell. Of course, it's hard to look at him in something so terrible, but you know the old saying - any Cameron is better than no Cameron (yes, I also never heard). <br /> <br /> Like many of these 70s shot for television, I watched Strange in Space thanks to Mystery Science Theater 3000. I wouldn't call it a great episode because of the big imagination, but there are some good jokes along the way. In the end, while I rate the film as 2/10, it gets 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
