It seems that the rule in the making of this film was “never create a scene of 1 minute duration, when you can create a scene of 10 minutes length”. It was a principle established from the very beginning by an infinitely long depiction of the end of Harvard class in 1870. The meaning of this scene, I believe, was to present some of the main figures in history and give some background - which is somewhat effective when comparing the idealism of the Harvard graduation ceremony with the realism of life in Johnson, Wy., But it just continues evolve, and it sets the stage for a film that shows repeated episodes of stupor, nothing, aggravated by the fact that I discovered that much of the dialogue was almost incoherent. In the end, I could not even watch it in one sitting. I went through about half of this, and I had to postpone it for a couple of days before I could drag myself back to see how it turned out. <br /> <br /> My reaction to this film in many ways is a shame because it has its advantages. Performances are usually of a high level, especially Chris Christophersson in the role of Averilla, Christopher Walken in the role of Champion and Isabel Huppert in the role of Ella. The main story - interspersed around this omnipresent nonentity - is potentially interesting, focusing on the efforts of immigrants to settle in Johnson County and the efforts of a local livestock company to stop them, killing many of them in cooperation with the government and the military. There are also some absolutely breathtaking landscapes. Having said this, all this, frankly, could be done in half the time - and should have. In the end, all of these potential positives are washed away - again - by a stunning little thing around which the film seems to rotate. Seriously - 2/10.
