We found this film almost impossible to watch. With such a super actor, it's a shame that the script and direction were so terrible. The tormenting pace at which the story was told drove insane. Flashback was awkward. Characters were one-dimensional. Tough metaphors - the river, the cat - repeated too often. <br /> <br /> The film No Fool, based on Rousseau’s other novel, was infinitely better, probably because it was more rigidly written and directed. <br /> <br /> The photo in Empire Falls was beautiful. It is a pity that this was not a travel story. <br /> <br /> I read the novel and enjoyed the writing style, but I had some controversy with the novel itself. I would give a romance 4 out of 5 stars. Perhaps the writers and the director were so impressed with the novel's reputation that they felt they should include every damn thing in their film. It was supposed to be a television film, guys, not “Books on the tape.”
