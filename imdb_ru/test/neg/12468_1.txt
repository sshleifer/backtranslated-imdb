Egads, what a bad movie. The pie is perhaps the worst film I've ever seen in a whole year, and Iâ€™ve been faced with some nonsense. In this garbage there is nothing, from the characteristics to the direction to the plot. Even the usually brilliant Dominic Swain could not save this film. None of the characters show any sympathy, except, perhaps, Eloise (wonderfully depicted by Lacy Chaber, the only bright point in this grim failure). <br /> <br /> ******* Possibly Spoilers ******** <br /> <br /> The main problem with Tart is that it rattles without saying a word. He dangles drunkenly, instead of leading us along the path of history. He also introduces many potentially tantalizing details (hypochondriac brother, mother's property, constantly inherited, classmate-anti-Semite, father-killer of another classmate) without successfully studying any of them. And as soon as I finally thought that the characters might have some sort of permission, the film suddenly hit us. <br /> <br /> I left the film, feeling that he was trying to tell me something, but with a strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be transmitted. This is an obvious first film by a writer / director who really needs to spend much more time working with more reputable directors before imposing more of her work on the unsuspecting public. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 1 out of 10, and I am usually very generous, even with bad movies.
