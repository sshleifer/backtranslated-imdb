For connoisseurs of bad films, Galaxina is a real gem. With truly awful dialogue, acting and directing, this is not a choice for people looking for a suitable movie. But as one of the most unintentionally hilarious films of its genre, it is invaluable for a good laugh. In particular, scenes involving the worship of the motorcycle worshiping Harley Davidson are especially good, and many other scenes provide an opportunity for cheap laughter. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the scenes with Dorothy Stratten really do not give, but since she plays the android, I think you can excuse her for the wooden game. <br /> <br /> Bad movie lovers, don't lose sight of this!
