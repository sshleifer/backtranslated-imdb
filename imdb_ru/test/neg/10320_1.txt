I saw this remastered on DVD. He had a big photo of Sandra, it says “Sandra is in the main role ...” and it seemed that she plays a big role in this. Not this way. She is barely at it. She does what she can with the script, but not so much. <br /> <br /> The sound was terrible. By this I mean that things did not go together. Shots will be made, and the number of shots will not match the sound. People talk in the car when it is moving, and the shot goes outside the windshield, but there is no engine noise, road noise or any other sound. Pretty weird. <br /> <br /> The rating was terrible. It sounded like the same notes over and over. The dialogue is really terrible. <br /> <br /> It was terrible to act, I could not believe it. The battle scenes were similar to the Batman comic without BIFF and BAM. They were really lame. The filming scenes, I mean with firearms, were literally ridiculous. I quickly moved forward in many films. Even then it was too long.
