I bought this film because I thought the actors were decent, and I like Jennifer Rubin and Patsy Kensit. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that acting is not at a high level. Steven Baldwin sometimes makes his character almost backward, and sometimes sullen. Patsy Kensit is so-so, but not too convincing in some scenes, and the alleged poetry that she says in a certain scene in her Hotel Room is completely pointless rubbish. Ms. Kensit is certainly very impressive and sexy here, but ultimately I think Jennifer Rubin is definitely the best in this film. Miss Rubins character is at first innocent and then sexy as she plays Stephen Baldwin (Travis) for a fool. Auxiliary cast includes Adam Baldwin (no relation to his more famous namesakes) and M. Emet Walsh, who appeared in many films, and I also noticed Art Evans, who was one of John McLan's allies in the film “Die Hard 2. “These are some nude scenes with Ruby and Kensit, a bit of action, but this is certainly not a fast-paced or intelligent thriller. There is a certain scene when they are in a car preparing to commit a crime, and Stephen Balvin’s character wears sunglasses, and when you see him again, the area around his eyes, etc., turns black instead, then the sunglasses appear later when they leave the scene of the crime and the police are chasing, a very obvious mistake in editing. <br /> <br /> If you are fans of one of the ladies or Baldwin, then you can find something to your liking here, but others should stay away. This is a reasonable, but unremarkable thriller that costs no more than a couple of dollars if you want it.
