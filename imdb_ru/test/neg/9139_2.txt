Enjoying Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi, I was looking forward to this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and saw in which direction she went. Rarely has a film so impressively failed to justify its predecessors and went astray. Although he is trying to present a “civilized war” in the form of sports, science, commerce and other forms of competition, he lacks a global scale and even coherently developed themes of his predecessors. War is chaos, but even war has a purpose, and this film had a small structure and unclear objectives. <br /> <br /> Nakoykatsi is imperfect, because it is a chaotic mixture of images that does little to develop his theme. On the other hand, he wisely avoided using some of the iconic images of the wars of the last century. <br /> <br /> Nakoykatsi is also so closed that several times I had to remind myself that I was not watching ads promoting Americans. Lifestyle. Perhaps this closure reflects the ongoing "war on terror." Presenting “sport like war”, famous team logos ensured that the United States would be depicted as winners. Consequently, he missed the opportunity to portray some of the many sports around the world and to show that humanity is united in the use of sports as a form of civilized war. <br /> <br /> In addition to the newsreels, the footage seemed to have been shot on a budget within New York, and in the rest of the world there was little recognition of “life as a war”. The gallery of persons (wax figures) only hinted at the existence of important characters outside the United States. Manufacturers have missed the point that globalization does not mean Americanization. <br /> <br /> Philip Glass's soundtrack sounded the same as all the other Philip Glass scores I heard (with the possible exception of Koyaanisqatsi), and at best can be described as “harmless”, not adding or distracting from the chaotic images.
