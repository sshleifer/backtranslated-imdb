My mom and I rented this gem a few years ago when she came here for Thanksgiving. I rarely laughed so hard. This is a typical low-budget horror film with dumb special effects, a worse plot and an even worse acting game. But do you really expect the classics when Linnea Quigley gets the highest score? I thought not. <br /> <br /> Since this film has a certain entertainment value, I give it 3 out of 10.
