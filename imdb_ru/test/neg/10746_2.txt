I was looking forward to Dante's contribution to this excellent Showtime horror series, but it was easily the worst of the whole mass. This is really very bad. This may in part be due to a poor, if odd, choice of raw materials. Why Joe didn't just write the original, I have no idea. Instead, we get this episode with soap, where the “message” stuns the script, the characters, the production, everything, and in the end I just wondered if this could be worse, and I won’t spoil it ... but things got worse. What an abomination from such a talented creative team. Skip this and buy John Carpenter instead. He manages to balance all the elements: horror, humor, character, vision, and it is fun. Returning home is about as fun as if a bear fell on you during sleep.
