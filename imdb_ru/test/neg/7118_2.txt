Spoilers ahead Some of the people who were killed in this film are actually asking to be killed, breaking into abandoned houses, chasing ghosts, etc. <br /> <br /> In a strictly cinematic aspect, this film is very bad. , The three plot lines are shown parallel, and suddenly we find out that they are separated by at least several days. This is a cheap shot ... <br /> <br /> In addition, the thrills are so cheap that they are ridiculous. Even "The Nightmare on Elm Street" did not fall so low as to show that someone was attacked by his sweater ... It's a pity. <br /> <br /> Save your money, stay home, and you will not be angry at the filmmakers ..
