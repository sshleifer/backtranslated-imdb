I really like Ryan Reynolds and Hope Davis, and I really had high hopes watching this last night on the DVD. Mostly, because I try to avoid reviews until I myself look at something and form my opinion Big mistake! My 2/10 for the first segment, which, frankly, is actually quite decent, and if they shot a film about the characters only in section 1, it could rise above the mark of 5/10. As soon as he moved to the television "reality show" the territory stank to the skies. Ryan Reynolds remarkably captured the essence of the actor on the edge, but as a gay writer and famous game creator / dedicated family man, he was definitely less effective. From the commercial on the box, I was expecting a thriller with memories based on “Memory” - unfortunately, this is far from the standard of the film.
