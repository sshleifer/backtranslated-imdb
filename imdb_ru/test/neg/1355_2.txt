As a Spanish tourist in Los Angeles and a movie fanatic, I made a terrible mistake. I went to see the "Women" remake of one of my favorite for all time. I have seen the original many times, in fact, it belongs to me. My desire to see a remake was based on Diane Inglish, the woman in charge of Murphy Brown. My opinion was: how bad can it be? She should know what she is doing. Well, I do not know what to say. I do not understand what happened. Women with Botox are a pretty depressive affair. Meg Ryan or someone else who played Mary - she looked a bit like a grotesque version of Meg Ryan ... another actress, possibly masked by Meg Ryan - she doesnâ€™t add to the character anything Norma Shearer did in 1939. New tired, unconvincing prototype of what has become a farce inside a farce. Annette Bening's Friends, Debra Messing, Jada Pinket Smith are as divided as anything I've ever seen, and if that wasn't enough: Eva Mendez as Crystal, the character created by Joan Crawford at one of her best and funny performances. , Casting Eva Mendez is actually a sign of how wrong, how poorly this commercial attempt is conceived. I did not give him 1 respect for Candace Bergen and Cloris Lichman
