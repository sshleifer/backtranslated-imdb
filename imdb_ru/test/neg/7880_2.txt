I'm tired of the open thinking argument. I tend to be fairly unbiased, but these lines are mostly made by people who enjoy things that they don’t need to “like”. You know what, there is a reason that so many people are disgusted with it. And just because someone is not there, it does not make him so bad. In the end, there is a reason for the existence of a feeling of disgust, and no amount of "open mind" or "pushing the envelope" should eliminate this feeling. Otherwise, we are no better than meaningless living beings. <br /> <br /> Return to movie. Another argument is that this film puts women into roles usually meant for men, so men do not like it. But just because it is disgusting for more men than otherwise, it does not make him great. Maybe men should not be involved in what dominates the film industry, but the answer is for women to do the same? Maybe if you do not like movies, television and entertainment programs, in which there is so much sexual objectification of women, so much violence, do not watch them. <br /> <br /> And if you're a director, don't do it, don't do it. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, someday someone will ask for impartiality when what happened in this “film” happens in real life. <br /> <br /> Damn, some people like it so much
