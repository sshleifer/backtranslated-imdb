It's hard to be too tough with Brad Sykes, the hardworking guy doing what he likes, he has honesty, which other filmmakers often lack microbudgets. Look at the crew's insignificant thanks to Camp Blood. It is not unusual to thank everyone for the pizza they ate, for her Brad and his buddies, and thatâ€™s all, no complaints. Jennifer Ritchkoff is not the most common hero of a horror movie, but she copes well enough for you to barely notice that Bethany Zolt looks like a star, and Joseph Haggerty is so funny that it hurts. The clown is hardly the original bad guy from horror films, but the design is good, Shemp Mosley does a decent job to bring it to life, and the image beautifully conflicts with the rural background. Blood Camp is a horror, like a blue collar, and basic, as it happens, is not a good thing, not a bad thing, just a thing.
