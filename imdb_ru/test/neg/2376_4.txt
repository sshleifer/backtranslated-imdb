This Asterix is ​​very similar to the modern Disney cartoons. Soulless, technically good and ordinary jokes for adults. Perhaps this is because this is the first cartoon that I watched after Laputa: Castle in the Sky, but it was pretty disappointing. <br /> <br /> The plot is contrived and confused, but involves Asterix and Obelix in Viking territory to save the spoiled teenager, who will then learn humility and find love. Yes, and at first they do not get along, but when faced with difficulties, they all share the bonds of friendship ... Yadda Yadda. <br /> <br /> It is best to beware of little jokes. The Vikings get the very best. For example, Vikea (the wife of the Viking leader), giving a list of furniture and skulls, to return them from the next raid. Or Vikings who do not know the meaning of mercy (literally). Oh, and Olaf, the dumbest Viking, is actually very funny (as for a voice playing the role of dialogue). <br /> <br /> For example, on board a Viking ship: (After the speech of Abba, the captain's daughter) Olaf Who is this new guy? Captain: This is my daughter, cod! Olaf: Your ... daughter ... man?
