I did a review for this directorâ€™s fictional vacation about BTK. I also saw this movie, and it was terrible. Please save your money and time. This film was terrible, and this director is inept. I do not understand how he finances these films. They are terrible. I decided to make sure that I check who the author, director and producer is, and if the name of this director pops up, I will not waste my money. There is nothing worse than renting a movie on Friday night, cooking popcorn, and then realizing that you were fooled by creative art on the front of the box for a movie. Stay away. So, I think I need to come up with something to fill the lines? I have always checked IMDb for reviews before, but I think I will not be more. This is ridiculous. I have been corrected in my reviews too many times. Not enough lines? You can cancel my account. Your site is a pain.
