The younger and his dad begin a new life in a new city. This is the same life, because Junior has never changed. He is still the same rotten lad, as before, only he has become more. This time he has a friend named Trixie, and she is a little worse. Junior does not like it when he meets his father, and he spoils all the possibilities that he has. Then the grandfather comes up and a dog appears. I thought they both would have made it a good movie, but they didn't even become buddies to the end. This is a film for the most immature people. It has diapers, farts, doggy and toilet humor. Only someone under the age of twelve can find it super funny. I hope that when I have a son, he is exactly the same as the younger one.
