Business leaders are abducted, forced to roam the forests all day and miles, sharing a dialogue with their captor. And we have to listen to all the nonsense ...... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, his snotty wife and family at home with the FBI, wondering what to do ...... ..... she never seems concerned about the fate of her husband, except when it comes to redemption ..... A love story "? Give me a break! <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous. And almost every scene is filled with the kind of expectation that something important will happen, but this will not happen. <br /> <br /> The result of the abduction is predictable and stupid, and it becomes even more stupid when we learn the fate of the kidnapper. <br /> <br /> This is garbage: <br /> br /> 2 out of 10.
