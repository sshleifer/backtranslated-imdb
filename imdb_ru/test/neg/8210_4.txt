There were a lot of things in Dungeon of Harrow that could make this a good horror movie. Creepy mansion, torture chamber, paranoid owner, henchman, ghoul in prison, etc. But, unfortunately, to say that it was not done very well. <br /> <br /> The writer and skipper suffered a shipwreck island belonging to the count in the castle, his slave and dumb maid. The count is becoming more and more suspicious that the two shipwrecked men are pirates (of all things) and are becoming more and more prone to turn them and expose them, and the dumb maid who supports them, tortured and imprisoned. Sounds good, right? <br /> <br /> Well, not really. I used to call it one of the worst films I've ever seen, but now I hesitate. Since he had such great potential, he cannot be called "one of the worst." However, seeing how all this potential is lost, this is a really big blow to this film. In general, this is not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> There is a very gothic waiting scene when our hero is shackled in a dungeon and faces a mad and leprous rotting bride decorated with a tattered wedding dress. It was creepy and disturbing when I first saw the horror in this scene. Man, I wish it was the best movie! <br /> <br /> This film had everything it needed to make it a sullen night chiller, but in the end it took all the wrong turns. I suggest someone to redo this.
