This film was supposed to be much better than it was. Christopher Eccleston is a great actor, but even he could not save this story about a young woman who is looking for the truth about the death of his sister. Spoiler warning: in fact, the truth is that the older sister (played by Diaz) is just a spoiled, selfish and shallow girl who took too many drugs. Not very cool and not so interesting. The film is also overloaded with too many memories and voices, and it lacks a dramatic pace. In general, it is definitely worth skipping - not recommended.
