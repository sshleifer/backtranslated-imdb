Oh, there are a lot of the worst films of Wayne. This film is edited badly, but it has an element that makes watching it enjoyable. The villain is an English-speaking actor who wears funny Mexican clothes and influences a stunning Mexican accent that is cheerful. The girl is dressed as a wannabe Jean Harlow, after all, it's 1934. At least, these pictures are beautiful and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Watch and laugh. Do not expect a serious western, but rather an easy and superficial story with a bad acting game, but occasionally flashing humor in the camp. Wayne is almost ridiculously young and handsome, and his acting skills blossomed years after this regrettable enterprise.
