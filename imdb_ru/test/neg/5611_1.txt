This film had such great potential to be fun, but at the same time touching, but not one or the other. He had a great storyline, but it wasn’t as good as it could have been. Strange "hallucinations" during his sleepy scenes had absolutely no meaning and were definitely not needed, they had no effect and did not improve or did not give any understanding of what was going to happen or happen. <br /> <br /> John Heder's character was fine, but could be extended to more. He played that crappy role that he was given at his best. The character was funny, but, again, it did not match what could be. <br /> <br /> Mila’s character was flawless, and her performance was up to par. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the writing was awful and most often did not make sense, and his hallucinations did not correspond to the film at all. This film, with the best scenarios and directing, could become a contender for “Vacation in the National Lamp”, if you consider that it is funny and bad to travel to America. <br /> <br /> Instead, he was worthy of a second flash. If I saw this in the theater, I would demand to return my money and boycott the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film did was spend an hour and a half of my life. He also managed to make everyone who participated in the film look bad, simply because the film was smelly. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie to anyone! Ever!
