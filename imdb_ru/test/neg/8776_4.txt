I liked this film when it first came out (but then I was only 12 years old - and I forgot that this film exists, until one day I found a used copy for sale at a gas station. I bought it and could not wait to watch this movie, which I loved as a child, and then, when I saw this film again many years later, it struck me ... Why in the world I liked this film as a child, when I watched it as an adult I realized that this film was terrible. in this film - that they had everything to create the greatest western, and they look at him Wali !!! The costumes are beautiful, good actors, there are 2 musical scores in the orchestral score, this is wonderful, and it keeps the classic spirit of the old temporary Lone Ranger alive, the second score is a series of country music songs such as Merle Haggerd, and The Statler Brothers and songs such as "The Man in the Mask" are so Bad that they are funny. In this film, the strongest point is that he had Briliant Storyline and one of the best in the West. someday, and for some time, it is interesting to watch John Reed return to health after he and his fellow rangers were ambushed. It's nice to see how he grows into his new life and personality as a Lone Ranger, how he conceives his personality, and goes to revenge to get responsible for the murder of his brother and all his fellow rangers with whom he rode. But unfortunately, no matter how good the storyline was, Merle Haggard ruined everything. Telling everything that you watch what is happening (for God's sake, why did they do it?) Between "The Story of Merle Haggard" and "Brothers-Statler", singing trivially (stupidly) songs like "Ride little cowboy" playing in the background , make this film impossible to take seriously. I would really like a really good producer to take the same script and story and re-make this film correctly, because this great film is based on a great western. - I would describe this film as a dress of a beautiful woman in the ugliest clothes. I give him 4 stars out of 10 - if you are 12 years old and you donâ€™t know better, then you will like it.
