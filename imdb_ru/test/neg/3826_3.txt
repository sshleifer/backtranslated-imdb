Tim Kerry was the reason I wanted to watch this film, and, although its appearance is always interesting, it is mostly wasted. The rest of the cast is not very good either, in this remake of the early zombie film, which has extremely graphic effects that are completely unnecessary. I will quote a popular axiom, sometimes less means more.
