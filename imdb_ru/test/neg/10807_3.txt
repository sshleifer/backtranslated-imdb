Now I watched it when it first came out on VHS, and all my friends and I thought it was a pretty good movie, but again, we were teenagers. But to be honest, not that good movie in retrospect. Metallic hair metal, dokken version Carnival of Souls. But a bad movie doesn't mean you can't see it; however, this does not seem to be enough charm, which is usually found in the usual Mst3k feed. But if it was on cable, and I was bored and I drank beer - of course, I would watch it again. But then again, I've watched Howling VII five times already, so maybe you really shouldn't listen to me. <br /> <br /> Someone else thinks it's sad that the director allegedly commented on this movie? And why did he so strongly feel the desire to use capital letters?
