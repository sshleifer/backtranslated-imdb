You just can't touch NRFPTP! The new crop is just awful. Jokes are not funny. Some troupes make me want to stop watching TV all together. Lorne - you let your creation go to the toilet. Guests are sometimes good, groups are mostly rubbish. On weekends, Seth should tell viewers when to laugh ..... Seth will receive a proper reception at a Baghdad cafe, though ... Make sure Andy goes with him ... There are only about 10 jokes in the show, and they just keep rephrasing them over and over. Even segments that are clearly not funny. Insulting people has become the name of the game, but they can't even do it right. Just a shame. I'm so disappointed with what happened to the show, but now I also know that itâ€™s safe to go out on Saturday night!
