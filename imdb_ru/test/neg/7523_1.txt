The time machine is fine. He works in real time for 96 minutes, but it looked like 96 years. The first 20 minutes were completely redundant. A huge amount of "dead" time in everything. What happened? When will anything happen? What's the difference? Obviously, the film was made with a limited budget, I will note for your edification the following: “Morlocks”: nothing but save some money by reusing the scenery and costumes from Part I of the Lord of the Rings, eh The “scary dude” in charge of the control of the Morlohs ... The most terrible thing these guys could have thought was someone in one of Gene Simmons: (from the Kiss group) old suits ??? A little known fact: fans of the future have perfectly groomed nails. <br /> <br /> Save your money, save your time. Go through this.
