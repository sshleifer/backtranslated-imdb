I really hate and despise this film and the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Of course, I am for having made a strong and honest film about youth and youth culture. The 1987 River's Edge is a great example of a well-made teen drama. However, I object to the infantile, dirty, and sensational approach that the creators of 2:37 used. <br /> <br /> A striking example is how he raises so many questions and yet fails in any significant way to comment or come to a decision even on one of them. <br /> <br /> My other main problem with this film, besides his complete plagiarism of “Elephant” Guus Van Santa (surprised by Sant Sant did not sue) is his attitude to freedom in the china shop to rather delicate issues such as incest and especially suicide. <br /> <br /> In short, avoid this film like the plague and everything that this director has ever been associated with. I heard that his motivation to do 2:37 may or may not be based on lies. Seeing a poor-quality result, it did not surprise me at all. This is a famous student film, in which there is no place in the movie or on DVD. Clean and simple.
