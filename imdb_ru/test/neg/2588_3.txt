I have to watch it without a commercial break, and let me tell you, even for a television movie it was pretty predictable. The actors coped with what they had and the cast was quite successful - Barry Bostwick, Jane Seymour, Francis Fisher, etc. However, the script was not only predictable (except for the last scene), but the dialogue was capricious and sounded like as if it was removed from the third novel. Jane Seymour's psychotic monologues were ridiculous. Sorry, but I find it hard to believe that someone so dreadful would have any suspicion. As bad as Theresa Russell was in The Black Widow — and she, of course, was stunned — she, at least, had the sense to play her pseudo-symbols a little straight. Seymour is a much better actress, but she has not overcome the material here. <br /> <br /> Finally, the music is incredibly stupid. It's almost a satire of its genre, like the fall of Kenny G. A film with such a dull and derivative script really had to become something sharper.
