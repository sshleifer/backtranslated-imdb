I had high hopes for this movie, I even refused to watch the Stargate night for this movie. I found that it was hastily, and many key biblical moments and facts were missing. I might have been a bit exhausted and spoiled for the 1956 version, since I’ve watched it every year for the past 20 years or so. I doubt that this will go into the sphere of the annual classics, like the other. If you haven’t seen the 19546 version yet, you may like it, but I seriously doubt it and urge you to skip this version and rent or buy the classic one. It has some graceful special effects, but that's not what I'm looking for, telling the movie like the Ten Commandments. I kind of watched them tell the story, and the authors did not cope with this work.
