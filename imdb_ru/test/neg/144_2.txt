I somehow managed to go through the whole movie, but I was stunned by the complete lack of entertainment. Me and my friends are fans of the movie HK, but WOW. This film has everything, and I mean everything that should not be in the film. Underdeveloped and stereotypical characters, excessive replaying, silly special effects, talking robots, at least 20 double jumps, impossible situations, unfriendly "jokes" and "jokes", a prerequisite for elementary school, mindless murders and much more. - long work time for the material. Add to this the fact that Gen-X Cops was a worthy film, and this film becomes even harder to endure. Simply put, if you are interested in watching this movie ... don't.
