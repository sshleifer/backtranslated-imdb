First I have to say that I donâ€™t really like fantastic movies! But there are some films that I really liked. This is one of the others;) I have the same opinion as some (most) here. The film is still going on in my back, but several effects are actually not enough to watch all this time ... I think they did well, these are animated landscapes with 3 suns and 4 moons, but this is the only thing I liked. There are no intellectual dialogues (is there any ???). But this is a great movie for anyone who loves Lara Croft or some other girls in HOT-PANTS ...;) <br /> <br /> For directors: "Stop trying again, PLEASE !!!"
