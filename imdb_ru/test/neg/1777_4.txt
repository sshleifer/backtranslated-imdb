Stinger starts "3 months ago" on the SS "Newark" submarine, where genetic experiments failed, and a member of the crew was brutally murdered by major scorpion-killers ... Jump into Camp Pendleton a couple of months later, where General Ashford (James Kagnard) Lieutenant Williams (John Miranda) from a briefing on his mission of landing in Newark and assisting genetic scientist Dr. Carly Ryan (Michelle Meadows) before anyone finds out about this, a group of corporate scientists and marines is aboard Newark and shocked, discovering that he is an izuro Dovd team corpses, except Dr. Mike Thompson (Casey Clark), which does not make much sense. This is just before the scorpion attacks, first lieutenant Williams should fall, so Sergeant Sam Harmon (Christopher Persson) is promoted and takes responsibility for ensuring that everyone is safe and forever put an end to the threat of giant scorpions ... <br /> <br /> This co-production in Swedish America was directed by Martin Mount, he was also involved in cinematography, and I thought that this was an absolutely incalculable feature of creatures. This is the beginning of the new year, and Stinger is the first giant monster / creature / insect film that I saw in 2007. I hope that everything will be just better ... The script of Mata Nastos is incredibly cliché and gets everything you need. ideas from other films, above all “Aliens” (1986), let's see if there is an isolated place in which there is a submarine, there is a team of marines hastily assembled, including one who chews on a cigar throughout the film, there are scientists, including a blonde swedish one, to try to explain all this, and the nasty money that seized the corporate villain who puts a mighty dollar above human life, and the last ingredient is a monster / alien / insect or something else case around ba AET many large scorpions, but they are not used in any unique or creative way, so that they could be grasshoppers killer. Yes, it's all here, unfortunately, Stinger is not an alien, if you know what I mean. This long touch is more than 100 minutes, and it is quite predictable, although it moves at a reasonable pace, and as a feature of a dumb creature, you can do worse, despite what many say about IMDb ... <br /> <br /> Director Munte doesn’t distinguish himself, it’s not scary, there’s not enough atmosphere, and the fighting scenes are boring and uninteresting. There aren't many scorpion attacks, and it's almost an hour before any significant action happens, special effects are at the bottom of the scale, but I've seen the worst, that's for sure. I mean, you can't say that the effects in Stinger are good, but I have seen worse. There is not much blood and blood there, there are mutilated bodies, decapitated heads and someone torn in half. The only clever and funny moment in the whole film is when a naked Swedish woman scientist asks her lover to turn on her, telling about all the money they are going to make from scorpions ... However, there was a moment when I moaned and tore my hair into stupidity when a guy is trying to fix the submarine's circuit and make the light work by hitting the power supply / computer boards with a hammer, and it also works ... <br /> <br /> Technically, Stinger is average at best, and there is a usual infinite amount of dark corridors which become monotonous. Stinger was shot dead in Stockholm in Sweden, if you're interested. The acting was bad and there is nothing more to say. <br /> <br /> Stinger is not a very good movie and not a very good horror movie, I cannot recommend it at all, but I have seen worse. If you liked Stinger (unlikely), you might like “giant scorpions at liberty” with a similar theme: “Tail's sting” (2001) or “Scorpion Giantus” (2006) (also unlikely).
