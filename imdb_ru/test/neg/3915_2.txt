I never heard of this movie until I caught it on TV last night. I really hope that he was never released in the cinema, as this would be an insult to movie screens and movie lovers. <br /> <br /> It had to be serious, it had to be funny? Why insanely simple plot? Anyone care? ... <br /> <br /> Horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
