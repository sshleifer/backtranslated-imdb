Mississippi's Siren, Francois Trafoe, had a flimsy plot. The script required too much elasticity in a hover of unbelief. The plot took place at a glacial pace. It all started in an interesting setting, but soon moved to the shoals of melodrama, which lacked logic or intelligence. What did the critics think? This one is overvalued even to be described as a loser. Even Catherine Deneuva, who is fascinated by Cherbourg's Umbrellas and Belle Doe Jour, just managed to annoy. <br /> <br /> We rented this film at the same time that we were shooting another Trafo film. We first watched this movie and found that it was so bad that we sent another one back at the same time.
