Of course, it's hard to be gay, especially in the south. We get it. Again and again. <br /> <br /> What stands out is that the filmmakers almost completely focused on the more “extreme” characters in these small gay bars of the city; the transvestites, the wretched scumbag of a long-closed bar and the guy who was brutally murdered for being gay, but had nothing to do with any of the bars that were in the center of this film. /> There were fragments of interviews from other people to whom viewers could perhaps relate better. But they were shaded, almost missed, perhaps they seemed to glimpse in the background. <br /> <br /> It would be more interesting, at least for me, to hear the experience of more common gays and women who were enriched or otherwise experienced by a gay bar in a small town and / or lack of this community.
