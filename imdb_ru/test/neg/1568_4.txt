George and Mildred are a really unfunny movie. This attempt to translate a successful series on the big screen, as often happens, failed. <br /> <br /> The wit and ingenuity from the TV show is gone. The plot is a typical English farce of confused characters and erroneous personalities, which is neither funny enough nor strange enough to cause a lot of decent laughter. <br /> <br /> Ruthless George and Mildred fans may want to see this latest episode from the coupleâ€™s output (Mildred died of hepatitis before the movie was released), but others should spend their time more intelligently.
