Wow, this movie was terrible. It is so simple. In fact, this is the first time I left early, as I recall. Although everything turned out well: I chatted very well with the two most charming girls, while we all waited until the others finally gave up the nonsense they called the “film”. <br /> <br /> Where to start, Bad behavior, bad jokes. Fecal humor, which I just can not stand. Sorry, but snot, urine and ramp * are not * ridiculous. Have you seen the title picture? This scene actually lasts about 5 minutes, when two “heroes” beat and maim each other, which in itself should be funny. This is not true. <br /> <br /> Not to mention body fluids, violence and disguise, I don’t remember much about it. At least not very good. I was very, very disappointed with this piece of trash. Or let's be honest: considering that I’m actually a big fan of "British" (that is, black) humor, I was angry. <br /> <br /> So, you want to consult? Three words: do not look.
