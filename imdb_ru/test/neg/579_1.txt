I'm a big fan of Robert Taylor, and I tried to find all of his films. I didn't have that, but I recently watched it on the Fox Movie Channel and was very disappointed. I know that he was a contract player and almost did not control his scripts, but the game was just as bad as the script. Victor McLaughlin was even bad, and Brian Donlevi was almost unrecognizable. Considering the relationship behind the scenes between Taylor and Stanwyk, it was amazing how little chemistry was on the screen between the two of them. But the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the US president ordered the navy to secretly leave the service in order to track down the bank robbers and report only to the president that it was difficult for him to evaluate anything else about the film. The scenes on death row were completely motionless. The only thing worse than Taylor's acting is the singing of Stanwick. She later became better at the Ball of Fire.
