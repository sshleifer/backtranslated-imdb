The film was terrible. The production company must pay a penalty for the loss of electricity by passing this nonsense. <br /> <br /> There were too many holes on the plot. Why should the Ministry of Justice send the killer to kill the world leader? If they were not the Ministry of Justice, why would they send someone who they thought would not do the job? To quote Butch Cassidy: “Who are these guys?” Apparently, the director doesn't know either, because he never told us. <br /> <br /> The characters were incredible. They did not behave in such a way as to correspond to who they were supposed to be. With the exception of the doctor, none of the characters were particularly convincing or likable. <br /> <br /> If you want to spend money on electricity needed to watch this movie, do not hesitate. Otherwise, run in the opposite direction.
