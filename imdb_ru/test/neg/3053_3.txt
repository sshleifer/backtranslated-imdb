Do you know why? Because they thought (or, at least, made horror fans think) that a group of disgusting, dirty, screaming teenagers, some kind of silly demons (where do they come from? What is their purpose? Who knows?) And the dark mansion is all you need to make a horror movie. Needless to say, they were wrong. You also need a script, some logic, some rules, and a little ingenuity. This film has one scene that fits his reputation (lipstick scene, of course), and a couple of funny moments (brother’s brother’s brother’s description of his mother’s cookies, “don't look at me” scene by Linnie Quigley). It also has more profanity than any movie I've watched since I last watched Reservoir Dogs. Literally every fourth or fifth word is “f ***” or “b ****”. On the other hand, when a movie begins with FOUR false fears in the first 5 minutes, you do not expect anything like good filmmaking. (* 1/2)
