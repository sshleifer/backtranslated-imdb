It is a waste of time, talent, and shelf space. What big leagues like Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Dan Aykroyd spend their time on such garbage? The petty criminal Reeves comes to the wedding of his brothers (Vincent D'Onofrio) and eventually leaves with the bride. Comedy? Thriller? Romance? I honestly do not know! Reeves is wooden at the head, and Dan Aykroyd in the role of a policeman is so terrible that you have to believe it! Only a bright spot from a dark dark tunnel is Diaz, and even it is not so good. Rent something else. everyone who is involved in this disorder should hold their heads in complete shame and hunt to get lost in the coming years.
