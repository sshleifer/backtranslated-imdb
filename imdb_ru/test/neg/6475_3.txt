Chris Ricci goes through most of this, but then quickly takes on the appearance of boredom and contempt - just like I did when I watched it. Without her, it would be just a cheap children's film, but at least she would add quality. In business, few, if any, brighter and more charismatic young actresses. <br /> <br /> There’s nothing to worry about if you take it for what it is - a cheap Disney design aimed at very undemanding children. I could watch Ricci all day, so I’m probably not paying attention to the many drawbacks of the film, but if you're not a Ricci fan, cat lover or a very small child either, I doubt that you will find it very interesting.
