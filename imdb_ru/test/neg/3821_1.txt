I read the latest comments and could not wait to see the movie. However, after 80 minutes of predictable "surprises" that did not even make me jump and the unreal villain, I was very disappointed. I thought the cartoons were the only films that lasted just 80 minutes. I thought it might be because of the changes that made it an “R” rating, but the original contained only ten minutes of Kill Bill blood. When blood spills out like hoses, reality loses its appeal. Add a killer who should be a ghost, but can tear someone's head off the jaw (ala King Kong with T-Rex), experience everything and have an ending that looks like a soprano final, and you are quite possible. I have the most bloated movie for the last year. After watching the film, I felt that I had seen countless films with the same plot and method, and also felt mostly unsatisfied. I don't know what everyone else saw in him, but if you want a good horror movie this weekend, watch Halloween, it is definitely worth $ 10. When it comes to the hatchet, let's hope that the next one is based on the Book.
