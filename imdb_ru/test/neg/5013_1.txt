This film was on paid channels today, and I had nothing to do, so I shot it. It must be the worst football movie ever made. It must be one of the worst periods of the movie. Premium service in the cable system has a rating system, and they gave 2 stars out of 4. This film is not even a half star. Bad behavior, Scott Bakula is drowning as usual, Larry Miller ?? Sinbad, could not act if he tried. One Rob Schneider liner is completely smelly. Fred Thompson should be embarrassed that he was even in this film. The only saving grace of this film was the hope that you would see Katie Ireland naked in the shower, even close. A complete waste of time and film. If we could give a negative number, minus 9.
