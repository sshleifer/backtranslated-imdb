This film is boring, boring, boring, boring and boring! This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, on the contrary, but ....... how to express it ....... it's boring! There are some very nice landscapes and some clever dry mind, but that is all. If it were advertised as a travel film, I would rate it as 7, but it must be a movie with a plot, some drama and, for God's sake, a point or a satisfactory conclusion. <br /> <br /> I read comments on this forum about these films, and I was wondering if they had seen the same movie as me. <br /> <br /> Watch this film (yawn) at your own peril and risk ........ one thing for sure - this is really rated correctly = G RATING! (Which most means GOD, AWFULLY, BORILNO!)
