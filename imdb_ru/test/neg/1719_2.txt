Incredible and extremely budgetary science fiction without charm and appeal. Even scenes related to the fall of asteroids are stolen from other films with the same plot. This is just a bad robbery of Asteroid (with Annabela Skyore) and Deep Strike (with Morgan Freeman) Mr Hopper seems eager to elude this senseless and boring science fiction. <br /> <br /> I give it 2 (two). And do not say that I am not a good guy!
