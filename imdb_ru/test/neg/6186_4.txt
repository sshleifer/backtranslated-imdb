Coltrane and Idle are members of a bank robbery gang who cross their leader twice during the robbery. They hide in the women's school and disguise themselves to avoid being detected by the crowd and the police. A lot of Catholic humor and farce, but the script is quite subtle, like laughter. Although there is a good scene in the shower ... on a scale of one to ten.
