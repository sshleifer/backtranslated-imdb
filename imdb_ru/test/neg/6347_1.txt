One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Absolutely funny. The story is bad. Animations are completely childish and biased. The physics of holograms are hilarious on how completely wrong they are. Oh dear, I even want to believe that there is a Disney label on this film. Ugh. The actresses are somewhat beautiful, but there are so many good films with amazing actresses who are much more valuable to see than this one. Last note, bad movie. Do not worry to watch this. If you are looking for movies to watch with children, think about other alternatives, such as Ratattuile, Monster Inc or Enchanted Story (in theaters). Seriously.
