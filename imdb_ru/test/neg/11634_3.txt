Two years after Brad Brown left the small town of Grover Bend because of a meeting with the Cretans, he returns to spend time with his grandmother on Easter. Meanwhile, Krite eggs begin to hatch. Because they create problems in the city, Brown and the townspeople, as well as alien bounty hunters who have returned to kill the creatures, must fight the bloodthirsty balls before they destroy the city. <br /> <br /> The original animal was a minor attempt to thwart the Gremlins family horror film. It became a cult favorite on the shelves of the video and was successful enough to warrant continuation. This sequel underestimates the horror and makes all his focus comedy instead. Unfortunately, the comedic part is very clumsy, as well as children. The acting game is on par with the rest of the film. Just the film suffers from a weak script. The visual effects are pretty well done. <br /> <br /> Rating: D + Review by M.K. Geist.
