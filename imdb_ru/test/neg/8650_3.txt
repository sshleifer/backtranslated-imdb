This film is very modern and direct. This is about 75% in English. It targets a multilingual English-speaking audience. The main plot is similar to DDLJ. The action is below average. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they depict the wrong picture and set a bad example for young people. In the film, Tanisha drinks from a bottle or removes tequila about 5-6 times. The director does not even recognize that she is an alcoholic and she has problems with alcohol. Throughout the film, she wears only a bikini, at work, on the beach or at a wedding. The heroine of the film that does this makes young people feel that this behavior is acceptable. <br /> <br /> The less said about the failure of Uday Chopra, who plays the role of Shah Rukh Khan as an arrogant pursuer, the better. A film about gender equality. But equality should not be about making the same mistakes, but about doing the right things. If men are shown in films as chronic Casanova, this does not mean that women should also portray the same behavior. <br /> <br /> In spite of the fact that the film was shot in a cheerful and merry spirit, it promotes many wrong social ideas in society. the name "forward", this "fun" part of the film has no effect. Even in Canada, women don't dress like this, or guys behave like they did in the film. This, of course, is not a reflection of Indian society or even Canadian society. Perhaps in the beginning they should have a disclaimer stating that “All the characters and events in the film are imaginary and do not reflect the actual culture of the cities and countries mentioned in the film.” The only good thing about this movie is the duration of 1.5 hours, thank goodness.
