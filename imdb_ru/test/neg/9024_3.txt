John Wayne's most loyal fans will cringe when they watch The Lawless Border. Even for a studio from poor families, this is one of the strangest. <br /> <br /> Unusually for a western, we have a sex offender. Earl Dwair is playing half white and Indian, who, for reasons that are not explained, pretend to be Mexican, hockey accent and all that. Dwair sounds like Frito Bandito from that day's advertising fame. <br /> <br /> He and his gang meet with Gabby Hayes and his daughter Sheila Terry. They really have nothing to rob, but Dwire just wants an excuse to kidnap Terry and end her. She hears the mean fate that she expects, and she and Hayes flee from the ranch. <br /> <br /> Where do they meet John Wayne, who follows the gangsterâ€™s trail. They also face one very stupid sheriff, who considers Wayne to be one of the bandits. Again, for reasons that I can not understand. <br /> <br /> It was a difficult way for the Duke to earn a living for ducal operas like this. Fortunately, the best things were on the way.
