If the film can't interest you for the first 25 minutes, it's all over for me. This concept that you just need to deal with the slow first third of the film, and then receive a reward is nonsense. A good movie should start and end strong. All this seems interesting and a few decent shots and promising, but in the end confusing and irrelevant. There are many other films from Asia that I can watch, many of which, I’m sure, most of you haven’t yet seen, that I would actually miss this one and look elsewhere. Why do I need at least 10 lines to view IMDb? I said my part and hope this will help some of you move on to the next movie.
