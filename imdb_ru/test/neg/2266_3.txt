As everyone knows, no one can play Scarlett O'Hara as Vivien Leigh, and no one can play Rhett Butler as Clark Gable. Everyone else pales in comparison, and Timothy Dalton and Joan Wally are no exception. One thing I really couldn't get through was that Joanne had BROWN eyes. Green eyes were the most attractive feature of Scarlett's appearance, and in this continuation she was deprived of these. <br /> <br /> In the film, as in the book, there were several sleeping ones. New characters were not so memorable, and I found that I forgot who is who. I felt that her trip to Ireland did absolutely nothing. Maybe I am only 11, but I did not see any changes in her attitude until the last word, 10 minutes, when Rhett told her that she had grown up. If Rhett had not told her about this, I would never have guessed that something had changed in her attitude. She really loved Kat, her baby. She likes this child the most because she was with Rett, her only beloved husband. However, if you read Gone with the Wind, you would see that children have no meaning in the Scarlett world. <br /> <br /> Frankly speaking, it seemed to me that too much was happening without Rett. All who care is whether Rett and Scarlett return, and Scarlett took too long to get to that. This is practically nothing compared to Gone With the Wind, but again, what is not? If you read the novel, you will like it more than the film. <br /> <br /> I would see it simply because it is a continuation of Gone with the Wind, regardless of whether it is worth it. This may not satisfy you completely, but will help you with this.
