If you are in the mood for very bad porn, without good porn combined with a very bad horror movie, this movie is perfect for you. However, if you breathe air, make sure that you spend time watching anything other than that. Play shit. The “plot” is crappy. They try their best, and all the time I have been waiting for one good buyout scene that can make the film worth seeing. Nope Stick scrambled cable.
