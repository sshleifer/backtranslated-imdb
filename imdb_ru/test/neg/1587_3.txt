(Spoilers) "Cash Crop" goes something like this. Farmers living in trouble grow a pot to make ends meet. A DEA agent is blowing into the city. Farmers are hiding the pot. A DEA agent is leaving the city. The end of the story. <br /> <br /> This film shows the solid actions of some second-tier actors, mediocre directing and so-called screenplay ... but he has no story. And since the story is the foundation of every drama, “Cash Crop” is a total failure. Too boring to recommend.
