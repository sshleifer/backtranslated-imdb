I do not understand a lot of good reviews here. I found wonderful photos and scenery, and the two main actors are attractive, but there was little to recommend this film. Fake southern accents and poorly written dialogue are the most annoying. This is not like real people to me. While it is nice to show that men explore various forms of sexuality without the usual labeling and stereotypical character traits, most of the story has no motivation or logic. The only thing that makes a lot of sense is the responsibility Griffith feels towards her mentally ill aunt, for whom Karen Black was lucky. Lee is an interesting character who would be more convincing if the dialogue he was talking about was more natural, and his motivation was clearer. Yes, I understand that he is a vagabond, but his actions in the film are not long in coming. This film is worth seeing, mainly because it has a pleasant atmosphere, but it is slow and deeply flawed. Serious rewriting and better editing might have saved it, since the premise and outline of the story are promising.
