New Orleans is nothing like the way he is portrayed in this <br /> <br /> movie. Quaidâ€™s attempt to speak with God's accent <br /> <br /> (by the way, hardly anyone says so in New Orleans) is terrible. The plot = elementary and meaningless. This picture <br /> <br /> calls itself a mystery, but the riddle involves a gradual process by which the viewer is given hints and turns throughout the film. There is nothing of this. "Big <br /> <br /> Easy" is trying to circumvent the banal stereotypes of New Orleans. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled - the real Big Easy is nothing but a city <br /> <br /> through which Quaid and Barkin make their way.
