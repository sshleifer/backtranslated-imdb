This is a remarkable attempt for the first time by the creator of the film Ham Tran, who offers a not too attentive look at the victims of the Vietnam War who are fighting for liberation, but presenting themselves as glorified history. With an awkward, self-consciously informative dialogue and ineffective action, even a relatively impressive budget with attention to detail will not be able to implement this sagging, albeit historically worthy, melodrama. Ignoring the often distracting separation from the actors to the reality of the situations on the screen, and you should stay with an informative, albeit somewhat impersonal educational lesson in the post-war history of Vietnam.
