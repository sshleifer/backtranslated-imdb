Red glasses <br /> <br /> I liked Avalon, I think this director made some amazing insane visions of the future. This film however was dull pretentious nonsense. The opening scene showed a big promise for the cover and description promising a surreal live action amimae style in the future noir. I feel I got it with Avalon. <br /> <br /> With the “Red Spectacles” I felt uncomfortable, striving for what the hell. The film hardly made sense to me, and I didn't give a damn about the people in it. Everything would be fine if the film were effective art. While the initial scene looked interesting, and the scene with a giant man in a robot costume holding a giant machine gun in the rain, looked cool, she did not watch the movie, which is worth watching.
