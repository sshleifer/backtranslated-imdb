I took it because, after spending time in the Albany area in New York, I knew a couple of people in the film, and I accidentally stumbled upon it. Attempts to comedy are not convincing, the obligatory scene “girl on girl” is disgusting, the plot is missing, the acting is one of the worst I've ever seen, and don't even get me into special effects. I understand that this is a very budget film made by a small independent company, but if you are going to make a sci-fi horror film with huge mistakes, do not make huge mistakes absolutely unbelievable. People want to see giant bugs. This is half the fun right here. And if you're going to make giant bugs absolutely incredible, at least get the actors to make some kind of mocking hint at this fact ("You are idiots! It's not them! You captured their trick" doubles! "). Be ready to spend two hours with your lives that you can never bring back.
