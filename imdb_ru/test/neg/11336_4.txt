This series, created for Televisión Española (TVE), is mainly a series of chapters from the life of an ordinary family in 1968, primarily through the eyes of a younger son. <br /> <br /> On the basis of historical events, such as the student uprising in May 1968 in France, the collapsing Franco regime, the war in Vietnam, the rise of imperialism and others specifically related to Spanish life at that particular moment, we can consider this a series of simple selections of characteristic weaknesses that are so vividly manifested in this kind of entertainment. <br /> <br /> As a rule, in an easy way, although some moments are missing, which can be called dramatic, the series seems to be aimed at people. of the approximately fifty who can recall those times, because, as it should be said, any junior either prefers to ignore such events, or is busy with other things. <br /> <br /> The best thing to say about this series is the role of Ana Duato as a mother of three children: she really well plays the role of a housewife of that time, demonstrating that particular Spanish inclination, which is especially noticeable among women, to allow all her thinking and your actions move forward with your heart, without resorting to the use of the brain. As we say in Spain, common sense is one of the least common sense. Imanol Arias offers very little, except that he is no ordinary stereotypical policeman, as in other television series. Indeed, as an actor, he should not trust anything other than television series. Its resources are too limited; however, his role as father in the family of the working class is not at all bad. <br /> <br /> Not very recommended for a different audience, even for Spanish speakers in Latin America: the topics are too narrowly linked to a specific place in contemporary Spanish history, such that if the viewer did not live here at the time, he will miss most of the links. It is even possible that certain situations that cause a few Spanish smiles will mean nothing to other viewers.
