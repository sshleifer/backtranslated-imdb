To begin with, I once met a director when he was going to reconstruct the Second World War with a historic movie camera and made a video about events that looked BLACK good. I really would like him to continue this. Because, no matter how much I applauded what he had achieved with an obviously “almost nothing” budget, when I was uploading a DVD, I just wondered why I sat for almost two hours without work. There is no real story about which you can talk, you do not care what happens to the characters (perhaps Italian troops and some Germans), and the ending is another comment from the “feature film” about the futility of war. I could tell someone how this will end as soon as I walk the first ten minutes. I knew that the Germans would have several heroic volunteers who would fight to the death, I knew that most of the Quartmaster soldiers would be killed, it was too damn obvious! And while I am on the subject, I was shocked to see that most of the Axis side was done well, yet the GI side did it ridiculously. All character development was clearly for non-English-speaking roles. In this film, GI just suffered a lot. And I can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works? Phrases, terminology, actions were written by someone who was completely unaware of the American military. If I now knew who directed this film, I would swear that it was shot and written by a German ...
