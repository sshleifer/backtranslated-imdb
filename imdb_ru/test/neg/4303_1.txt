Ed Wood is driving again. The fact that this film was shot should inspire hope to any aspiring director <br /> <br />. Any script you could use to <br /> <br /> level the litter box or birdcage shouldn't seem so bad now. Do not watch this movie if you do not have a cache with Tylenol or Rolaids. Watching this film <br /> <br /> made me realize that Boa vs. Python is not so bad. It would probably be better to make this film in Claymation, since at least no actor would have to take responsibility for participating in this film. It is clear why this director has so many pseudonyms. There is a good side to watching this movie: if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips, you can eat a way out of a cocoon of cheese around you, which will allow you <br /> <br /> to direct it to the cocoon of your TV surrounds him.
