"Do you have any beans?" Beans are good. You just eat them and go. ” I could not help laughing at this dialogue. You know, beans is a musical fruit. The more you eat them, the more money you have, money. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... Well, I can understand why the actors participated in this, because they needed salaries to pay their bills, but I'm not very sure what the intentions of the director and writer were. Even after watching a DVD documentary. <br /> <br /> Mike Rucker gave an idea he really didn’t deserve. I have seen him in other films MUCH better than this one. What would greatly improve this film would be to throw it all out, save Rooker and instead make another entry in the Substitution franchise. Rucker would make a terrific substitute teacher who will teach mischievous and morally weak youth to the fallacy of their actions and how they can become more useful and productive members of society. <br /> <br /> Casper, you really shouldn’t just push the undergrowth in such a way that you can get poisonous oak. Oops. Nevermind. I think poison oak now bothers you the least. Well, at least this time your croaking was not done by the tail of a giant python. There are a few things that are more embarrassing than piercing the chest with a giant snake. At the very least, the death scene in this film had a bit more dignity. As well as a more liberal spreading of karo syrup and red food coloring. Nothing says sad and tragic death, like the liberal use of caro and red paint! <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw a monster in a shiny raincoat made of artificial silk with a fur collar. For the first time in all, I think. Just to be picky, though, if it was an Indian ghost, why did he look like a monster from European culture and folklore? Wouldn't the monster be more Indian? <br /> <br /> Although I watched all this until the end, I do not believe that I could recommend it in good faith to others. ,
