I admit that this is not a very good movie. He practically screams "low budget", but, oddly enough, I still liked the film because, although it was not of high quality, it was full of energy. It was like a Little Engine That Could, and the film merged into one! <br /> <br /> The film unfolds in one of the radio networks and concerns some of their low-level employees - two-page boys (one very energetic and defiant, and the other abnormal), as well as a new administrator. All three have a vision of a radio star, but now they must be content with their modest work. <br /> <br /> Murder appears in this story, which seems completely unexpected. I did not know that it was a murder mystery film, and I was caught off guard. However, like most b-secrets, the cops are settling tanks, and our persistent hero (Moran) must try to save this day. Throughout this, it was hard for me to decide whether Moran was nasty or cute. I'm still not sure !! <br /> <br /> There is a moment in the film when it comes to the “deterrent”, and that’s when two pages try to play the role of radio-mediators. They appear with a black face and imitate Amos n 'Andy of 3rd or 4th level. Besides being very insensitive, it was also not funny. Fortunately, the producer of the show on which they tried seemed to feel the same. <br /> <br /> Overall. This movie is easy to miss, and I would not blame you if you do. However, the strange and frenetic tempo of the film actually seemed to fill the film’s artistic flaws, and I'm glad I saw it. Good film? Not. But the one that is still worth seeing for lovers of old bbc. <br /> <br /> By the way, maybe I just don't have very good taste, but I thought that BOTH female singing divas really had bad voices despite the fact that everyone in the film was captivated by their own melodies. Listen yourself and let me know what you think. I just could not believe that anyone was allowed to sing at the cinema - even if it was only for the lowly Monogram Studios.
