I bought the video for £ 13 at HMV (we pay more in the UK) because my friend told me that it was highly appreciated and the reviews on this site were generally impressive. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the opening credits were a disappointment ... dancing / music is not very powerful. <br /> <br /> Driving a car and an unexpected accident at the moment when the injured woman was harmed was a pleasant touch ... something unexpected ... although how she left the car with her well-groomed hair and still with her purse, it looked trite for most directors ... but for Lynch there was something different. <br /> <br /> Her dazed gait after such a shock was intensified by a regular low noise level, like scratching fingers along the board; I thought that another touch of the master Lynch, perhaps, portrays the demons, gnawing her shocked and injured self-consciousness. After a while, this noise became somewhat annoying, and upon further investigation, I discovered that a new video cassette had creaked. <br /> <br /> I don’t know if this squeak removed most of my pleasure, but this film was a waste of time. (and money) <br /> <br /> Two female characters had some presence, and the lesbian scenes were fairly honest, though predictable. There were no male characters of any merit, and apart from a few vaguely good scenes (including a vacuum cleaner) there were too many horrible scenes that were obviously weak and funny. For example, a formidable nutty coffee was spat on a napkin, and the face of a stupid monster in the back of a diner. Oh, what about the paint in the pearls of his wife .. boring and pile. <br /> <br /> This whole movie gives you the feeling of a failed genius ... you know, when you listen to Dylan's worst track and think, Oh my God, it was embarrassing .... was it really Bob? <br /> <br /> All this feeling of a failed television film, poorly combined with a few (not many) additional bits to give it a 15 rating. <br /> <br /> I whistled for the last 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> I will give him one more chance and look again. If I want to be perplexed and diligently understand the film, I will look at the Frank Woods Guide to consolidated accounting. <br /> <br /> Lynch made one classic .. Blue velvet and Street Storey were good. <br /> <This, like Wild at heart, was a disappointment; his oddity is now predictable and stale. Anyone want to buy second hand video? <br /> <br /> Break free from the more original original talent, David. <br /> <br /> Four out of ten (and no more). Sorry.
