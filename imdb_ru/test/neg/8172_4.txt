Ravi Chopra wrote this film 40 years ago, wanted to play Dilip Kumar in the title role. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film was rewritten and filmed in 2003, and therefore the plot looks outdated and at times too superficial <br /> <br /> As the reason why Amitabh-Khem’s division is too superficial, even the way youth is shown is too bad, like Gulshan in AVTAAR. <br /> <br /> The idea, although it goes well, but things are presented in a cliché form. Salman's character is the worst, looks straight from the storybook, while Bachchan’s climax speech is good, and the final does not forgive sons - good br /> <br /> Ravi Chopra does a good job Music is decent, Songs sung by Bachchan stand out <br /> <br /> Amitabh is excellent as always, he used to play the older stern father, but here he plays the sacrifice and well portrays her. His last speech is gorgeous, Hema is good in her role, Aman Verma Samir Soni is fine, Nasir and the rest of her sons and wives are decent, although Divya Datta is distinguished by Salman Khan Ke, Mahima is fine, Paresh and Lillet are lovely
