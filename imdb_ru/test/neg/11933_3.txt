The series finally reached an incredible level with this lousy fourth release, which was (thank God) the last one. None of the three sequels distinguished a very interesting original, but this particular film is nothing more than a shameless attempt to use the name of the Magnificent Seven and the fiery musical theme of Bernstein. Production values ​​resemble those of the film created for television, and the characters are forgotten and indistinguishable: in parts “II” and “III” you could not remember their names, here you do not even remember their faces. Lee Van Cleef was the wrong choice for the role of Chris, but no one could replace Yul Brynner in our minds anyway. Do not waste your time.
