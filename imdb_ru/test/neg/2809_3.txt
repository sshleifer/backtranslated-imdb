What a disgrace. It might be good. The main problems are the script and the star. The film cannot decide whether it will be a comedy (very boring and mundane) or insightful satire about the old East Germany and its morals. However, his attempts to completely fail. The film does not stick together, and the ending is very artificial and unbelievable. Unfortunately, any stereotypes about the German comedy are intensifying. <br /> <br /> Characters are stereotypes, and the main character, played by Kim Frank, is at least colorless. He simply cannot carry the film and seems to have been chosen mainly for his childish face. Perhaps the actor is not at fault (he is a pop singer), because the script does not give him a lot of work. <br /> <br /> One plus is the re-creation of the East German “style” and the period is good. <br /> <br /> The worst - the film looks dishonest and humiliating. It seems that the film was released by people who did not necessarily do their best and just wanted to make money quickly on a few cheap laughs. (If they tried their best, this is a really sad case!) I watched it in a cinema with an East German audience, and I felt sorry for them. The GDR regime was terrible in almost all respects, but those who survived it deserve better than this one.
