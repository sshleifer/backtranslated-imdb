The dull yawn of the film, in which nothing is preserved from the grace and constraint of its predecessor, “Golden Diggers of 1933”. The production code was firmly in place by the time this movie was released, so humor was all hockey, a kind of wocka-wocka, and the dry line-ups that sounded so cosmopolitan, dripping from the lips of the gorgeous ladies from the first film, disappeared. The cast of second-tier stars and character actors go through these movements, and the motive to “put on a show” seems terribly forced; instead of creating or destroying the world of Broadway, the show here is a charity event organized by a chic hotel. Who really cares if the show goes on? The score here is also soft. Of course, the big number in the film - “Lullaby from Broadway,” which accompanies a long fantasy-dance-style number about the possible demise of a New York socialite due to too many parties — the effect is not quite the same as the “Forgotten man "as the final 33 years. Busby Berkeley directs this film, and also puts choreography in front of him, and any promise that appears in the film’s smooth debut scenes quickly deteriorates. Unfortunately, no one learned from this, and two years later another film, Golden Diggers, appeared. <br /> <br /> Rating: C-
