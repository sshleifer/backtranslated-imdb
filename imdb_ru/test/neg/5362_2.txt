I give this nonsense 2 instead of 1, because there is an even worse show called Haunted Homes. But this guy and his buddies conduct their investigations like complete idiots. They assume that there are ghosts right from the start, and if they ever find rational explanations behind the experiences, they have to kick the drugs and scream to admit it. But beyond that, the whole format of the show is incredibly annoying. Despite the fact that a lot of this is scripted, the college-educated children who make up the cast hardly speak English, but still insist on trying to use "big" words that they clearly don't understand. And the ridiculously important voice voices of Chief Investigator Ryan make me just want to throw the TV through the window. (and he looks beaten all the time). In short, this group makes the guys from TAPS on Ghost Hunters look like MIT scientists!
