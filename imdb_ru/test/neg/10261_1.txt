Everything in this film was bad, the acting was bad, and the plot was bad. And it was all the blood and blood that were in “Demons”, this is a good movie, and it was not at all scary. My brother said that this film is bad, but I had to give it a chance, since the first film was very good. When the movie ended, I understand why my brother thought this movie was bad. The only advantage of this film was the music of "The Smiths" and "The Cult", but this is a movie, and the musical soundtrack is not the most important thing. And I saw that he came out four sequels after this film, I have not seen any of them, but if they can be as terrible as this, I have no plans to see them, but maybe I will see them someday .
