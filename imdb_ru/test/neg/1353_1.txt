First, I must say that I’ve seen version 39 at least 100 times; I know the whole dialogue and read the play '36, which differs from the game of 39 years old and contains its own nuggets of gold. This version is as flat as a lifelong film about adultery. There is a reason that you have not seen an expensive television advertising campaign for this. According to Entertainment Weekly, Bening hated the modest tone of the original and the way women spent all the time fighting each other. GUESS WHAT??! This was Booth's intention. It was a brilliant, theatrical presentation of gossip, adultery and cruel treatment among gifted Manhattan secular people. The crowd that made this new version did not intend to honor the original source material. They oddly choose this by inserting half the scene here and half the scene that come from the first version. Bette Midler (who plays only a few scenes and plays the old role of the countess in a wide, grinning style) has no context in this version. She mentions that she comes after "Buck", which is a key element in the original - then it is never mentioned again. This film is so boring that I don’t intend to overestimate it, but here are a few things that I consider incredible:> Mary Haynes boasts to her home workers: “I can suck the nails from the board!” That's right. Great letter. Norma Shearer could read about it and get an Oscar, right? > Compassionate Silvia Fowler !!! ??? Annette Bening got what she wanted, and the film just somehow fades. Claire Booth used Sylvia as a comic engine that swept through the play. As Rosalind Russell immortally portrayed, she was an ignorant, wicked woman who thundered from the many small, ridiculous, irresistible dialogues that still remain classic and quoted. She was not taller, biting Paulette Godard's ankle. The creators of the 2008 film decided that this character must die. After killing her, they killed the movie.
