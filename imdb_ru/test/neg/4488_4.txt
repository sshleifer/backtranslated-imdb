In my eyes, this film could be a very good film, Nicholas Sparks is a great author of novels, and this film had every chance to be as wonderful as in “Notebook”, but what sets them apart is that the laptop there was a dream team. leads to McAdams and Gosling, but here the balance is broken miserably due to the inept action of Channing Tatum. <br /> <br /> I felt that many scenes were uneven solely because of his work, a lot of emotions in various scenes are lost, because he cannot act, leaving an awkward and uneven situation, Amanda Seyfried gave an excellent idea only for In order for Tatum to drop the ball, and the mood was lost, and the scene could not be restored. <br /> <br /> This story deserves to be thrown right, but what he got was a cute boy who cannot act. Tatum must stick to what he is good at, films that are more about his physical abilities, albeit terrible, such as GI JOE, a step forward and a struggle. The less he speaks, the better. <br /> <br /> Try not to think of me as an insane hater of Channing Tatum. I came to this film with an open heart, because many times I was surprised to love Adam Sandler in "Reign over Me." I gave Tatum the same chance that I did not consider him here as the sum of his past roles, simply because of his role in this film, which, unfortunately, was a disappointment.
