RATING STARS: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Danny (Mel Raido) is a lonely factory worker who is trying to get his work and being a good father for his two daughters after a filthy divorce with their mother (Maxine Peak.) But after a quarrel with these daughters present in the Working Men Club, he uses a trip to their dance class to take a look at Louis (Colin Salmon ) and his gang of strong men who train in the boxing section at the gym hall / free weights and exercise in a more rigid, more energetic person. Soon, he took Louis's philosophy to heart and joined him as a nightclub porter when the 80s disco face comes ... but when Sparky's partner (Scott Williams) tries to retire from the drug trade, everything becomes pear-shaped. <br /> <br /> As Robert De Niro once said in The Tale of the Bronx, “there is no greater tragedy than lost talent.” The author of “Clubbud” had a good idea and a talent to make it in some film ... but, it seems, without the ability to combine all this into some kind of coherent film. <br /> <br /> How rude, some of the film sets (especially the scene at the end outside the Ring O 'Bells pub in Mosley!) It was pretty easy and fun to see ... but the grim look at the cinematography is really depressing things, Some really bad actors, for example, lead actor Raedo with an incomprehensible accent, which is everywhere, and Hammie’s script with some kind of dazzling dialogue are big problems for the film. More reputable actors, such as Peak and even Neil Morressi's favorite TV channel, are relegated to very small roles, while the hideous Raido and the lame villain Ronnie Fox are central. Williams produces the “Sick Boy from a Poor Man” from “Trainspotting”, leaving Salmon and Sean Parks apparently the only performers left without any integrity from all this, as excessive blood-sprinkled violence (which has become a common tendency for the British )! A truly missed opportunity. **
