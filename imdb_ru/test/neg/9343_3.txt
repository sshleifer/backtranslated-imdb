I donâ€™t understand the exaggerated good critics of this film, except for the fact that many people from Venezuela are understandably very excited, based on the fact that the Venezuelan cinema is really a bit behind other countries in the region. <br /> <br /> In the first place, the film is too repetitive, many scenes are almost identical for each of the two main roles, so it seems that this is a temporary filler. Time filling is also a good point, since this film is definitely too long with 105 minutes, after a while you will start to get tired and look at your watch. <br /> <br /> All the actors are pretty bad exceptions Venezuelan guy Edgar Ramirez, who brings a little farce and plays the role of Venezuelan recruit Pedro. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is not a representative film about people from the region (Caribbean zone), it tends to make fun of them.
