A friend of mine showed me this film yesterday, and I was very surprised that someone could make the film so terrible! <br /> <br /> Mix the most awful cliche with the most wooden acting game you have ever seen with the funniest special effects known to man, and you will get this magnificent beast! <br /> <br /> Vampire Slayer is funnier than most of the comedies I've seen, it's really awful! <br /> <br /> I was in the grooves during a scene where the character of a former policeman / vampire killer drinks coffee with an online journalist. Just look and you will understand what I mean! <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can't believe that someone did it with serious intentions. <br /> <br /> A tragic but very good laugh. This must be seen to be believed.
