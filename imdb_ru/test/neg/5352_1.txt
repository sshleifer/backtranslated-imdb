First things first - although I believe that Joel Schumacher is a mediocre director at best, and more often (like here) completely bad, the lion’s share of the blame for this ugly parody of the film should go to John Grisham, whose novel is based on that. <br /> <br /> The film takes place at an indefinite point in time (50s, 70s, now?). The film begins with the rape and murder of a child with goons, so caricatured that their goal is to appease the racists. that "at least we are not so bad" ?? We turn to the bad guys arriving at the courthouse when the girls' father, Samuel L. Jackson, fearing that they will become confused, will shoot them in cold blood before them in court. <br /> <br /> The scene is “deep south”, which probably never existed - few black characters live in shacks and seem to pick cotton, racist races in wool (Kiefer Sutherland - Klansman's caricature version) are ridiculous in their wickedness. Demonstration is a test: for protection, the “good guys” are the sweet taste attorney played by Matthew McConaughey, as if in a coma, his assistant played by Sandra Bullock's chest (it seems to serve no other purpose narration) and Donald Sutherland as an indispensable drunken lawyer who quiets down to fight for good. With regard to the prosecution, Kevin Spacey goes through the process of the appearance of demons, while in the city as a whole they burn crosses, intimidate witnesses and, it seems, the locals don’t care? <br /> <br /> Some of the reviews claim that the film is immoral, since Samuel Jackson is undoubtedly the killer, and he should trust the forces of the law, and not fall for Matthew McConaughey’s verbal oratory. Honestly, despite the fact that the main point of the film “Justice in court is good” may seem controversial, everything in the film stinks: characteristic features of character, lead acting master, conducting, screenplay and dialogue almost to the point of parody. Peter Menzies Magnificent, 50s. Tech color cinematography is good, but derivative. <br /> <br /> And it takes almost two and a half hours !! <br /> <br /> What else to say? It’s a waste of 141 minutes of someone’s life, it’s tiring, empty and vicious, and almost like an afterthought is morally disgusting.
