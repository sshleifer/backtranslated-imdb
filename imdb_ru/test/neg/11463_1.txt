I understand that most people do not know who Solomon Kane is, and that the film was created for a much larger audience. But why then call it "Solomon Kane", if the name does not have a market value? Characters, of course, have no relation to P.E. Howard character. Except that he has a big hat. This is where the similarity ends. <br /> <br /> This is always a bad sign when some superhero / fantasy / sci-fi movie lingers on the story of the origin, but when you come up with a whole cloth like this one for a character who doesn't have it no, you have completely missed it. Kane is no longer a fanatical Christian warrior, but rather a bad guy who is trying to save his soul (this part is on the initial stage). <br /> <br /> With the most basic elements of a character, Change, or simply ignoring, the use of the name Solomon Caine is simply puzzling. Is it just that they can say “From the creator of Conan” and hope to connect to a promising franchise if the new film “Conan” starts? Ignoring the complete deviation from the stories, the film is competent if it is completely common to the first half, but then turns into sheer stupidity in the climate scene, which includes many super villains (remember three "boss levels" at the same time), none of which are the least interesting or threatening. <br /> <br /> If I were not a fan of Kane, who was disappointed that they completely ignored the original material, I would give the film 3 or 4 instead of 1 Even for (most) viewers who will come to this, nothing without knowing about Kane, this is rather thin porridge.
