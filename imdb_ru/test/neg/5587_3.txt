Sorry, ELO fans, but I was disappointed with this CBS Television City concert in Los Angeles. That's decent in terms of music, but the presentation is just boring - big. Most songs sound the same, and lead singer-writer Jeff Lynn is almost as lively as a shop mannequin. He has a pleasant voice, but he has nothing to look at. He just stands in one place and sings an hour and 40 minutes. All songs sound like 1970â€“1980s bubble gum: enjoyable, but not addictive. <br /> <br /> Lynn is accompanied by a very pretty woman, Rosie Vela, but she is not too lively. The only song of 23 that causes any excitement is the last one: "Turn Beethoven over." Now, if only some of the 22 other songs caused such excitement, it could be a much better live DVD.
