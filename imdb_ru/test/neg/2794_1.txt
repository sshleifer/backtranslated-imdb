DO NOT take this movie seriously, rent it with people who want to play Mystery Science 3000, and you will probably laugh. Evil guys are not so scary, it's funny, it's like some sort of 7th grade dude with a sickle in a stuffed tree gets up. A fun game. I love to torture myself from time to time with a bad horror movie, and it really made me giggle. I recommend it on this basis. Of course, recreational drugs will improve the experience. Oh, there is a naked group-float scene that will allow some star dust in the 5-star system. The famous black male is seriously injured, but continues to joke, and also readily uses the damaged part of the body. Enjoy this complete and utter disgrace for movies.
