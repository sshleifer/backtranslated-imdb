Mr. Moto has a pretty straightforward plot - when a boxer is killed in the ring with the help of a mysterious poison, it’s up to even more mysterious Mr. Moto to solve the case. <br /> <br /> I am shocked by the number of positive reviews about Mr. Moto Gamble on IMDb. Because for me ... well, I find it extremely disappointing. I like Mr. Moto, and I like Charlie Chan, but I can't say that I cared about this mix of the two. For those who are not familiar with the story behind Mr. Moto, it was originally assumed that this is a film by Charlie Chan. But when Warner Oland retreated, some scenes and acts were rewritten for Peter Lorre and Mr. Moto. As I said, the end result left me excited. Mr. Moto is not Chan. He is more mysterious, he is more athletic and more exotic. So trying to put Moto in a Chan movie is like squeezing a square peg into a round hole — that doesn't work. And while listening to Lorre / Moto, try saying one of Chan's signature euphemisms, which sounds silly. Add to this the fact that almost 10 minutes from the already short 72-minute lead time consist of boxing scenes (which I never like), and you will get a film that I cannot but like. If I had to say something positive, I would point out Kei Luke’s speech. But even he is not close enough to hide Mr. Moto in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but 4/10 is the best I can give.
