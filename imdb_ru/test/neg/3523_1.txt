The film begins with three kills in a row. No plot, no characters, no motivation; the second murder takes place behind the scenes, and the severed head of the victim is in fact used to quite effectively kill the third victim to death! This is a high point. But Lewis is obviously smart enough to lead with force; Soon they cover up the failed dialogue scenes with the off-screen detective behind the scenes and shoot endless instant reporters in a terrible wide frame. To date, the terrible atmosphere of the Betacam production is quickly replaced by an advertising film, and the monumental (and quite charming) simplicity leads to a further change in this direction. Fur-cop investigates, kills the meat grinder, I repeat, I reach an early climax with an unforgettable gag in the form of a napkin. Just how the hell did fingers get into the salad? And wasnâ€™t the purpose of the Cult of Blood to collect detached shoots? When GORE stops making sense, you know that you have a problem. And, without spoiling a big senseless turn, just take my word for it: the exciting incompetence of the first scenes gives way to a deep impulse that destroys the cathode tube. The main reaction is to try to leave it behind and continue your life.
