Honestly, after the Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was somewhat embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is Bad. The game was bad, the dialogues were extremely superficial and insincere. It was well shot, but again, this is a big budget movie. It was too predictable, even for a movie. I even knew from the very beginning that he would die at the end; the only thing I didnâ€™t know was how. Too politically correct. Very disappointing. The only thing that is really worth seeing is the landscape and the house, because it is beautiful. But, if you want it, see National Geographic. I love Lane, but I have never seen her in such a lousy movie. As for Gere, he is a good actor, but he had such films, so I'm not surprised. One and a half hours, which I would like to return.
