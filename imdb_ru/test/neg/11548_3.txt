This unintentionally funny mid-80s TV movie is based on the premise that Donna Mills's sex bomb (mostly terrifying wardrobe everywhere) is an abandoned housewife yearning for her sexy past as a cheerleader. She avoids her empty life, fantasizing about casual sexual encounters with one of the many attractive men she encounters, eventually giving up her fantasies and indulging a little on the side, although all she really wants is to rekindle the flames of passion James Brolin's boring husband. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of ludicrous moments in this film, Millsâ€™s first foray into co-production (later, after her departure from Knots Landing, she achieved great success as the crappy queen of television films was filmed mainly in melodramas coming out in a week , during most of the 90s - she usually played some kind of sacrifice, clearly set up to wash her hands from the wonderfully evil and interesting rogue, whom she had played for so long on the "Nodes"). Funniest are stretched fantasies of the sequence, filmed as if they were meant for soft core porn (wind and smoke machine, lights, porn music), but since this network scene television film is all very chaste and ultimately not very sexy. The funniest (and weird) scene - Mills strolls along the wild side of the city center among the spiny punks (complete with the soundtrack of Robert Palmer). <br /> <br /> Less horrible is the terrible dialogue that cardboard characters have to say (poor poor Sisely Tyson as a compulsory psychoanalyst, or Veronica Cartwright as a compulsory best friend, or even preschooler James Brolin) with this daily soapy style of anger fist.) Of course, like in all such films, we learn that all problems can be solved with the help of psychotherapy, and then the film just becomes stupid. As we briefly examine the causes of Mills' shocking behavior ( as if we can't t be that she wants a good sucker!) <br /> <br /> Vacuous.
