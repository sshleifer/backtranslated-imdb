Like many people of my age, I remember watching this film as a child in '98 and leaving the theater almost in tears. At the time, this seemed to be one of the most important, impressive cinematic experiences of our generation. Armegeddeon was at the same time fascinating, fascinating, funny, heartbreaking and truly inspiring, and everything really happened in it, right up to the memorable Aerosmith song and juicy tears ending. <br /> <br /> Sweet Jebus. What did we smoke? I watched it for the first time in recent years on one of the movie channels, and ... I can't even describe it. This is, indeed, one of the worst films ever made. Where to begin? Leaving aside a lot of FUNNY scientific mistakes (“tracking the shots” of astronauts? Yes, of course, thanks for that, Billy Bob), I should have said that the worst was wonderful - I dare even to say, unmatched - in which it combined a shitty letter with shitty action. There are too many examples of this to even begin listing here, but one of them, in particular, comes to mind is the scene where Bruce Willis tells the Fedam where to go, in order to track down each of these charming scammers. oil drilling team (“check every bar in New Orleans”, “dice tables” in Vegas, ”“ the only black guy on a motorcycle in Sturgis ”... all to the tune“ Get together ”... this reminded me) a little bit of the scene "TEAM NEWS! ASSEMBLY!" from the leader, except for serious). Ben Affleck once again proves that he is by far the most overpaid actor in Hollywood, with less depth, range and general talent than anyone else in business. Not that Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler or anyone else in this GODFORSAKEN part of the hajj was much better. <br /> <br /> (I must say, however, I enjoyed seeing the leader of Owen Wilson being killed halfway ... is this the only film where his character dies?) <br /> <br /> Peter Stormare is perfect as the most stereotypical disability. (On the other hand, Peter Stormare really does have talent for playing unrivaled Eurotypes.) It was really funny, almost IMMEDIATELY after the Americans docked with the Russian space station (which is actually called in the film) Ben Affleck succeeds in alone make the whole joint explode in a spectacular Hollywood way. I also like the fact that, after all, Paris is the only place on Earth that can be destroyed, and that absolutely nobody cares. And on top of that, it literally turns into a simultaneous advertisement for Lockheed Martin AND Kerr McGee. Oh, how proud I am that I am American. <br /> <br /> There are many other things that you can rant, but I will not ... suffice it to say that this is a really, really, really terrible movie. I feel ashamed to ever sincerely like. <br /> <br /> I give him two stars only for the factor of bullying.
