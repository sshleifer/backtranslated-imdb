INFERNO begins with the rather impressive effect of TVM's stellar landscape. We also met a scientist named Heller. You did not understand? Heller, Hell-er, Inferno. So, I think someone at work had some kind of intelligence. However, as TVM progresses, intelligence throughout the storyline becomes more and more obvious to appeal to the American TVM audience. <br /> <br /> The story itself is full of stories involving numerous TVM serial characters, such as a hard liberal school teacher who is trying to save a home boy from a criminal life, a doctor who has lost his medical license, etc. In fact, the story concentrates much more on these characters than on the approaching disaster, when all the potential tension and drama that could arise in the script will soon grow in a cloud of smoke, and being TVM, we just know that there will be no depression /> <br /> I noticed a problem on the screen, and every time an explosion occurs, a huge fireball appears that looks ridiculous, not to mention physically impossible. Look at the scene where the national guard fights with the gang. The soldier fires a grenade at the tower, and the whole building explodes with a ball of fire. What a small greenna containing no more than a few ounces of explosives can do that! No, he can not. There is also another scene of military engineers blasting a dam with plastic explosives, and the same effect of a fireball is seen. Director, please note that explosiveness is not the same as napalm. <br /> <br /> Having said that I found INFERNO well observable for TVM, I never wanted to turn it off. He did have some potential, and let me repeat that the special effects are pretty good considering the budget, and it's not as bad as TVM, as some people do
