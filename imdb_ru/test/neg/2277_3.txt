A boring, perfectly predictable soap opera. Mary Tyler Moore is married to Ted Danson, who has an affair with Christine Lahti. Moore is friends with Lahti and does not know about fraud. Danson dies in an accident, and Lahti is pregnant with his child. To yawn! <br /> <br /> I’m ashamed to admit that I paid money to watch it at the theater in 1986. I liked all three stars, but even their considerable talents could not handle it. I CONSTANTLY knew what was going to happen. As another poster said, it’s like a lifelong movie with a PG rating. <br /> <br /> In one place Lahti swears non-stop, and even Moore loses once! There are also meaningless pictures of topless playing football (!!!). In addition, this is a friendly television. The only good thing about this was that Timothy Gibbs played Moore and Danson's teenage son. Very beautiful and pretty good actor. In addition, there is nothing to recommend. You've seen it before ... and done better. It was obviously forgotten. Skip this.
