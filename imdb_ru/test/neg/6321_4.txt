I was ready to love “Where's Popp”, it has a connection with the characters of the Normal Lear comet sitcoms, who, when I grew up, felt like extended members of my broken nuclear family the size of a reizenet. How much fun it would be to see Barnard Hughes, Vincent Gardenia, Ron Liebman, Rob Reiner and Garrett Morris uncensored before the SNL before censorship. <br /> <br /> But alas, “Where's Daddy” pulls. It is claustrophobic and a burden that violates the basic rules of farce, ease of mood and quick tempo. <br /> <br /> The plot includes the efforts of a lawyer (George Segal) to rid himself of his domineering Jewish mother, who lives in his giant apartment in New York. Along the way, we are exposed by ridiculous characters and situations: a comedy group of robbers who repeatedly rob the main character's brother, police rape, which includes a gorilla suit and subsequent cheerful love, Ruth Gorden rips off Segal's pants and bites his ass when he serves her dinner. Why is this not working? Part of the explanation is the sense of doom generated by cramped, dark interiors and antique decorations. I absolutely absorb the cinematography of New York in this era, but when watching this movie it seemed to me that I was flipping through a police newspaper in a dark bus station. <br /> <br /> The main reason is slow pace. Modern MTV-style fast frames have changed what viewers see as a comfortable editing pace, but even taking this into account, camera shots are held for too long. The development of the plot is also very slow. There is one situation in which it works: a strange love song that George Seagal sings Trish Van Dever softly, very close to her face and painfully long. It reminded me of those painstaking extended shots in the British version of Office, where you mentally implore the camera to turn off, and at the same time you can't stop watching. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the film is more likely to "hurry up" than "I can not look away." What made me think about whether it is possible to have a black comedy, which is also a farce. The dilemma is that object gravity in a black comedy tends to weaken the lightness of a farce. Films such as Robert Altman’s M * A * S * H ​​and Dr Krundkran Strandzhelov show that this can be achieved. They do this not only with the help of speed, but also with the help of entertainment scenes, which are neglected by “Where's Dad”. <br /> <br /> Although the film has many funny stereotypically funny characters, almost all of them are directly involved in the central drama. on how to deal with a rebellious mother. The scenes with Garrett Morris and the robbers from Central Park are as close as the spectators get into a mental breakdown. The kidnappers seemed almost Shakespearean, following the tradition of the comic joker. If the rest of "Where Popp" clung a little closer to theatrical tradition, it would be the best film. Edgier is not always better. As if all these talented actors and director Karl Reiner were shot shortly before the creative maelstrom of the 70s. <br /> <br /> Random notes: after robbing Ron Liebman’s clothes, the robbers mention “King Wilde” “Naked Prey” (1966), a great fighter who was the stylistic predecessor of the Planet of the Apes in 1968. <br /> <br /> How politically incorrect he is, anxious to find out about the death of an action movie hero as formidable as Charlton Heston Linda Harrison, who played Nova, Taylor's dumb buddy, said that James Francicus seemed sweet and tiny compared to Heston.
