Hello! I am a Tire, an African (but white!) Jungle Princess, with an incredible ability to transform into the cheapest and not the scariest monster in the world (think of the 60s Star Trek aliens), seductively rolling in the mud! When I first came to this terrible situation, I took the only logical action: I turned myself into a torn bikini in the jungle, in which I performed my poorly acting antics. I enjoy romantic novels and tear apart a random, unimpressive African commander. And I would have been missed if I had not mentioned my (white, of course) Assistant Mr. Cutter, a former American military man, who seems to have fled from the United States after the divorce. Can you say alimony ducking? In any case, he sometimes distracts me from a difficult life. I mean, how many idiots of blondes do you know who is also the endangered species of a monster tearing through the flesh? Despite my many difficulties (playing so hard! * Whining *), I did not give up, and after a long reassessment of values, I finally found my role in life: to terrorize insomniac night viewers so unhappy as not having a cable or satellite.
