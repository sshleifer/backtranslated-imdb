Before I saw this film, I heard a few negative comments about this. However, when I watched it, I thought, “Well, it's a little slow, but it's quite interesting.” At the end of the film, a complex moral dilemma arose that led to a shocking, but in the context of the film, an entirely plausible solution with extremely dramatic consequences. If this were done, it would be an extremely powerful ending and would give me a very favorable impression of the film. <br /> <br /> However, because of the ending, which not only emotionally copes, there is absolutely no sense for you when you see how one of the characters performs an action that should end her life, but for inexplicable reasons does not. By the way, please tell me if I missed something here, and there is a reason why she survives, because I just couldn’t, how logical she could do it, and it ruined the whole movie for me. <br /> <br /> That said: all three roles lead to powerful actions, although the transformation of Kevin McKid’s characters to the end goes a little further than completely convincing, and this creates a very powerful ethical triangle. <br /> <br /> This movie is recommended if you are ready to go out yourself when your mother and sister are lying on the bed. But look no further if you have only a pinch, but a few mountains of salt.
