What can you say about the film, because of which two hours seem three weeks? The hero begins his career in Japan, is experiencing an identity crisis (saving shinobi), makes a trip to America (saving a slave named Sam), participates in a small wild western battle (saving a native American Frenchman / Japanese named Julie) goes on a hunt for pirate gold and then sent back to Japan for the war. The film obviously has no clue where it goes at any given time; I think the director modeled every scene after the last movie he watched. If you are going to watch this movie, I suggest renting subtitles so that you and your colleagues can openly discuss how stupid the movie is, not to mention the movie, perhaps skipping another blunt plot twist. <br /> <br /> Films the director watched during the filming of this film - “American Tail”, “Fayvel Goes West”, “Star Wars”, “Indiana Jones”, “Guni”, “Ninja Turtles”, “ Kung Fu, Vampire Hunter D, Ten Commandments. <br /> <br /> Notes of Interest - The most inspiring fear line of all time. After about 90 minutes (or 19 days) of the film, the main character just defeated an American villain, and as soon as one of them goes to the VCR to put an end to the pain that the hero proclaims “Back to Japan,” the agony continues for another week.
