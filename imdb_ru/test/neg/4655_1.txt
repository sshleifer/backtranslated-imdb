The film is about Lassie, which was supposed to be "put to sleep" .... FOREVER. This is how I would describe this painfully dreary waste of time on a film. So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgotten films I've seen. It is not even an achievement like “so bad it is good” or “so bad it is remembered.” The idea that Lassi will become bad intrigues, but in fact so little happens, and so slowly that you feel your life slipping away when you sit and watch nonactors read their lines from hint cards pathetic salary. <br /> This is an empty hollow film shell. Seriously, do not waste time or on a child. Unless both of you are being treated. That is all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Avoid, avoid, avoid! It will drive you crazy! Hahahah, got it? BARKING! Hahahahahahaha! <br /> <br /> Sorry, I had a hard week.
