It hurts me how someone can rate this movie very highly. It is not an understatement to call it contrived. The way the guy managed to build a wooden labyrinth of underground rooms in such a short time is ridiculous, or maybe he was the greatest carpenter since Jesus. Hoyt Ekston’s obese sheriff looked like a refugee from Jerry Springer’s show, and I discovered that blond woman Jennifer Jason Lee is pretty straightforward. We in the UK have the expression "lamb made like a lamb," which is perfect for her. However, everything was not so bad, I really liked it when the end credits rolled, and “The End” came out, which was brilliant enough for this hot broadcast of a television movie, which, if it were a cinematic release, would have been put on in discount stores as soon as possible.
