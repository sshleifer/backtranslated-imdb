I stopped watching this movie halfway through. It was just awful! Boring, invented scenes. The complete absence of pathos seen in Norman Bates, Buffalo Bill or the image of Steve Reilsbek Ed Hein. The film does not have to be historically accurate, but the true story of Ed Hayn is much more interesting than this third melodrama, which was completely invented without a good reason! Ed Gein, pictured by Kane Hodder, is a cartoonist, a sadist. Attempts to show the trauma inflicted on him by his mother are simply weak exercises in a recycled style. And this film wanted to be stylish, but even screwed up. Fortunately, there is the best movie of this story. Ed Gein in 2001 effectively told this story and offered a little peace when we observed how the patient does not control himself. Steve Railsback, who played Ed Heine at the time, was already famous for capturing another famous serial killer - Charles Manson. His Ed was pathos. His film is the one to see. Avoid this mess.
