I think this is very interesting, this film is called a thriller. This is not exciting at all. <br /> <br /> Most of the time you hear piano sounds. Then you hear the sounds of the piano. Then some people talk about facts that do not concern anyone. <br /> <br /> Then the piano sounds again. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this film was the reason for my registration on IMDb, because I think this film is one of those that humanity must be warned about. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: By the way, the most similar to the action part occurs when a can of hot chocolate is poured. <br /> <br /> Also very interesting: "Actors". Yes, quotes are intentional, as you might think, because they are not valid. They play the piano and have small conversations, but they do not play, but do. <br /> <br /> I think that before this film I had never left the cinema and was not angry. Indeed, this film pissed me off. Angry at the time and money I spent on it.
