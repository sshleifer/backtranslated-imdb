Each James Bond film has its own rules. Just like every Indiana Jones film has its own set of rules. And the fact that the writers do not violate these rules, maintains the integrity of the characters. With a completely unnecessary turn of the plot, the integrity of both Ocean films falls somewhere between Plane 2 and the Roadrunner caricature. <br /> <br /> Imagine what happens while you stand on the cable bridge outside the Temple of Fate. Indie ordered Shorty and Willy not to worry, because during the first two films he secretly possessed supernormal abilities and could manage both of them safely . <br /> <br /> Interestingly? Of course, for the cartoon Roadrunner. But Spielberg would never do that, because it would destroy the integrity of the film. More importantly, it would annoy the audience. They were already sitting on the edge of their seats for three hours of films about Indiana Jones and were counting on Indiana to plausibly leave this bridge. If he flew away? People left the cinema just like people did during the 12th Ocean. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> 1. The character of Julia Roberts, Tess, penetrates the museum, disguised as ... Julia Roberts?!? Smart twist? Destroying the fourth wall three hours after we were introduced to these characters? Is that a naked gun 33 and 1/3? This is an example from a textbook on how cheap laughter can spoil an entire movie. But wait ... just in case you haven’t come out yet ... <br /> <br /> 2. Waiting accumulates during the last hour of the film - as they begin to rob - only 10 are left ... 8 ... 5 ... 2 DAYS! And then in the last 12 minutes of the film, the only entertaining part of this film, we see that the robbery was done a few days before and it took Matt Damon only 30 seconds to complete. Last 10 days? A complete waste of your time. <br /> <br /> BACK TO INDIANA JONES ON THE BELIEVAL BRIDGE ... "Just relax, Willie! I stole the REAL stones about a month ago! Besides, I convinced them that you were Kate Capshaw!" <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen it yet, reduce your losses and go to the Polar Express. I do not want to spoil your end, but in fact this is Santa Claus. Most importantly, you will not feel deceived by leaving the theater.
