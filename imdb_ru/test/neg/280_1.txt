Ocean 12 is getting annoying and getting worse from now on. As in the case of celebrity awards, each major actor / actress is represented in a short 60-second scenario, which seems to stop in a short position with a blinking “applaud now” sign. The first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly fragmented, poorly edited, and sometimes completely unrelated to the story and confusing. Speaking of history, ... there is one, it seems ..., but it is barely noticeable for all the pictures and cameos "look at me." Only Matt Damon seemed to really "act" during this film ... the rest of the cast seemed to be only there to participate in the rat-pack-want-to-be session. As for the robbery, action, drama ... it was placed in the last 8-10 minutes of the film and was pitiful and anti-climatic. Terrible! Terrible! Terrible!
