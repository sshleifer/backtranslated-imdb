The opening scene keeps me from rating at absolute zero. I wish the whole film was as sandy and real as the intro. <br /> <br /> To enjoy some movies, much can be forgiven (60-shot handguns, superhuman heroes, all women are gorgeous and half-naked), but Puuuuleeese is “Assault On My Intelligence 13” so contrived that I was surprised that the actors appeared on the second day of filming. <br /> <br /> First, how did these guys make up being policemen? By stupidity I think. How female protagonists justify the fact that they were half-naked in mid-winter in Detroit or wherever they are. In fact, not a single character responds to the elements of this film. During the storm of the century there are no windows, no electricity (which miraculously returns inexplicably), and they are all as comfortable as beetles in a carpet. What technology exists that disables all mobile phones, radio and brain functions. It must be the same force that makes Maria Bella leave the knee in a wheelchair over snow without a coat and almost no dress.
