After 15 minutes of watching, I knew how this would end. This is a cliché movie with a silly setting. I am a big fan of thieves films, but this is nothing new, clever or special. This is about an insider robbery that went wrong because the “hot bad guy” shoots ass and, of course, the “good bad guy” goes on a moral journey. The reason why this is stupid and not believable. If you’ve already gone so far as to kill your ass, why not just kill one guy who stands between you and 43 million. They have 45 minutes to hide the money and make a robbery. None of sensible people will be afraid to shoot Mr. “do good”, and in this case he is a guy whom they have known for several days ... Everything and everything, on which I relied on fast rewind from the middle, but I do not know what i'm sorry
