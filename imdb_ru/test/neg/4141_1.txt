After 1988 after the catastrophe, the films of J.J. Amitabha lost the quality they had before. <br /> <br /> Banning MAIN AZAAD HOON, released in 1989, which was a great movie, all films were mostly craps, except HUM (1991), later in 1991. /> <br /> This is another one of Amitabha's shit movies that people abandoned in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> He made this film as a sign of friendship with Shashi Kapoor, who shot the film and did not take a penny with him. The film also had Rishi and Dimple (again, not paired with each other after RANBHOOMI). <br /> <br /> The film was released in 1991, when Bachchan had 4 releases and 3 flops, including INDRAJEET, AKAYLA, AJOOBA <br /> Ajooba appeared 2 years after TOOFAN and JAADUGAR made both supernatural films that were rejected. This is another type of shit, Bachchan wears a mask and clothes like Krishs and performs magic, changing 1 person per donkey. special effects, but the film is too bad to watch. <br /> <br /> Directed by Shashi Kapoor - not very good music. c bad <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Amitabh became too old by 1991 and looked tired, his acting was fine, but not at the same level as his best Rishi's fine. Dimple is fine, the rest are forgotten.
