It's so fake! The plot looks like a general adaptation of the average movie of the bliss. Common themes of blasploating, such as racism, oppression and the struggle for the integrity of your community, are described in a simplified / superficial way. And the jokes are not even funny! Dolemite makes these opposing comedy monologue routines that are really painful. All the people around him deliver this canned laughter. Even the soundtrack sounds like it's a funk. For the best comedy in a backsplating experience, try Coffy and Friday Foster with Pam Greer. For a more realistic blaise experience, try Black Heat.
