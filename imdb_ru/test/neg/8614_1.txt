The plot is simple: an American couple is on vacation in Thailand. Somehow, they are attacked by "all-powerful" Chinese vampires, and the girl is kidnapped by the big boss of the vampires. It is normal so far. The girl's partner remains to look for her. And now the horror begins. He comes across a strange group of half-vampires or something like that (they only drank the blood of animals). These vampires are in conflict with a bad guy for about ... 800 years. However, with the help of "good vampires", the guy starts looking for his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Now the fight begins, what kind of karate movie without a fight? I also noticed that vampires are very ugly guys. I mean ... the vampire is an old-fashioned guy (he's alive since ... forever), he has a style. There are also modern vampires, but in this movie the vampires are ... weird. Well, come on, they ride a bike, they are all dressed in leather, and they destroy everything in their own way. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that you can clearly see that this film is budgetary, the script is boring and the actors are not very talented. The music is pretty good, but the effects are not so good. <br /> <br /> To summarize, the film is not so good, but if you have a day off, watch it and tell me if I am correct or not.
