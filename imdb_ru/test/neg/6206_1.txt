This is not a good movie. This is a proven remake of the English film "The Hitch". But it offends the original. This is hardly a film that you expect from such a veteran director as "David Dhavan", who is credited with such good films as "Raja Babu", "Kuli No. 1", "Hero No. 1" ... <br /> br /> The main theme for this film is taken from "The Hitch" with some changes to attract an Indian audience, but the story and the script are not convincing enough. Plus, the main cast, that is, Salman Khan and Govinda, is pitiful. It seems that they need the slightest provocation to take off shirts to bare their breasts. I do not find it fascinating and least of all comic. What was the director thinking about? In addition to this, viewers have to bear the matter of Govindaâ€™s excessive actions. It was just unbearable. I advise viewers to watch him at your own risk. My rating 2 for this movie can be considered very generous. <br /> <br /> Instead, I would advise viewers to watch the English film Hitch, which is much better.
