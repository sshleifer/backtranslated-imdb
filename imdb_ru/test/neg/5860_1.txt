Despite the potentially exciting premise, the Series 7 is a weak attempt to attack reality TV. In addition to its production prices in the basement, which represent pain in the eyes after 10 minutes, the overall tone of the film is misleading. Several reviewers attacked the acting role in the film, but I think the real problem lies in this unsuccessful attempt to turn the film into a farce. Apart from the fact that the jokes are not funny (a pregnant woman swears a lot, a young girl gets a bunch of weapons), she does not mix with the general tone of the film. If the creators actually made the Series 7 look like a real reality show - colorful, but hollow edits, inconclusive sound effects, wide camera movements - perhaps their view would be more convincing or at least more acceptable. Instead, Series 7 runs through the already painful world of death and game shows. You can only imagine that the director slaps his back for stating the obvious.
