My boss at the time showed it to us at a Halloween party at our office. He is Chris Huntly, who co-authored and acted in this. He knows that this is bad, we know that this is bad, and we all agree that the monster looks too much like a vagina to be a coincidence. Maybe this was due to an unsuccessful gynocological experiment. <br /> <br /> It was VERY low-budget, and all the actors were friends, so you have a case of "Hey, gang, let's do a show." <br /> <br /> No one was hurt, and this was the first attempt. Nothing wrong with that. It laughed at us all, and this is a great movie that you can watch with friends and make fun of. :-)
