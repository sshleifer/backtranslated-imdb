I saw this film in 1956 and again on the channel a few days ago. The film has not improved with age. On the contrary. This is a real epic with spaghetti. <br /> <br /> Trojans are heroic and pleasant; Greeks are nasty, petty and mean. <br /> <br /> And what if Paris escaped with the kingâ€™s wife? Hey ... love is love
