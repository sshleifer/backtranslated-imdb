The scriptwriters of this mini-series should have been sentenced to guillotine themselves. They cut a very funny story and squandered Richard E. Grant's talents. The only thing that writers have hidden from the original books is the name. All characters were completely changed, and the story was not the same. I highly recommend watching another version of Scarlet Pimpernel. Any other version is better than this one.
