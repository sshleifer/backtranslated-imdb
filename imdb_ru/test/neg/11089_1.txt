Very strange, it seems to me that this is a very average film, if not a little less. It is brilliantly filmed, but along with R. Lee Ermee's performance, this is the only redemptive aspect that I discovered in the film, which consists of two separate parts. <br /> <br /> The first part is devoted to the basic training of marines, which, looking at him in 2007, begins with what I have seen millions of times in dozens of other films and TV shows, and this is not particularly exciting. After 30 minutes, I got the idea and wanted them to just continue it. The sergeant instructor is the only plausible character, while the others seem just cardboard cutouts. The overall action is terribly haggard, and the script is devoid of anything interesting and consists of a little more than the cries of the sergeant. Boys are trained and fall into Vietnam. Oh, and the fat eccentric shoots a sergeant (what a surprise ...), probably mistakenly believing that he was actually a screenwriter. <br /> <br /> An hour passed, and nothing noteworthy happened. Nothing ... <br /> <br /> Then we will have a Vietnamese part. <br /> <br /> It starts with a two-tier stage, where “Stars and Stripes” journalists are bored, and they do a little conversation to pass the time. At first I thought they were playing some scenes from old movies, it sounded pretty bad. But no, they actually muttered their scripts. Then the camp is besieged. About 20 Vietcongs enter the camp through the main gate. It is a pity that they are thrown like flies, because they simply enter several manned rifle posts without means of cover. Is this normal behavior? Were the Vietnamese suicidal? If so, why didn't the United States win this war in the first two months of the battle? The rest of the film continues with even more illogical scenes of war. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the whole plot is completely meaningless. None of the characters cause great sympathy, and the story, quite frankly, is quite without incident. This shows a little more than some war reporters hooked on by a platoon who shot some guys because they are disobedient idiots and seem to think that a gaping hole in the wall will protect you from bullets. <br /> What was the message of this film .. that people died in Vietnam? What are animal people in military situations? What if you want to get rid of really stupid people, do you send them to a war zone? Or is something like concrete really burning in Vietnam? <br /> <br /> Sorry, but if this film deserves 8.3, then the Apocalypse now deserves 38.3 <br /> 5/10
