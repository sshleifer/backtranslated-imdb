This film follows a plot that is very similar to Warriors, similar to Warriors, but with less intensity and a rather bad game that has nothing to write about. <br /> <br /> The story as a whole is not so bad, based on a small Australian gang who are trying to get out of the city when one of their members is accused of raping a girl of another gang. Then they have to make their way through the streets while they are being pursued by a number of rival gangs. He could assume that the authors took a page from the book “Warriors” and rewrote it, but, as mentioned above, not so much. <br /> <br /> Overall, the game is not very good. in my opinion, and in many cases it is obvious that they are really acting ... the scenes of the struggle, nevertheless, compensate for this, but then the weak sound effects accompanying them bring him back. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn’t say anything about Warriors Once. <br /> <br /> Low budget, good story, bad game, nothing special.
