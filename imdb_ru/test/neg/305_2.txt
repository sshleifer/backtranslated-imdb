The premise of the film was very promising - a kind of hilarious film such as Napoleon Dynamite. And, frankly, there were some funny moments and funny lines, but overall it was not very good. The script and dialogue were similar to a local sketch, full of clich√©s and scenes that were predictable. <br /> <br /> However, it was funny enough, and I was stuck to see how it ended, because it hints that something special is happening at the end. But it seems that the film ran out of money, or the author ran out of ideas, because the final is very sharp, almost passing directly from what seemed like a key conflict in the film to the final credits. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was very disappointing, but not completely unnoticed ...
