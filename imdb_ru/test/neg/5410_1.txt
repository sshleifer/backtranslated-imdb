My wife and I enjoy bad sci-fi movies. Some films are so bad that they are good. Mansquito was one of them. It was bad, but he had some redemptive qualities. It makes you wonder how a self-respecting actor approaches such lines as “Hey, Manskito!” <br /> <br /> This film is so bad that it has taken its place as our standard for the bad. This is not just a bad movie, it really stinks. There was a strike group, "Indian", who was riding in a black cloak and used SWORD for a loud shout. He shot down a helicopter with an arrow !! <br /> <br /> We tried to laugh at this film, but there were no moments when it did not rise above the pitiful. We could not come up with any function other than one. These were the words "The End." <br /> <br /> It seemed that the plot, character development and film makes no sense. Someone in Hollywood should be fired.
