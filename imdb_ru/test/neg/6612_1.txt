This film is rubbish from the start. First, it tells about the season, which took place 16 YEARS AGO! What's the difference? This film had the same depth as the bottle cap. This makes such a complex person like Bob Knight a cartoon character. <br /> <br /> Swearing doesn't bother me, but I'm still amazed that ESPN showed a movie with more curses than Kevin Smith's movie on a simple cable channel. The word “F” was missed at least 20 times before the first commercial. <br /> <br /> This film was terrible, and anyone associated with it should be embarrassed. I rate it at the same level as Jaws IV - “Revenge and Everybody Wins” ... 2 films that are in the Crapfest Hall of Fame.
