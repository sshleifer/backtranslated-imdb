Aghhhhhh! What a disappointment. A perfectly good piece, like Antonio Sabato Jr., and nothing but embarrassing chatter coming out of his mouth. I cringe at 95% Dialogue! It would be better to make the character dumb! How Antonio Sabato and Michael Pare could speak these lines without losing control over some bodily functions, I cannot do it! If the character Michaela Pare had preceded or finished another sentence with the word "Men", I think I would throw iron through the TV (I love multitasking - especially to survive bad movies). It must have been a scant year for both of them to subscribe to this film. Car washing for life would probably look pretty good for them by now. And the bad guy ... if he was so bad, then why didn't he shoot all these rich college students instead of promising toilet breaks. Even the name was wrong. “Emergency landing” means that the plane actually falls, and does not just land even without a fire or wound token. Instead of a safe landing, the plane should have crashed and burned in the same way as the script. <br /> <br /> THIS MOVIE IS A STICKER!
