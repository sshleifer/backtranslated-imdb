In a sense, you should respect Arachnia. Obviously, this is a tribute to the films about the big mistakes of the fifties, and the special effects look terrible; at least there is no computer graphics in the movie. However, on the other hand; You can not respect the movie too much, because it is rubbish. The game is terrible, special effects (as already mentioned) cannot be taken seriously, and as soon as you see how one giant spider has been blown up; You saw them all, so pretty quickly getting bored. The plot is followed by a group of people who are not lucky enough to be in a plane crash after a meteor shower. They go to the only house in the area; it's just a house where a man has a huge spider, which he used as a circus attraction. Coincidentally, around the same time, a meteor shower made more giant spiders rise from the ground. All the characters in this film are bad caricatures; none of them have anything like the third dimension, and they will soon start to miss you. You should feel like director Brett Piper, as he obviously has nothing to work on for this film; but this does not make Arachnia vain, and in general there are better films about giant beetles than this, and therefore Arachnia does not receive approval from me.
