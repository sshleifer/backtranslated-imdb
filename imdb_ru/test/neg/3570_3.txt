I have to agree that the film is not the best I have ever seen, but I would like to point out that the actors portraying Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey were real Dorsey brothers. As actors, they were great musicians. A film based on their famous split would be better if professional actors played the part. Many films made during this time were popular with big bands. Most often, the films were not so good, because musicians are not actors by profession. Most moviegoers have not seen Tommy or Jimmy Dorsey play themselves; they went to the plot and music. I have never been a big fan of Dorsey, but the music is good even today. <br /> <br /> I have to comment on the previous post about the actors who played Mom and Pop Dorsey, and that their accents will be considered extreme in the Dublin audience. Arthur Shields and Sarah Olgood were actually Irish actors, both born in Dublin. You may remember Mr. Shields as Rev. Mr. Playfire in The Quiet Man, and Miss Allgood is Mrs. Monahan in Cheaper by the Dozen.
