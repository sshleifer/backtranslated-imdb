While I saw and enjoyed films like this that were silent films about the Russian revolution, such as Potemkin and Ten Days That Shook the World, I didn’t particularly like it. This was mainly due to the annoying and “fanciful” way that the director chose to make the film. While POTEMKIN excelled in his editing style, this film used similar techniques with much less finesse - in some places the editing seemed very fluid and amateur. In addition, and it was really annoying, the use of zombies at the beginning of the film and at the end of the film was indeed excessive. By “zombies,” I mean that to illustrate how depressed and oppressed were the Ukrainian peasants, people in many scenes stand like mannequins. And they stand like this, motionless, for a VERY long time, while “evil” capitalists and exploiters of the masses pass by. Give me a break! This film is a wonderful example of style over content - and this is only a film for those who love or may lose sight of excessive patience. <br /> <br /> By the way, the DVD for this film is slightly improved if you leave the audio commentary on. This makes it easy to watch a movie and gives you some interesting ideas.
