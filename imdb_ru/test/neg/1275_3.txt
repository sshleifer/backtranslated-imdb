Maybe I don't get it right. I mean the movie. It does not make me happy or something else needs to do. Maybe because of my mood. In any case, this is a simple family film with children for actors. Just admit that all films of this kind cannot overcome the barrier of 4 out of 10, not to mention who plays in the film (for example, Antonio Banderas played in such films ... two or three of them cannot remember the exact number) I was bored. I almost fall asleep just because the topic is so clich√©, and the acting was so predictable. But I'm sure my child will love this movie when he grows up ... Hey, I'm not a monster, I found some funny or good moments in the movie. The owls in the film were sooooo cute. A trick with the painted windows of a police car and the blows that a child received in the head with a golf ball ...
