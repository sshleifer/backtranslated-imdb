Vicente Aranda shot a terrible historical film. It shows the scarce resources of Spanish cinema. In this film, the surreal scenario shows that Juana, like a nurse, face Felipe, only cares about sex ... but about sex with others, not with her. Technical mistakes begin with a wedding ring that shows Isabel Castile. - No one noticed? Then the voice in the frame seems documentary, the actors and actresses in the film sometimes laugh - look at the sequence when Juana arrives at the council who wants to keep her in isolation -; the castles are almost destroyed when they were built recently in the film era, crowds are just “four”, the lights are badly set ... Compared to the French film by Osella Amelie Poulain ... The point is to talk about a bad film like Juan La Loca.
