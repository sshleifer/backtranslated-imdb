This winding tale of mafia revenge is simply not very interesting, even when Ed McMahon is playing a mature role as the main heavyweight. Jim Brown effectively kicks ass, Gloria Hendry again proves that she can bring life to even the poorest roles, and Brock Peters is decent as a Policeman who plays in a book. It is still dull and poorly constructed, and even the seal shown on the cable is now emasculated from its original account of James Brown.
