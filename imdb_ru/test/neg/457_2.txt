Universal Pictures' poor minor feature about a mother-in-law filmmaker who is investigating the armed forces, chasing away the achievements of a daring young woman he was nominated for a novel. Director Robert Montgomery and stars in this adaptation of the short film "Come Be My Love" and his acting performances this era is invariably lazy. The plot is juicy, predictable things, and the writer Robert Carson has given all the really funny lines (as usual for films of this period) to an angry black maid. It is always nice to see support from Ann Blyth and Jane Cole, but they can do little with this hockey material. * from ****
