This is a horrible Norris film, with one of the most annoying appearances at Calvin Levels and a weak script. The characters were terrible, and there is hardly any action in this, plus even Chuck Norris stinks of it! Christopher Neem is very weak as the main villain, and the story was not very interesting, plus it seemed to Norris that it was all fed up, and I do not blame him, as I did! Calvin levels give one of the most annoying movie performances, ever, I could not stand, as I was tempted to rip the tape from my VCR, plus Norris and Levels had no chemistry together! If you are looking for some wonderful martial arts from Norris, do not approach this, however, if you want a film with an uninteresting history, it is unlikely that any action or bad game will look further! This is a horrible Norris film, with one of the most annoying performances that ever existed at the Kelvin levels. Avoid him like the plague! The direction is incredibly bad. Aaron Norris does an incredibly bad job here, without any fuss or thrill, working with the camera and keeping the film at a boring pace! Here is some blood and violence. We receive 2 bloody punctures, a torn heart, an exploding body and several gunshot wounds. Act really bad. Chuck Norris is not AMAZING, as he used to look very bored here, his single body movements are flat, and his game was not so great, and I'm a big fan of Norris, this is his worst! (Norris still rules!). Kelvin Leyves is incredibly annoying, his tearful, mediocre performance annoyed me greatly, I hoped that he would get it well! But, unfortunately, he did not. Christopher Nim is quite weak as the main villain, his voice was steep, but he outplayed! Sheri J. Wilson is beautiful and did well with what she had to do. The rest of the cast are terrible. In general, please avoid this, it is not worth the torture, even if you are a big fan of Norris (like me). BOMB of 5
