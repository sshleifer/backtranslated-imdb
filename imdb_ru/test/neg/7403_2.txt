This film took three hours, including commercials, on the History channel last night. But three weeks passed. These were not cheap, shy, and unintentionally funny descriptions of Dresden bombings. The point is not that the film is deprived of almost the entire context of the Second World War. It’s not even the point that the bombing itself was often created to appear as nothing more than a serious inconvenience for a silly love story. No, it was wooden faceless characteristics that sucked the life out of history. Yes, and the fact that if a film can be compliant, then this is a film about Dresden. Perhaps the best name would be “DRESDEN” - because URIAH HEEP WAS EXPERIENCED. <br /> <br /> This is especially annoying the last moment. Was the bombardment of Dresden a war crime? The creators of this film believe in it. But, as a rule, exhausted, as the Germans approached World War II, they cannot bring themselves to say this without thinking about "peace" and "no more wars anywhere," as if they were Mother Teresa. And, which is also typical of German insults against the British, in particular, there is a cumbersome attempt to humiliate themselves before “British”, while all the “fault” of Dresden falls on one person, Arthur Harris. <br /> <br /> I said one person? Well, not quite. At the beginning of the film there is an exclamation from the main character of Anna, whom we should all sympathize with. "Damned Americans!" She shouts, watching the bombs fall. A few minutes later a warning sounds on the radio stating that the “American terrorist explosion” is being inflicted on the Germans. <br /> <br /> Remember the word "terror". Got it? They are indeed the Americans behind the inhuman attack on the German civilian population. It doesn’t matter that the American strategy of almost all wars in Europe was the “exact” bombardment of industrial and military facilities. It does not matter that they were the British, who enthusiastically used the "local" bombardment of civilian targets in Germany - even before the Germans themselves set their sights on the British. It does not matter that the Americans bombed during the day, having suffered more casualties than the British in order to hit accurate targets, while the British bombed civilians under cover of night. It doesn’t matter that the Americans were, in fact, involved in a real campaign of terrorist bombings by the RAF, which kicked and shouted against it. It doesn’t matter that most American officials, from the FDR to General Doolittle, opposed attacks on civilians, while Churchill and his generals could not wait. <br /> <br /> No, in Dresden, both the Germans and the British, in addition to the “bomber” of Harris, innocent of the doctrine, she hints, created by evil Americans. And only the power and strength of a love story between a German nurse and a downed British bomber pilot can adequately explain the “truth” of the atrocity. Right. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, for younger and probably less readable readers of IMDb, the first and so far the only major literary attempt to give a thoughtful voice to the explosion in Dresden was a pacifist romance. wrote Kurt Vonnegut - an American POW in Dresden during the bombing. I think the German ZDF could not find a pretty nurse for Billy Pilgrim.
