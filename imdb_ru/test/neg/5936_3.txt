Based on the 2007 spy novel David Ignatius, Lies Lie tells the story of a CIA employee Roger Ferris (DiCaprio), who is sent to Jordan to track down Al Qaeda's mastermind, and yet he walks his narrow rope of allegiance to his Jordan hosts and his manipulative American boss, Ed Hoffman (Crowe). <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen trailers can be forgiven for thinking that the story revolves around the action of the double agent and the betrayal of Ferris Hoffman, but in fact the story is much more mundane. Instead, they serve us cold, disgusting, funny broth, while a white, pretty boy, American Ferris, with virtual impunity, moves along the bustling streets of Amman Jordan with a restless look over his shoulder or attracting the attention of local residents. Only during the scene where Ferris takes out his newly emerged Iranian sweetheart for tea, does reality intrude into the fact that the couple is bombarded by the bright eyes of Jordanian men. <br /> <br /> The film’s difficult problems are plot twists that seem designed as nothing more than an addition. Ferris flies to Jordan, Ferris drives out of Jordan, Ferris flies to Washington, Ferris flies to Great Britain, Ferris flies back to Jordan, Hoffman flies to Jordan, Hoffman returns home to take care of his children ?? it goes on. This kind of thing you expect to see in the episode of "Amazing Race", and not in the spy thriller. <br /> <br /> In betraying his mastery, Crowe gained an impressive weight of 63 pounds for the role of the massive Ed Hoffman, thus joining the small selected club of actors, consisting of Robert De Niro and Christian Bale, as those who had exposed themselves massive increase or decrease in weight for their roles. It’s a pity that everyone else didn’t share Crow’s commitment to quality, because if they did, we would have a much better movie than this mess.
