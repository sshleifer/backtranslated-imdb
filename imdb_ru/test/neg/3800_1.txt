Unhappy. Let's talk about the unsuccessful. FOR THE ADVENTURE OF POSEIDON is bad in all respects. Rescuers Michael Kane and Karl Malden decided to tow the wreck of the same name ocean liner with a really squeaky tug. They are challenged by the ruthless Telly Savalas and his gang of machine gun thugs. In this sequel, in the remake of Kane, Malden, and ANOTHER group of survivors of Poseidon, there is the same dangerous journey from a sinking ship. This group includes Shirley Jones, Slim Pickens, Peter Boyle, Shirley Knight and Slim Pickens. Jack Warden plays the blind. Of course, you would like to be blind by seeing this mess. Sally Field is especially annoying when she goes aboard the tug Kane. <br /> <br /> Master of Natural Disasters Irwin Allen not only created this film, but also decided to direct it.
