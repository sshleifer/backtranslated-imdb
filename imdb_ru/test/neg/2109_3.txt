The film begins in Mexico, where the girl is cursed, she spits on snakes through green jelly, and her friend tries all these crazy spells to remove the curse. He simply repeats a terrible language that does nothing, so they decide to cross the border and take the train to get to LA to see their uncle, to remove the curse. Comic gaiety comes. In this film again and again the same snakes! He has garden snakes and pythons that will never bite. They all make rattlesnake sounds that have no meaning. The whole movie has some funny lines, some weak effects, but the most important thing is a great finale that leaves you as WHAM BAM, THAT JUST HAS BEEN HONOR !!!!! The whole movie is about 1, but the ending is 10, so in my crazy math, he gets 3 overall. When nothing else is needed in a blockbuster, grab it for thoughtless entertainment!
