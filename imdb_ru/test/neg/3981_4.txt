This is a great prerequisite for a movie. In general, the plot is very original, interesting, and there is something to think about. However, poor production, obviously a small budget, the crap acting from the protagonist, and a few third-party actors really distract from it, it would be a classic. The future producer should try to restore this story and give this largely indecisive attempt to properly release it.
