The only reason I registered on this site was the opportunity to write a commentary on this film. I felt I had to get rid of my anger by writing it off. <br /> <br /> The film “Babas Bilar” must have been the worst movie I've ever seen. I truly believe that the script could have been a pretty good movie, or at least a good one, but something happened on the line somewhere. What makes it even stranger is that the actors on the paper look pretty decent. Put in practice and the script, and the cast does not deliver. There are a lot of actions, it happens with many things, and you can't help but wonder why this happens. And then the actors, the actors put so much effort that you almost start crying. <br /> <br /> If you have a lot of time, I would say that you can see it. If not, don't.
