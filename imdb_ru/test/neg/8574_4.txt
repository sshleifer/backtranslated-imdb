The main disadvantage of this Spanish slasher / shocker is in its script. The first half hour is a normal effort, creating some tension and an atmosphere of fear and fear. We even have good killings! Then it goes down completely and turns into a whole directory of "your basic slasher-cliché." I have to admit that I was very disappointed because the trailer promised much more. The last thirty minutes consist of several murders and a big run in an abandoned monastery. It was supposed to be much better (although the final scenes in the flooded room are quite decent)! <br /> <br /> First of all, we have a dialogue. This is awful most of the time (there and there was quite a lot of giggling when I saw it), and just enough elsewhere. It is also barely audible in many scenes, drowning under the pressure of sound effects and the soundtrack (however, this may not be so bad after all the silly lines we have to listen to!). There is one line in the whole film that mentions the films “I know what you did last summer”, indicating that the filmmakers wrote it all as one big joke, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> And the end ... well, some will hate it, others will dig. For me, it was basically a question of the first, because the last turn came from nowhere! If the audience were given some clues about the mental status of girls, I would have thought otherwise. It also throws all the logic out the window, because the killer has never been in place for some murders! But, as an avid fan of horror, I learned to live with these discrepancies in Spanish and Italian films. <br /> <br /> But everything is not so bad. The film has a great budgetary character, mainly due to the excellent cinematography (scenes from past times really shine here), hard-editing and an atmospheric soundtrack. Despite the fact that most of the actors are pretty bad, Anita Brim is an exception, making the most of what she has to work with. Presence on the screen! <br /> <br /> And, as I mentioned earlier, fans of such things are horrible enough, and they are usually accompanied by very good special effects with images of water (but the “water theme” “in the end, as a rule, becomes tedious) . <br /> <br /> So at the end of this review, this is a film that is quite funny in the “so bad, it's good” style, and it also pleases the eye. But do not expect too much, because it does not deliver, as you probably think, judging by the descriptions of trailers and stories.
