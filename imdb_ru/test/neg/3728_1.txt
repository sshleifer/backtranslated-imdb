It was without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. And it says a lot, because I saw my share of horrible movies. <br /> <br /> But I have never seen a movie in which every character depicted was a stupid loser. Seriously, throughout the script there was not a single respectable character. As appropriate, the plot was equally lame, without any intelligence. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz would even agree to participate in such nonsense. And although I have not seen all their other films, I have always enjoyed their performances so far. The point is not that the acting was bad, just the whole storyline was idiotic.
