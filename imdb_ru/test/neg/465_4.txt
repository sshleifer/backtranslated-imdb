I must say that I was not impressed, probably because I expected much more from this film. Perhaps the emphasis on religion versus science or the meaning of life, and not just a few lines. So, if you expect to think about something after watching this movie, do not. It is more psychological than philosophical. I vote 4 because of the end, it clears up a bit, and because I really respect the BBC documentaries. There are a couple of very interesting scenes that really gave some meaning. It was a brilliant idea - to add it to the film, connected with the theory of evolution, it is very unfortunate that this was not the main theme. Ah, I just forgot to say that for more than 1 hour the film is rather boring and cruel.
