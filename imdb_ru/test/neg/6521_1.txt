This film is by far the worst ever to exist. The storyline is weak and never shows what happens to people after 20 people are left in their hands. It really bothers me. It drags on without meaning, very boring. The only good thing was the cast, WOW, a lot of great actors and actresses. But apart from the fact that it was terrible, terrible and disgusting, do yourself a favor, don't watch it. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1 of 10
