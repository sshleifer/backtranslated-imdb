“Happy Days” were created and broadcast from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s and seem to become more and more ridiculous with age. During the broadcast, most of the viewers who grew up in the 1950s were middle-aged with families, and the scenes at Mel's diner probably brought them artificial nostalgia. Fons was, of course, the coolest of the coolest (although the actor Henry Winkler still never learned to ride a motorcycle). Richie Cunningham was a completely American blond child who would probably be elected as the president of the student community. Potsi was Richie's best friend - probably the star of the show should have a best friend. And Ralph Malf was an awkward Fonz assistant, if not the whole group. I liked it when Fonz beat poor Ralph Malf. And there was Mel, a middle-aged draper, managing Mel's diner. And, of course, who could forget the appearance of Mork? Is it really the 1950s? Ironically, films shot in the 1950s, such as Rebel Without a Cause and Wild, became better with age and portray the period more honestly than this show, which was filmed 20 years after the period that depicts. <Br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the TV show "Happy Days" is not in the same league as "Rebel Without a Cause" or "American Graffiti". “Happy Days” may have covered some aspects of the 1950s with their diner, hamburgers, cool cars, and sticky plaid shirts, but this is rather a nostalgic idealism, made strictly for laughter, and not for honest portrayal. “American graffiti” had something to say about young Americans in the 1950s, while “Happy Days” seemed more about how the elderly of the 1970s wanted the 1950s to be similar. The result was some kind of diluted fabrication, which in fact has nothing to do with the 1950s. “Happy Days” is, at best, a comedic fantasy with an artificial culture of the 1950s as a backdrop. As another reviewer noted, an all-American child, Richie Cunningham, would probably have been punished for making friends with such people as Fonzi. And Mel would probably have banned Fonzi from entering his diner. <br /> <br /> Short story: “Happy Days” was originally a pilot called “Love in Happy Days”, which was rejected for broadcast. Comedy pilots who had sex and romance themes that were not aired, sometimes appeared on the infrequently broadcast Love American Style show, which was often broadcast instead of baseball games that were raining, or other unexpected cancellations of programs and / or changes. In short, “Love American Style” is a one-time show that contained all these one-episode comedic pilots who never made their debut. “Love in happy days” appeared like the show “I love American style” somewhere in the early 1970s, but at that time television executives could not foresee how popular the show about young people of the 1950s would be, especially during its heyday. comedy shows on middle-aged people, such as The Mary Tyler Moore Show (and his follow-up by-products, such as Rod), The Bob Newhart Show, and All in the Family. (How things have changed since most television sitcoms talk about young people, and the industry avoids most shows about middle-aged people such as the plague!) <br /> <br /> Subsequently, one of the young stars of Love in Happy Days ", A children's actor from Andy Griffith Show named Ron Howard, got the opportunity to make a film about young people, filmed in 1959, titled American Graffiti, shot by relatively unknown George Lucas, whose previous" THX 1138 " horror bombed at the box office. Even when the premiere was Kazan's cinema directors, studios again could not understand how a film about young people in the 1950s could become popular because it “does not fit” with what was popular in the past, although they did not understand that most of the audience was young in the 1950s. As everyone knows, the film became a hit, and studio leaders acknowledged that they completely misjudged their audience. Somewhere during the dramatized performance of American Graffiti, television executives realized that there was a comedy pilot in their repository, very similar to "America skie graffitti ". They brought him back with the original cast, as well as with Henry Winkler in the role of “The Fonz”, renamed it “Happy Days”, and the rest is the history of television, since it became one of the most popular shows of the 1970s. <br /> "Happy Days" now seem ridiculous. Characters are flat and cardboard, they are never what they are on the surface. The problems they deal with are trivial. And their reactions seem meaningless and even stupid. Nowadays, the character Fonza seems like a caricature of "Fonza". Was the idea of ​​becoming a kind of parody of Marlon Brando in Dick? Looking at the show with a fresh look, I feel that the producers really missed a great opportunity to present the 1950s with depth and realism, which can still be fun and interesting. Instead, manufacturers chose cheap laughter for quick money. This is definitely a show that did not stand the test of time. "American graffiti" has many external manifestations of "happy days", but it had an advantage. He was honest about the characters and their problems. "Happy Days" looked like "American Graffiti", but could not conquer them.
