Tedium as soon as the French can do it. I first checked my watch after 7 minutes, and leaving 143 minutes, I also thought about going out. I will not even try to discuss the incoherence of the “plot” or the inability of the characters to be representative, because after about 1 hour I realized that none of this mattered. It was not just self-indulgence or pretentiousness, it was a vacuum. Spiritual vacuum. This film has no saving grace, no pleasant character, nothing funny and nothing sad. It is not smart enough to be dramatic, and there is not the slightest moment that would be even a little farcical. The most intriguing in this film is how he managed to get mostly glowing and positive reviews. These reviews have deceived me, but you should not be, gentle reader. All I want for Christmas is three hours ago.
