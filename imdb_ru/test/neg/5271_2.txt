Well, <br /> <br /> First, as many reviewers noted, this is an excerpt from Martin Cahill’s story, first presented by BBC and John Boorman’s film “The General”, which is an Excellent film far beyond that. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey’s acting cast was really good in terms of British and Irish acting talent, especially Peter Mullan — but that was completely wasted. The characters were with ** p! As for Kevin Spacey, he was not an attractive con artist, but nothing really significant or significant. <br /> <br /> Not so much to buy this movie. The best bits are jokes and tricks made from other films that he breaks. Compare notes about this film and “The General” - I would be interested to know what others think. <br /> <br />
