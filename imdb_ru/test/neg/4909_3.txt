This film is the third attempt to convincing, capricious thriller and fails with a bang. He almost managed to keep my attention, because the main character was seen slowly and predictably, violating all the vital rules that he conveniently set at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> But this is the last 25 minutes or so. that things are really starting to spin. The vaguely believable storyline (and this is generous) becomes completely ridiculous, as new characters suddenly appear from nowhere, and random and strange events are never explained. <br /> <br /> It would not be so bad if the script weren’t “It’s so audacious, acting (despite the strong British cast) and such a boring direction. This is not an example of good British filmmaking, and whether Tarantino’s bat should not make it a century, at least, compared to his earlier work. <br /> <br /> My advice in this case, if it is difficult to keep from, do not waste your efforts. If you're British, like me, and he's in your local video store, stay away. Perhaps go to the video titled "American Beauty" - now this is an example of the great British direction.
