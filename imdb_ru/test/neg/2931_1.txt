I believe that this film was a terrible waste of my time, and I find out about it after watching it 5 times in class. This film does not show what absolutely perfectly happened in these times. no one can truly say that these things happened with the letter. in any case, the only good part would be the actors, even if they really were crappy. They read the script without expression. pretty boring. I would prefer to watch the game at school. so I definitely would never see this movie in my whole life again. it’s a complete waste of time if you don’t want your time to be wasted and if you would like to see an unrealistic view of what happened in 1981
