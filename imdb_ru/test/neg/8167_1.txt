It’s hard to make a bad movie with the "loser at last" sports theme, but this movie has been a great success. My mind amazes how senseless and boring this film is. <br /> <br /> I think the director could not decide whether it was a runner or a coach. It ends with nothing. In the end, who cares? No character has a pleasant personality. There is nothing in the film that could excite you. Even the “bad guy” is not so bad. (I think that he is in two scenes, and, it seems, on some barbituate.) I think he asks her, once and for all, to leave the carriage and practice with him. Then he sort of asks her to move in with him. that's all. Conflict! Voltage! What will she do? !! <br /> <br /> What about running? Has the director ever seen a real marathon? Christina’s form is so wrong that it’s absurd, just like the form of the supposed “champion” she competes with (character without lines. -Can they hire, you know, a real WINNER?) <br /> <br /> - running speed is beyond comprehension. Did they run or go fast? This is actually funny. I can literally walk back faster than they ran in the big race. Maybe it was too difficult to move cameras at real speed? <br /> <br /> Another absurdity: (spoiler, I suppose) At some point in the big race, two leading women inexplicably fall, at the same time, time. What they fell for is a mystery. Maybe they both just got tired and fell? -And then they get up, but they don’t start running again, maybe 30 seconds. Oh yes, very realistic. This ridiculous event does not even add tension, since the other runners are not near, and, moreover, at this moment you are numb in a state of catatonia. <br /> <br /> I especially liked how all four of her male teammates, all highly skilled athletes, drop out of a big race because of charlie horses, or stretched tendons, or something just as incredible. <br /> <br /> But who cares? In this film, there is almost no tension, no resolution, nothing. Some woman runner, absolutely impersonal, found an old, boring trainer with a past failure that was barely hinted at. They train a lot. She is not happy. They train a little more. She wins the big race. Woopie. <br /> <br /> My description is actually more interesting than the movie itself. I just saved you 90 minutes. Avoid this like the plague.
