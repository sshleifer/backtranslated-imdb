This is a 1990s television show, not a 1979 film. It looks like these are three episodes with a total duration of just under 90 minutes. to that. I didn't care about that too much. I just felt that there was no story, and there was nothing in terms of excitement or drama. I watched how much time passed on my DVD player, since I was very bored. I also thought that some of the dialogues were, to put it mildly, not very good. Plus, I thought the game leaves much to be desired. but it is only me, however, that is good clean, wholesome family fun. here, of course, there is nothing offensive. children will probably enjoy it. For me, Black Stallion 4/10
