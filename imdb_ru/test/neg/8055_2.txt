There are too many things in this movie. Another reviewer comments on the fragmented, episodic nature of the film as a reflection of the director's memories - this is fine if it was written and executed that way. Instead, we get a direct narrative - sometimes - that jumps around, below and above, leaves us in some cases dangling, interrupts the flow with unnecessary digressions in other cases, and the rest simply does not work. <br /> <br /> There are also some plot details that just don’t work. For example, why drag a body onto a beach in an urban area in broad daylight rather than at night? Why leave your flat sheet on the body? Why did the artist, who knew Joe's character for a short time, decide to leave him “everything” (even if it were not much)? This site was poorly designed to make this point work. In this respect, why should even a person be an invalid or an artist in addition to providing money and gratuitous scenes of nude pose? Could he as well be a photographer or an opera composer? In this respect, how does someone evaluate an apartment at the Opera House - especially without some clear connection with the Opera? The coincidences are also too obvious and unclear and inexplicable. Why do guys take everything in stock and "disappear". If Tim was a 10-year-old schoolmate in a small town like Bangor, how could Joe lose him for 8 years, especially if they knew each other well enough for one to recommend the other for work. <br /> <br /> Some other subjects (for example, a mother and her boyfriend (s) and a sister who wanted to escape) felt like apostates. There are some good ideas that could make the function fully developed or Interesting shorts could. At the conclusion of this film there is little meaning and offers even less.
