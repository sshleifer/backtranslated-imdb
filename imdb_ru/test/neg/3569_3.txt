Why waste time on this awkward and shy movie? From time to time, after an hour of tedious plot and amateur acting, we begin to receive fragments of the big band that Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey made, individually and together, by the great musicians they were. From time to time - in a jam session with Art Tatum, with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra performing "Marie", and an outstanding musician, Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestra performing with Bob Eberle and Helen O'Connell singing "Green Eyes", - we get the full song. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is freely available, and the DVD is just as bad as the acting. There are only four chapters in my copy. This means that you can get arthritis in your fast finger, trying to quickly get to the place where there are good things. The swamp you pass through is a Hollywood version of the life and battle of two Dorsey. Tommy, excellent on the trombone, and Jimmy, excellent on the saxophone, usually could not stand each other. In 1935, they finally fell apart, and Tommy founded his own orchestra. Each of them did better than they did together. They reconciled when their father died in the forties, where the film ends. Later they managed to put up with each other in the orchestra led by Tommy, when the big band era disappeared in the fifties. Tommy died in 1956 at the age of 51, vomiting in his sleep after drinking, pills and a big meal. Jimmy died of cancer at 53 in 1957. Jimmy was incredibly talented and, apparently, rather calm guy. Tommy was extremely talented and, apparently, was often a powerful idiot. But good music compensates for many flaws, and the sounds of the Big Band, created by the two, helped to define the swing era. <br /> <br /> They play themselves in the film, and we see how they evolve from a fight (with child actors) to adult men fighting and fighting with each other. The film is not only filled with their two parents, played by those Hollywood Irish cliches, Sarah Olgood and Arthur Shields, who just want their boys to get along with each other, but also the main storyline, which tells the novel by Janet Blair. as a childhood friend of Dorseys, who becomes a vocalist with them and serves as an almost full-time middleman and assistant, and William Landigan - a pianist. Blair is not bad at all. However, if you want to understand why she never became the star she probably should have been, just look at films like this one in which her studio shot her. No wonder she left Hollywood. Landigan just takes a seat. <br /> <br /> How bad is this movie, except when we can actually hear the Dorsey game? Well, here's a song written specifically for the film and transmitted to Blair Warle. This is called "For me." <br /> <br /> For me ... you are the rose of the rosary ... the rising of the rising sea ... the shining of the star ... <br /> <br /> the rose of the rosary? The film does not get better than this, and it can not get worse. However, if you like the doorway and if the price is right ... well, in retrospect, I wouldn't have bought it anyway. The highlight for me is Eberle and O'Connell, singing Green Eyes. You can watch them on You Tube for free. You will also find there are a lot of each of Dorsey. I'd like to know.
