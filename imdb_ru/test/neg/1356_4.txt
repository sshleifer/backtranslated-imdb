Really Crazy Even if you havenâ€™t seen the original George Cukor film with Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine and the cast of a thousand other stars, you can refuse this forced, politically correct, depressing comedy. It depresses for various reasons. Meg Ryan for one. What did she do to herself? Her face can barely move. This alone removes her from Norma Shearer. Annette Bening should sue DP and Debra Messing, what the hell was she doing here? Actresses without communication in the subconscious of the public are trying to pass for friends, completely unconvincing. Eva Mendez as Joan Crawford is an outrageous mistake. What a terrible idea! Her character is like a trans-gender without taste and subtlety. It is strange to think that a woman has adapted and directed these women. The only positive things I can mention are the short but very funny looks of Bette Midler and Cloris Lichman as housekeeper.
