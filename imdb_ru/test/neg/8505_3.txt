I like movies on gay themes, where the characters are not stereotypically gay, and this is what attracted me to this film, besides to the main role, and this is the only reason I put another star in this film than it deserves ( although not because of his role in the film, let me tell you). Many people complain about the cinematography, but the sensation of video in a video camera added a certain "underground" quality to me, and there are several scenes, usually around sunset or sunrise, and among the trains that would make any screen of the film turn red. . <br /> <br /> But the acting is cardboard, the music is repetitive (I listened to the soundtrack from another movie in the second half of the movie), you have to wait almost twenty minutes for any dialogue, and then itâ€™s embarrassing and amateur. The graffiti theme could have made this film gorgeous if it were gracefully exploited, and the art itself was more intriguing, but it is not. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, there is no climax; from the very beginning there was no plot. The film just crawls back into its shell of silence and dies. Unforgettable movie.
