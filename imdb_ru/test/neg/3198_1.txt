Anyone who thinks this film is great needs desperately to be seen. It amazes me that this movie was made as a joke. It has nothing good. Props cost about 10 dollars, and the whole set can fall at any time. Why are such films made in the first place? It also had two of the most annoying characters I’ve ever met in a little boy on a spaceship and cattle from the 20th century. This film is almost as bad as “Cool Like Ice”, starring incredibly talented vanilla “misunderstood” ice.
