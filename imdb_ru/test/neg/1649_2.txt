The perfect double bill for the awfully banal Beverly Hillbillis is the same disgusting, misplaced comedy Son of the Law. Country girl Rebecca goes to wild California to attend college, but she is being attacked by a lifestyle. “Resident Advisor” “Crawling” helps her to get comfortable, and soon they became good friends. Beck decides to bring the stupid "Crawl" home for Thanksgiving with the obvious results of "fish out of water." <br /> <br /> The only other comic angle that Steve Rush (aptly named) wants is sexual in nature. By this he beats us, but to no avail. Both comic aspects fail, and you know that the film gropes when Crawl steals a combine and writes its name in a cornfield. <br /> <br /> Dramatically, the film is also failing, with several family attempts and personal advice from crawling misfires. Between them, Paulie Shore and Karla Gugino manage to raise a couple of smiles, but a little more, while the rest of the actors are just food. The problem is that it's actually almost impossible to fall in love with “Crawling,” and you will find that you spend the whole movie thinking about why Rebecca would like to spend a minute with him. However, if you are a fan of unreasonable comedy, “Son-in-law” is right on top. <br /> <br /> Sunday, November 10, 1996 - T.V.
