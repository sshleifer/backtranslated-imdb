Milla stands out in this film with her personal sense of style and the way her clothes hang. I learned to hate that wrinkled little three-year-old face that she does when she pretends to cry. This makes any points she tries to make as a serious actress quickly disappears. Of course, in the film with BALDWIN and Denise, she still shines like a mature actor. David seems to have done Woody Allen with the help of Howdy Doody. Not a single word or gesture throughout the film seemed sincere or even sincere. "How Harry Met Sally" and "Two Weddings and a Funeral," even "Sleepless in Seattle" were scripts, locations and actors. The script seemed like a chain of bad and rude jokes, separated by MANY. The places seemed to be a few blocks away from each other. In this dish of indie film, only two actors, Milla and the girl who played the chick, who was in the stars. I watched most of this for the first time with the sound off, just watching Milla. This picky was old when I first saw him, and this is a stupid excerpt from the song "How to succeed in business, without really trying."
