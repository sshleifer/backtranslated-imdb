I hoped that it would be the caliber of Das Boot and reflect the absolute realism created by the recognized German director Leni Riefen Stahl in her documentaries, unfortunately, I was monumentally disappointed. The storyline is implausible and can not be gullible. Air Force pilot shot down and somehow gets to the hospital in Dresden. Anna, a nurse whose father runs a hospital and is about to get engaged to the doctor she works with, falls in love with a pilot and they make love. The following evening, at a luxurious engagement, the pilot turns out to be disguised as a German officer and dances with Anna. Although the director did a good job, for me this is a soap opera of the lowest order.
