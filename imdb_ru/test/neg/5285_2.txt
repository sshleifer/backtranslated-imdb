Perhaps this is one of the best, most terrible films in the entire history of cinema, because everything in this film is so bad and accidental, it's funny, and I don’t know how to treat this. karate from the porch and shouting "pancakes", it's intriguing. Since many have already described the plot and all I'm going to do is to summarize the quality of the film with one quote: “I am a park caretaker who is going to offend you”. yes, enough said? If you are looking for quality or a really scary movie, I do not recommend it. but if you like such films, then I think you will like it ... I don’t know how, but I think some people will want it.
