The actors are so soft that they are almost impossible to distinguish from each other (Polina Kehl said about this film: “The actors have names, but they are really anonymous”), and the special effects are really bad. They feign weightlessness with people hanging from cables and repeating the trick that allowed Fred Aster to dance on the ceiling at the Royal Wedding (but none of these guys moved well enough to make it look convincing). <br /> <br /> The essence of the film is that one of the characters, an aviation tycoon, is trying to convince some of the other “industry giants” to go with him to the Moon Rocket consortium, and he shows them the cartoon Woody Dyatla, which how a rocket works at grade 2 level! (And to think that Robert Heinlein was working on the script ...) <br /> <br /> The only plus is that the production design is able to convey a kind of sensuality of “Amazing Stories”, and even this is done much better in the next film of the director (George Pala) "When worlds collide," which looks like a bad game, but much more interesting. However, Pal's best science fiction film should be The Time Machine.
