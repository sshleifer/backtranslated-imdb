Hollywood has shot a lot of weird films over the years, but no more than this. WHY this film was made, I will never know, and how Paramount would have thought he would sell tickets in 1947. This is the strangest mix of genres I have seen in a long time, a film that really does not know if it is trying to be a serious military drama or a Viennese comedy operetta. <br /> <br /> It tells how a British spy tried to derive a poisonous gas formula from Germany in the days before the start of World War II. Ray Milland, a good actor, was stuck playing a role like a fugitive from Monty Python, and all this is a very exaggerated communication in English in a preparatory school. In Germany, he meets the gypsy Marlene Dietrich, who helps him to travel undercover, as, of course, another Gypsy. She plays her role as a typical gypsy caricature of the Viennese operetta, like the other "gypsies" in the film. But there are Nazis who are not funny at all. And then Milland discovers that he is starting to think like a gypsy, and this is not considered a joke. Sometimes music for light comedy, sometimes for drama. Every time the Nazis appear, Wagner plays in the film, which in itself is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This film could be a comedy or serious about the fate of the Gypsies and seriously show how the Nazis treated them. Both are hinted at in this film, but neither is pursued. What we have left is a really strange mixture of genres, which must have embarrassed everyone (except the director). <br /> <br /> Strange.
