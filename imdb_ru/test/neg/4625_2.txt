This movie starts off great, and you get stuck. Most of the acting is good until Patrick Swayze appears (with his Texas game - everyone else sounds British, even a Muslim), and proves that he cannot play. You can live with it until the first battle scene, where they all fall apart. Why does Patrick Swayze fight the villains with an ax when he just stuck his sword into the ground 5 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> A few minutes later the swords shift further, and people who know about other people should not know about. Other observers mentioned “Problem production”, and this is evident. <br /> <br /> In the end, I didn't even care about the battle scenes, of course, the CGI Dragon was weak, but the storyline was the biggest disappointment.
