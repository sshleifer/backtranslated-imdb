I was very disappointed in this movie. The director showed some talent in his other endeavors, but it seemed to be a filler. Perhaps this was a deep meaning, but it seems to me that this is nothing more than a director who has access to some toys. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend his other work to people, but, of course, not this one. Watching this, I kept thinking that it would begin to grow after the initial slow period, but this did not happen. At the end of the film, I was neither entertained, nor excited, nor thought about things in a new way. I could only say to myself: “What was that?” <br /> <br /> There were some really amazing parts in the film, but they were not enough to justify re-watching the film.
