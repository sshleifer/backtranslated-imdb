This western / musical / comedy is not one of the best in the genre that I have seen. I found it too slow. He just got to the inevitable end. I also found that it is not related. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Randolph Scott is the headliner here, and Lloyd Bridges also plays a major role. but for my money, Edgar Buchanan is the best of the group. Buchanan has appeared in many westerns in his day, providing comic relief many times as he does in this film. I also liked Ann Dvorak as Rita. Otherwise, I can't think of what to recommend this film. The film is based on the novel by Ernest Heikok, who also wrote the novel "Stagecoach", who was mad in the film with the same name in 1939 and remade in 1966 and again in 1986. In my opinion, the version of the Stagecoach of 1939, one of the best films ever made. as for the city of Abilene, my vote is 3/10
