This film was stupid, and it was more than that. It is about this guy who curses him, and he turns into a gorilla. I had to see how bad it was because of the name. Before this guy turns into a gorilla, he gets married. I was a little upset because she was not the gorilla's bride: now she is the gorilla's wife. She was supposed to marry him when he was a gorilla, then the name would make more sense. In the jungle, too, there are all these people, and they all want to leave. This is not just film B, this is more like movie Z. I have not even seen a banana for a wedding gift. Oh, right, he was not yet damned.
