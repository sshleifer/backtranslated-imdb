I did not see this film when it originally came out, but there were a few songs with a common name, and this term is still used from time to time, and I thought that there must be something in the film, so I dug it up and gave an idea. Now I would like the approximate hour and forty-five minutes of my life back (it seemed much longer). There was nothing particularly bad in the film, the acting was good, without large plot holes, of course, there was no big plot to have holes in the film. There was nothing special about the movie. There was some kind of chemistry between them, but nothing was convincing in their relationship; Nothing interesting about their story. Toward the end, when he tries to chase the train to catch his runaway romance, neither my wife nor I wanted him to catch her. Honestly, we thought that they were better off with each other, and if they did come back, we really didn’t care. So what does this say about this love story, when even a 25-year-old juicy romantic, like my wife, did not have emotional attachments to a relationship. I should have left it in the “missed” category. <br /> <br /> Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html
