I was struck by the terrible game and the script for this film. All characters seem to be immobile due to personal problems â€” more like deer in headlights. They fuss and complain about their emotions when decisive action is required. I found myself screaming on the TV screen, trying to wake them up to their position and do something! The plot line is implausible. Every time there is a key decision to be made by the lead character, one of the other characters has to raise all the problems with an obvious decision, as if to further complicate the decision is a proven melodramatic trick and just wants to make you moan. Obviously, the meaning of the decision is obvious - you do not need to treat the audience as idiots. In general, there are too many emotional melodramas in the whole film.
