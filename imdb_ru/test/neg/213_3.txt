Well, for example, I thought that the trailer was pretty good, so I was hoping for this film, plus with the cast I was sure that he could not get less than 6 in my books. However, I am annoyed by this story for half an hour ... exactly where normal films become good, this film has reached the bottom. <br /> <br /> SPOILER * The guy everyone is trying to help is so concerned about getting other people in the middle of the noise that he turns to his colleagues to save the tramp and then locks himself in one of the armored trucks . Not only is he constantly trying to attract the attention of other people, with which he endangers more people and, in short, he is ultimately responsible not only for the death of a tramp, but also for the fact that the policeman was shot and abducted by his younger brother ... oh, and all 5 of his colleagues die a shameful death. <br /> <br /> But in the end, he is HAPPY, because he came to himself halfway through the efforts, and that if all his colleagues are now dead, they do not stick to the plan and become a millionaire. This film tried to be so politically correct that it made me sick! Destroyed a good story. Shame really.
