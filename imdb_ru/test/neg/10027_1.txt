Even by the reduced standards of the 80s slasher films, this one stinks. An ordinary pack of overwhelmed teenagers heads for the “forbidden” part of the forest, which burned down in the 1940s and apparently left the only evil survivor. Fast forward (actually, you will want to rewind most of this mess) until today, when a couple of vacationers are undressed; teenagers follow their trail, while a half-worried park ranger (lunatic Jackie Coogan) and his healthier cohort (who spends a lot of time tuning his banjo) succeed in part by directing our attention from the running yards of nature’s mill. Finally, more kills - but nothing that you have not seen a million times before. If you want to see the children killed, choose SLEEPAWAY CAMP or the first FRIDAY on the 13th.
