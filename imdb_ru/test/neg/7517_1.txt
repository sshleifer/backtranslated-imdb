This film is a shame. How can you take one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time and turn it into some kind of indecisive love story. The whole beginning of the film was not in the history of H.G. Wells and should not have been. Also Eloi were made completely wrong. They built houses or created some kind of real society. They did not care about each other at all. It was an important part of the story. The way they formed a world in which there were no difficulties and complex emotions. They hardly knew about Morlok. I do not know why this film was made the way it was, but some stories should be told as they are or left alone.
