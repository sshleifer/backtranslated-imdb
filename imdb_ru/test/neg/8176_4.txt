This may not be the worst movie that ever won the best picture, but it's there. Well, if you think about it, this is probably the worst movie that ever got the best picture. However, you expect it to be a decent movie. It really is, though, if it is doubtful as well. The film contains almost no depth and is just “funny” after “funny”, if you want to call it that. At first it is very interesting, but it seems that everything is exaggerated on many levels. <br /> <br /> There wasn’t a spectacular scene on the set, but it was quite interesting to see Charlton Heston in his first lead role. It seemed to me that many characters, like the tone of the film, annoy after a while. I really liked James Stewart as a philosophical clown. He saved the film for me because he gave him the much-needed extra layer. Unfortunately, after Stewart there was nothing else. <br /> <br /> The direction of such a respected Cecil DeMille did not exist for me. At times I found this film trivial, and its use by Betty Hatton was a mistake. From time to time the film looked very good, but it did not create that magical feeling that the classics should have. Scripture was actually quite good, considering how small the film was. <br /> <br /> The term Hollywood Trash has emerged from such films. There is no depth, no real attempt to attract emotions from the audience and there is simply no artistic value for the film. Then of course there are a lot of holes in the plot everywhere. This film is constantly annoying and upset. Through this film, I even felt that much of what I was watching was not only an inaccurate depiction of circus life, but also the opposite of how it really is. Why this winning best picture is not clear to me, but it is not the same as the first or last time Oscar made and made a mistake.
