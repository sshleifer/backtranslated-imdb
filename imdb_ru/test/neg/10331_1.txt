This ridiculous action, so known as the acting debut of the future famous Hollywood starlet Sandra Bullock, is so full of holes that you can easily be suspected of infestation by termites. The storyline is incomprehensible and very poorly thought out. Production values ​​stink cheese. In fact, the general lack of production values ​​would be better ... at least, the film would seem more rude. ADR is ridiculously bad and omnipresent in the film. It is a controversial question whether or not any of the dialogue tracks from the actual shooting was used. <br /> <br /> The performances are mostly terrible, although there are a few exceptions. In these exceptions, however, the actions are undermined by the fact that the director obviously gave the actors bad leadership and sometimes forced them to act completely out of character. (i.e., characters move from a passive state to a panic state in the blink of an eye. Bad direction.) In addition, the constant "weapon sound effects" (downloadable magazines, slide platoon, etc.) are fully used too often and often completely not synchronized with the actions on the screen. Add to this stupid "bad guy" vocal distortions for the main villain (mainly so that you KNOW that he is the villain in this incomprehensible mess of the film), and you have a recipe for disaster. <br /> <br /> Situations in the film go far beyond the standard “suspension of disbelief” and become completely ridiculous. One lead character spends most of the film tied to a chair before he DECIDES to use a butterfly knife tucked into a sock to free itself. So my questions ... why he didn't do it before, and why he even has a butterfly knife. He wasn't searched? RIGHT. This is one of a hundred examples of completely ridiculous situations that are somehow entangled in this 90-minute package. <br /> <br /> In general, “The Hangmen” plays like an unbearably bad TV R-rating film from the “80s. If not for the subsequent success of Sandra Bullock, this would NEVER find its way to the DVD. But this is so, so my only advice is to stay away. Watching this movie can actually affect your IQ.
