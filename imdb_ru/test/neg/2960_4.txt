This exhausted and sloppy spy melodrama with two clowns (one idealistic, one drug) Californian children who divulge the secrets of the KGB never seem to gain momentum to withstand any tension and anxiety before he dies a very slow death in two hours. The finished product of John Schlesinger creates the impression that most of the time he slept in his directorâ€™s chair, as the film lags behind and the actors sleep, with the exception of very annoying because of the great work of Sean Penn. <br /> <br /> Boys and friends from the altar of childhood Chris (Tim Hutton) and Dalton (Penn) are developing a plan to sell KGB secrets when Chris gets a job that gives him access to top-secret government materials. Frustrated by what he sees in US intervention in international affairs, idealist Chris and Dalton, hungry for drugs, come into contact with the Russians and begin to collect secret material. When Chris decides what he wants, things start to fall apart at an inadequate pace. <br /> <br /> The Eighties were not kind to respected director John Schlesinger. In the 1960s and 1970s, he shot a series of critically acclaimed films in both England and America, but then in 1981 Honky Ton Freeway appeared, and this was the beginning of the end. Falcon and Snowman more or less closed it. Due to the lack of expectations of Marathon and high-quality performances (Hoffman Voight, Christie, Jackson, Finch, Olivier), which he persuaded from the leads in the past, Falcon goes in a circle most of the way. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn chews landscapes from beginning to end in such a disgusting way that you encourage his tormentors to do more with him. Tim Hutton is controlled by his limited acting footage, and most of his scenes show the need for more rehearsals. Lori Singer, in the role of friend Hatton, plays with Schlesinger most of the way to film her empty expressions. When she experiences emotions, you understand why. Only David Suchet, as a KGB officer on duty with astute introspective presence and restraint, feels good.
