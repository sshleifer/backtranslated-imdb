This is a story about a police maniac who, for some reason, became interested in a young college student and his friends. After they report him to their boss, who, in turn, suspends him in anticipation of a psychiatric examination, he finds an opportunity to psychologically torture them when, by a bet, the children break into the guard at the department store and open the door. Only they are locked in the store with the eccentric. Murders and riots begin, and the children run, trying to survive until the morning when they can escape. <br /> <br /> “Dangerous Game” could have become a successful psycho-fighter with feline mice, probably if it was installed elsewhere. The idea of ​​a psychotic cop stalking a bunch of innocent teenagers in a department store just didn't work. Especially when he comes face to face with his quivering prey quite often, and yet, quite often he does not do anything serious. There was no real confrontation that would suffice for this kind of story, and would probably work better if, for example, adolescents were free in the neighborhood and stayed to stand up for themselves against this perversion (especially if it took several days , as long as he makes them all more paranoid ... although it goes without saying, even this is a cliche). <br /> <br /> What a pity that it could not be the best thriller, given the catchy cast of the young Australian characters. Even a frivolous adventure, despite the villain’s madness interspersed with the painting, could even make it more satisfactory. Instead, it all started anew, and, of course, he had many sequences of actions, but they were on the verge of ridiculous.
