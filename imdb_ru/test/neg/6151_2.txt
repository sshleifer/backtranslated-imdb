I saw this movie when he first went to the movies. We were all looking forward to when Mark Hamill would resume his career, but we came out with the desire that it did not bother us. After about half an hour, many came out. I would also like to. The basic premise seems to be in order, but the plot was ridiculous and tortuous, and ends halfway through. This is a completely unforgettable film, not a film for which you want to pay. If you're really bored and it's on TV, then it will help you kill a couple of hours (or help you fall asleep!). 2/10
