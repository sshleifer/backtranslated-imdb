I am one of those gluttons when it comes to comedies these days - I will still check them from time to time. My observation is that most of them are not very funny, even those that are in large networks that receive High ratings, I just don’t understand who finds them teeming with ridiculous. Although some made me smile, none of them made me laugh out loud, I usually switch the channel in a few minutes. Now on the FOX network, they are releasing new shows, such as a change of underwear, for some reason they think they can make a good comedy film, it’s wrong to make mistakes. They beat this dead horse so much that they hired anyone they could find to write a crappy pilot with a bad dialogue and just confuse him. Let's take a quick look at the last piece of junk that Fox released. titled “War of the House” <br /> <br /> I watched for about 5 minutes and it was generous. In this particular episode, the daughter tells her parents that they are scolding "I'm already an adult." Dad is fed up and tells her: “Okay, okay, go and do what you want, If you mess up, it's your problem” to which she replies: “Well, I think you're crazy, but hey, at least I didn’t get AIDS ”(cue track of laughter, you can’t be a live audience if they don’t pay applause for such garbage) - I found a crack about not having AIDS, to be in such bad taste. Well, hey, at least I no longer need to watch this shit. Take a hint of FOX, stop wasting your time on sitcoms. Well, you have the Simpsons, but now he is getting really old and tired.
