I rarely see a film with such a cast, such a potentially strong story, based on a bestseller that was so weak and to some extent imperceptible ... <br /> <br /> The premise of the story looks like a novel by Brent Easton Ellis - a lot of drug abuse, hopelessness, and suicidal tragedy, when young Elizabeth Würzel (played by Christina Ricci) tries to cope with the fact that she is a suicide loser, who seems unable to come to terms with the fact that she’s mostly pathetic to Being such a child ... <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci plays not only tragic characters, but also a tragic actor, whose sobs and squeals for the most part of the film actually make you want to scream - to kill yourself and let us go to the commercials ... The director will not help, because he gives absolutely no tempo, and the story seems so divided that you can’t even imagine what this damn girl really does. about. The director obviously was in Prozac when shooting this film imitation, and therefore allowed the film to run on autopilot, turning it into an unbearable mess. <br /> <br /> The only redemptive traits are sympathetic Jason Biggs as the Würzel boyfriend (who Fortunately decided to get rid of the self-centered self-centered egoist and the incredibly good Jessica Lange as a weeping mother. , director and terrible accomplices. Pure class. <br /> <br /> I don’t know if it really was Wurzel or who it was, but the film successfully made me completely uninterested in her works. <br /> <br /> B in the end I finished watching this movie and right away u started thinking: OK. time to watch something that is actually about real problems ...
