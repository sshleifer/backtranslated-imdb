This film played in the Lifetime Movie Network last month, and I decided to check it out. I watched the first 20 minutes, and then turned it off, because I'm sorry, but the holes in the plot, which are an integral part of the plot of the film, make the film only garbage. <br /> <br /> A film about a woman who accidentally rolls a child on a bicycle on the road, leaves to get help, returns only to find out what he is called “run and run”, and hunts for a “monster” who wounded (eventually killed) her. /> <br /> This is a film about a woman in a rich district, which has 2 small students and is an active, sociable woman, but in order for this film to work, you need to be believable, so that she doesn’t own a cell phone. Sorry, but this is a complete BS, especially when everyone seems to have one - they used their own to call 911 when they found a girl lying on the side of the road - when our leading woman left the crime scene to call 911 pay phones. When the lead woman returns, the ambulance is already next to the girl, and they talk about how terrible the man who hit and left her. <br /> <br /> Just VOLUME. Sorry, but I do not want to buy, that this woman does not have a mobile phone, which is necessary for the film to work. Please do not insult my intelligence film, thank you. Maybe, if this happened in 1970 or 1960, I would buy it, but this is clearly a modern film (at that time of 1999). .. But wait, if she had a mobile phone, there would be no film. Pff. <br /> <br /> A woman clearly knows about technology, because there were computers in her house where children played games, so all she had to do in the film was to make her mobile phone freeze in the car, make her the resort is different to call the police ... leaving the mobile phone as a whole, just made a ridiculous conspiracy.
