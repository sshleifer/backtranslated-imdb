The speed, which, I believe, is a direct copy of the Hollywood film “Cellular Communication” (I did not watch this movie), gives the impression of a test match, which is very interesting in the first four days, but then ends with a very boring draw. I watched this movie today, January 12, 2008 on a rented VCD. The release date is October 19, 2007. But, fortunately for me, I did not know and did not hear much about this film before, except for the fact that it was a failure at the box office. Therefore, in this situation, when I watch a film, I feel that this film could have been a very good film, but then the director again falls into the trap of Bollywood traditions and misses a very good chance. <br /> <br /> Of course, like the Bhatt film, it needs to be copied from somewhere else. But now days have no meaning for me if I have not seen the original film. I just found the main theme, very similar to Nick Vremeni and Badshah. In the film, Sanjay Suri is shown as an intelligence agent, but his wife considers him a chef. This brings back the memory of “True Lie”. The only new part was the use of the phone. But what I also learned now is taken from the film “Cellular Communication”. Therefore, when a film is made from a mixture of many other films, its future becomes completely clear. <br /> <br /> What I like about the film is its pace. As the name implies, everything happens very quickly, and between scenes there is not much time for reflection. But this is a break in the last 20 minutes, so the film goes in the traditional Bollywood style of Dhishum dhishum. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is also quite interesting. Three stories run in parallel, one after another. One of Urmila’s abductions, another from Zaid, who is trying to help Urmila, and then the plan to assassinate the Prime Minister. These three stories naturally mix with each other as the film continues. <br /> <br /> But then a very ordinary game and unnecessary additional style killed the spirit of the film. Except Sanjay Suri, no one makes any impression. This applies even to Urmila, who is always promising in RGV films. Because of this usual action, some scenes do not actually convey the feelings that the director wanted. For example. the scene at the end, where Urmila gives up hope and turns off the phone, should have a good impact. But instead, we are just waiting for the end of this scene. <br /> <br /> In addition to acting, an extra love of style demoralizes the film. Showing such awesome baddies is good for Hollywood movies, not Bollywood. Von London is also just for creating style, and there is no particular intellectual advantage. Especially in the end, all these dhishhum-dhishhum were completely unnecessary. Maybe the director had the impression that the highlight of the Hindi films should be such fights. They look unreal, increase the duration of the film and ensure that people leave the theater before the movie ends. <br /> <br /> In the end, I believe that once you could watch a movie. If this is on TV or you can rent it, then everything is fine. But then again, make sure you have a remote button and go ahead. The next time the movie is shown on TV, you can calmly watch other channels.
