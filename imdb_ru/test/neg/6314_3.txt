Spoilers abound. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> I was completely disappointed, it was my first film “STREET FIGHT”, which I saw (I still did not dare to go to the joke of 1994). Very little attracts your attention in the STREET FIGHT ZERO (ALPHA) unlike most Japanese games. The fights are ridiculously conducted overboard (Shun vs. Zangif was laughter), and the dramatization is too whimsical, especially towards the end, when Ryu must control everything in his fight against his brother. <br /> <br /> The main street fighter Ryu weakened to a darker version inside himself. Disappointment in managing this darkness is further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! The tournament on shadow street battles is held not only to fight for the minds of the promoter. <br /> <br /> What is the artist's drawing? Any anime painted over the belly is impressive. The soft character of the plot makes the STREET FIGHTER genre too clever and places more emphasis on the character (Shun), who is not even a fighter in a video game! Studying the nature of not only the main stars of the original STREET FIGHTER game is completely ignored. How many times have you caught Rolento? Adon? Guy? STREET FIGHTER ZERO lacks video game imagination.
