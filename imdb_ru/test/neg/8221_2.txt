“Garden State” is another of these “indie” paintings that supposedly save on production values ​​in order to give viewers a real realistic human drama. Oddly enough, the production is very good, as are the performances (some quite famous actors). The drawback of the film is the script of Zach Braff, who, apparently, is mostly taken from situations taken from other films. <br /> <br /> When you are as young as Braff, you have not really lived enough to use the experience as a film. It seems that the Braff experience is related to watching movies and repeating the same banal phrases in his own film. At Garden State, he plays Andrew Largeman, a half-successful Hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in New Jersey to bury his mother, who committed suicide after years of suffering in a wheelchair. He seems to have no feeling for this; he has no relationship with his father, who accuses him of causing his mother to become paralyzed in an accident at the age of six, and does not feel particularly discouraged by the loss of his mother (in fact, he attends a party right after the funeral whom he invited from his friend who works at the gravedigger cemetery). All this strongly shrugs off the "Beautiful Girls", as well as the guy who returns to his hometown to "find himself" and hang with his old friends, with the little "Ordinary people" thrown to the side. <br /> <br /> It’s really a miracle that Braff could have achieved everything in his life, given his father and his useless friends (I’m surprised that he didn’t kill himself), who still live their "life" as if they were still go to high school, hang out with dumb girls, drink, drink drugs, etc. None of them even recognize him by their role in television as a “backward quarterback” (the character Natalie Portman, the most knowledgeable person in the film, does) and say things like "Hey, I remember you from a younger year." These guys are such losers, for them watching TV would be a cultural leap forward. Even one friend who made millions by inventing a silent sticky has no real reason to live, because all of his landmarks are high school and parties. And you don't need big money to celebrate as a sophomore high school. <br /> <br /> Braff, as it turns out, is hard to heal, which does not “feel” and deal with anything, really, as an adult would be. He then meets Sam (Natalie Portman), a kind of lost girl who buries pets and lives with her mother, like a 10-year-old child in a bedroom that looks like a pink dollhouse blown up in full size. Anyway, they fall in love, and Braff learns to "feel" again. Cliches come quickly and violently. Braff has a long heart-to-heart talk with a cold, detached father, and he tells him what it is and what the name of the game is. In one of the scenes, Braff and Portman are in the home of a millionaire child playing offended in front of a giant fireplace, and this is so common that, I swear, I just expected someone to come and throw the sled into the fire. In another case, Braff visits the doctor (Ron Liebman) to replenish his junk, and Liebman tells him (in the worst line of the film): “The body can play a trick on you. I once found my former best friend's cufflinks. ” in my wife's bag, and I haven't had an erection for a year and a half. “Obviously, no licensed doctor will ever say this, but this is the poetry of dirty bags, a tribute to Bref, I think, to his fellow losers, to let them know that he still thinks about them, just like a joke” "In Clerks, Kevin Smith nods to his interlocutors. In any case, Braff finds true happiness and goes crazy; the story unfolds by itself predictably. But if you have a movie from the cliché from wall to wall, at least give him some enchanting ideas to breathe life into him. And Braff affairs He has a suitable job, casual acceptance, to make his role of underprivileged Andrew real and insightful, and Natalie Portman (also from Beautiful Girls) gives the film a big boost. With her tiny features and a twinkling mood she almost steals the picture The companion Jean Smart is surprisingly good as Portman's mother, and Peter Saarsgard (although much better in The Broken Glass) is known as a gravedigger friend. I would recommend Garden State if you can't get enough of the novel from the storybook from movies, but when people start to greet it like a masterpiece, they just don't know. Braff thinks you can take the same weary old story line, write a few "f ** ks" and "awesomes" and hit the sound track of acoustic rock, and it contemplates the material. This is not true.
