It could have been much better than it turned out. Tom Pittman performs well, and some of the older actors do a good job with what they have to work with, but that just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> First, the actors are too old to play in high school. students, especially Howard Weit (Vince). He looks about thirty. Secondly, it is difficult to sympathize with poor Marv, especially since Betty is not so hot to begin with. <br /> <br /> ******* Spoilers ****** The end is so strange, It seems that the director intended to shoot Pittmanâ€™s character, but there are no shots ... he just knocked on the cement where he lay there, until the ambulance drivers lifted him up and laid him on a stretcher (face down!) What were his injuries? Leather knee? Goofy! Vince had just shot his girlfriend without any remorse, but he simply pushes Marv to the ground and rushes away, despite the fact that he does not hide that he hates the child. And to make things even more stupid, Marv asks the police to tell his father that he is sorry. (Spirit! Hello, Marv. You have just dispersed. I think you will have many opportunities to tell your father that you are sorry ... personally). And this writer didn't get an Oscar nomination? Skip this if you can't watch it on MST.
