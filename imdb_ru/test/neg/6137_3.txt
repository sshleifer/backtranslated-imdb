Picking it up along with the rest of the Marx Brothers box set, I was disappointed with most of everything except Night at the Opera. This abomination is the worst thing I've ever seen of them, with clever lines left unattended, and the characteristic is sad. The playwright is so obscenely stupid in this play that it is difficult not to take hold of the TV and try to strangle him. <br /> <br /> As it happens, Marx seems to be doing well, because outsiders have led to chaos much better when they have a good gag or two at least. The material here is obviously written for everyone, and he really spends the gift of Marx. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10
