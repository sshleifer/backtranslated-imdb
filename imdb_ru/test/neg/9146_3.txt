This tedious effort from not yet great director Budd Bettiher and pretty, but not yet boring actress Nina Foch, this film, as noted by one of the other reviewers, is the quintessence of a certain kind of film "B". This is just not a very good view. Both the promising premise and the overactive fog machine are wasted. <br /> <br /> The main plot is that of Nina, a nurse dismissed from military duties because of her nerves, a nightmare. She meets a dashing boy at the resort, where she gives her nerves a break, and realizes that he is in a dream, although she has never met him before. Meanwhile, it turns out that our dashing fellow is working as a spy and is about to perform a top-secret secret mission, which should not fail. <br /> <br /> Of course there are the Nazis. And plot holes. And smart people acting in this way will most likely lead them to completely unnecessary scratches so that the work time can be shortened in an hour. In the end, the film becomes a competition between which a group of spies can act more foolishly. If the FBI and OSS acted like this team, we would have lost the war in the 42nd. <br /> <br /> The film itself is fairly smooth (despite the best efforts of the fog machine) and acting. - as it seems, in many of the Colombian BK TCM showed recently - oddly not affected. It is less stylized than the one that can be found in the Warner Bros movie with the same budget, but also less interesting to watch. <br /> <br /> The power of Boetticher is, of course, rather a style of fact that allows you to create strong stories and speak in your own western Randolph Scott to come to the fore. Perhaps the problem here is that this style will not work when the script is lousy and the actors are tired of the five-year film.
