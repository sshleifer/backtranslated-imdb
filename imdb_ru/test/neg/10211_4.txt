In 1989, here in New Zealand, the fight was a kind of mega-rush phenomenon, and the orange goblin itself, HALK HOGAN (one of my super-heroes at the time), was at the top of the starship, so now it seems obvious to me I adored this film in 1989-90 when it came out here. HULK HOGAN A.K.A Terry Bollia is amazingly bad actor, and Zeus A.K.A Tiny Lister is worse !!! The storyline repeats the WWE standard storyline (then WWF) at around 88-91, culminating in the fact that the standard good guy knocks down, attacks, and then plays the storyline again only to realize that the good guy uses all his inner forces (received vitamins, prayers, etc. from food) to establish an epic return ..... A fairly standard formula here. It is worth looking at least to remember their youth !!!!
