This is one of the worst films I've seen in recent years. The storyline has a potential that is never realized. Actors are a bad choice, but, given the script, their talent was not in vain. I really wanted everyone to die as quickly as possible so that I could go out and see something else. Unfortunately, I stayed until the end and laughed at the noise of people moaning about how much this crap. In the end, it was not a booze, this is England, just a gentle groans about what kind of crap. Then I look at IMDb and see that 288 people gave him 10 out of 10. I really just donâ€™t see how these people can give this bill. They must be a PR company working with a distributor. At the end of the film there is a funny problem with sets, when at the cemetery and the attacks of hits, look out for a quirky landscape that swings when touched (this is supposed to be a brick wall) - the bloody effects are sooooo OTT - the film feels like everyone does a lousy horror, except the director.
