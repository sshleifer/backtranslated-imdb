I bought a DVD of this movie for a dollar in a large store. This is perhaps the best and kindest comment I can offer. At least it did not deceive me because of the cost of lunch. <br /> <br /> The problem with Chiller is Craven’s problem as a director. This man has his apologists, who claim that his travel documents prove that he is a really smart guy and a comprehensive, insightful conceptualist. But it is no secret that, as a director, he never possessed a bit of a visual and telling hitchcock. As vigorously witnessed by Chiller, it is much closer to this legendary flatfoot of Herschel Gordon Lewis. What Craven as a director lacks is the main component that will raise him from a director’s position to a higher level of film production. <br /> <br /> Let's decide. The transitional moments of this movie are smooth. Shooting shots give a sense of quality production. The film looks professional, as in a film filmed by a television commercial director. (Thought: films are only a visual difference, these transitions, which at least look professionally processed, may well be the work of some directors of the second block.) These are the parts between bridges and smooth transitions - drama - that fail. <br /> <br /> The essence of the proceedings is always carelessly processed. Critical shots (after, say, a departing car drives into a well-placed camera, then we cut the night exterior of the hospital, then into the waiting area and corridor, then into the phone booth in the corner, which will be featured in the next action) are quickly distributed, therefore we can hurry and move on to the next part. Craven never approaches an explosion of dramatic or visual possibilities at any moment. The end result of all this inappropriate attention to the least important details and clumsy rush that makes things move is a film that is like the work of a young student who sharpens all his pencils, fussily corrects his easel and lighting set - up, rubs all his pigments, stretches and show your canvas ... and then nothing to say. Craven, like an art student, never gets to the heart of the exercise. <br /> <br /> For Craven apologists who point out that this film was made for television, I will point to Spielberg's “Duel” and say no. More.
