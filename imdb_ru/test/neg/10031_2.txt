All the criticism of this film is quite reasonable! It's pretty boring and filled with all sorts of nonsense. The couple exchange nods about their "good grub." The middle picture of the table, when the phone rings, until someone finally comes up, sits down and answers it rather slowly. Fourfold or more when people look at things. Lonely banjo-tuning and game, a break for beer. Telling a deer joke about a frog with a big mouth trying to learn how to feed its children, with a lot of expressions with a big mouth (which are necessary for a weak raisin). The separation of sandwiches with cucumber and cream cheese on oatmeal bread, which is squeamish becomes unpleasant when people talk about people burned in the fire. Many seemingly video materials with close-ups of animals, birds, insects and spiders in the forest. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a forest fire, then at least a couple of decades later, some people in those same forest are killed with an ax. The killer was obviously not too pleased with the stolen ax and was killing other people with other weapons of opportunity or with his bare hands. <br /> <br /> If it’s true that the movie in the version available on videotapes is cut, perhaps if a lot of the footage was shot, it deserves another DVD viewing. Otherwise, it’s just not very interesting, and it’s likely to test the patience of even the most hardcore outdoor fan.
