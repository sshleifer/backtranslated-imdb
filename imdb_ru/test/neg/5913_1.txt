It's really one of the worst movies ever made — and I don't mean such a bad, good way. Eddie Murphy is a great comic, and it shows how bad this film is, that he almost killed his career. The script and direction are inept, the scenery and staging is as creative as the Brady Bunch episode, and the acting shows how bad the cast can be when it’s absolutely nothing to work with. If it were not for the costumes - which, in addition to Eddie Murphy's ego, apparently form the bulk of the budget - you would have sworn that this thing was hit by a bunch of high school students spent on mint schnapps. The fact that anyone could find this parody in any way, funny or interesting, is stunning. It is probably not by chance that the lost souls praising this abomination are hardly literate. But if your idea of ​​fun is that Della Reese shoots her “little finger”, then by all means, set aside your plump cup and rent this movie.
