Okay, wait, give me this street, in fact there are some morons on this site who think that this is one of the best, if not the best, continuation of Halloween. I even read that someone said it was as good as the original. Phew, what nonsense, do not believe them that I watched every Halloween and, unlike some, knows what makes at least a good horror movie, and this stream S is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen in own life. Honestly, if I were John Carpenter, I would sue the man who wrote it, or go to his house with a hunting rifle. Seriously, the Halloween sequels as a whole are almost all nonsense, two is shit, three is stupid, four is good, five is good, five is good, H20 is good, Resurrection is painful. However, in many ways, I believe that this is the worst of the very bad sequels. What for? Well, let me start some kind of pompous speeches, not just a review, but rather pointless reasoning about why Halloween 6 Cure of Michael Myers is one of the worst films I've seen in a very long time. Well, where should I start, oh yes the plot is about the boy plot. In fact, the plot is a bunch of confusion, containing cults, signs of Thor and some other nonsense. It's just silly, in fact, the film is trying to be bright and smart, but it is complex in such a terrible way. Why does Michael Myers have a reason to kill people? A fairly simple explanation. Michaela likes to kill his relatives, which would be enough, but no, we must have a man in black and mysterious cults, with signs of Thor and complete shit. God, this is so bad that it made me want to cry, that this is indeed the case, the authors tried to add to the character of Myers, but in fact managed to do the opposite. In addition to wearing a mask and overalls <by the way, a completely different color, Myers is simply not the same guy from the original or even two, hell, maybe even four. Is this another reason why Myers became a parody of Jason Wurhes? I thought it should have been the other way around, but Myers is so much like Jason that all he does is endlessly killing people in horrible ways. In the original, he teased that his victims took his time, and as a result, it was all much more stressful. In this he just walks, hacking people to death. I mean, in half an hour we razed the number of murders in the original, it was just ridiculous. Oh, and Myers in this, it seems, has a really big head, I mean her huge, and he is gaining weight. What else shit, oh yeah, Tommy Jarvis's return is pretty bad, in fact all the characters in this film are, of course, Dr. Loomis shit bar. I can not stand this little child, I would like him to understand that he is really annoying. Our Heroin is boring and not interesting. And her whole family is a terrible group of actors. Mother is rubbish, brother is bad, and father, I mean, was it his first part or something like that? For God's sake, he was like a cartoon villain. He was actually more evil than Myers. <By the way, his death is one of the most terrible that I have ever seen, I think that even on Friday the 13th something so funny will not happen. What kind of nonsense, oh yes, Tommy Jarvis, I don’t know what this guy’s name is, but he really cannot act, he tries hard to be serious and all that, but I just wanted to laugh at him. I would like him to die in reality, if everyone died, that would be really good. Dr. Loomis is a terribly aged and dying Donald Pleasant. Despite the fact that he remains on his last legs, Pleasance still stands out in that short period of time, which he shows. It is a pity that such a cornerstone of this franchise had to say goodbye to such garbage. What else is rubbish, oh yeah, a little where the radio dj gets it. First, how the hell did Michael manage to get in this van when he was at his house five minutes ago? Secondly, it was just a senseless murder that can increase the amount of the body, but this is just another world of nonsense that adds to the delirium of this film. This is actually the death that said all this to me, because it was meaningless in many ways like this film.
