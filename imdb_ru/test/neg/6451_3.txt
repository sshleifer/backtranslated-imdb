This film was a low point for Jason Robards and Sam Peckepe. The main plot plots are taken directly from Sergio Leone's “Once Upon a Time in the West” masterpiece (released two years earlier and also with Robard): a person discovers that he has found a watering place in the desert and is the only water for many miles in any direction he plans to build around the station "Station" and, in order to secure a love interest, he falls in love with a prostitute. To this add the uncompromising preacher, bad music, stupid fast action shots, even more stupid T & A shots - and everything is ready. There are few questions why this was not possible at the box office. In fact, the question is, "how did he go so far?"
