I have to say that I was very excited about this movie before renting it, since it was Adam Sandler’s play “Happy Madison”, and I’m usually attracted by such silly humor. <br /> <br /> There were some funny moments at the beginning of the film, but this film lacked everything that makes a good film. I understand that many films that are not realistic can still be quite funny, but this film was unrealistic and not funny at all. The game was terrible, the cinematography was very bad, the plot had no meaning. I cannot reconcile with the fact that 3 cool older women will even work on such a bad letter. Overall, I was not very impressed with this film, and I do not recommend spending $ 5 on its rent.
