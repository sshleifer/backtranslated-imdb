The only reason I watched this movie for the second time was to find out the name of the girl “the second banana”, playing opposite Katie Holmes. Her name is Marisa Koflan. Never heard of her before. She is beautiful. Exciting. With a lively face and a pretty body, she is very watchable ... She has a real "balance" ... More than a passing Grace Kelly atmosphere ... with youthful abundance so it makes sense that she will look like the most beautiful Irish American. The film is unremarkable, Katie Holmes is a classic beauty in the flesh. But Marisa Koflan is the one you follow with your own eyes. In 1999, when this film was shot, she was about 25 years old. It reminds me of another stupid, useless film, the only atonement in which is “Pretty Girl.” These were “Career Opportunities” when I first saw Jennifer Conoli. Or Lubricant II, when I first saw Michelle Pfeiffer.
