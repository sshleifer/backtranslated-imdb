My view: another unconvincing PG-13 horror film with predictable scare tactics and a derivative plot. <br /> <br /> Spirits are moving. The walls creak. There is something wrong in the basement. These, along with several other horror movie clichés, haunt the walls of yet another home in the country in Sam Raimi’s “COMMUNITORS”, a lame blend of the most predictable scare tactics thrown at the plot, wildly reworked from the best (and sometimes worse) horror movies of the past. <br /> <br /> When the Solomon family moves to an old farmhouse in South Dakota, another attempt by the pope (Dylan McDermott) to reconnect with the family, especially their former drunk daughter, Jessica (the undervalued Kristen Stewart) in the more refined countryside than their home in chicago. The horror comes when Jessica begins to receive unexpected visits from poltergeists at home. Thinking that she is some kind of teenage girl who cried a wolf, her parents do not believe her. How could they? The real horror in MESSENGERS is waiting for which horror movie will be the next wild. Will it be an angry flock of crows who want to get more than the harvest in the family (the direct robbery of Alfred Hitchcock's “BIRDS” masterpiece)? Will this be a haunted house with a story dating back to Amityville Horror or Poltergeist? Or will it be grotesque ghosts, taken from your familiar recent horrors, such as RING and GRADJ? Hell, the film even manages to tear off one or two scenes from some really bad horror films, such as AMITYVILLE 3-D and the mediocre COLD CREEK MANOR. Perhaps all Pan Brothers really wanted was a B level horror movie, but should it be so bad? Can't they tear them away from the best? Avoid this. <br /> <br /> Rating: * of 5.
