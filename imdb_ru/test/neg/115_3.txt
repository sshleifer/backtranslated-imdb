I first watched this movie back in the mid / late 80s when I was a kid. We could not even go through all this. Dialogue, acting, everything in it was just unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Here are a few examples ... imagine that these conversations sound very dramatic, with excessive action: “Oregon? Are you going to Oregon? ”“ Why would anyone want to go to Oregon? ”<br /> <br />“ Survivors? Nobody ever told us about the survivors! ”<br /> <br /> This film was VERY bad, my sister and I rented it again for her 16th birthday, just so our friends could sit back and laugh it was terrible. I don't think we could finish it then!
