First there was the Zu Warriors film from Tsui Hark (2001), which is visually innovative, but it lacks the acting and writing departments, and now this film, which is visually almost as good as Zu (although no longer innovative), but worse in the acting and writing departments. It is really sad that in the HK film industry, it seems to be an almost complete absence of acting and writing talent. I think you need to understand the Cantonese dialect in order to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogues in the film are. As if some perpetrators are talking on the street, this is so bad. Worse, the actors and actresses themselves look like offenders and cannot act, even if their lives depend on it. I understand that this film should be a comedy aimed at the younger generation in Hong Kong, but have the young people of Hong Kong really become so mind-blowing that they cannot appreciate anything except such a juvenile and vulgar acting game / writing? If so, I'm ashamed that I'm from HK. <br /> <br /> I would like the creators of HK to learn some lessons from such directors as Zhang Yi-Mou or Ang Lee, and finally made a film that is both visually stunning and competent and mature in acting and writing departments. And stop using young singers / idols / heartbreaking actors as actors, because they can't play as many fans as they can in HK!
