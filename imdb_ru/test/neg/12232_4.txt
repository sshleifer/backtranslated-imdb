When I first saw the Returns trailer, it looked absolutely terrible, and I was not interested in seeing it, but when it came out on a DVD today, I thought that nothing else could interest me, I would rent it and give it a shot. I watched it at that moment, and in fact it was not so bad. I think it was sometimes immature and stupid, but there were some funny moments that made me laugh. I really don’t watch a lot of sports films, so I’m wondering if maybe I’d see more, maybe this film would have more meaning for me, but all this is good, I still did not mind watching “Returns”. I admit that these “silly parodies” films are not convincing, but what harm is there in a silly joke from time to time? Returns are not so bad if you give them a good chance. <br /> <br /> Coach Fields fails in life, family and career, but when he is offered the chance to bring his career back to life if he can lead a weaker football team to the championship. But the team is really really terrible, as if beyond horror. But with a little effort and effort from the team, they try to do their best, even if it can turn into something more sad. <br /> <br /> “Returning to All” is not the worst movie I've ever seen, I think it’s good for a couple laughing and giggling. I know it was stupid, but I couldn’t stop laughing when the coach comes to the height of the fight in the locker room and he hits the nerd’s head on the locker, he and the nerd were generally so funny together, this film is too serious, I think you will have fun watching it, if you watch it, expecting it to be Oscar-worthy stuff, this film is not for you. 4/10
