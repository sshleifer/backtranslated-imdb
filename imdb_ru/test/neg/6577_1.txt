What is it about studios such as Paramount, which have a proven series of popular films and believe that they can do without a budget and formula? Paramount spent less on this movie than on TMP, which sounds good, until you realize that there is a 10-minute gap between the time the movie was created. The cost of a TMP of $ 40 will be equivalent to $ 75 million in 1989. This film is the reason why Shatner has never been given equal opportunities for directing and other films. Every time he turned around, the studio cut the budget and made demands on the storyline. The fact that it was the only storyline Roddenberry and Shatner could agree with for the most part complicated the freshman’s directorial task, but after all the machinations were completed, everything that ended up was a bumpy story and a load of poorly executed special effects not worthy of the original series, especially a large movie. The most vivid examples: - All Phaser effects were very deprived and looked fake. “The shot of the Enterprise at the big barrier was so obvious that the frame from the still frame was enlarged.” At least the eskimo stick that held the Enterprise was successfully sewn. - God "chases" Kirk up the mountain ... Egads, they may also have just taken pictures of Godzilla climbing a volcano at the end of Godzilla 1985, and used drawing buttons to scratch the emulsion from the film to make electric shocks from his eyes on the endangered captain Kirk .... Yes, friends, I have a real problem with what this last scene looks like, especially. <br /> <br /> Thank God, Star Trek VI was such a movie Redeemer ...
