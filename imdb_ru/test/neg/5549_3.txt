The low budget jerk Herschel Gordon Lewis reaches a new low (even for him) with “The Gore Gore Girls”, “film” (sniker), which has all its technical marks: poorly recorded sound, poor lighting and OTT blood, It would be tolerable, even a little charming, if the film, at least, had an interesting plot (“Blood Feast” in all its absurd glory is a great example), but “Girls” is a good reason. The completely unsightly pompous private detective Abraham Gentry (Frank Kress) is recruited by a newspaper reporter to find out who is not killing in the form of strippers (you will stop worrying about who is to blame long before these two have finished the job)). As before, the call is not for the plot, but for creative methods of bloodletting (including the shreds of a girl traded by a wooden hammer) and occasional splashes of shaky skin ... but this is not enough to enhance the material over boredom.
