Like many others, I was counting on the appearance of Dennis Hopper, to make it not a waste of time. I was sadly mistaken. Everything negative about this film is more than true. However, what takes the cake is a terrible, terrible storyline for the main character. <br /> <br /> That's why: the planet can be destroyed, the ONLY way to recover from it, for the ALL human race that will be saved through it, as many intelligent, capable, good, competent people as possible in the underground. And Dennis Hopper is the only visionary / scientist with a vision that was prepared for the worst and realized this. But what is the main motivation of Stevens (Sonny D'Angelo) ?? He is angry because Dennis has decided who to save or be doomed! While Stevens was clearly explained that Dennis's character did everything to warn people about the danger, but they laughed at him. The character Hopper was a boy with a finger in the dam, and now Stevens accuses him of “picking and picking” ??? And if this is not enough, he wants to prevent everyone from entering this shelter, because "this is not fair!?" And .... he is responsible for the death of one guy who is the savior of mankind! Oh my god, how stupid can you get? <br /> <br /> What’s also crazy about IMDb is forcing one to write at least ten lines about this piece of shit. I mean, TWO MILLIONS in the budget, what could be done with this? Think of clerks, Blair Whitch and many other films that were made for $ 100,000 and were even better. AAAAARGH! I think I was lucky that I didn’t pay a penny to see this shit, and sitting to the end of the word, Über shit, is one of the most heroic things I did this year. It is not surprising that the authors of this group of dung used to work as an operator and title designer ...
