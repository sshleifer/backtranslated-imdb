This film very much reminded me of a song by Dead Kennedys called Straight A's. However, in contrast to this film, the hero of the DK song turns into a suicide. You would like this jerk to resort to suicide instead of committing the crime he committed. It was all confusing, and at the beginning you sympathize with the hero of the film, then he quickly betrays your sympathy. Long sequences, simply showing the hero's face, while he utters a monologue, delay the film a little. Avoid this if possible.
