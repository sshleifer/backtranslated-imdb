Oddly enough, it is Fred McMurray who plays a more “crazy” role in this comedy about worms. Carol Lombard demonstrates a beautiful game that combines light moments and hidden drama and seriousness. <br /> <br /> As usual, Fred McMurray remains a mystery to me. The camera is not his fan, he is not so attractive, and he does not have the style and dexterity to remove this very similar role to Cary Grant. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bellamy is superb as a good friend coming back to life through his relationship with the Lombard character. One can only wonder why her heroine does not want his gentle, soothing love instead of the almost inevitable death of McMurray. But this is Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The picture almost works, but does not reach the goal, primarily because of the performance of MacMurray. It would be great to see Grant or even Clark Gable in his role. Lombard and Bellamy are pretty much believable and pretty; McMurray is tough and makes you want to keep him at arm's length.
