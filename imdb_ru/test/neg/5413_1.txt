Wow, where to start. Well, if you like to laugh at the failures of directors, then this one is for you. I bought this film for 5 bucks, because I never miss the opportunity to laugh at the god’s mistakes in the film by the god Casper Van Dien, and the boy was one of them. Perhaps this was enough for this film to contain the most terrible monster ever created films. This thing, which should be an Indian ghost, looks more like a skeleton from a plastic candy plate that you put on the porch on Halloween. He wears a cape, which clearly is a garbage bag, complete with something like a hood in the shape of a bucket over his head. In some points it is a person in a suit, in others it is clearly a plastic support placed on the top of a horse. This monster has a supernatural ability to see "predatory" sight, obvious robbery, and can miraculously appear after throwing a spear. Sometimes a spear hurts people, sometimes not. This thing also manages to shoot down a helicopter with one arrow. Wow, that makes a lot of sense, like when a child explodes a space ship with fireworks at the end of Critters. This creature is immune to bullets, but somehow dies at the end of the film. At the end of his deadly merriment, which we will never know why he is on, he is blown up. This is an incredible feat, because we have already seen how this thing exploded in the film 3 times. But I think this last time was charm. <br /> <br /> And don't even turn me on to the limp of other characters. First of all, in which division of Delta Force are women working? The last time I checked that the military still prohibits women from engaging in combat situations. In addition, this unit is "undercover". What for? What possible reason should they be secret? And they are not even very good at it, I think no one realizes that they were military if they didn’t have uniforms, BUT THEY WERE ALL CAR CARRIERS (who accidentally change the sound effects throughout the film, at some points sound) like air rifles, explosives, and in others, canons). There is one part where Skeleton is throwing some builders from the podium, and you can clearly see the site where they fall. In another moment. Michael Rucker falls from a hill that is perfectly flat land. They slightly tilted the camera to create the appearance of a slope, but he clearly pushes himself in this falling scene. Then, when he is helped to climb to the top of the hill, the rope becomes flat, and when she shows a woman on the "top" of the "hill", the rope rises up from her grip, and not as if she were pulling someone up the hill. In fact, Rooker has a line that says: "I will not follow him, I will follow him." What kind? Perhaps this is the stupidest thing I've ever heard, and I watch these bad movies as a hobby. The saddest thing about this quote is that you can say that everyone who participated in the writing / making of this film thought it was so bad. Believe it or not, this is good compared to the rest of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> Acting, bad. Makeup, really bad. These characters had scars or wounds that they liked on the sides. Maybe these are the scars of the aliens who like to run around the face. Yes, I think I will make a movie about it, "Attack of alien scars that move on your face." This villain will be more frightening than the Skeleton, and the film is likely to be worse.
