I'm actually too exhausted to write this review — bad films always do this to me — but I feel obliged, as if it were my civic duty, to warn anyone who might think about buying or watching this terrible mess — a picture. Please, please just take my word for it: this is the one you want to stay away from. It's so boring and boring, so tasteless and boring, such a bad reason to gather any familiar talent. Burt reynolds? Wasted (despite all his efforts). Ice-T is hardly in the film, and when it appears on the screen, his performance is so subdued and muffled that it becomes crystal clear that the director, possibly intimidated by Ice’s intense look, did not know what to do with it. Rob Lowe, as the main character, has never displayed so little charisma on the screen. Mario Van Peebles should be ashamed of himself; his performance, in the saddest sense, is a joke. Of course, Satan himself signed Mario’s check for this film. The plot is as weak, unfinished and annoying as all the music involved (a completely boring club song, it seems, continues literally for the first third of the film). The view of the film will make you think seriously whether the director of photography, as one of the film’s unforgettable heroines, did not smoke a crack from a pipe glued to your mouth. And if you are looking for, at least, stylized violence like “shoot yourself,” then nothing will come of it. This film, I assure you, I promise you, has absolutely no redemptive qualities! Please, I beg you, Avoid this flick! Do not insert it and fall into delusion, believing that its pace will accelerate, it will become better and turn into a worthy outcome. It will not be so. It can not! It sucks! Now you have been warned, and now I can go to bed (now at 3 o'clock in the morning, I apologize for any possible mistakes this warning may contain) - knowing that my conscience is clear, because I have fulfilled my civic duty to my neighbor!
