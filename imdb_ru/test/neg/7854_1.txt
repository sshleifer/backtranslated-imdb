I am a fan of good historical fiction and was thrilled by the thought that someone would take a well-written series of books and take it down. Writing scripts is not like writing ordinary fiction, but when you have a book that you adapt, it would be nice to actually follow the storyline. <br /> <br /> The images of Vespasians (the present Emperor and his 2 sons, Titus and Domitian) were terrible. They acted like a Caligula cookie cutter and were the “bad guys” in this adaptation. There was a scene with Titus, who sent justice, as if he were Caligula (from the film of the same name). The way Vespasian is portrayed in books is mainly followed by the reports of historians who wrote in that period — they were fair and sane. , not spoiled by the madness of the imperial clave. <br /> <br /> Helena (love interest of Marcus Didy Falco) cites Pertinax’s divorce (one of the traitors mentioned in the title) as a reason that he was a traitor. she felt it was better for her to marry someone who appreciates her as a person. <br /> <br /> In the film, Markus gets a slave named Justus, but in books he could barely afford in his apartment, let alone afford a slave. Between the non-existent slave Justus and the female gladiator there was definitely no romantic interlude ... <br /> <br /> In general, if you want good cookie cutters, take Caligula with you if you want a good Roman from a classic story. Point of view, get me, Claudius.
