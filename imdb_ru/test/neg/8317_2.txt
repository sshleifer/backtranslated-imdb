I don’t know in which neighborhoods there are people who have written enthusiastic reviews of this film, but I’m glad that I’m not there if they don’t comment on the cartoon character of this thing. Well, we are learning to suspend our disbelief in films such as the series "Die Hard", but we see how little Jodie confuses the whole street gang with Glock as a NEW ... come on. All she needed was a bald head and a torn T-shirt, and she WAS Bruce Willis. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Jody, being an executive producer, blinded her, as much as it was a joke and a waste of her money. Or she was experiencing some kind of fantasy, where she is the only blonde, and all the others are a black brunette or a Latina. Even the dog is black. Little Blondie is the only good one, and (with the exception of the black cop) everyone else in the city is some nasty minority to get her out. Has your fear of acting talent decreased so much that you think that the only way you can be seen is to be the only bright spot (literally) on the camera in a dark, gloomy and gloomy area / film / film crew? Apparently, she thought that she had acted in the wrong movie ... The Dark Knight. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous holes in the plot, actor's chewing of furniture, unreasonable violence (“Look, girls! Now you can do it too!”). ... Spend time with your family instead of watching this tree.
