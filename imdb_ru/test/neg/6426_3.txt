The film starts quite well. This is truly a terrible scene when a couple of fugitives on the run from the law tore up an innocent family living in a secluded country cottage, killing their mother and father. The young daughter manages to escape only with the help of a mysterious ghost who kills two aggressors while she covers herself in the cupboard below. Then, 15 years later, we catch up with her as a stupefied student, exploring the supernatural, living with her erratic aunt and for which the mysterious redhead is caring. She has no real friends, she was almost raped at a party, and she still has strange visions that no one can see. So yes, life is beautiful. Everything becomes much nicer when she quarreled with her mom's sister, who was later found dead in a bath under suspicious circumstances with 11 engraved on her forehead. Hmm, I wonder who will be the main police suspect? This is quickly accompanied by a large number of deaths, and all of them are related to their attitude towards our heroine, who was in bad relations with them until their death. Could she be the culprit or maybe the explanation could be something more ethereal? Hint: if you think first, you chose the wrong Blockbuster movie. Go back and get the right, short-sighted GIMP. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was ready to quickly go to good details, being safe, knowing that I did not miss anything except mediocre expectations of the militant. But the first ten minutes they grabbed me, and I decided to give it a chance. I was quite pleasantly surprised: this was certainly not a masterpiece, but the game was quite good, and the script continued to create intriguing situations, of which I was looking forward to the solution. Alas, after 45 minutes, I realized that my attention began to wander during a long sequence, when the main character walks through the library, doing nothing. Then we get a cheap panic, and then a quarter of an hour of the divine book about paranormal phenomena between her and her new boyfriend. The situation has only worsened, as a promising start is thrown out the window when we get one unconvincing plot twist after another, followed by an end that is so anti-climatic that it doesn't matter to promise the moon and get a tiny tiny meteorite instead. Sorry. <br /> <br /> If everything was bad, it would be much easier to swallow. The fact that it starts with a gallop and barely ends with a whimper is not only disappointing, but also heartbreaking. How can something that began so promisingly end up becoming so formal? I don't know, and I don't care. The next time I’ll just give some advice to the screenwriter and director: don’t spend 5 weeks writing the first part of the script, and then 5 minutes to finish the rest. You tend to notice these things in the final product, when you treat your project as carelessly as here ... 3/10
