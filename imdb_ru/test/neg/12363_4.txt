I'm not going to tell the story of a movie like some people. I am sure that people who read this will know what the storyline is. I'm also not going to talk about everything that is wrong with this movie, because I will be here for ages if I do. The storyline is typical, and the special effects are below modern standards. This is not a movie that you should watch if you are a serious movie lover (like most of us here), the little things will annoy you the whole movie and ruin the experience. If you are an ordinary movie lover who likes to have a good time while watching a movie, then this movie is perfect for you, a lot of fun. It would also be a good movie to take a partner. Only not for us, movie lovers. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 10
