This must be the most terrible abuse of the word comedy that has ever been observed. It's just not funny, and the writers obviously just tried to use the title of the series to make a few pounds at the box office. This film makes the continuation seemingly subtle in terms of sexual hints (does not mean a feat), and has the full charisma of a corpse with riggamortis. I am afraid of a complete washout !!
