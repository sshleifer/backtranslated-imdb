I fully understand WHY this film was made. “The Silence of the Lambs” was an incredible film - a terrible thriller with a great story and a high jumper .... <br /> <br /> What I don't understand is why this THIS film was made ... and why Anthony Hopkins agreed repeat his role as Hannibal Cannibal in this horrible and unsatisfactory film. <br /> <br /> There is no way to ruin a movie any further than to watch it, but for those of you who prefer to spend your money, read no further. The film is absolutely terrible. It's so bad that the transition from Jodie Foster to Julianne Moore becomes no problem. <br /> <br /> The only way to truly enjoy the movie is to set the clock and leave the theater exactly two hours after the movie began, because until that moment it was a rather interesting thriller. The reparat between Moore and Hopkins is comparable to Hopkins and Foster, and the performances of other characters are pretty good. But literally at the two-hour mark, the film turns into nothing more than a stupid horror film of class D ... he is sick, and he is stupid, and almost like the film crew the shooting time ended, and he finished the final together in one day. <br /> <br /> The initial rumble due to the unsatisfactory and bizarre ending of the book by Thomas Harris made the director Ridley Scott order a rewrite ... and, frankly, having seen the movie And after reading the final of the book, I don’t know what's worse. <br /> <br /> Please don’t waste your money OR the time for this film unless you’re ready to quit EXACTLY in a two-hour time, because this is the ONLY way you will be satisfied with the Clarice Starling saga and Hannibal Lecter. .. continuing the riddle that made the first film, and the expectation of this film is so great.
