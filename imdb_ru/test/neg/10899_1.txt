If you just want blood, and nothing but blood and torture, you are in the right movie. If you want at least a piece of good acting, logic, history, sequence, or even a good guy ending, go to another place. <br /> <br /> I could not help myself to think: “God, are these people mentally retarded? "For example, after they drove out and saw that other people are disfigured, the main actress meets a policeman and tearfully tells her story to a policeman and tells him about a psychopath riding in a yellow truck. The yellow truck pulls up and the officer just goes to him, talking to a guy, and the truck leaves without any problems. The actress comes out and says, why didn’t you arrest him? And then the truck moves to a policeman ... after he was rammed, he stops on the road at about 20 feet, simply standing there while the actress is trying to pull the policeman away, but he is too heavy. (At that time) At this time the truck retreats and crosses the policemen’s legs twice. Then the truck leaves. Why the actress didn’t reach the gun, I cannot do it. later she shoots a policeman twice in the head because the psychopath was going to burn him alive) Once through the mouth that didn’t kill him (Duuuumb) and twice to finish the job. * She rolls her eyes * Right after that she turns away to go to the bathroom which was supposed to explode and when she rises from the roof, she turns around, and the policeman is gone ... OK ... <br /> <br /> Another example: the main actress meets a trapped woman in the bathroom, she spits out, like a gallon of blood, on the floor, occupying about 1/3 of the room. (Probably more) After the main actress goes outside to grab a towel, she returns and everything leaves. : / They also do not explain why everyone continues to disappear. Stupid, stupid, stupid. <br /> <br /> I like horror movies, thrillers and blood, but this one was too stupid. I lost brain cells, watching this drop, and you shouldn't either.
