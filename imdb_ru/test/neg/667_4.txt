Eight convicted teens were taken to an abandoned Blackwell hotel to clean it up as public works. Soon they discover that this is the residence of a clumsy psychopath (Kane) who can pull and collect eyeballs. It does not help that the guard watching them (Steven Widler) had a previous meeting with the beast four years earlier. <br /> <br /> Slasher films are my guilty pleasure. Most of them are poorly targeted and active, but they still have some attractive and entertaining value. See no evil is a good example of this. It shows a terrible letter and action, but the scenes of death are pretty good, and the film turns out to be interesting. The package sounds like a mix between Friday the 13th, Saw 2 and Halloween: Resurrection. I really liked the idea, but it didn't work. It was just a bunch of clichés, and everything was predictable. Writer Dan Madigan just focused on the scenes of death and nothing more, apparently. The death scenes themselves are pretty good and terrible. Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them, and he came up with some creative murders. <br /> <br /> The game is quite soft and unremarkable. This is because all the characters are one-dimensional, and we do not know much about them. These people were hard to feel because they were rather unpleasant. Kane is surprisingly mediocre. I expected that his presence on the screen would be worse, but he did not cope with this work. Second level Jason Voorhees, if you want. The rest of the actors are relatively unknown, and this film probably will not help or hurt their careers. <br /> <br /> Although the death scenes are terrible, they are not necessarily scary. There really is no expectation just some death scenes. Because of this, the film does not matter much repetition. Also, if you don’t like slasher movies, don’t waste your time on it. This is not much change your opinion. In the end, See No Evil is a decent slasher, but it’s common and memorable, so you shouldn’t watch it. Rating 6/10
