It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Why would anyone make a movie about murder!?! Mr. Allen again plays the only character he is capable of â€” a sexually short man who cannot get a girl. Get a hint, Allen, there is a reason why this is the only character you can successfully portray. Stir this movie! This is a waste of time if you do not want to know how to successfully kill someone. I feel sorry for the actors who say yes to Woody Allen. Look at his cast and tell how many of these people still work. My respect for all the actors who work for him immediately falls because they decided to participate in the film.
