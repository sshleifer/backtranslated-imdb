Deepa again tried to boldly highlight a topic that no one wants to talk about. The storyline is fine, the cinema is outstanding, the script and acting skills are far below average. I assume that the citizens of Uttar Pradesh in India, where its original set was destroyed in 2000, are to blame. This led to a completely different cast, I just wonder what kind of an exciting movie it would be if it had the original Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das and Amir Khan. Current actors Liza Ray (which is good for writhing in the painting sheets in Bombay) and John Abraham are pitiful and need basic acting lessons. Sima Biswas, Raghubir Yadav and Kulbushan Harbabda saved the film as much as possible. The guy did an outstanding job. Editing and promotion of the film is also not what you expected from Deepa. A great topic, sending a strong message about the practice, which is still quite widespread in rural India, but does not meet the standards that Deepa set for itself in Fire and Earth. Watch it once ... when it's on a DVD, donâ€™t spend $ 10 to watch it ... well, it surpasses the average Hindi film any day
