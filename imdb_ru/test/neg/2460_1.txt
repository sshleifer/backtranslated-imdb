A bunch of medical students gathered in their spare time to connect each other to electrical cables and die. Then they stand, counting the time until brain death, and then they begin CPR and heart massage and return each other to life. The fact that Julia Roberts was in this film has to say it all. FLATLINERS is like a group of GHOST. Everyone wants to see his dead relatives and visit his old dead buddies, so it may be better than having a group of medical students kill you for five minutes and then bring you back to life. The rest of the film has predictable relationship problems, plus the predictable “YES CAN BE IF WE KEEP EACH OTHER, ONE OF THESE DAYS ONE OF US WILL STOP DEAD?” This film was supposed to be called BRAIN DEAD. The fact that the characters were depicted as medical students made me wonder if they went to a foreign correspondence school to get diplomas. The only thing that kept this film from laughing was that they didn’t just put their fingers into electrical outlets in order to "die." This film would be a great comedy film “Three Steps”.
