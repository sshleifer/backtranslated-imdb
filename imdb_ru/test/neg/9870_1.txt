This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. Period. This film goes beyond the ridiculous, as if the director wants the actors to sue his ass for wrongfully distorting their role as the fantastic four, I believe that the film should have been released in comic stores just to say this to desperate fans that can't get enough cheerfulness and want to see more and more crappy movies. He had big flaws in front of future actors, with the exception of character Jay Underwood, in which I believe that this was his best performance, considering roles such as not entirely human films, in which the story is told in such a way that he has no character. he cannot act, and people have made good decisions not to watch his films, so he most likely will not play any huge roles unless he starts his career in the rarest but most interesting way,
