What is the point of pretending to “deceive” people from such things as ski passes and pizza? I do not see the point. I would not be smart or original, and this seems to me extremely meaningless. <br /> <br /> Skyler Stone doesn’t seem to be a very down-to-earth guy or even a good guy. He has very little charisma, and almost everyone can do what he does in this show. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this shit is the fact that many phone calls are being restored, so they not only obviously deceive the poor people on the other end of the phone, but also deceive the audience that doesn’t have enough time to read "Renounced", which flickers on the screen for about half a second at the beginning and end of the show! <br /> <br /> Not only that, but he also claims that this is how he lives his whole life. What a lie. No one can live his life the way he does, and the fact that he says that this is not only another scammer to watch his show, but it is also one of the most trumped-up, crying pieces of a bull hit I've ever I heard. This guy is @ $$! <br /> <br /> What makes them think that, for example, write and write a song, make someone spoil a HUGE photo of you and two friends, get dance lessons and actually travel to a ski resort is really worth get free ski passes and some food for free? What is the point of this? This is a lot of problems to go on several ski passes and a bit of snow. <br /> <br /> As regards the comedy, this is the most important thing.
