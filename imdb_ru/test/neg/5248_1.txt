Shooting this movie right on the video, I did not expect an amazing movie. (Not only because the film will be in the cinema, so it will be.) Only very weakly following the story told in the epic poem, this film gives a unique look at the story of monsters and super people. The overall picture can be summarized as contradictory, with a mixture of medieval and post-apocalyptic (reminiscent of Mad Max). With rock music and a techno soundtrack, you feel a little ill at ease. The battle scenes, though incredible, are interesting, and Christopher Lambert has some of the most interesting weapon combinations I've ever seen in a film, although this is often unjustifiably ineffective. The special effects used for the monster Grendel are surprisingly effective and are one of the few highlights. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert demonstrates average performance like Beowulf. He will not be as memorable as the Highlander, but at least not as poor as the Fortress. The cast is pretty neutral. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good action thriller with a complex plot, I would not offer this film. However, if you want the film to be not very informative, full of marching battle scenes and a somewhat predictable plot, find a copy of it.
