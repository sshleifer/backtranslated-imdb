Other reviewers seem to appreciate this film. I would say that for something made by an eighteen-year cinematographic student this is not so. If you want to watch a good movie about graffiti, stick to documentaries. It is shot with the same quality as digital home video. The two main characters are gloomy actors, and again it would be good if it was a student film. The plot tells about a lonely artist who rides a skateboard all over Portland and writes graffiti. Another joins him, and they skate together, creating art. Then comes the unnecessary gay love scene. Then there is a dispute between them, which is never actually discussed, because in this film there is as much dialogue as Charlie Chaplinâ€™s picture. This film really shows that street gravitational artists give their shape well, and the music is pleasant, but in general I would not call it a film.
