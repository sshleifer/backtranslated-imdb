I thought I was going to watch a UFO movie. Instead, I saw a film in which viewers (I) tried to make a decision to accept Christ into their lives or risk going to hell. The whole UFO thing was one big red herring !!! The game was pretty pathetic. In fact, it looked as if some people from the Evangelical Church just got together and decided that they wanted to make a movie. All the characters spoke as if they were in a church talking to other church members. It was not a real dialogue at all. I wish I had read a few reviews before watching this film, so as not to waste my money on it. If, on the other hand, you are heavily involved in the whole church scene and want to see a demonstration of how to spread your views (no matter how limited they are) to other people, then by all means look at it.
