It looks like these are two films combined into one. First, ZaSu Pitts is a renegade in a small town. She wants to help the romantic life of Marjorie Woodworth. OK: I've never heard of her before. But she and the Pitts are in both parts of this mix. <br /> <br /> Before we find out, the Pitts are no longer Miss {Polly. She is Emmy. I had to rewind to see if I had fallen asleep somewhere. I did not have. She is no longer in a small town, but on her way to the Honeymoon destination. <br /> <br /> There are some pleasant moments in the film. The first part is better, with roles for what seems to be, at that time, every Hollywood character actress worked in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> But what about Miss Woolworth? She sounds a bit like Betty Hatton. She looks a bit like Marie Wilson. She is beautiful, of course. But she is not a comedy. <br /> <br /> Pitts were often used in very small roles. Here she has the biggest role. She is always funny, although this film made me think, and not a little if anything good. (Like a comic. When she was a tragic actress in the background of von Stroheim's silence - “The Wedding March” and “Greed” - these are the two that I saw - she was gorgeous.)
