"Comedy of biblical proportions!" Those masters of hyperbole, the authors of film tags, again in this; the sequel of 2003 by Bruce Almighty, causes only a laugh The only thing that raises my interest in this film above complete indifference is its dogmatic Christian nuances. Sorry, make it overtones. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrell, ignoring Jim Carrey’s common sense to refuse repression, plays Evan Baxter, the smug news presenter from Bruce Almighty, who has just been elected to Congress. With a new life in Virginia and the stress of moving to an Acropolis-sized home, the pressure of all change affects his family. His wife (Lauren Graham), apparently airlifted from Stepford, and three sons (Jimmy Bennett, Graham Phillips and Johnny Simmons), who diligently look sad to the accompaniment of the piano, pray for the family to get closer and almost from of guilt, just like Evan. <br /> <br /> In this must have been the greatest shock of all time, God really does appear (Morgan Freeman), but all this annoying “work in mysterious ways” is everywhere, telling Evan to build the Ark of Noy Esq. to prepare to the great flood, instead of just giving him a pool table or X-box or something else. And in the true mischievous style of a deity, he also makes Evan grow a beard, long hair, and wear worn and nondescript clothes. Now, in those days, I’m sure that the razor was hard to find, so the beard was something of an inevitability for Noah, but I’m almost sure that it has nothing to do with spirituality. The same with clothes; Such impractical clothing certainly complicates large-scale construction work. Couldn't God create a pair of steel-toed boots and a hard hat for the poor guy? Apparently not. <br /> <br /> Paraphrasing Bill Hicks, I find the thought that God spoils us, and this is somewhat disturbing, as is Evan, who is fighting him at every turn. And who wouldn't? God, in fact, dismisses him, drives away his loved ones, makes him a laughing stock and at some point actually threatens him. Of course, God is right, and a reasonable, hard-working family man who got along well, is forced to eat a large piece of bitter-sweet humble pie. It’s almost as if God had left him alone, Evan should have endured and humiliated him. What is this message? <br /> <br /> Evan Almighty has a very commendable ecological bias, the main theme of which is that the federal government does not take into account the damage to the world around us. This is also the first film ever to compensate for carbon dioxide emissions, and this should certainly be considered a landmark achievement of a Hollywood studio. If it were not for the banal, indulgent banner of American Christianity, flying high above it, Evan Almighty could be a harmless family film, worthy of praise for the environment. But with his confused religious dogma and the relentless message of “blind faith,” he is considered one of the most disgusting films of all time.
