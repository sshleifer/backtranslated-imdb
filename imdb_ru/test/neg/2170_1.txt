When voting, I was going to give 2, but when I saw that 1 means awful, he hit on the head. The image of Native Americans as bloodthirsty savages deeply worries me. This is the third film I've seen about D.W. Griffiths, where human races are stereotypically ugly. A man cannot tell his side of the story, so I will try not to attack Mr. Griffith personally. In my opinion, the three films probably influenced thinking about millions of people and their children's children. Such films have probably made for many offenses that are still with us. Someone may say that the camera work was great, the action for the first time for its time. Positives are far outweighed by negatives; itâ€™s as if someone takes 10 dollars from you and returns ten cents to compensate for this.
