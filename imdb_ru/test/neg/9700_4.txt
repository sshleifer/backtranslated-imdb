While Pride and Prejudice is great to watch, and the soundtrack is beautiful, we don’t see Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. For some reason, the film was moved in the early 1790s, and not during the Regency period, where the novel begins, as scientists have long shown. The Bennets estate in Longbourne is shackled and looks like a Cold Comfort Farm. Yet Bennets in the novel is a gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk around the house, and the barnyard with dung and chicken droppings does not adjoin the house. Scenes are reconfigured from the novel, and so that we do not forget, Jane Austen for some reason placed the scenes in certain places. For example, the film sets a big stage with Darcy's suggestion on the street in a storm in front of the neoclassical temple, and not inside the Collins pastor's house: why did Jane Austen put him in the pastor's house? Because while Lizzy and Darcy speak completely, if they are brutally honest with each other in this scene, the Collins never said a word of honor. Why rain and outdoor offer? Looks like Jane Eyre is dating Rochester! And when Elizabeth walks through a windy field to stand on a rock and look at the panorama, you can expect that she will cry out at any moment: “Heathcliff”! Austin was armored! Judi Dench is a GREAT actress, but Lady Catherine should be tall and bright. Miniature Tom Hollander is a brilliant actor, but Mr. Collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy, suggesting that his terrible dance with poor Lizzy is an elephant. Matthew MacFayden - another one of my favorites from MI-5 by A & E; in P & P, however, he is more young Heathcliff, never smiling - although Austin in the novel notices that Darcy is smiling at Lizzy pretty, and she understands this when he sees his wonderful smiling portrait in Pemberley - the portrait that in this film is why- This is replaced by a sculpted marble bust. And much of Austin’s dialogue has been replaced by modern speech. Mr. Bingley was turned into such a clown that the question arises why Darcy wants him to be his friend, and why Jane Bennet will love him. The bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and listen to, it is so different from the novel by Jane Austen that any student who watched it, thinking that it could replace viewing with reading, will fail!
