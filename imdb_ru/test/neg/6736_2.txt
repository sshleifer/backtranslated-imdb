I saw that “The Foreigner” took the place in the lists of the films “Bottom 100” here on IMDb, so I did not expect much when I tuned in on the US channel a week ago, but I had hopes. “Belly Of The Beast” (which was broadcast a month ago) was erratic, but it contained magnificent landscapes and photographs, as well as some great moments scattered everywhere, so I thought there might be something like that in this film. <br /> <br /> Alas, this film almost does not meet the standards of basic viewing abilities. The script begins with the foolish offspring of the novel by John LeCarr and the film by Richard Ludlum, but it is filmed by people who do not have the talent of these worthy writers for plot and characterization. Instead, we got a dark, vile, nihilistic, mysterious nest of the filly with intricate motifs, intricate alliances and response shots. And shooting in the chest. And the explosions. And gutting. This translates into the uncut style, which is based on beaten “grainy or slow frames” every 10 seconds, as well as on wire and hyperactive jumps. These cinematic devices that were outdated 10 years ago, when MTV directors used them for Whitesnake videos, and the director works with them as a press, hoping to bring some strange coolness in the style of techno-thriller art to the process. <br /> <br /> Seagal himself is just awful about that. The whole film he says in a hoarse, hoarse half-whisper and alternating two expressions: he seems to be sucking on a lemon, while someone is waving a small shit to his face, or looks like constipation. And he is so stocky (and conceited) that he never removes a rag on his knees in front of the camera. I understand that it is difficult to keep the girth under control, since the male actor is aging (although Denzel Washington and Paul Newman seem to have never encountered this problem). But you deal with it by being honest about it and growing up as an actor, rather than hiding it from carefully selected camera angles and floor-length. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I cannot say exactly what is happening, and the film gives me no reason to care about what is happening, and the main character is completely one-dimensional and visually unattractive. Not a recipe for a good movie experience. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, most of the scenery and scenery is atmospheric and bright; in fact, if you froze the film on almost any scene that was not a close-up of Seagal, you would be amazed at the thoroughness and professionalism of the lighting, colors and composition, as well as how beautiful the Eastern European settings are. But putting a rotten egg in a Faberge egg cannot make it edible. And the hearing has rotted in the depths of the soul. <br /> <br /> There are “cool” movies (for example, “Versus”), and there are visually striking, but emotionally cold films (for example, “Another World”), as well as thrillers about conspiracy of paranoia (for example, “The Bourne Identity "and his remake with Matt Damon). And then there is this thing that cannot decide what it wants to be, pretends to be all these things and fails because it has no courage or soul. <br /> <br /> This is a film made by professionals with a real budget, so it cannot be assigned to the same class as Manos, The Murderer or Hobgoblins. But I would rather watch all three of these films several times in a row than watch “Alien” again, even once.
