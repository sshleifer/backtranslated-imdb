From the director of Barbet Schroeder (Reversal of Fortune), I think I saw some of this in my class of media research, and I recognized the lead actress, so I tried it despite the critic rating. Mostly tough guy Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling from Half Nelson) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt from Bully) team up to kill a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without police who won't find them. . The murder investigation is being conducted by Cassie “Hyena” murder detective Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who are rather bewildered by the evidence found at the scene, for example, unbound hair. It seems that the plan is not entirely successful, because Cassie and Sam quite quickly suspect Richard or Justin, the only question is whether they can dissuade them. Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, RD Coll as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verick as Asst. YES. Al Swanson. Now I can see the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's The Rope with a kill for the challenge, but this film makes it very stupid, and even a fairly good Bullock cannot save him from dullness and predictability. Adequate!
