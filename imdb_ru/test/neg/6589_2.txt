First, I apologize for my English. Secondly, the true story of this episode: 39 soldiers, Operation Highway. 6 soldiers were killed. Hundreds of rebels were killed too. For 10 years, the Soviet Army has lost less than 15 thousand people and killed more than 900 thousand militants and civilians. There are no rebels without constant US assistance. War veteran: “Traditions. There is no tradition in this film. There is no military oath, there is no first jump, there is no farewell to the battle flag. No delivery rewards. and medals.

Upon returning in the first months, there was a feeling that I had not fought before the war, I didn’t care how I had finished everything. There was a vague, but depressing feeling of dissatisfaction with himself and acrid irritation. Such are the nightly ideas, may be out of place at all. Officers really in the film is not at all. About how much time they spent with the staff. In the fighting - it is constantly. New Year's Eve at the fighting. Where did they get the beds? In the mountains? And so on ...
