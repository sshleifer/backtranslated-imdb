Let me make this movie for you ... <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes is a demonstration of terrible special effects. I don’t find fault with special effects, but you have to understand that if you can’t afford good special effects, you shouldn’t tie your movie to special effects. Star ships inflame each other clots of color, inflating explosions and flying past the moons with the number of polygons low enough to count with your fingers. You will not know what is happening. This makes no sense. <br /> <br /> In the second act, a woman walks through the desert. At this point, you will be persuaded by gray landscapes and illogical, boring fighting scenes. No one says anything interesting happens. The goals of the protagonist are unclear and not very convincing. It lasts about 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> Then, on a five-minute montage, she sneaks onto the enemy base, ties herself to the rocket, tries to destroy the doomsday weapon, fails and dies. <br /> None of this has anything to do with the possible direction of the film. <br /> <br /> Over the past twenty minutes, mostly the memories of the chick are passed on to her daughter, who has been in stasis for a very large number of years, learning the secrets of humanity. After this, we see the first and last five-minute segment of human interaction in the film, then the new heroine is forced to choose whether she wants to become part of the material causing the big bang or not. You know. Because when the universe collapses, you decide whether you want to be part of it. <br /> <br /> She chooses yes. BUT MEMORY OF HUMANITY SURVIVED IN CAPSULE. Maybe we will not repeat the same mistakes, eh? If you like movies with characters, then this is not a good movie for you. Leading roles could well be fulfilled by any old toy toy that can remain right side up, walking along the sand. The whole story is told through a painfully boring story. <br /> <br /> The film tries to appear deep, bringing together a whole bunch of underdeveloped ideas of science fiction. There are enough concepts to feed a lot of films, but at the moment they are inflated with completely non-essential details. Two-thirds of this film could be reduced to 45-second editing. Instead, the narrator fills the story of the prehistory of the novel, not giving us a reason to care about what happens to the characters. <br /> <br /> There are good ideas here, but no one is watching movies to see ideas that are explained ineptly. People watched movies for fun. This film does not entertain.
