I was a little old for this show, I was 6 when it first came out. First of all, when I was a small child, there were several children's shows on Sesame Street, where I watched and studied, but there was nothing else besides this. All my cousins ​​were born a few years after I turned 7 years old. Barney was a very big part of what they were watching. When I first saw this show, I told my grandmother that she was not teaching anything, she was just using magic to fix it. At that time I was 9 years old, how many 9 years have an idea of ​​what is actually happening with television shows. More and more, what I saw or heard, what lessons Barney had, more and more I told people how bad the show was. The funny thing is that my parents had a small child in the middle and late 80s, and that was me, by the way. They agreed and said the same thing as me. The sad thing about this is my cousins, who are now 13 years old and who still agree with what they saw. He does not deceive his creativity; he has no right to think otherwise than what they tell you. It is good to steal if the person does not know or objects that it is gone. Let's be honest with ourselves, Barney seeks to earn money, not to teach children anything. The brighter the program, the more children will watch it. Children are stupid not because they are not educated, they just do not know anything better, the second Barney gave a show, and the parents bought it. I never believed that television could influence people like Barney. If you have a small child who reads them, watch a show that teaches their numbers, do not let them participate in this show. Barney is like smoking once, smoking a lot, and you hooked, and let your child watch this show, for which he caught, and one day their children will watch the same crap and buy the same crap that you bought
