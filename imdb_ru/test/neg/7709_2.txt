Well, this film was much worse than the first and the first sucks! Zombie makeup was extremely fake! The game is very bad! And it really does not follow the first! Watching this, I kept thinking that the first masterpiece compared to this. I would say, catch it on TV, do not spend your money on it! This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's on the list. I started watching it last night and fell asleep, so I looked today and almost fell asleep again! The plot was meaningless, I mean the fact that a small military team is going on a mission to get the blood of the lead zombie and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop the zombies, but they did it where you wanted so that everyone dies. They made a lot of bad guys that were really annoying. If you ask me, it was rip off the resident evil, and not rip it off too. The plot could do this if the game were good, and if they really made you afraid to see what was around the corner. With these zombies, my grandmother could go into this building and survive! from 1-10 I give him 2.
