It was only a matter of time that the parody be made from sports films! And there are many films that can be seen that make fun. But the biggest problem I encountered was that it was related to the recognition of films. The director and the screenwriters of “The Returns” for some reason forget to show creativity. Although I have to admit that I laughed at some of the scenes, “Returns” could have been much funnier. Actors forget to seriously show their roles and show straightness throughout the film. Deception requires this, and this is the main reason foolish jokes work in such films. Due to the inability of the actors to do this, the jokes never hit the mark. Some scenes are shot forever and usually fake, which should not be a problem. Take, for example, "Naked Gun". They always have something happening on the screen. In The Returns, they didn’t even bother to let things happen in the background. Only a few factors make this film worth seeing! Still interesting to see the films that are joking. And Jermaine Williams in the role of Ipod. His parody of Cuba Gooding Jr. on the radio was fun! He seemed to be the only one in the cast to understand what a parody is. Not really bad!
