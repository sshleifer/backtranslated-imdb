The DVD release of this film hopes that you will buy this film in the name and face of Sandra Bullock. Her picture (years after this film) is basically a cover ... and a cover ... and a cover ... the same picture. Her name is visible on the front cover, all 4 edges and the disc itself. She is the first name in the list of stars. Her biography is printed inside the case. This film should revolve around her character, right? WRONG! This is her first film, and she plays a minor role. After watching the movie, each role seems to be secondary. The dog-character actually displays some personality. Less than an hour after watching, I don’t even remember the names of many characters. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I watched it a few more times, I could really understand the plot, but I don’t think it would be worth the effort. <br /> <br /> Oh wait, I just remembered a funny piece! Video game fans will enjoy Doom-cam. Looks like a first person shooter. Hands and gun aimed in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> I’m usually not a person who criticizes films, but it may be the worst movie I've ever seen. I expected that some of the silhouettes would go across the screen, sit down and begin to mock him. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad that the money we spent on it (used) went to charity.
