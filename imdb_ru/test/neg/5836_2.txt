Scary film. Just awful. The beginning of this film is like something from bad women in a prison movie. He then moves on to the B-version of the film about foreigners. Bi-roller in this case means adding free sex scenes and women in lingerie. Yes, and many shots are the same as in the other two films of the same company (including women in prison). The only thing that saved this film from 1/10 is that I actually saw the worst films. Not much and not much, but worse.
