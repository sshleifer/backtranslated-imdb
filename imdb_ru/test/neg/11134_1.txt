Okay, so I freeze in my room when mom knocks on the door. I open the door and what do I see in her hands? "SLEEPY DREAM HIGH". I think it should be an older horror film, because now anyone can be stupid enough to name the film, which is after the blockbuster "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp in the lead role. But, to my surprise, the film is at least two years older than the original. This alone should have prevented me from putting it in V.Ts.R. But no, I had to take a chance, I had to believe that this film could have one little ray of hope. Little did I know that the rays are where there is none, where they can be seen. <br /> <br /> Number one, the storyline is so ridiculous that it probably is true in some village town. Secondly, the actors are more like real-life people who are just surprised at the set when the director shouts. Thirdly, any film with a director is always terrible. But the funny thing is that this is another film directed by Kevin Summerfield. I began to rely on his film to get me to the floor with laughter. <br /> <br /> How to start this movie? I know, let's start with a runner in the forest. The lighting of the camera was so bad that I believed that the runner was standing still, and the operator was working. I like the way a woman stops eating chocolate. I mean, itâ€™s almost dark or almost a light that could be detected when the camera is illuminated. And she stops running around to eat a chocolate bar, I mean CONFITTER BAR, WHAT IS HELL. Thus, she is the first victim because of stupidity, and I am ready to break the tape, find the director, burn his small hands. <br /> <br /> Then from nowhere, some guys like to try to fix the car, which was probably broken for several years. Then comes the fake Mac 10 and a very real prostitute who are part of our main cast. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a group of children who are in trouble. And they are given the choice to pick up trash in Sleepy Hollow Park or hang their face forever. They were sent there to the forest with one of the teachers (Mr. E. or a.k.a Kevin Summfildom), who intends to look after them and make sure that everything goes accordingly. The funny thing is how flawed the charters are. I mean, with the fake guy from Mack 10, and who has ever heard of Hacker trying to kill himself. And something like one of the students had an affair with a teacher, Mr. E., even before all this crap appeared. However, the school still thought that it was a good idea for them to let him go. In addition, there is one student named J whose goal in the film is to continue annoyingly jumping out of nowhere, trying to make the audience jump when all he does is add to the cheapness of the film. The sound was so terrible in this movie. I mean, that was one, when two guys were fighting, and he hit the other guy in the stomach, and from T.V. there was this sound effect, which sounds like someone punches a stale wooden box. It began terribly and ended dangerously stupid, even for my taste. I will say this, though, the background music made the scenes look a bit tolerable. But not so much tolerated. My conclusion is this: if you want to leave another movie in which Kevin Sumfield took a serious purchase of Sleepy Hollow High. <br /> <br /> PS I'm still thinking about taking pictures to take these images off the fake Mac. 10. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
