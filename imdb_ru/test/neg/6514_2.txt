Two policemen from Los Angeles are looking for a serial killer nicknamed "The Family Man" who destroyed entire families, and when one of the policeman’s wives takes a six, questions arise and it turns out that the serial killer is not responsible, but rather the mob. The idea of ​​Seagal in the serial killer movie is an interesting concept, because you could see Seagal playing a good serial killer, but making him a policeman who has a ridiculous penchant for prayer beads and razor-sharp credit cards and looks more stupid than funny. Also, the running joke includes Wayon's pleasure in eating a powdered deer penis, and this dirty material is completely inappropriate. Not to mention the beginning of taking the school hostage because of the separation of the boy with his girlfriend. After Seagal neutralizes him, the girl tells the young guy that he loves him. Now you can take a lesson from all this: if you want your girlfriend back, taking a school hostage can take you back to her side. I myself thought that flowers or an old phone call might work, but then again, I'm old-fashioned. Besides, who am I to weaken someone's brilliant plan of reconciliation. <br /> <br /> * of 4- (Bad)
