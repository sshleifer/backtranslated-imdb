If I knew what I was serving, I would have run away from the theater. The film is terrible in the truest sense of the word. Despite striking imagery, intriguing places and a plot that could be exciting, the film is dead. <br /> <br /> I was unfamiliar with this period of Greek history and was preparing to watch a great movie. The director's hand is heavy. not enough to see a passing train; we have to watch it from afar, we have to watch the car by car, we have to see smoke, we have to see how it slows down, and we have to see how it stops. The directorial approach is didactic. In addition, the characters he creates never develop, they never change. They are so stereotypical that we wonder if they should be everyman? Every girl? Everyoldmusician? Is there any sense in this allegory? This is the most pretentious film that I have seen in a long time.
