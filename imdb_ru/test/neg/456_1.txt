The One is a very successful show, mainly because it looks like it is the only network show that only one person is watching at prime time. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about The One, I thought to myself, “Nuuuu! Another singing of the song! We miss them!” and then proceeded to fasten his helmet and run around the house, hitting his head on blunt objects and sharp corners. Because, frankly, the constant year-round pain and suffering caused by only one or two “talented” reality shows is simply not enough. We needed one more. And not only one - "THE" One. The one with slightly less attractive members with a little less talent. The one in which a little less sense, although it is difficult to imagine a scenario in which this is possible. One with meaningless shooting of participants when they are not performing. Because I care that Johnny sings does a lot during off-hours! I really do that! Now you might think, “Hey! On the entire continent of North America, less than 4 million people watched the first episode. Does this not mean that this show sucks? ”Well, besides, I say that less than 4 million people in North America suffer from syphilis, so sometimes low numbers bring good news, don't they? Think about it. <br /> <br /> In the end, The One can be terribly unoriginal, a show that does not even broadcast, because they also understand how useless it is, but it's still not syphilis! Hooray!
