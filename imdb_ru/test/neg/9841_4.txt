Stick Up is one of the short series of films in which Bobby Ray and Oliver Hard are teamed up before Hardy's immortal association with Stan Laurel. Several critics have suggested that Ray and Hardy - a small man and a powerful big man - were the prototype for Laurel and Hardy, but this is simply not true. Ray and Hardy play well with each other, but in reality this is not a team; Ray has more cadres in each of these films, and he is clearly intended to be a hero, while Hardy mocks him completely differently from his later character Ollie in relation to Stanley. Obviously, the relationship between little Bobby and the big babe was inspired by Chaplin’s earlier films, in which Little Tramp scoffed at the huge Mac Swain or the sturdy Eric Campbell. <br /> <br /> In Touched, however, Hardy wears a bowler hat identical to his later title Ollie (albeit with a fuller mustache), and he and Bobby have spent most of this film as opponents, - become drunk companions. <br /> <Bobby - Matz and Blatz paper hanger with Hardy as his boss. When the belated Bobby tries to pretend that he quickly emerged, some clever things arose between these two men that remind me of the routine that Roscoe Arbuckle and Buster Keaton performed in the Garage. A little later, Bobby Ray, whose short acting career never got a strong character on the screen, performs an “impossible” recluse that would be out of place for Stan Laurel when he pulls a long stepladder out of a much smaller toolkit. /> <br /> Hangers go to work at a sanatorium, and there they usually depict mental illnesses unreal: one resident insists on sitting on a piece of toast, because he believes that it is a poached egg! There are also several racist (and tastelessly unfunny) jokes involving a black man who allows prisoners to crack walnuts on top of their heads. When he sees * the image of a lion - not even a photo, keep in mind - he looks cowardly, as if he is a real wild animal. <br /> <br /> “Sticking” is pretty awful. Most of the pantomime and acting skills are much broader than what is needed for a comedy film; even Hardy, already a very subtle actor by 1925, plays poorly with his excessive play here. There are some bad frame matching examples. I was impressed by one unusual setting of the camera, when the face of the fat pedestrian got dirty, and we see a close-up view of its reflection in the hand mirror, rather than its actual face. <br /> <br /> Spoiler comes. During their brief mix, Hardy usually played the boss Ray or the opponent or both; here, this time, they end up as buddies. This is a good ending, but it does not make up for what is really a bad movie. My rating for this is only 4 out of 10.
