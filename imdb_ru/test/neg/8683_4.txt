In this Stupid Symphony, a mouse from the country visits its cousin in the city. Most of the short design is two mice exploring the dining table. Animation is good when this short suffers from a lack of humor. Perhaps I just saw this “adventure at the dinner table” in too many Tom and Jerry shorts. Despite the fact that it was in the first place, I just did not find it pleasant.
