There is a reason the world has forgotten these creatures: they are boring. This is Hammer Production, which means that the one who made this film must hit the hammer, if possible, several times - and where it hurts the most. Most people think more about taking a dump than these idiots making this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, now ?? The film begins with cavemen who prey on antelope. Now, antelopes must have evolved greatly from those prehistoric times, because they actually attack and kill people here. After that, it was time to get to know the rest of the tribe: more bearded men, some fashionistas, and even a pair of very old, gray-haired grandparents. These old geeks, obviously, have never heard of cavemen not exceeding 30 years; they refused to submit to the will of both logical and prehistoric records, so they remained alive. One of the cavemen is not bearded; he is clean shaven. Not as clean shaved as Tarzan, the Lord of Humanoids, clean-shaven, wandering through the jungle from childhood and without a razor, but so far. <br /> <br /> This is followed by the obligatory destruction of an earthquake / molten lava. a sequence that makes many of our not very hairy friends meet their doom. It is interesting to note that before the earthquake of the fashion-model, their breasts showed more. After that, they must have become shy or something like that, because they covered their chests for a while (perhaps they were covered in ashes, so I mistakenly thought they were covered). More action follows in the form of two fashion models fighting on the sand; I guess the best thing about women’s wrestling. After most of the desert has been crossed, our dark-haired tribe meets - how else can it be - a blond tribe. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Next are fascinating things. There is that red-haired fashion model who is sick of seeing the cave teenager kill a hedgehog. There is also the scene of the death of a woman at birth: these models of cave fashion are so fragile. In the end, we meet with an even more dark-haired and leathery tribe, that is, an evil tribe. One of them becomes the WWF champion after he actually won (!) Great Bear in a fight. 1,2,3 ... and ready: bear loser. We are also witnessing how a jealous caveman miraculously recovers from two serious injuries: first he is stabbed with a large spear on his thigh, but he leaves it as if it were just a scratch. Then he is thrown off a cliff — on a large stone — a blond cave man-stud with two shoes, but he leaves him as if he is being thrown onto a giant sofa. In the end, it is unclear whether he will die from falling from an even higher cliff or that this voodoo doll will be crushed. Oh, yes, in pre-historical times, voodoo was used by white tribes who live in the desert and whose women were fashion models. From films it is always important to learn. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is as insightful as it is informative: cavemen loved to fight for local power, and also loved their fashion models. As if any self-respecting caveman would fight to be the leader of such a pitiful ligament.
