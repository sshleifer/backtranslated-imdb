If only the writer / producer / "star" had the slightest idea of ​​the limits of his acting range and how he was perceived on the screen (wearing glasses and separation is not enough to make you look clumsy and bizarre if your face and teeth were fashioned by various medical professionals to match the American ideals of a common, faceless symmetry mistakenly perceived as beauty in this obsessively superficial society) he would call John Heder the main character instead of trying to it will on Hunting and provide a vehicle to showcase its ... its ... well, himself. <br /> <br /> An excellent cast (the Lord knows they must have problems to agree to this) is wasted in a painful constant struggle to convincingly respond to the main character, unable to convey even the simplest line with appropriate intonation, and, believe me, he lacks simple lines to choose from, since the dialogue seems to have been made up by a five-year-old one. Oh, wait ... this is the same person who pretends to be a writer, like pretending to be an actor. I do not often see the film until the end, but this ejaculation was unconvincing from the very beginning and showed no signs of improvement after the first hour. Excrement.
