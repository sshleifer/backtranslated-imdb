Like anybody who bought it, I was deceived by “20 pieces of extreme blood” and “banned in 20 countries” or something that is written in the box. I have to admit that I am a big fan of blood, and I always wonder when films can put it on a thick layer and look convincing when doing this. Tom Savini, Rick Baker and Greg Kann are among the best in the business. The revolutionary effects of makeup in the 80s. Today you do not need them, since everything is done on the computer. But computers cannot compare with visual witchcraft that these three people could conjure up. But I digress. <br /> <br /> Watching fantastically bloody films such as Fulci Gates to Hell or even the crowning achievement of Savini, on Friday, the 13th final chapter, you can appreciate everything that goes into making a horrible bloody film. You cannot understand the difference between reality and magic. <br /> <br /> I can’t imagine another reason why someone could see Ferox's cannibal, other than blood, which is supposedly omnipotent in this film. If for this reason you are looking for this film, then you are wasting your money. As many other reviewers have noted, most of the blood is the consequences. You do not see torture or bloodshed, as it happens, you see what it looks like after words. <br /> <br /> Blood? Well, it is here, but not as much as one would hope or expect. A man is castrated, and women hang her breast, but in addition to these two scenes, in one - scalping; There is nothing else in this movie. The blood scenes even in the three mentioned are still quite tame compared to what you hoped for. Maybe it's just me and my sick and perverted experience in the genre of horror and blood, but I was expecting a little more. Call me sick or perverted, but isn't that the only reason people watch this movie? Honestly, I missed many places. <br /> <br /> “Cannibal Ferox” is another film that is trying to capitalize on the fascination with an excellent film. Although Cannibal Holocaust is not a very good movie, it is much better than this trip. If you do your best to buy it for $ 20, you will feel deceived. <br /> <br /> 3/10
