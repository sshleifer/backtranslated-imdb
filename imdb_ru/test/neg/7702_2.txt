The problem of this film, like many other unsuccessful films, lies in the script. <br /> <br /> This scenario is so focused that it fluctuates everywhere. What is this story? Well, this is a biopic, but I think everyone will agree that you can never squeeze all your life in 100 or so minutes. Some selection and editing is required, but this script is simply not selected or edited enough. This did not make Hoffman’s life one or two definable turning points or themes with which the public could identify themselves and through them “get” a broader picture of the whole person. <br /> <br /> The film wanders from being directly fooled by a “problem genius” biographical film, to a semi-documentary / motor (using new shots faked to match the archived frames), to the sub-film “True stories about dog stories of the week "(the whole" I raise "a son who does not know that I am his dad is a" joke ", a film about the theory of political conspiracy, etc., etc., he simply never decides what he wants to be , and indecisive citizen Kane loves the narrative structure (reporter) interviews with people Hoffman from the past) soon abandoned, making the film even more unstructured and flabby than it begins. <br /> <br /> The film is full of moments and incidents that do not contribute to history and could be cut to leave room to expand something more important. The whole scene is in the psychiatrist's office after Vincent D'Onofrio knocks on the window, shouting “I am Abby Hoffman! I'm Abby Hoffman! I am Abby Hoffman! ”(“ I play! I play! I play! ”) It was easy to cut out. All that is happening is that the psychiatrist says: “You have bipolar disorder, some kind of lithium,” and two women in his life say: “We could see you more often on weekends.” and blast! That's all. No more mental health problems. This is such a meaningless, meaningless tokenical scene that could have been easily and needed to be thrown away before it was shot. The scene where they all rise and watch footage from the newsreel from the phones of Vietnam and Hoffman GOD? It makes no sense. It tells us nothing about anything. However, when it comes to such an important moment as drug addiction, filmmaking is in such a hurry that the situation comes out of the left margin and does not make any sense to the audience. Suddenly he is dealing with heroin? Where does this come from? What for? What's going on here? <br /> <br /> I, being a middle-aged left-handed person, can assume that I am sitting well among the target audience of this film, but even I am fed up with the image of “Man”, “Pig”, “Pooh”, etc. As brutal, suitable, thoughtless, hippie-hating androids. Maybe it was in America in the 60s, I don’t know, I wasn’t there, but from the point of view of the film it was a cheap, clumsy controversy. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, Vincent D'Onofrio was convincingly charismatic, like the younger Hoffmann, and I could watch Jeanine Garofalo in everything, even while reading the bus schedule, although she was simply not suitable for this part.
