I agree that this film is about sex without seduction or love. In fact, it makes sex seem so boring and makes you wonder why it is annoying. I don’t think at all that this suggests that second generations of Canadian Indians relate to sex. Anyway, did you know that the first idea of ​​the hotel / drunk was copied from the Korean film “Yopgijogin gunyo”, filmed in 2001 or so? This Korean film was really brilliant as a comedy, but at the same time makes the audience think about the complexity of the relationship between a man and a woman and the difference in experience and thinking of a man and a woman. I mean, most of the Neal N Nikki hotel / drunk segment was emulated duplicates. Can't bollywood filmmakers only make originals, please? Seriously, I never enjoyed the Hindi film, which is a copycat. Those who like me have always talked about Indian feelings through Indian cultural means.
