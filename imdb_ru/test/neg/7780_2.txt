The problem with this film is that it is not funny, not scary, not dramatic, not intriguing, does not stimulate, does not care, does not care even the slightest interest. I recently saw this film on film and was glad that I hadnâ€™t spent money on its rent. This is basically a failed filmmaking attempt. I will not even tell you a story. Story? What story?
