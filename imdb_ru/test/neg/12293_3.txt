It was the first feature film for almost all the participants, including the director Teka Tan, so they deserve praise for shooting it. But this film was clumsy in its direction, preached in its style, exaggerated in its play and overly politically correct. The plot was everywhere, making it difficult for any aspect to develop well. Gangsters are drawn into the story, although I'm not sure that their presence added to the film, except that it makes the film even more unrealistic. They could be completely eliminated, and as a result the film would be better. <br /> <br /> The story of a young Malaysian ethnic Chinese who returns to his homeland after studying in the West. His research brought him back with the skills that, in his opinion, he needed to realize his dream of managing a rock band and climb to the top of the Malaysian charts (quite a youthful premise). The beginning of the film hints at the conflict with his traditional father, but as soon as the gangsters get involved, this part of the story is discarded unceremoniously. <br /> <br /> The film attempts to take advantage of Malaysiaâ€™s surprisingly diverse ethnic mix, but unfortunately, the way these aspects were captured on film seemed either terribly contrived, or just a preaching. There is a beautiful scene of Malay women performing beautiful traditional dance on the beach, but how the vision is integrated into the plot seems forced and unnatural. <br /> <br /> Acting turned out to be somewhat amateur, and the male leadership was particularly unconvincing. The female Malay leader was a notable exception, leaving the most positive rating. The film also has an open, cheerful character, and, although it is a little caricatured, it brings some funny moments in the film. But the film was only a step above the typical local soap television drama. Unfortunately, this film, which is in no way offensive, was banned in Malaysia. 3/10
