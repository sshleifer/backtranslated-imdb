The book gets 10 out of 10 stars ... <br /> <br /> PROBABLY CONTAINS SPOILERS OF WALLPAPER BOOK AND FILM !!! <br /> <br /> If you have never read Jeffrey Household, The Rogue Male The original material for Man Hunt, you will likely like Fritz Lang's story. On the other hand, if you are in my camp and practically remember the book, the film will be a terrible disappointment. I assume that you have already read a brief overview of the story and proceed to my complaints. A little home romance is one of the greatest classic unknowns, tense and untainted, with only a few heroes capable of promoting the action. Fritz Lang and his screenwriter Dudley Nichols feel the need to add the brother of the protagonist and sympathizer sucks, the latter of which reduces the depth of the story, introducing external motivation into the script where the novel did not need any. In fact, the true climax of the book was not the salvation of the nameless narrator from his underground lair, but rather his self-perception of his true motive for continuing the hunt in the first place. And this is one more thing: if David Fincher and Quentin Tarantino can go through the whole Fight Club and kill Bill 1 without revealing the names of their main characters, why can't Lang? “Thorndike?” What kind of hat did they pull it out of? Which leads me to my most bitter complaint: the house hunter is so typically British that he will bleed out from Union Jack if you cut him. But Walter Pigeon, who plays him, a Canadian! He barely holds the accent, which is only a little deeper and more convincing than Kevin Costner in Robin Hood. He looked just in this role and was a good actor in the 1940s, but how reluctant as the hero Rogue Male? Let's take a look at Sketeers Island for a more convincing version. Redo more with subtlety and with, please! Will I send it for free ??
