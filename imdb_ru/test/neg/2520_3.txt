I first heard about this film when Patton Oswalt spoke about it on his CDs "Werewolves and Lollipops." He said that this is a lost classic, which is completely ridiculous. Being a lover of a terrible movie, I knew that I was waiting for a treat. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the strangest I've ever seen. Certainly one of the strangest shock films. In essence, the demon took human form a few years ago for a woman, a woman died or something like that, the demon cried with blood, blood fell on the bed, the bed is now obsessed, and now she is eating. Along with fruits, flowers and chicken, it also has a taste for people. People can fluctuate between excited teens, mayors, gangsters, servants, or professional orgy throwers. There is also a sick guy who ate in bed, but put his soul behind the painting in the room. <br /> <br /> Most movies allow you to understand the plot through exciting actions. “The Bed of Death” follows a different path: it basically tells you through the narration exactly what happens when slow, boring scenes of murders occur. In addition, I must say that everyone who eats in bed is surprisingly quiet. I would have thought that if the bed swallowed you in the course of a science fair experiment of the 5th grade, it would sting a little. I think the nerve endings were not invented until 1981 or so. <br /> <br /> The story is stupid, the direction is slow and rather awful, the scenery is rare, the action is quite painful, and the brother is one of the unintentionally ugly actors I've ever seen. Probably would have made a great movie for a party if alcohol and clever people were involved. Of course, the one you should not miss.
