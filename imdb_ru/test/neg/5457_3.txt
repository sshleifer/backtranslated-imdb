The director uses astral projection to kill people in the guise of a blue man. <br /> <br /> A boring horror film, which just seems to be sitting in front of your eyes, makes you wonder why you are watching it. I sat through the whole movie, and I really can't give you a more brief overview of what the movie is about, because I continued to discover that my attention was diverted to other things. <br /> <br /> I can't highly recommend it. I think my feelings are best summed up by the fact that I paid a dollar for the DVD as a double function, and I feel disconnected.
