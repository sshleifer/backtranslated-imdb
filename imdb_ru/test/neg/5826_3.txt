First of all, I should note that I used to love Winnie the Pooh as a child, and I really liked the movie “Tiger”, although I’m in my twenties. <br /> <br /> But this film was so bad that I was ashamed. I was a fan in my youth. <br /> <br /> Well, well, I know that this is a film for children, and in any case it is not aimed at people like me, but these are my thoughts about the film for other people my age. <br /> <br /> The main disadvantage of this film is the boss himself, he must be the most annoying character I saw in the children's film (perhaps even more annoying than a little kid at Monsters Inc). He has the most annoying voice and chatter about singing stupid things and making even more stupid comments, I know that Pooh films are not too good, but it was insulting even for two-year-old intellect! <br /> <br /> Secondly, where was the story? The previous excursions in Pooh had at least a point in history - yes, I see, it was about taking people who are different from you into your hearts - but in fact it ended, and I felt that I was watching 5 minutes cartoon on children's television. <br /> I have no children of my own, but when I do this, I’m completely going to show them high-quality children's films, such as "Tiger Movie", "Toy Story" and "Finding Nemo" (although in our the days they are too kids for me) I see how they will be very attractive for young children). Not so with this terrifying attempt to film. <br /> <br /> Yes, and one more thing - NOT GOOD IA! He must have his own movie!
