I just spent the last half hour reading other reviews, and I don't know if I want to laugh or cry. There is no way ADJL looks like Harry Potter, Danny Phantom, Fairly OddParents, and not a secret magical world that was about to overdo it. Also, in no way ADJL anime. Anime is very similar to drawing style (and some will say more, such as plot and Japanese origin), in any case ADJL is not anime, so stop saying that it is, and if you are looking for something similar to anime, look where like Teen Titans and Avatar. <br /> <br /> ADJL is typical. It's like all the other Disney shows. The arrogant child of the protagonist, who thinks he knows everything, does not bother to listen to people who are older than him and continue to make the same mistakes. Best friend buddy. A repetitive plot with a hint of a turn. And the rivalry between brothers and sisters. Can't they create a character who has brains and who is not full of himself? Can't they have children to respect their elders? Can't they come up with something else with the plot? Can't they let the brothers and sisters get along with each other and not hate each other? ADJL is too versatile because you have bad guys who are defeated and come back again, as well as complete idiots who have no ancestors to hate them. Come on, you will think that someone who is at least 30 years old will be able to beat a 13-year-old. <br /> <br /> Watching ADJL is like watching almost everything else on TV, the same thing again. Nothing fancy, just new character designs and one little idea that has been used over and over.
