First, let me state that I have no idea who Nora Roberts is. So the book may have been great, but the film is not. <br /> <br /> I spent my whole life living in the Peymont, North Carolina region. I have never heard of southern accents as funny as in this movie. I lived in two small cities in North Carolina, as well as in Charlotte and Raleigh. Sometimes you meet people with a strong southern accent, but I have never come across a city where everyone speaks like a bad imitation of "Gone With the Wind." <br /> <br /> In response to Gore_Won from the atheist community. Your comments show more about your perverted mind than about the film. If we had to strain our imagination and pretend that there is something realistic in this film, which is not, then the truth is that bad people like Tory's father will always find some excuse for their actions. The author chose religion as opposed to Tori’s supernatural abilities. Your suggestion that the “true character of the gospels” leads a person to beat his daughter is the most perverted and misinformed interpretation that I have ever heard. Before you begin to talk about the Gospels, you should probably read them first. <br /> <br /> Return to movie. The dialogue is flat, unnatural and unbelievable in most cases. In particular, many of the things that Cade told the Tories are irrelevant and do not match the mood, the context or the way they are pronounced. <br /> <br /> “Fascinating turn” at the end of the film is unconvincing, predictable and not credible. Some also claim that Jacqueline Bisset does a wonderful job in this film, but the truth is that the bitter mother character is also an obsolete, predictable, one-dimensional character. Is this the fault of Biscet? I dont know. <br /> <br /> If you have a choice between watching this movie and repeating a twenty-year Muppets, I recommend the Muppets.
