Everyone I know loves this movie, but I'm afraid not. I hated this movie so much that I had to turn it off in the middle of the movie because of disgust. Too much time is spent on tearing and emotional bedlam, and the point of view of the character of Bullock, devastated by her divorce, is driving too much into the viewer's head. Already enough !! And why haven't we heard about her ex-husband anymore? He is depicted as nothing more than a costume that appears from time to time. Something was supposed to make her marry him, what was it? What is so devastating about divorce? You could spend more time on this than on another shot of Bullock lying crumpled on the bedroom floor. The dialogue is unnatural, stamped and terrible, very much like one of these banal “ABC Afterschool Specials” or something like that. In this film, there is no imagination, no creativity, everything is very predictable and therefore boring. This film also goes to overload on the factor of fussiness, very stupid and not funny, as it should have been! It's just another one of those horribly filmed films “I’m a Woman, Hear My Roar,” very much like Waiting to Exhale. If you want to watch the films “I am a woman, hear me roar”, which are really interesting, original and well made, then see “Gas food” or “Ruby in Paradise”. Skip this shit! I give the "Hope Floats" 3/10.
