It's a shame to see such a talented actor as Amitabh Bachchan play such a weak role, especially when he was behind the sensation in BLACK (which I highly recommend). One line in the film says: "Sakar is not a simple person, he is a thought and philosophy." Directed by Ram Gopal Varma believes THE BODFATHER is inspired by this film, and perhaps this is the problem. It looks like a badly mutilated American cinema in India. The index of the left elbow considers the seven elements of filmmaking - acting, continuity, plot, character development, dialogue, artistry and stage plots - in the range from 10 to 1, and 5 is designated as the average score. The continuity of the film seems high, 8, maintaining a violent tone, saturated with drama, and using justice outside the legal system as motivation. However, there seems to be a lack of emotion associated with the evil of organized crime. The acting scores 4, it seems too weak, even when someone is beaten or killed, it seems, hu-hu. For example, when one character shot in the forehead, I wondered if he was going or when he would fall. He does not, and ala Ronald Reagan he is placed in a car, with the bloodied face of ala John F. Kennedy. The plot assesses 5 as an example of American-style gangsterism, led by a family oriented to Robinhood. Character development looks static, and characters seem to be chess pieces on an abandoned chessboard, thereby earning rank 3. Dialogue seems unnatural and seems to be forced to conform to some Baueri speech pattern 4 for dialogue. Production sets look below average - 4. And artistry puzzles: too many close-ups, too fast panning and too many group scenes where the actors seem too rehearsed - 3. I, too, have a big camera movement destructive. The average index of the left elbow is 4.4, and with a small deduction based on poor derivatization, it drops to 4. The film constantly raises two questions: one, why do so many people eat so often, and two, does it in India Do not have a brand of organized crime? Should such films depend on Western cultural examples? No matter how much I like Amitabh Bachchan, I cannot recommend this film.
