This is a cheap biography of a black and white star show of minstrels, a certain Dixie Boy Johnson. Whether this person ever really existed, I don’t know, but given the cast lists, Lee Lass White and Roscoe Karns playing this character, I assume that this person really existed and is whitewashed (forgive the pun ) version of his career. The plot, as it is, follows Dixie Boy from career heights to depression after the death of his wife during childbirth, his abandonment of his child to his friends and his return to his daughter’s sixteenth birthday and on stage for reconciliation. Another forgotten man, Benny Fields, plays Dixie Boy. This man has an excellent baritone, but no acting talent, and he has a boring ball on the screen. Gladys George valiantly tries his best to revive work to no avail. Judy Clark makes the best imitation of Betty Hatton, which I have ever seen, although I believe that she thought she was herself. The abundance of musical numbers in a short time of sounding in 70 minutes brought the deserved Oscar. Worth seeing.
