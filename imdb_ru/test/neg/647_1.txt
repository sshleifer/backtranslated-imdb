My wife and I saw it in the theater when it first came out. <br /> <br /> There were only 3 pairs, and we all came out at about the same time. <br /> <br /> This is the only film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It was just painful to sit. <br /> <br /> The theater actually stopped us at the exit and asked if we wanted to return the money. <br /> <br /> Never happened before, or because Pleae does not rent out, you really will regret it. I really believe in the final results of the vote. Perhaps personal taste is somehow related to this.
