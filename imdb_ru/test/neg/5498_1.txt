Adored by fans for his unusually charming work, and Hollywood for his softball, easy-to-use film making techniques, Tim Burton tipped the balance too far in favor of the formula with his new disorder of the cinematic legend “Sleepy Hollow”. After the quest Ichabod Crane ?? played by johnny depp. in the heart of the mystery surrounding the random and terrible murders of the city by the legendary headless horseman, the story unfolds as if it were deliberately trying to be disgustingly predictable. Invented as a children's bedtime story, the funny introduction of the character is permeated by deliberately exciting and exciting chase scenes that, with undeveloped characters fleeing their lives, produce as much fright and thrill as the Nightmare Before Christmas. <br /> <Throw in an endless bundle of old trees for the atmosphere and the blonde with wide eyes and great love (Christina Richie), and Burton has a film that takes the age-old legend of Sleepy Hollow, and he succeeded. like a Disney movie without charm or captivity. The dialogue was fluid and ridiculous, severed heads were plentiful, and there were enough monologues exposing the plot to confuse people like James Bond. Even with the support of Emmanuel Lyubezki, the most sought-after filmmaker in Hollywood today, Depp's magnificent role and the amazing recognition of the name of Burton, Sleepy Hollow is nothing to lose your head.
