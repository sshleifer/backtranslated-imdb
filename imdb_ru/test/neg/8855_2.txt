Sandy drama? Emotionally powerful? Blah! The BBC has lost a lot of time for such productions as The Wire, Sopranos and Carnivale from HBO. So, the budget may be much smaller, but yesterday's “Street” was a poorly acting, predictable, unrealistic, stereotypical, insensitive, and big fat waste of time. Television (British television) is not as good as before, and more and more behind American production. <br /> <br /> There was no sense of brutal violence from the “local gangster”. There was no indication that this man was "crazy" enough to beat the man he respected for so long. When he did this, there was no remorse, and it should not have been the character who would back down when Bob Hoskins called his son pansy in manifestation of "courage." <br /> <br /> I wish I was more eloquent to express my disdain for this show, but I am not one, and although I cannot prove my point well enough, trust me when I speak that it was nonsense, shock television, which does not give any real inner perspective of life. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
