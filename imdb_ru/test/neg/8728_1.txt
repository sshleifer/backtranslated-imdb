I agree in many parts with a rather thorough review, already published on the theme of the miniseries, and I agree that it has its advantages, and not only the minuses. For example, in the original film it is possible to cut most of the middle and last parts of the novel into a single montage, including the discovery of Gurney Halleck and the novel by Paul Atreides and Chani, which is a parody when reading the novel. . This was one of the main flaws of the original film, and the miniseries, to its credit, includes many of the original plot lines that were cut from the Lynch film due to the expansive nature of the Herbert novel. <br /> <br /> However, in itself, this is a double-edged sword. Instead of completing the translation of the novel from the text into celluloid, the creators of the mini-series were tempted to create their own storylines that were missing from the original novel. Similarly, although it is certainly a “more complete” description of the Dune storyline, it is also a break with the original heart, soul, and main vision — the vision of prophecy. Where are the inner monologues that characterize Herbert's writing and demonstrate what many different characters think about without having to suddenly change the point of view or expand with words or unnecessary and unnatural oral monologues? Gone. So much of the initial agony of Paul’s decision to choose jihad or death, the choice to fulfill the prophecy or abandon it, undoubtedly, the most interesting aspect of the novel itself (and the one that fascinates people who are far from science fiction fans) is missing. <br /> <br /> What is the point in Dune without prophecies? This is simply a more educated and learned version of Farscape or Andromeda. How sad that this is all that we have provided. Yes, the Lynch movie was a mistake. But a flawed film may lead to a correction by another director, taking on some of Lynch’s best filmmaking moments and rejecting some of the more bloated aspects of the style, while at the same time restoring the storyline. Now this story will probably never be transferred to the cinema again, and I find it heartbreaking.
