I do not understand how this garbage hit the shelves of a movie store, it is not even a real film! It was incredible, I and a group of friends decided to watch this one night, and it was just the stupidest thing that any of us have ever seen, I couldn't believe it! For the first 15 minutes we watched in complete fear that someone really thought about it, and then turned it into a film. Are they on crack? I think, yes, in huge doses. I very much doubt that anyone might like this garbage. Does it have to be sci-fi or comedic or what? I do not think that the idiots who cared about this simply decided to make a film about nothing and see how many suckers they could fool to watch it. Well, we put something on tape, so let's take it in the movie store and see if they really put it on the shelf - no, no, no. This is not a movie. Action is like watching wooden dolls walking and reading from a book, that's how bad it is. I feel like I'm going to the cinema, complaining and getting my money back, no one should tolerate this shit. So I'm here to warn you - DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE, it's the dumbest thing you have ever seen!
