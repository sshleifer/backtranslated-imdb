Oh my God. In this sequel, this time there is a mirror in which the evil spirit of the psychopath who killed a whole family from a shotgun in Amityville house is kept. The mirror captured the entire horrible case of a terrible family that did not have time to prepare for its uninvited guest. The mirror is transferred to photographer Kees (Ross Partridge) with his ass (.. just those who turned out to be his crazy father and the man responsible for killing the family), and soon this evil terrorizes those in the attic (.. for example, artist Case, friend Suki pictured by Julia Nixon-Soul, where he lives when they look at it. Soon Keysu has nightmares, he looks through his father’s eyes, coolly shooting his family, fearing that he may follow in his footsteps. Soon he sees other incidents in his father’s eyes, like that terrible day when dad hit heads with his mother about the floor of the institution or experienced a moment inside the cell when the doctor injected the medication to immobilize it. Support for actors who deserve better than to get stuck in the garbage like David Naughton is quite strong (American werewolf in London) as the owner of the attic that Keese lives with, Richard Roundtree as an eccentric sculptor / painter, Terry O'Quinn as a psychologist -detective, and especially Lin Shay as a cheerful child, a rather strange secretary-nurse in a shelter (.. the one that kept father Case) th will be closed soon. <br /> <br /> Completing the film, the sexy, leggy Lala Sloatman as supporting girlfriend Case, Barbara Howard (Friday, 13th: Final Chapter) as the devoted wife of Noton (he was on the verge of starting a novel with Nickman-Soul ), Jack Orend as a sadistic villain who tries to provoke his son to kill innocent people, as he did, and Robert Rusler (A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddie's Revenge) as a rejected lover (..Nixon-Soul) who meets an unsuccessful demise, tearing pictures as revenge for his dismissal. /> <br /> This movie is a bad special effects movie, just using the name Amityville as money. The franchise has never been so great from the start, but with each continuation of the green light, it became worse and worse. After the third film, furniture from the infamous house becomes an “obsessed” subject that torments people. Nevertheless, the actors try their best, but the material (... the mirror causing chaos and killing with supernatural means) does not have quality ... and rather mediocre special effects do not help. O'Quinn, with whom he has to work, shows why he is such a great actor, he may even shine in such excrement. Still not lost, you will see that Slowutman is always wearing super short skirts (or her man’s shirt in shorts), showing off his legs everywhere ... hey, you should find a silver lining somewhere. Believe it or not, AMITYVILLE: NEW GENERATION was the seventh film in the franchise! The coolest part of the film was the portraits of demons painted by the artist Nixon-Soul, perhaps inspired by an evil mirror after his exploration.
