I really wanted this movie to be liked, especially after all that I heard around this buzz. But unfortunately it just didn’t work for me. Paranoid Park suffers from the same fallacy as Lost Translation: if you use very few dialogues, be attentive to close-ups with slow motion and focus on pieces of fabric in the setting, then your story will magically be deep and thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Most of the storyline, if you can find the plot, this film is invented. I was not impressed with the confession “write down everything”, how the main character copes with the accident. So what should we believe in? He grew up happily and wrote a book about his experience, so was he justified for this terrible incident? <br /> <br /> That, I suspect, must be a film that evokes sympathy for a young man who, when Directed and faced with impossible moral difficulty, creates a portrait of a future sociopathic person instead. He has nothing to do with anyone around, and by the end of the film he has no real understanding of what is right or wrong. At home he has no direction, and he does not feel anything towards his friends. What we have is a portrait of a non-man, a spirit who just floats through life while he lags on his skateboard. I do not feel about him at all, and, frankly, I would like to be caught. The entire film does not necessarily focus on his guilt feelings, but on how he is going to avoid punishment and / or responsibility for a bad decision. He not only gets away with it, he finds a way to subtly rationalize it. A very frightening, negative message, suggesting that so many of our young people are so detached from the right and the strong that they simply make up the rules when they go forward, serving themselves for good or evil. I consider this an offensive treatment of modern youth, and the pretentious arrogance of the director accumulates with every painful, thoughtful step and keen eye. <br /> <br /> (He killed the guard, but if you blink your eyes, you miss him. Whether it was an act of mercy or not, it's hard to say - perhaps he was so upset that he pounced on his skateboard. When he runs to the guard's car, one of the wheels of his skateboard is stained with blood.)
