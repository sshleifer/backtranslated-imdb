A film that tries its best to say something and usually fails. Like the stupid academics who inhabit the film, he wanders aimlessly, replacing the endless (it seems, forever listening to him) conversation with some action or plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is one of the best examples of Canadian Cinema I have seen.
