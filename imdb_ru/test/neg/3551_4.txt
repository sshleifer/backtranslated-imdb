Not even original in the plot. Ho hum There were a few moments that could be quite interesting, but the film follows the path of 90% of Hollywood films. I really do not “understand” how Samuel Jackson plays most of his time in his other films, but he was pretty good at this film. He rarely shouted and went much further in his character, instead of returning to the “anger in your face”. I liked Eva Mendez - as usual - and even though she was a great eye candy, she turned out to be much more than an actress. Louis Guzman was also really good, except for the fact that I didn’t like the change of his character towards Samuel Jackson at the end of the film. How can a character center around disliking a former cop and then turn into a lollipop in a split second? Is there no original thought left in Hollywood?
