What do you get when you plant Lou Diamond Phillips, Todd Bridges, Barry Corbin with a bad wig and an alien in a train? You get a very bad movie called “Alien Express” or “Dead Rail”, which will be more interesting in the old TV series Comedy Central “Mystery Science Theater 3000”. You name it, this horrible film has suffered in the areas of acting, plot, plot and special effects. In fact, the external shots of the passenger train looked as if the production personnel used the usual HO scale model in front of a painted background! The rest of the special effects go down the hill. <br /> <br /> The plot is very predictable and is similar to two films from the 1970s called The Terrible Express and a film about the catastrophe called Cassandra Crossing. At least, Kassandra Junction had the best cast, an exciting storyline and real train scenes. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh well and laugh at the movie at the “At the Cinema” party, then look; otherwise, "Alien Express" derailed long before leaving the station!
