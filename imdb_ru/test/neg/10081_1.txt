When I came to look at it, I thought that I liked the first two and I thought that they were very tense, so this one should also be good. WRONG! There was no waiting, and they do not explain about the new dinosaurs! When I finished watching this, I lost all respect for Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton, but then it turned out that this was not the director Spielberg and not Michael Crichton! This film was experiencing "movement." I thought that this film had absolutely no plot, and I thought that no one should spend their money to watch it.
