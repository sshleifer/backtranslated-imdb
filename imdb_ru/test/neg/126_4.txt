It is worth the entertainment cost of rent, especially if you like action movies. In this game, the usual car chases, fights with a great style of hitting Van Damme, shooting in battles with a shotgun of 40 shells and even a bomb in a terrorist style. All this is interesting and well-resolved, but nothing can surprise you if you have already seen your share. <br /> <br /> The plot becomes interesting thanks to the inclusion of a rabbit that is smart, but hardly deep. Many of the characters are largely stereotypical - evil veterans, frightened illegal immigrants, crooked policemen, indifferent feds, a harsh, tough lady-station chief, a bent politician, a fat federalist who looks like he was a type of Mexican in a 1940s Hollywood film. All acted tolerably, but again nothing special. <br /> <br /> I thought the main villains were pretty well made and did pretty well. By the end of the film, you probably knew who the good guys were and what not. There was an emotional lift, because the really bad ones got their only deserts. Very simplistic, but then you did not expect Hamlet, right? The only thing that really annoyed me was the constant cuts to the VD daughter during the last battle scene. <br /> <br /> Not bad. Not good. Passable 4.
