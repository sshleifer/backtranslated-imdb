A special unit of four police detectives administers justice in a unique way in the 1950s in Los Angeles. Nick Nolte plays Max Hoover, the chief officer of the unit, and his partners are Michael Madsen, Chazz Palminteri and Chris Penn. Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly and John Malkovich are also starring. Pretty impressive list of names. Unfortunately, this is the only thing that even impresses in this film. <br /> <br /> Our story begins when young Allison Pond, played by Connelly, is dead in a remote area of ​​the city that is currently being developed. Our group of four detectives is called, and it immediately becomes obvious that Max Hoover of Nolte will take a very personal interest in this case. Soon we learn that Allison, in addition to being well known to Hoover, was also associated with some rather important military and government types who might have had reason to want her dead. But who exactly was implicated and why precisely they would like this seemingly harmless woman to die? Hoover and the team go on a search. It sounds like an interesting premise, but, unfortunately, it is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Despite an impressive set of names, acting here leaves much to be desired. Nolte replays, Madsen seems incredibly bored, Palminteri and Malkovich play caricatures, Penn has almost nothing to do, and Griffith is boring as much as he can be. Of course, Connelly's best performance in fleeting episodes of memories. The dialogue throughout the film is forced and wooden. The sense of drama that can be expected from this type of mystery is absent altogether. Nothing dramatic really happens. In fact, nothing happens for most of the picture. Instead, we just go to a rather ridiculous and incredibly disappointing climax. When the "mystery" is solved, you may find yourself saying: "Oh, come on, is that all there is?" But things get worse, because after solving the mystery we get a completely ridiculous and absolutely incredible sequence of actions. And even then we have to suffer further, because at the end there is another horrible, poorly acting, completely unnecessary scene. And then, fortunately, it's over. And not for a moment.
