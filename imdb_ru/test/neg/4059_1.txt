This is without doubt the worst sequel I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them to make such a conclusion. The plot is just ridiculous. I can also catch the ball and run around the field. Why can't I play the Super Bowl? Yes, I know that this film was intended for children, but there are only some scenes that even children can understand, completely stupid and unreal. The first film “Air Bud” was pretty good, but this one was a complete failure. Disney loses it. If I controlled who won the Razzie Awards, I would give it a pair. Have a nice day! =
