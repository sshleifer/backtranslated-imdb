An unpleasant British film from a Japanese novel about a very worried young man who falls under the influence of a classmate like Hitler and plans to harm his widowed mother's lover. Several good scenes (Sarah Miles, having found her son spying on her and facing him in anger, a guy with a pasty face tries to lure Chris Christofferson at his demise, being very friendly), but what's the point of provoking shock? Ugly and uneasy, he does not demonstrate to anyone who is involved in any advantage (especially Christofferson, whose empty views and ordinary rude talk are irrelevant in such psychological turmoil as this one). Director Lewis John Carlino, without any feeling of his own absurdity, seems to believe that such a circumstance can really happen. If he is right, it is much more shocking than anything in Sailor. * from ****
