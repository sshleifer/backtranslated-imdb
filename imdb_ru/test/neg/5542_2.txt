Screenwriter and director Michael Hearst on the Sci-Fi Channel to the classic horror story Stan Winston about revenge that went awry, has its moments and a bit of decent bleeding, but ultimately not enough compared to the original. <br /> <br /> Of course I’ve been pretty sure the filmmakers didn’t try to make a comedy, but I caught myself laughing. Family feud, which began because of a car accident, is the basis for this entry into the franchise. Families Hatfield and McCoy live in a remote city with unpaved roads, drive pick-up trucks, drink moonshine and beat each other in the ass at every opportunity. When Judy Hetfield (Amy Manson) and Ricky McCoy (Bradley Taylor) decided to fall in love with each other, they decided to fall in love, causing an attack of chance. One night, two lovers decided to go into the woods for a while, while Ricky's sister was playing guard, but it so happened that some of the Hetfield accidentally killed Ricky’s sister that night and caught him and Jody together. You know what happens next. Ricky finds the body of his sisters and decides to pay a visit to Haggis so that he can take revenge on the powerful Pumpkinhead. You, Hou! In addition, Harley (Lance Henriksen) returns to warn potential damned souls from using the Pumpkinhead to alleviate their pain. It really distorts the story, because Harley had to call the Pumpkinhead years before this story appeared, but the entourage and characters look like dirty Pilgrims who somehow traveled in time to deliver the pickup truck back to Plymouth. In addition, there is a sheriff (Rob Freeman) who has his own connections with the demon and looks as if he is participating in a 70's revenge movie, and not about a horror movie made for cable television. <br /> <br /> Some of the blood and special effects were cool, but instead of sticking to the “man in costume” mindset, Hurst used some awful looking three-dimensional frames for certain scenes. One particularly awkward picture shows a pumpkin-headed man jumping from tree branches, how a poorly rendered 3D monkey. Cinematography was exceptional and slightly improved the quality of the film. The game was pretty decent, with the exception of a few poorly executed accents. <br /> <br /> Family feud never ends well, especially when families involved in feud have to deal with the Pumpkinhead. I didn’t enjoy every minute of this film, but it was much better than most of the films sci-fi channels post. Maybe this is a sign that the channel is trying to improve the quality of its films so that they match the quality of the original series. ” I would not waste a coin for rent, but if you had the opportunity to catch it again in a test tube, I would say to check it out. This is not such a deadly film, but it rises just above the level of garbage that nowadays gets on DVD.
