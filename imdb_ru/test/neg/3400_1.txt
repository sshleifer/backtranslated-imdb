As if someone was trying to make a scary video game and documentary at the same time. The historical aspect was great. Everything else was terrible, stubs for directors of another film that seemed to happen every minute, the video of the real ghost hunt was edited as a scary film, and not as an investigation, they pursued house music and sound effects that would distract you from what's happened. Thank you for wasting 2 hours of my time! When there was evidence, it would have flown by! They were mostly just people who talked about the place. The episode of the Ghost Hunters show that went on there absolutely destroys how this show was. I'm so upset about the science fiction channel for playing it, not watching it since it went on the air.
