National Lampoon's Dorm Daze is just the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen Kazaam. Anyone who reads this, who thinks that this film was good in any respect, form or form, has no idea what a good film is and should never watch another film again, because it is really so stupid. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to call it all wrong with this film. First, the plot is everywhere and cannot follow very well all the numerous “misunderstandings”. The game is terrible at least, and it was all badly done. Anyone who has worked on this film should not be in another child’s film, ever again! <br /> <br /> Too difficult to sum up this movie in just one or two paragraphs, because it’s so bad, but for those reading it there, please don’t watch this movie! If you want to watch a good movie, turn on something else on TV. Even in the US, films are better than this. <br /> <br /> _friend.
