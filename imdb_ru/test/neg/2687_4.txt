I am new to Argento’s work, and if this is Suspiria are some signs, then Argento is more of a cinematographer of experience than a story. In his films, the characters fall into grueling and fascinating horror contexts that literally saturate the logic of the world around them. The camera literally gracefully flows through the sets while the characters run, stumble and strangle their way to a possible terrifying conclusion. It worked, really well, in Suspiria. For some reason it did not work. <br /> <br /> The problem I faced in this film is that although the main character “gets help” by contacting the police and asking his friends for help, it still feels as if she’s refuses to "get help" in terms of the actual attempt to find a solution to her problem. The capture in this film is that she is trapped in a little killer game that she could easily get out of ... without tuning in so easily? In a strange way, it seems that the character wants the torture that the killer inflicts on her, which, in a sense, is the meaning and could work, except that his whole psychology is disturbed mainly because of what Argento feels he does. <Br /> <br /> As a tribute to the “Phantom of the Opera”, this is certainly an interesting and unique take. Despite all his virtues, Argento also enjoys operatic movements, which well underlines the action. It just doesn’t make much sense, especially since he goes deeper into a completely useless ending (yes, I know that this is a link to Harris’s novel The Red Dragon. No, it didn’t work). Why a character should move from one awful fishing experience to the one who wishes with the director is not clear to me. From the side of Argento, it sounded almost selfish. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a fun experience, and between this and Suspiria I’m more than willing to follow up on the further production of Argento. But this is not the film that I would like to return to or recall. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
