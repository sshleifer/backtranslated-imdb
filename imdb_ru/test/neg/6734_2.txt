Since I am from Norway (one of the ten richest countries in the world), it was great fun to see how we use trucks from the 50s and have been living in cottages since medieval times. And since we have very strict laws regarding pistols, it was interesting to see how many weapons there actually were in Norway in five minutes of shooting. Mr. Direct-to-video even managed to deliver a silencer as soon as possible, so he must have powerful friends at customs. <br /> <br /> Please at least find out something before heading to an "exotic" country, Dude - you can hurt the feelings of old fans. <br /> <br /> Sverre is an old fan with hurt feelings.
