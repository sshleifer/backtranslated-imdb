I see this film as a bad tribute to old films. Since he really does not hold a candle in the horror era of the gold of the 70s and 80s, this is, of course, personal taste. <br /> <br /> This film simply falls into the category of “New Generation Slashers” in my book of cast - typical 18-24 years and potential models. I am personally very tired of this image in horror films, old films at least had some differences in people. One or more fat people and assholes in general. Just looking people, of course, having a couple of good looks is good, they were always there. But when the whole cast is just a bunch of good pillars and asses, it becomes stupid. I mean, yes, I like to watch hot chicks. But not in horror, which should reflect that some ordinary people are hunted, for example, a maniac with a knife ... You expect that some random people who you see on the street will look like people who are hunted. I think. Of course, there are some films with good audiences, but this is not so much. “Wrong move” is one of the best examples. <br /> <br /> The next point is the murder scenes that the slasher should talk about. In this bad movie, all you can see is 2-3 shots of sudden alt / scream and crescendo music. And it's all. What you can see is not at all very clear, not for people who have seen horrors for many years. In comparison with this, the slashers of the old school had much more and better death, blood and blood. Not to mention the killers in those films that have surpassed those you see here. <br /> <br /> As for real horror fans, watching horror with new approaches is much more interesting and original because of originality. what pops up, the killer in this does not add anything new and fresh to the genre, in my opinion. I have to agree with what someone previously said, CGI is what I hate to watch. Personally, I prefer makeup in the sense that I am a conservative (unless the CGI is very well done). But the most important thing is to set a good mood setting, which will allow you to “get into the movies”, a good background story is a very good thing. In addition, disclosing and explaining too much of everything in the movie to viewers removes any feeling of mysticism that adds much mood and prevents you from thinking a lot. Just as an example: keeping the assassin's background secret for the viewer is a good move in many cases. I mean, if everything about the story and the people in it should be explained or shown in detail, then this is not so much content left for the viewer to think about ... It's like watching a porn movie and hope for a great story in the meantime. <br /> <br /> Why the old school slashers still work, at least for some people. This is because they became cult films of that era when they were something new, so making new films of this kind is difficult today. The exception may be people who are new to this kind of horror, of course. I noticed that many people like these horror films, so, of course, there is no “right taste” for horror films. <br /> <br /> But for people who can share my opinion; Here you have a guideline what to expect from this movie.
