I think it was a HORRIBLE mistake from Disney. First, Cusco DOESN'T have to go through the "imperial school" to become an emperor! This has never happened before. Secondly, the new voices are not at all like the originals. Very bad repetition. And although I loved the film "The Emperor's New Groove", "New School" is just stupid. It seems all the jokes are the same, and many of the movie. The plot becomes redundant, always Isma (so you write it?) Tries to become an empress, Kuzko stops her, and so on. D. Or Kuzko learns to become better. I think Cusco is annoyed by his constant complaints and questions. He is a spoiled child, and it bothers me. I do not think that it is worth five minutes of your time, much less half an hour.
