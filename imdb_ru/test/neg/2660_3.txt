Nothing could be more appealing than the idea of ​​a good love story featuring Kristin Scott Thomas and Harrison Ford. Cool, sophisticated English beauty and warm-blooded American man - what could be more beautiful? Well, this is not the movie. Immediately they ruined everything, appointing Christine Scott Thomas as an American congressman. This is similar to the role of Hugh Grant in the role of Baby Ruth. Or Colin Firth as Al Capone. Kristin Scott Thomas is exactly the kind of woman you can't imagine shaking hands with fat ex-addicts in dirty slums or squeezing smelly crowds and kissing babies. She would have been much better played by the birth of an aristocratic senator who belongs to the hunting club and goes to flower shows, but she has no idea how the other half lives. <br /> <br /> Then there is Harrison Ford as a regular guy, a cop. Of course, he's tough enough for the role. But the idea that he is going to admire this stunning social beauty is a bit hard to swallow. Why could he not be, say, a tough, but rich reformist politician with blue collar roots who inherited the Senate’s place of her late husband Christine? They are both pretty cool with each other, but for the sake of duty Christine is cordial to him, and he in turn begins to show her some of the rougher aspects of life - the things that her husband protected her from. Her political awakening coincides with the passionate passion of a new, bluer collar lover - one who appreciates her sophistication and refinement much more than her aristocratic husband. Now it's a love story! Instead, however, you get an empty, meaningless “thriller” where the action is delayed and nothing happens. Well, there’s one passing-by ghetto-style scene where Harrison is almost killed, but she’s so harsh and inexplicable that she’s actually more like a long-awaited comic relief. <br /> <br /> In this film, the sky is always gray, and our exquisite, beautiful Christine always looks a little chilled. When she must dream of passion, she looks more like a dream of a woolen blanket and a cup of tea! She also looks a bit sleepy most of the time, as if she would really prefer to nap in bed than to fuck Harrison Ford. <br /> <br /> Given all the circumstances, I would say that you cannot blame her.
