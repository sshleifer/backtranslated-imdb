The Alien is a direct video from Stephen Seagal, originally intended to be shown as a theater film in March 2003. It was assumed that this intention was canceled when Seagal’s previous film (Half Past Dead) was shot at the box office. According to some reports, the film had a generous budget of $ 20 million, including filming in Warsaw and Paris, and it was completed as part of a studio commitment to make a two-picture deal that was agreed upon after the relative success of Exit Wounds seemed to indicate that Seagal still had solid followers. <br /> <br /> Despite the size of their investments, Sony Screen Gems probably made the right move in postponing this film. It is almost incomprehensible. What i say It's incomprehensible. I do not think I understood everything that happened, except for the most general terms. <br /> <br /> A mysterious guy hired Seagal to deliver a mysterious package to another mysterious guy. Other mysterious guys are trying to stop him. Other very mysterious guys are trying to kill moderately mysterious guys who are trying to stop him. Other really, really mysterious guys do especially mysterious things, and all this was in fact too mysterious for me to understand. The mysterious wife of the intended recipient attempts to intercept the package before she can be delivered to her husband. Since he is a self-proclaimed "unsurpassed professional" who was hired to deliver the package only to her husband, Seagal first challenges his wife and then intervenes in protecting her and her daughter from other mysterious guys for unexplained reasons. agendas, as well as from her husband. <br /> <br /> Many people have mysterious, mysterious conversations. Many people knock each other's brains out. Some guys seem to die more than once, while in other scenes the shootout ends without a clear idea of ​​the result, so viewers can see that someone is dying, but they are not sure which shooter is heading for the hill. Loyalty often change, adding mystery. Or should I say embarrassment? <br /> <br /> I don’t know who was on which side, or what someone really wanted, and the resolution was just as unsatisfactory as the exposure. At the end of the film, I just sat and thought: “Is this the end? What the ...? "<br /> <br /> I could not even understand what was the matter. IMDb says Australian actress Kate Fisher (from Siren) was in this film, but I'll be damned if I find out where. Either she was left on the floor in the cutting room, or she wisely refused to participate in the project. She might have found some activities more useful for her career, such as having to do an unnecessary operation, pulling out those annoying magazine inserts, or visiting some of the livestock college courses. <br /> <br /> Seagal used to be a pretty sympathetic honest hand-to-hand fighter, but the militants did not manage to redeem this film at all. Sigalu is now in his fifties, and he is a very large man, so he minimizes the level of physical exertion, and even during this he is kept in a coat up to his knees to hide his rudimentary Brandos girth. He may even flinch a little, removing the wrappers from the bars, although this is understandable if you calculate how many of them he needs to eat in order to maintain his current girth. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal seems to be preparing a return with Exit Wounds, but if his last film was already half dead, then this one should be pretty close to filling the other half.
