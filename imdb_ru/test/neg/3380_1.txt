Although I could summarize this pathetic episode of The Night Gallery in a nutshell, these two words are horse manure, I must write at least ten lines. This is a very second-rate episode, not worthy of the standards of Rod Serling, but rather an inept attempt at some ironic black comedy. The premise of the giant rodents inhabiting the moon is, of course, a lifeless ball, completely ridiculous, as is the construction of a giant mousetrap. I suppose we must also assume that the moon is made of green cheese, and this is how these absurd creatures survive. I can only assume that this episode was presented as filler to supplant the other two episodes, first shown on that day. In general, a waste of film, actors and airtime.
