After reading the back of the box, I first thought that it was probably a fake Saw 2. I could not be further from the truth. It seemed to me that they had given someone a phone with a camera and 10.00 dollars with down syndrome and told them to make a film. The plot did not exist, and did not act. As if I was watching a silent film about growing grass. It didn’t surprise me at all when I found out that the whole film was “improvised”. By the end of this “movie” I lost my will to live, and maybe I got sick with AIDS just from watching this piece of cinematic shit. I could spend about 70 minutes doing something less painful. How to jump off the building.
