Contrary to most of the comments in this section, I must say that this film barely escaped the definition of “rubbish!”. The only readers who seem to know what a catalog of clichés are are those who, like me, live in the northeast and know first-hand what this area looks like. I am completely tired of films that should be “realistic”, but at the same time depict the working class (wherever it is) stupid, criminal, but then I justify them because of their social background. And funny? I smiled briefly twice and laughed once, but this was due to the incompatibility of the two boys-actors with Sunderland accents, allegedly trying to hide their accents in Newcastle from Sunderland fans! There was only one pleasant character in the whole film, and it was the eldest grandfather whom Roy Hudd played quietly, but very competently - the only one not Jordi in the cast. <br /> <br /> As for the script - well, I'm just wondering at which faculty of university sociology the author studied. He, of course, did not hear the local accent. And I also never heard the expression “Pure Belt” - and I am not only my own, I am a linguist who writes articles in the local dialect. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and vision on this garbage. This is not funny, not realistic, not entertaining and fundamentally dishonest.
