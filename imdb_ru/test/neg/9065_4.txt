All right, so it's about 30 minutes of blood with no history at all. There is no conversational dialogue, no subtitles, not even real characters. You see three people in the whole movie (who are alive), and two are just there for a very small reason. The main guy has no emotions and simply cripples the corpses for no apparent reason. This is the whole movie. I love to watch very bloody films, especially since in America real blood is not very common in modern films. So yes, the effects of blood were pretty cool. But this is not very disturbing. Why does everyone think it is so alarming? There are no characters, only 3 living people and 3 corpses. No one has a personality or background. You see how three corpses are torn to pieces, and you cannot identify with it unless you identify yourself with death and how this may well happen (despite the fact that the guy lost his job and soon after that goes to jail) The viewer must take care and care, he must identify himself with the victim. For example, in a good horror movie, you should take care of the main character. This is just a guy and a corpse. It is as deep as a puddle, made from just one drop of rain. They never give you any reason to care for anyone in the film. All this guy hacks several bodies, and then has sex with the body. Now with the sex scene is a strange thing: he always puts on gloves, but does not use a condom. Therefore, he could not take care of getting some strange STD from sex with a corpse, but as long as his hands are not entangled, there are no problems, now it is really logical. I do not really like the film, I liked that it was very terrible, but when it ends, it makes no sense to watch it again, there is no reason to even worry, and this is simply not a very convincing film. I say that if you can find it for less than $ 10, then you could also get it, but if it’s more than simple, it’s not worth it.
