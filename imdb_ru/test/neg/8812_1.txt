Why every time I mention this movie to someone, I have to hear 10 minutes of praise about it. I came to the conclusion that any film that has a turnaround is considered a “genius” for everyone who watches it. Is this really what the film has become? Or every time someone says: “Wow, this is so cool!” Everyone has to agree with them and not have their own opinion? How this movie has a rating of 7.5 is a shame for the film industry as a whole. It also became another film for which “two” sequels are “needed”, so I will have to hear about this terrible franchise for a long time. <br /> <br /> Now about the film and why it is like that. so bad. The original concept of this film is actually not so bad, since lately there has not been a good film about a serial killer. The writing for this film is terrible as well as execution. Well, this is a low budget movie, but that should not change the story or the writing. The actors could not be worse, trying to make us fear this killer or just fear this movie. Thus, they go out and get a big name in Danny Glover, but his talents (whatever they are) are in vain, because ITS CHARACTER IS NOT WORTH. Why is he even in this film? What was all his struggle at the end turned out to be useless and misleading because of what the audience deems happening. This is, of course, the intention of the directors, but there could be no better way to do this without forcing us to watch all this garbage. And then the “big” turn comes (was it the third or the fourth?), And the whole audience is in shock and leaves the theater, as if it were some kind of masterpiece. Of course, the film makes people talk about the storyline, and what does not, but it was not the only flaw in this film. The direction tried to be too creative with what it worked with, and the sequences of memories were used simply as a shock effect. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, even if you like it, go back and watch the movie and you will soon understand why it is not worthy of the praise it receives. If you haven't done so yet, watch the awesome serial killers movie. This is exactly what this film wanted to be. I have received more arguments about this film than perhaps others, and will continue to argue with him. Please do not support this franchise, not only for you, but for me and everyone else. Hollywood needs to find a good horror film, not 1000 remakes, sequels and films about the "shock" factor (such as this one). Oh, yes, the label "Saw 2" sounds promising: "Oh, yes, there will be blood." Yaaayyyy !!!! Pretty!! blood, should that mean his good right? Give me a break. Sorry to everyone who loves this movie, but bad writing, bright direction and bad play do not make a good movie.
