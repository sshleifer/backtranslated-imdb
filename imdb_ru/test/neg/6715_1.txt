Sigh ... what can I say? <br /> <br /> Why a horrible script like this gets approval first. There is nothing wrong with having a complex plot, but this was not properly explained to the audience. <br /> <br /> Wife explains the plot with memories - this is bad, bad, bad. Having such a tough editing of battle scenes is also bad! Such fancy editing appears only in trailers. It reduces the cost of the whole look! <br /> <br /> And who are the Russian guys on top of the movie? Who is the guy who was tortured? Is he from the CIA? <br /> <br /> This film did not deserve release in the cinema. But it does not deserve to be produced in the first place. This is a joke with Hollywood.
