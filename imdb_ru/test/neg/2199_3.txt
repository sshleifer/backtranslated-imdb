Rating: * 1/2 of **** <br /> <br /> “The Network” is one of those films that will not remain in your head until the next hour. Well ... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is. It is a mediocre, pitiful, hollow, ridiculous and predictable piece of trash. One of the adjectives I just used above is the reason that made me add 1/2 stars to the one I would give. So is this a “so bad, is that good” case? No, this is a case of "so bad that it is ridiculous." <br /> <br /> Bullock in (unexpectedly!) very poor performance is played by Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time. She works at home, she has no friends, and her neighbors do not know her. Suddenly she sees herself involved in dangerous situations after her colleague dies, and the same thing almost happens to her. Her identity, bank accounts, etc., D., Etc., All removed, and now she is Ruth Marx. The plot even includes the government and ... Wait! Have we not seen this before? Yes, thousands of times. The Network is trying to be modern, to be a portrait of the 90s, showing the computer as a villain. Big deal! This film is about nothing, just an excuse to show ridiculous action movies. Take the scene of the accident on the boat. I just laughed when the camera started to slow down ... <br /> <br /> What's worse is Sandra Bullock. How terrible she is! Has she already made a decent movie? "Time to kill," well. But she is still a bad actress, repeating the movements of the robots on each of her photos. <br /> <br /> The advantages and disadvantages of a computer have already been shown in “2001: A Space Odyssey”, the best, smartest, and most complex film ever made. No need to compare the "Network" with it, is not it ?? <br /> <br /> The only reason to see the “Network” is to laugh, as I said, and see what it is. tried to be. The results are unfortunately a shame. <br /> <br /> REMOVE this movie from your head!
