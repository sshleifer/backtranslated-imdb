A lot of good could be done with this film, using basically the same scenery, storytelling techniques and storyline. For example, why not plant the seeds of Erica's ability before killing her lover? Why not develop the relationship of Erica and the policeman slowly and convincingly? Perhaps, to counter Eric's metamorphism, having included in her life other aspects, relations, etc., which she now rejects? Why not make her hurt an innocent bystander, to emphasize the wrongness in Erica’s actions. <br /> <br /> Instead, TBO uses the fantasy of revenge at the maximum level, disingenuously saying “don't do this at home.” Messages are added only to make the film legal. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Jodie Foster. After showing a number of films such as The Silence of the Lambs, Nell and the film in which she plays an ordinary prodigy mother, Foster played a series of roles in which she plays the same hard-to-be-bitten heroine who alone defeats evil. This is fine once or twice, but I was too accustomed to her close-up of “fight flight”. A TBO could use a younger actress or one that would more convincingly perceive herself as a woman of forty (instead of 40-year-old Foster playing a younger woman). <br /> <br /> A TBO is a film with significant actors, funding, and resources that manage to get down in the trash.
