Yes, what did I expect? I thought it would be a film about young people at their turning point in life, something like “Sonnenallee” or “American Pie”, which I really liked. I wanted to see a funny movie, perhaps with an ironic look at the idyllic Würzburg. And what did I get? <br /> <br /> Warning, spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> This film begins with a long dialogue that gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow: longer dialogues. Sometimes I thought that Moritz Bleibtroy could forget his text and try to hide this fact by improvising and simply repeating what he had said before. But since I think of Bleibtroy as one of the best German actors, I believe that this effect was really intended. I think the author wanted to show how boring a conversation with close friends can be - especially when they are stoned. But actually, I don’t need a movie to get bored from talking to my friends. Boring dialogues make up the bulk of this movie. <br /> <br /> But okay, this one. I can handle this, I saw good movies with disgusting dialogues, just think about the life of Schwarzenegger. But the next thing is that the characters are cheap and flat, and the storyline is as predictable as everything else. Just one example (SPOILER !!): Why do you think someone carries a garden hose to his hemp plants in the depths of the forest? Water them? Of course not, usually you will not find water pipes in the depths of the forest, is not it? The only reason this water hose is because the hunter, who comes by chance while the two main characters collect their dope, may be subjected to drugs, ill-treatment and, finally, filled with three bottles of Jaegermeister. I really hated this scene because it is really cruel. Usually I don’t mind violence in films - comedy techniques are full of them. But in such a comedy between you and you there is a tacit agreement that people will not suffer if they fall on their faces or be beaten with chairs or the like. But if this happens in a film that is otherwise realistic enough, the scenes of the farce also seem real. In this particular scene in Lammbock, I really thought that this hunter should be seriously injured, if not dead - the final scene really gave me the impression that he was left to die there, completely filled with plenty of booze that everyone can handle. And the main characters just leave. Otherwise it would be if the author consistently followed the same style; The scene could be pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Talking about being consistent is what I lacked most in this film. The whole film seems to be a list of small episodes that came to the author’s mind. Things just happen for no apparent reason - yes, I know, this is life, but this is not a movie, because the movie is meant to tell a story, and not to show boring episodes without any meaning. I found myself asking, "Where is the point?" all the time. Characters other than the two main ones are not worked out, you will never know why the main character's sister wants to sleep with her best friend Kai, in fact, she tells you, but I could not buy it, not at all. I think she was just there to give Kai the opportunity to play this children's sketch test, which you must have seen a thousand times earlier, and mostly better. The friend of the main character you meet once, then she leaves Germany (which you don’t even see, and the guy doesn’t seem to matter), and finally, in one sentence it is mentioned that she met someone else in America and broke up with a hero. It seemed to me that the author wanted to tie several loose ends. He did not really know that you would never know what is wrong with studying law, being the son of a father (father corrects everything and serves coffee at the end of the night, which, in my opinion, makes him one of the best characters) for the entire film) and live in beautiful Würzburg. Even dinner with a dad's girlfriend, who may have been designed to show how awful to meet his father’s expectations, seemed flat, just another nice dinner with family friends (except for the trip the guy goes to later, but I think what to show that eating dope before you eat dinner with your parents is not healthy, it was not the purpose of this scene, if any). I survived much worse dinners in my life than this one, and still finished my exams. I could not understand one character in the whole film, it just seemed flat and implausible. <br /> <br /> All this made him not a very good film, but not one on which I would not watch TV again. He did have some good scenes (although most of them were not new, like the scene with nice and understanding police officers), some were really funny, some dialogues were good, and I like the game Bleibtra, although he repeated his famous stereotypes again this time. Not good, not disgusting, this is what I thought after the movie was half over. <br /> <br /> But then this scene of incest came, and I really found it repulsive. Incest is just not funny. I don't even know if it was intended to be funny, some people from the audience were laughing, so this could be so. This scene spoiled the whole movie for me, I no longer felt sympathy for the main character - I don’t feel sympathy for anyone who is damn helpless, for me, this is rape, and rape is not funny. So maybe it was a hint of a drama or so, but incest is never mentioned (although we thought this could be one of the reasons why the main character must eventually leave Germany, but as never not mentioned, we don’t know.), it is even completely unnecessary. I almost expected my sister to become pregnant eventually, which would simply add the final touch to this tasteless story, but even this final cliché wasn’t realized, because in this film nothing really is decided or thought through. This is not really funny, in fact it is not a drama, it is not a road movie a la Tarantino, despite the desperate attempts at violence, it is definitely not fun. <br /> <br /> Skipping this film, Watching "Final Fantasy" is also bad, but at least with beautiful pictures and not so tasteless.
