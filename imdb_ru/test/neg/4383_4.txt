When I was young, I was a big fan of Chuck Norris. I just started shooting all his old movies on video to see them with adult eyes. I remember that I especially liked it, and I thought it was one of his best. Now that I’m a bit older, I can say that, despite the fact that it’s rather average, I still consider it one of my best films. In the role of an actor for him, Norris plays a police officer who is haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous film about a serial killer. Serial killers are all in vogue these days, and people would like to think of them as being completely invented by the 1990s. In contrast, it's nice to see where the real passion came from, especially from the militants (and also from slash and slash) from the 70s and 80s. While Norris’s attempts, both with a sense of humor and with all forms of human compassion, come down to hands and laughter, no one can hit someone on the head like Chuck. Being a big fan of Steve James, I can recommend this film, the same thing for the legend of the genre Billy Drago, and also see Mitch from “The Blue Brothers” as a supporting role. Not great, but it's better than anything Norris did in the 90s.
