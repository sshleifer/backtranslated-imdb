The Book of Revelations begins very well. Daniel, a selfish dancer, is abducted, sexually abused and raped by three masked women. <br /> <br /> Nothing else happens after that. There is some hint of reopening, but the film provides no explanation, no real end. The reaction of Daniel after insults is very simple. He quits dancing, has sex with every woman around, and finally begins a relationship with a very simple and ordinary woman. <br /> <br /> I have seen a good share of feature films, but this is something missing. br /> <br /> Main wires are fine; but some characters do not seem to be fully defined.
