When the movie “Going to Hell” is released, you expect a certain amount of biker cliches. With character names like Pistolero, Comanche and Gent, I prepared for the worst and was just a blow to the face. Dialogue, soundtrack and style of shooting are standard for biker films. The dusty desert is blurred by the heat when the bikes rush along the road while CC Rider plays and they talk about sex and violence. To yawn! Three leads were just ridiculous and incredible. Seeing how old people, such as Bishop and Madsen (in a perverted shirt), riding in a dusty strip of a deserted highway reminded me of two men who were desperately trying to outlive their youth. Poor Eric Balfour tried his best, but with such bad material it is lost. Even the appearance of Dennis Hopper in full swing Easy Rider could not save him. And let's talk about the store bought the sun? Many have compared this with the work of Tarantino. It is not even close. What makes Tarantino work so brilliant is that he knows that she rolls over, so he just puts out the balls and raises it as high as possible. Bishop took this film so seriously that he was just a bad copy of the exploitation genre.
