The director was probably still in the early stages of training when he tried his hand at westerns. Look at the outfits. They all look well washed, well cleaned, well dressed and ironed, as if ready for church. Even horses look well-groomed and shiny. This is WESTERN, because I cry out loud! It should look dusty, nasty and sweaty. And then there is the amateur game of women in this bird. A whole dozen or so, all beautiful and gifted, had just been raped and widowed, but there was hardly a tear. Instead, they all with great interest (if not outright lust) look at the newly arrived magnificent seven, whom they subsequently feed, bandage and console with love during battles with gangsters. The same director's criticism concerns Lee van Cleef, who does a good job with acting. Our Lee, playing the law, just lost his dear wife. But Lee, strong as organic rock, does not show any emotion and turns out within a few days after the death of his wife in the arms of a lush widow, with whom he and her brood go into the future. Cad And there is one thing that always bothers me somehow with this type of film: it doesn't matter how many explosions caused by dynamite occur in the middle of a hundred about 50 horses, not to mention how many shots are fired. the rabble above them, they kill only crooks, and the nags always go their own way, rejoicing in the whole. (I know ... my stupid ... it's just a movie ...). This is not the worst western ever made, but get ready for some serious yawning.
