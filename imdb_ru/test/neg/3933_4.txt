The plot in Petites Coupures, of course, stunned this viewer. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> For about 48 hours, Otheia’s character has an affair with a teenager, loses his wife’s affection, tries to seduce Scott Thomas, rejects her, she gropes for more one female figure in the back of the car, and then finally shot herself dead for his troubles. <br /> <br /> *** end of the spoiler *** <br /> <br /> what ??? <br /> <br /> The only saving grace in this film is Kristin Scott Thomas. Like Charlotte Rampling, she seems * natural * to be filmed in French cinema. I hope that one day Francois Ozon will be able to play her in the part where she will be able to show her true talent. <br /> <br /> There are some excellent French films, such as the wonderful Colonel Chaber, asking for a DVD release, but for now this is a trip that is chosen. <br /> <br /> Avoid this. <br /> <br /> zzzz ..
