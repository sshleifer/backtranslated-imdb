A scary film about a doctor who catches fish and catches a mermaid when he is thrown overboard. She traps him to bring her back with her. <br /> <br /> Glynis Jones, starring, is a really stupid man with a tail hanging out. <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford is a nurse who must be so eccentric, but we donâ€™t see eccentricity here. In fact, Miss Rutherford was not allowed to use her comedic gifts. <br /> <br /> Nice to see David Tomlinson in the film. 16 years later, he will meet with Jones in the much more excellent Mary Poppins. <br /> <br /> Miranda hurts the fact that two guys, the neighbor's bride and the chauffeur (Tomlinson) fall in love with her. > <br /> Ask any mermaid that you accidentally saw, what is the best tuna, Chicken of the sea! As for this movie, forget about it.
