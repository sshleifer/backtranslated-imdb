After the death of the wife of a plastic surgeon, he gets his hunchbacked assistant, who will help him bring her back to life with various parts of other married, young girls. This film wants to be a game like Gersel Gordon Lewis, but fails with a bang. The game beyond the horror, the bloody effects of the brutal (no, not in a good way), the plot almost does not exist and does not give any pleasure. Skip this. Do you want to know how incompetent this is? At some point you can actually see the film on the slate. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Candy Furr becomes topless and again in memory <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> DVD Extras: Comment with Jeffrey Hogh and Synthia Soroca, the second function "How to make a doll"; Alternate headline with Herschel Gordon Lewis intro; 2 shorts ("The search for the perfect woman" and "Hospital maniac"); Dead Elvi Music Cover Gallery; Trailers for the films "Dr. Black Mr. Hyde", "The Boots and the Preacher"; Doctor and Playgirls, Horrible Deuce; "The Wizard of the Mountain"; "Awful Dr. Orlof"; "The Foolish World of Dr. Morgus"; "Professor Last," "The Beast"; "Fanny Hill meets Dr. Erotiko"; and “I, Marquis DeSade” <br /> <br /> Easter Eggs: theatrical trailer; the scene from "Just for the hell of it"; and trailer for "Ax"
