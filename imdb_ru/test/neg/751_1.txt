Can you rate 0 out of 10? Because this one deserves it. Although I'm not a big fan of Jane Austen's books, I looked through this book with two women. Well, at least we laughed at how bad this film is. Robert Hardy was the only actor with any charisma in all of this, although he went too far as usual (almost as bad as William Shatner). But this was not enough to save this stinker from fullness. It is often difficult to separate the sequence of a girl's dream from what is actually happening, and there are so many holes in history that you can barely understand what is happening. Too many loose ends, and the final reminds the culmination of "tune in again next week." The main actress is too small and strange in appearance to be a heroine, the main character is too stupid and feminine to be a convincing hero, and the music sounds like some cheap New Age project for the director's favorite daughter something a space opera woman crying?). So in conclusion, I suggest you cut the budget and order a DVD of this as soon as possible. Especially if you like disappointment.
