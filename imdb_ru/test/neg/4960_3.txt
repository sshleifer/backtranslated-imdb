This is terrible trash. I liked “How You Want Me,” “Father Ted,” “Green Wing,” and Bill Bailey's performance, but I submit them to Hippie and Planet of the Apes (rethinking) in “Great Family Tree, it went wrong.” I guess the same people like it with “Withnail and I”. It is rewritten, but little by little, luxurious air penetrates it, and Bernard Black is just less camp. And I thought it was self-indulgence even before Dylan Moran became a writer. But the installation shows such a comic potential that in the first two episodes I didn’t even notice that it wasn’t a bit. <br /> <br /> What they say / do * should * be funny, but somehow they don’t manage to register as more funny or “I see how someone, having written it down, could have thought that it will be funny. " What I am trying to say is that situations / comments are slightly humorous and yet too mundane / soft / consciously surreal to be created and portrayed in a comedy series. <br /> <br /> Life is too short. Avoid.
