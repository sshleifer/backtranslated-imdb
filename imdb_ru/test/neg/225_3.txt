After reading “Fool for Love” in my drama class, I was looking forward to see how Sam Shepard’s beautiful play would be translated to the screen. To my horror, this was not nearly as exciting as a play. The film seemed to pull, the music did not fit the tone of the film, and all the raw energy of the play seemed to be sucked out of this version of the film. It is a shame to see how this happens even with the participation of Shepard, who plays the role of Eddie. Do yourself a favor ... watch the game the next time it takes place in your area, or just read a book instead.
