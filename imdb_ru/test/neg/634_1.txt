* THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ... OR CAN NOT BE. WARNING THE SAME ALL * <br /> <br /> Damn it. Just when I thought that the SCIFI channel used all its ridiculous ideas for films, they gave us IT. Actually, the plot itself is something that we have not seen in films such as “Snakes on an airplane”, “Deep Blue Sea”, etc. ... This means that some kind of monster / animal / threat hiding in cramped surroundings, threatening a bunch of people. people. In this case, a foreigner on the train. Wow. <br /> <br /> I must say that when I first saw this thing on the cable, I could not stop laughing. No SCIFI film has prepared me for this; it was so incredibly pathetic that I could not believe it! All actors are a group of characters of a stereotypical genre. But since they are not so well known (if not more), I did not expect many of them. Except Diamond Phillips. There are no comments, but I think the guy was desperate to find a job. The problem was what they called “special effects”, which was terrible even for the standards of the SCIFI channel. The model / toy they made us believe that it was a real train (not to mention a model / toy helicopter, more than the train car), a meteorite horizontally arriving from space, an “alien” (puppet in a sock, and I am a “joke”), ordinary aliens who looked rather ugly ... as long as they were static; when they started to “move”, it was terrible, explosions (the terrorist blew up ALWAYS! And how about an exploding helicopter! How many barrels of gas did this thing carry?), mad mathematics used (they couldn't even solve the school problem correctly!) I will not talk about that end, similar to the end of the world, by the time I did not know whether to laugh or keep crying. If I remember correctly, I did both. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect movie to laugh alone or with friends. But be careful; it's so funny on so many levels ... and you need to damn much suspend disbelief ...
