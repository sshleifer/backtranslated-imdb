The motley collection of Western tourists in Africa fails because their plane broke down, so they had to take a bus to get through the Namibian desert to get to the nearest starting point to civilization. Not surprisingly, the driver’s compass ultimately does not work, and they are far from the course, stopping in an abandoned ghost town that was a barracks during the fighting in World War II. They find some kerosene (useless in terms of refilling their bus tank), a storage room full of semi-etched carrots in cans, and a local hermit who looks at them with indifference. One of them, who seems to have something in terms of survival techniques, is leaving to get help. They must remove the tires from the bus and burn them if he does not return in five days: I hope someone will see black smoke. <br /> <br /> Does this sound interesting? Well, of course, even if it sounds very similar to Flying the Phoenix or any number of films in the desert island genre. That is why it is surprising that “the King is alive” is number 4 (if someone else thinks) in the ongoing series Dogma 95, which, if I correctly remember this ridiculous Dogma 95 vow of chastity, proclaimed that “genre films Are strictly verbose. Unfortunately. Well, anyway, you can say that he will try his best to compensate for the fact that this is a genre film. Yes, it does not take long for one member of the group, an old-fashioned actor, to start writing - from memory! - various roles from "King Lear" on rolls of paper. The idea is that the performance of the play will help pass the time. All this actually goes against the advice of the hiding survivor to remain an optimist (did the old actor never speak at a theatrical dinner in the play “Odd couple” only once in his life?) <br /> <br /> This film is so bad that I really don’t know how to continue. This is so monumental, stupid, so full of absurd situations and characters, that causes rational criticism. Perhaps it is time to offer a Full Disclosure: I despise this so-called Danish film “movement” to an almost irrational degree. I think that my face even slightly reddened from the mere mention of Dogma 95. First of all, if there is a word “dogma” in the title of your movement, you have already lost me; secondly, in this particular case, the persistent demand of the movement to abandon individual artistic achievements is a recipe for hypocrisy, when you consider that the filmmakers rob one of the greatest works of the greatest INDIVIDUAL writer who ever lived. (But undoubtedly, a crowd of dogmas believes that the “Works of Shakespeare” were actually written by a consortium of Elizabethan celebrities such as the Earl of Oxford, Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh, and the queen herself.) <br /> <br /> Hell Perhaps I forgave the whole enterprise if he played the script for farcical purposes (attacking the precious Dogma - now THAT would be disruptive!). But the film takes itself very seriously, and soon turns into a cliché that accompanies the genre in which it belongs unmistakably: people who oppose each other; men grow beards; the inevitable deaths of several protagonists. All with a deadpan face. "Is this the promised end?" Well, not really: we also have to endure the terrible DV transmission. This is another rule from Dogma 95 vow of chastity: manual digital video only. Some Danish friendly advice: your “movement” has problems when your finished product has a worse visual quality than high school home video. Professionalism belongs to the artistic bag, along with his personality. Mr. von Trier, "Artisan" and "artist" are related words: not every donkey, who has $ 100 in his hands, can be a director. Pass it on. And, by the way, allow your directors of Dogma to get credits for their films while you are on it. The fact that the author of “The King is Alive” is recognized, while the guy (or girl) actually shoots him is just a bit hypocritical. <br /> <br /> Despicable. 1 star out of 10
