Everyone who was lucky had a lot to justify, and there was a lot of hype when this show was announced. Now it is easy to explain why he did not live up to his expectations: firstly, this show could not create a realistic world of teenagers, in which way Rugrats captured the world and the imagination of the little ones. Secondly, the heroes of the series are stereotypes (Angelica: white spoiled blonde unlike Susie: a colored girl from a modest family ...) or boring (Tommy, Chucky) and annoying (Deal). Finally, there is not a single ounce of innovation or original storyline. Summing up, we can say that All Grown Up is a waste of time and a bad idea to continue a series for a show such as Rugrats. It's boring, lacking imagination, and it seems that the producers do not even know how children behave from 10 to 13 years. To be precise, shouldn't Angelica and Susie compare the size of her bra, and not fight for someone who does a better job?
