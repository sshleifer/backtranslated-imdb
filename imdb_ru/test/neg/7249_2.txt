I bought this film for Blockbuster for $ 3, because it sounded interesting (a little Ranma-esque, with the idea of ​​dragging someone along the skeleton), because there was a cute girl in a mini-skirt on her back, and because there was sticker with limited viewing. I thought it would be sweet, or at least a sincere adult age with a strange indie edge. I was 100% wrong. <br /> <br /> After looking at it, I have to wonder how he got the limited sticker, because there is hardly any obscene language, some violence and the closest thing to nudity (Honestly! I usually don’t walk in the hope of it!) it is when a girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (you often see her panties in this film, because, in spite of everything, she is wearing some kind of mini-skirt). Even anti-religious humor is tamed (and chrome, caricatured, insincere, derivative, unoriginal and, worst of all, not amiss in the slightest degree - it would be better to just listen to "Ray Stevens": "Will Jesus wear a Rolex on his TV show") It barely qualifies as PG-13 (it’s not rated), but Blockbuster refuses to allow anyone under the age of 17 to rent it - as if it were pornographic. Any small child can go there and rent an edited version of Requiem for sleeping, but they insist that Zach and Reb are worse. <br /> <br /> a, but not like this. <br /> <In a sense, this worries me - the only thing that can offend people is the idea of ​​suicide in the beginning. If someone needs to watch films with honestly depicted suicides (not this, but the best, such as The Virgin Suicides, these are teenagers. If both of these films were rated as R solely because of the aspect of suicide, then I have little chance of turning the story I am writing into a PG-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). Suicide is one of the three main causes of death among adolescents (I think it is number 2), so it is likely that most adolescents have been or will be affected by this. <br /> <br /> Just say no to this movie though. 2/10.
