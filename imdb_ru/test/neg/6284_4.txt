I had only two reasons to watch this movie. Firstly, Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Marisa Tomei (who are both good actors) participated in it, and I had nothing better. Although, having seen the film, I immediately thought about something better to do: sleep! This film is a waste of time. This is a standard ex-cop movie. The former tinker is the best that ever existed, but he was fired. He continues to do something on his own, to the dislike of his former friends, and he saves the day. All the big surprises (NOT !!!) Go to bed, or if you have insomnia, try this. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
