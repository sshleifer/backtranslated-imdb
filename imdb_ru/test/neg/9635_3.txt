This presentation of the popular children's film story is pretty pathetic to watch. I know that this is one of the earliest attempts in filmmaking, but this 15-minute picture is not pictorial and poorly filmed. “The Great Train Robbery” (1903), which I also commented on, is much more creative and interesting to watch. <br /> <br /> We see a little long-haired Jack selling a cow (2 people in a cow). costume) for a hat of beans from a merchant, and later a beanstalk grows, from where his mother throws them in the yard (I suppose poor Jack got the wrong look). Jack dreams of a goose (actually a chicken) and a golden egg, and the next day he climbs the stalk into paradise. <br /> <br /> No effort is made in this film for creativity. The stem is like a rope with leaves on it, the giant is just a tall bearded guy in the house, nothing unusually large compared to Jack and the climax of the film where Jack escapes with a chicken goose and his golden egg is unhappy because the dummy’s dummy falls out of the screenshot instead of the giant and then the actor takes his place - rises to his feet in an exaggerated dance of death, as in most of the early films. The beanstalk (leaf-covered rope) stretches from above and is gently wound on the giants' forehead. <br /> <br /> See something else.
