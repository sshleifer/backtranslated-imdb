Keep in mind, the next time you see Richard Kelly participate in any production, run away quickly. <br /> <br /> Kelly proved to the world after his latest film “Tales of Southland” that he is one pretentious director. It was condescending and confusing. Little has changed in The Box. <br /> <br /> I can imagine what his plan for Warner Bros. should have been, and I’m willing to bet that the studio’s leaders did everything right: a full-length film based on one of Matson’s old Richard’s Twilight Zone stories . <br /> <br /> Big mistake! Do not read further if you do not want this film to be completely spoiled for you: <br /> <br /> Norma (Cameron Diaz) presses a button. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) has an alien who uses his body as a vessel for conducting “experiments” in which the fate of humanity rests. There are scars on his face, because he was struck by the Strangers' lightning that killed him, but then brought him back to life in order to perform all these tests of the red button. Obviously, since Norma presses a button, knowing full well that someone may die, she must suffer the consequences of not having to consider someone else’s life instead of her own. In the end, she and her husband (James Marsden) decided to kill Norma, instead of forcing their son to grow up deaf and blind. <br /> <br /> Kelly dances around the “message” of her film, trying to make the audience understand what the moral of the story is. Obviously, any person with a mind says at the beginning: “What if I were the one who was dying?” Richard Kelly doesn’t even allow his character to lead this normal HUMAN conversation. In fact, they avoid all of this together. It looks like they are both educated, working in a prestigious school, and also at NASA, so why shouldn't both of them have the best ability to SEE OUTSIDE THE BOX ??? <br /> <br /> If he had the main characters actually have this conversation, the whole movie could have ended right here! Instead, we have to watch the weddings last forever, NASA and the NSA will be pleased that Arlington Stewart is taking these government programs, teleporting to show Marsden's life outside of our world, so it’s easier to kill his wife and the drones will be controlled by Steward that can be anywhere, anywhere, anytime. <br /> <br /> The most painful part of this film is the tempo. In fact, nothing happens. This is a mixed bag of ideas that are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Incredible how this movie is sold. Commercials make it look like “Saw” and even use the music from these films to sell it. In fact, you get a slow, boring, ridiculous (yes, half of the theater laughed at the acting and visual effects) and dirty film, which is neither creative, nor interesting, nor cohesive. At some point, Cameron Diaz and her son were abducted, and then suddenly she returned to the big black NSA car with her husband on the way home. Where did she go? Why did they take her? Do we really care? I will not. <br /> <br /> By the end, you really don't care what happens to any of the characters. You will be rooting for all of them to die, so the movie is just over. Go see something else that plays. Do not waste your time or money.
