A thinly disguised retelling of the history of the Garden of Eden is nothing new, nothing shocking, although I feel that this was exactly what filmmakers wanted the idea to be commonplace. A strong performance from Daisy Egan, that's all. I thought she was 13 years old, and I was interested in her character. The rest left me alone.
