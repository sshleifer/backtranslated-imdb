The controversial German journalist Jutta Rabe, who herself led divers to the wreckage of Estonia, put together this stupid “thriller” to save her investment. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, of course, is always observant - but he only has three scenes. He delivers his stuff perfectly - as you can ask a professional. In addition, the main character, Jürgen Prošnov, is sometimes very good. <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the cast is bad. The actress who plays the role of the Swedish minister-minister (or whoever she is — she doesn’t seem to figure in the cast) is EXTREMELY bad. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting ideas in the script, and the story is actually quite interesting. The final script should have been rewritten a couple more times. Some scenes are ridiculous, especially the last scenes. <br /> <br /> The film lasts almost 2 hours, which is 45 minutes more. Presented as a 60-minute television film, it might be really interesting. Like a two-hour film, it is pretentious, boring, stupid and stupid. <br /> <br /> Jutta Rabe can be a good journalist (her ideas about how governments use Estonia to transport military items from Estonia to Sweden have been completed. How true recently when the Swedish military officially stated that they actually used the ship "Estonia" for this), but as a producer of the film she sucks. <br /> <br /> The director, screenwriter and actors suck more. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3/10. I would give her 1 if it were not for the fact that the story is sometimes quite interesting, Donald Sutherland is in her and she has real shots. <br /> <br /> But we don’t I don’t even see how the boat sinks! What is this film about a sunken ship? Like a werewolf movie without werewolves ...
