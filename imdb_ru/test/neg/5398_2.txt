This may contain *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> How to start on this empty wasteland? Well, it would be nice if they had a plot. Acting talent, decent dialogue, indecision, humor, hey, even unreasonable sex would help this click. Unfortunately, there was only a lot of blood, (even this was not done well), shooting from automatic weapons and missing. <br /> <br /> There seemed to be no reason to attach the main parcel, damned Indian, to protect the bodies of the tribe he had killed when the federal special forces commando dressed in civilian clothes tracked him down. In most cases, this was due to a violation of one of the basic rules of behavior in a horror film that separated you from the group so that you could be removed one by one. You might think that this team will know better, especially because in fact it is the third team sent to investigate, and the other two teams disappear without a trace. When they finally understand that they are being shot, they make one of several racks and shoot their weapons just to hit the trees. In this film, the scene of filming trees endlessly repeats itself to save money. <br /> <br /> When they do not remove the trees, they follow this spirit, which leaves no trace (who knows how they track it), and spewing a lot of macho BS. By the way, did I mention that the majority in this team are women? It is interesting to listen to them, to speak harshly. Not very exciting, but interesting. <br /> <br /> In general, the best films can be found in the Kmart shopping cart.
