I like his style of martial arts, he is fast, close and, oh, very fast, but it seems that his films are becoming more and more qualitative, crime-based, and becoming less significant ... I thought he was going to get more deep message. At least some of the films had a hidden meaning or design, there were some good redeeming qualities of character in this, but the rest were so far away. I was very disappointed. Martial arts also suffer. I hope to see more faithful Seagal in his future films. This film also lacks a storyline, too many spaces, so the thought is lost. Too many things are mysterious without a solution.
