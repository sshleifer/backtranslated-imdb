... when we all know, nobody does it like the BBC. <br /> <br /> Being an avid fan of this kind of Sunday evenings, I was looking forward to it. How disappointed I was! For the first thirty seconds I didn’t think it looked promising and after two minutes I was hard to watch. <br /> <br /> But me and my friends were saved only to find bad actions and a complete lack of understanding of half the characters. The plot was hurried to the extreme, and the makeup and costumes are tasteless and very 21st century in the style of "BBC Robin Hood." This modern style could possibly be placed within the sharp corners of the camera and visually luxurious cinema, but, unfortunately, we received neither one nor the other. The direction seemed obviously inaccurate both for acting and for choosing a shot. <br /> <br /> After 30 minutes we could not watch it and came out and rented a “Prestige” (which is very good, by the way) is unfair that I blame it because I look at it so little, but I rarely feel themselves so compelled to warn people not to watch something! However, my friends and I really thought that the house and the umbrellas were beautiful - but this is as good as it turns out.
