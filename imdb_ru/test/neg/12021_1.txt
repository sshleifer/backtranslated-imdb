Everyone has their own choice of "the worst movie they have ever seen." Some like to choose on Gigli or Battlefield Earth. Some choose classics such as Plan 9 from Space. From the age of 14 I declared very loudly that for me this is a problem of a child of 2, and 9 years later I feel the same. This is not "one of the worst", it is not just an expression. This is actually the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> How many farting, swaying, writing and vomiting can be inserted into one film? I do not need to see the dog take the dump, which rises to my waist! Why am I so stubborn in this mud? I have nothing against the bathroom or humor. Hell, I like American movies with cakes. Having such an excess for 90 minutes is a bad idea, but the real turning point is to do it with children! Small children call each other sexual names (IMDb does not even allow me to publish this word here, but here it comes from the lips of 8-year-olds. Think about the irony in this!), And urinate and tear each other only makes it dirtier. The worst line in the film: "I think I should fart in the offices of more people." <br /> <br /> In which other film is there: urinating in lemonade, sticks of dynamite, exploding toilets, a little boy taking off sex with a nanny and projecting it to the side of the house, and a little girl joking about the scratches of the testicles? <br /> <br /> However, my most favorite moment should be when the same little girl on the carnival walk says, “I'm going to vomit,” opens her mouth, and a fake vomit that flies out flies out of her open mouth under perfect angle of 90 degrees! The ripping scene in Scary Movie 2 looked more real than this. <br /> <br /> I think the only redemptive element in the film is Gilbert Gottfried. You have the impression that he didn’t even have a script, but he was just himself. It is unfortunate that he should behave stupidly when he is thrown pizza. <br /> <br /> Know what? Reflecting on the film, it made me go to the bathroom. Goodbye!
