Just finished watching it after getting tired of preparing for the exam at the Michigan bar. I wanted something meaningless, and I could just sit back and say: “What the hell are they thinking?” I’m not disappointed in this endeavor, but if I had watched it in a serious mood, I would have been angry. The company that did this thing simply pasted the CGI footage from the first octopus and added a little footage to the fake octopus, due to which the one used in Monster Bride looks like a masterpiece of footage with special effects. Since when does an octopus have fangs? The plot is that the NYPD diver investigates some of the killings / disappearances on the Hudson River shortly before July 4th. He and his partner (who will soon be transported or soon driven by an octopus feeding on a fig), investigate rather incompetently (all the while believing that a huge octopus will kill people), and sometimes they are accompanied by a female footman from the city hall. Of course, we can assume that the octopus can become so big until this thing attacks a policeman and a girl from the mayor’s office. Surprisingly, all hell did not break free, and only a few policemen and several more civilians were killed. <br /> <br /> Really lame. Do not worry about that.
