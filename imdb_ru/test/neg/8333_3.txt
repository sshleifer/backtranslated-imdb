I went to see it, because I had never seen Tel Aviv where the story unfolds. I was disappointed, as it does not offer many types of the largest metropolis of Israel. This is also pretentious - one of those films that makes you wonder about its meaning, until you end up giving up with a shrug. <br /> <br /> The main character is Batya, a woman of twenty, who works as a waitress at weddings. Her parents obviously do not care much about her, and when the little girl comes out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her, Batya feels compelled to take care of her. The little girl does not speak, and Batya cannot give her social services, because it is now the weekend, and the agency is closed. Therefore, she takes her to her apartment with a leaking roof, and when it comes time to work in the evening, she has to take with her a little girl. The boss is very unhappy with this and other shortcomings in the work of Bati. <br /> <br /> Another main character is Keren, who is getting married. At her wedding party (where, of course, Batya works), she breaks her leg, getting out of the cabin of the women's room, the door of which does not open, and therefore she and her new husband cannot take planned holidays in the Caribbean. They find themselves in a dirty hotel on the beach without a view. It smells bad, traffic noise, and Keren complains all the time. Does her husband meet a strangely attractive older woman ?? writer ?? who is also in the hotel, and Keren is worried that he was sleeping with this stranger. <br /> <br /> The third main character is a Filipino woman named Joy, who cares for the elderly. The old woman behind whom she is hired is very irritable and does not speak English, only German and Hebrew. Joy speaks English, but not Hebrew and German. The joy is mainly related to how her son is doing in the Philippines, and wants to buy him a toy boat, as he asked. She finds the perfect boat in the store and plans to buy her. The daughter of the old woman who hired Joy is an actress who appears in a certain postmodern adaptation of Hamlet’s “physical theater” and does not get along with her mother. <br /> <br /> The way in which these three stories, which for a moment intersect, decide themselves, seems to mean something profound. I didn't get it. In Bati’s relationship with a little girl, there is an element of fantasy, and perhaps Bati’s non-existent relationship with her parents is somehow turned upside down in that relationship. When Joey sees a toy boat in a shop window, a strange effect occurs when small sails heave as if they were blown away by the wind, and they do it as if they were on a real ship scale. Keren draws the outline of the bottle around the ship, which is on the cover of the brochure in the hotel room, and in the story of strange female poetry, the ship in the bottle is mentioned. But what does all this mean? I thought about it a bit and realized that I was not going to lose sleep in the process. If someone has a clear idea of ​​what it all means, maybe they can fill me up.
