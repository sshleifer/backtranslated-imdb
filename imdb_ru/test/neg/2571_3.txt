Steven Seagal shot a boring, boring and boring movie. Steven Seagal plays the doctor !!!!!! ???! There are several militants in this film, but they are poorly directed and have nothing to do with the rest of the film. A group of American Nazis spread a deadly virus that could destroy the state of Montana. Wesley (Seagal's character) is desperately trying to find a cure, and this is the story of the Patriot. The Patriot is an extremely boring movie, because nothing happens. It is filled with boring dialogue, illogical spaces between events and stupid actors. In this film, Stephen Sigal completely criticized, and I would not advise this chatter to his worst enemy. 3/10
