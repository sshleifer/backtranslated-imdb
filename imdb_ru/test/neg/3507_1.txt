I agree that many others spoke of the petty and offensive nature of the study of racism in this film. It confuses me that so many people seem to have been fooled by his pretentiousness. I want to comment on Matt Dillon's character as an example of what infuriates the most in this film. Here we have a man who - unlike the film’s main message that “we are all little racists” - effectively rapes a woman publicly, brutally humiliating her husband and intentionally encouraging him to make a move that he knows will lead to his arrest even death. He does all this after he pulled out a pair without any legal basis, but because, as we understand, they are black and rich, and he is a wounded little boy who is now a policeman and therefore can do what he likes . This behavior is not SMALL racist. This behavior is evil. I’m worried that this extreme racism is supported alongside the behavior of another character - the spread of her paranoid stereotypes about violence in a gang - to illustrate that everyone is a SMALL racist. Later, we were fed with a spoon a little about poor old Dillon's father and how blacks took him to a poor house. Should this explain, or worse, justify this behavior? And should Dillon's character redeem himself by committing a completely unmotivated and incredible, ridiculously random act of saving a woman that he attacked sexually last night? You are welcome. The fact that so many people seem to have some sort of self-praise admiration for this film makes me sad because of the superficiality of our understanding of racism and our apparent lack of determination to condemn and end it.
