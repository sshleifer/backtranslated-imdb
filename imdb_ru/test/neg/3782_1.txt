This is a VERY bad movie. However, I read that this was done by a high school teacher, so maybe I should give him even the slightest praise for his ambitious (but terrible) special effects. Here's the plot: the monster appears from a pile of garbage and pollution in the city of Milpitas, California, and begins a destructive rampage. I'm going to spoil the “big surprise” about how the monster looks, so please read the rest at your own risk. You have been warned! The monster looks like a giant two-legged fly in a gas mask. In some scenes the monster is an actor in costume. In other scenes, the monster is created by motion stop animation. The game is terrible. The dialogue is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The plot is predictable. Stay away!
