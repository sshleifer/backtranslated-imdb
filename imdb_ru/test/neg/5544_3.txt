Pumpkinhead was a decent horror movie from the 80s. No classics, but a nice piece of fluff. Why then, we now considered the fourth film in this privilege, beyond me. As in previous sequels, there is nothing here that would really link films other than the monster, the witch and Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen). This time we follow the feud between Hatfields and McCoys. Part of the film is the romance of Romeo and Juliet, when young boy McCoy and his lover from Hatfield decide to run away to be together. However, they soon burst apart, and the boyâ€™s sister was killed. The boy runs away into the forest and makes the witch resurrect the Pumpkinhead for the sake of revenge. Acting is at best tolerable, at worst - amateur. The title daemon doesn't even appear for almost forty minutes, and when he makes his pale comparison between him and the original design. Overall, Blood Feud is not impressive. It may be worth seeing once, but certainly not an addition to the collection.
