Low budget secret. From the darkness the shot rattles, and from this direction a woman is visible. Young architect Jimmy Macmillan (Chick Chandler) discovers a dead body that goes missing. A woman in a hurry, Mary (June Clyde), is connected to the place of death; but it was Macmillan who should try to solve the case in order to avoid serious suspicion. The suspects are six shop owners in the immediate vicinity of the crime scene. The whole atmosphere of Film Noir; but not quite the real thing. This film is good enough to be a decent low-budget puzzle / drama, and this is a good little escape. Other players include George Meeker, Michael Raffetto, Milton Wallace, and Rebel Randall.
