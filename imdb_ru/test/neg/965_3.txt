Sometimes Hallmark can do it right - like the 10th Kingdom - but many of their science fiction films do not stand up, and this falls into the latter category. Perhaps the version I saw was cut out (the demon [?] Shown in the trailer, and advertising frames did not appear), but anything that made the film shorter can only be a blessing. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILERS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WITH ORIGINAL FAIRY TALE: <br /> <br /> In any case, the film updates the story before the beginning of the 20th century (?), and does Gerda and Kay (here called Kai-Lex). Fan, I continued to expect him to say: "The dead do not solve puzzles") 18-year-olds. This is followed by the main story of Hans Christian Andersen: the boy gets an ice fragment in his eye, it becomes bad, the Snow Queen shoots him to solve the riddle in her palace, and Gerd goes in search of him, various adventures are on his way. <br /> <br /> Since the two main characters are older than the original, it takes a lot of time to put them together and “fall in love”. Unfortunately, I was never convinced that they were especially in love, and, of course, not in love enough to understand the meaning of Gerda’s quest. By the time the main story begins, the pace of the film has slowed to creep. Alas, when Gerda begins searching for Kai, she only manages to pick up the pace for a leisurely walk. <br /> <br /> There are several strange additions to this story that do not seem to lead anywhere. At the beginning of the film, the Snow Queen kills Gerda’s mother, but no explanation for this is given. The polar bear living in the Snow Queen's palace is more than he seems (although this may be because the producers realized that the bear’s feelings for the Snow Queen would be fine in Fairy Tale, but not in the modern film). Again, this is never explained. In addition, hints that the Snow Queen has Kai's erotic desire are omitted, but never fulfilled. The script is also full of anachronisms that really knock you out of the “fairy tale” mood. <br /> <br /> The staging looks good, although there is evidence of a penny squeezing: the Snow Queen's palace is the hotel where Gerda and Kai lived under the ice. The three main characters play with varying degrees of success: Kai looks just as soft as Gerd, but as soon as she sets off to find Kai, you are warmer with her. Bridget Fonda looks great like the Snow Queen, but she seems to be in a different movie for everyone else. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film is unsatisfactory. It looks good, but pulls and lacks magic.
