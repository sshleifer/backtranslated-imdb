What a lousy movie, it took me 3 times to finish it. Most of all I did not like the infantile sense of humor. jokes made by a child of 10 years. not funny. in fact, quite annoying, for example, when a detective cannot take a place in a bar, he shouts “she removes everything” and then everyone runs “fast forward”, as if in a hurry. so stupid. and a guy sitting at a bar smashing fruit to solve his post-traumatic stress disorder. on the bar! and the bartender supplies him with more and more fresh fruit. should it be funny? and I mean ... I love good old films about exploitation and have seen many horrible movies, but its one bad. and the "Mountain" is not so exciting. don't worry i wouldn't recommend it.
