A 10-year-old child, fed up with his parents, arguing, decides on a hot wire car and goes on a surreal trip to America to find Motorama cards, which is a card game for gas stations, that if he can find the word Motorama, he has a chance to win 500 million dollars. Along the way, he meets many strange characters. No one can create a “classic cult game,” Joe Mignon’s previous “After Hours” was achieved thanks to sheer merit and a terrific director, but this was not instantaneous. This film, on the other hand, is just weird, just to be weird. No rhyme or reason for any of this. The plot is random at best and seems to exist only for the demonstration of various cameos. It's just not a fun and thoughtful movie. It is too crowded. I have heard many comparisons between this and the David Lynch films. It's damn close to heresy, since even Lynch’s “worst” film (the worst in quotes because he doesn't have any bad films) is still many miles above this recluse. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Cynthia King is very short topless <br /> <br /> DVD Supplements: "Joe Dirt" trailer
