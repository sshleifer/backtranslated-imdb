This is one incredibly standard western in which there is some kind of bad game, boring storyline and silly actions. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem is how incredibly formal this film is. It presents all the usual clich√©s, yes, even a bar fight, and there are really no surprises in the film. This makes it a boring and weak western to watch, and not least because it is so poorly made. <br /> <br /> This is obviously a small production, and the film looks as if it was shot in 30 days. Directing and editing can be called bad, and all the action sequences shown in the film are incredibly stupid. This may seem a little ridiculous due to the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> His story is also not so interesting. This is a fairly friendly western (so no blood), in which for some strange reason everyone seems to be against the Junior Brothers, who in this film are portrayed as good and very friendly guys. The story becomes more and more stupid and stupid when it approaches its end. The younger brothers really existed and were part of the gang of James the Younger, of which the famous brothers Frank and Jesse James were also part. Of course, they were not as friendly in real life as shown in this film. Just in the early 40s it was the custom to have nice male characters in it. Only in the era of Spagethi-western, the main characters became real rotten criminals. Strangely enough, this approach has always worked better than the early Western ones, in which the main character plays the good side of the law. <br /> <br /> What makes this film original is that it was shot in color. It was something rather unique for the 40s of Westerns and still gives the film something extra. You may wonder why they shot this western in full color. In the end, the film is still made in the style of a black and white early western, and I really think that this film would be a bit more believable if it had been made in black and white instead. <br /> <br /> You can easily do without this western. <br /> <br /> 4/10
