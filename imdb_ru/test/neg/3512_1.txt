This film was terrible and eventually made me wonder why someone had gone into trouble to make it. Now everything was not so bad, I studied cinema, and this film was very well assembled, and it contained very good cinematography with interesting angles, very good lighting and excellent camera work. I would like to see it at school, because it would be a good film on which to write an article. BUT ........ Since I finished and lost most of my pretense in the film, I realized that the film should be the most interesting of all, this film was long and boring, and Iâ€™m not sure when it finally comes to notice that it was worth my time. <br /> <br />
