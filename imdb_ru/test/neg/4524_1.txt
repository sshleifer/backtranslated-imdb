What a sad surprise. <br /> <br /> Being a devoted fan of the original series (starring Don Adams), I was really looking forward to it. Poor fool me. It is more stupid and smarter than the brain than the bottom of a monkey. <br /> <br /> To say that this is bad would be a serious understatement. It was the worst film (first 30 minutes), which I saw a long time. I could not stand for more than half an hour, preferring to watch how my fragment is disconnected from the hard drive. <br /> <br /> I can tolerate bad ... bad is good, sometimes even cute. But with the invented Hollywood crap (and this should be the worst thing in many years) I will not bet. This film is a gross insult to the collective mind of humanity! My five year old daughter could write better - and she is not even dyslexia !!! I really feel like trying to see the rest, but I'm afraid I have more important things to do ... like making pizza dough and watching it grow. <br /> <br /> What a sad disappointment. No ... fuck me! What a fraud! As Mel Brooks once said; "A piece of shirt!"
