=========== BIG SPOILER ================================== This is a terrible movie without cute characters. So many cliches and meaningless scenes. A good editor is needed, but then there will be no film left. Please save your two hours. The only decent and unpredictable scene in the film was when the younger brother refused to prevent his brother from committing suicide. In the description, read the "moments of dark comedy." Perhaps I missed it when I blinked. Horrible characters start right from the funeral. Do people at funerals laugh and complain about food during the funeral of a very young man who committed suicide? Then the father digs at the only remaining son? Right at the funeral? How is it that the neighbor, whose husband cheated on her with Sigourney Weaver's character, is a bad guy to tell her husband? The father does not even know that his son can play the piano, although everyone around him seems to know that he is an excellent pianist. The film attempts to unite every possible dramatic clich√© into one film: the father banishes a sporting son to succeed, a dysfunctional family loses an elected son due to suicide, the son leaves a feeling of lost and lonely raised as the son of a husband, incest, homosexual inclinations, bullies, possible incurable disease, etc., etc., etc., DO NOT WASTE YOUR 2 HOURS.
