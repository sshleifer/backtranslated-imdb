it seems that if you are going to publish here, it will be a 10-star rating, nobody ever likes something, well, frankly, some do not like it, but we go, the Rachel Ray show is just awful. !!!!!!, this show reminds me of the character of snl Linda, regardless of whether she has any cooking - anything. I have to say that I liked Rachel on the network for 35-40 dollars a day, but I wish she had enough life experience to make her interesting day by day, give me ham on the street, Anthony Burden, interesting people , but most of all I find her annoying, she actually told a member of the audience of the studio to “shut up” and joke, but shut up, shut up, and who care about her favorite stories, sorry, Rachel, you were canceled !!!!
