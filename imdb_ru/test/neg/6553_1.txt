Sherman Hemsley was good at Jefferson and especially in the family. He was also very good at Amen. Why was he making this movie? This movie has a horrible script, and it's a waste of a very funny person. Luis Avalos is doing his best, but this is terrible. This film was the beginning of the bankruptcy of Sherman Hemsley. I think he's very funny, but this is a horrible, senseless ghost story. Stick with ghostbusters.
