one of the worst excuses for Irish accents I've heard. from a really great actor too. This is a bad Irish accent, not to mention the Dublin accent (which is completely different). One way or another, the film is loosely based on the ganglord story of Martin Cahill, and coped much better with Brendan Glison in the lead
