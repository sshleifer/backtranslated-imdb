It seems that the world is now in a strange reduction stage, when objects such as DVD and CD players are steadily decreasing in size. Obviously, it is much cooler to have an iPod smaller than a larger one. This is not the case with theatrical screens, as is the case with IMAX, a huge, well-known theatrical system that stunned the audience after its release to this day. While the material is right. <br /> <br /> The main problem of “Great Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D” is that it uses a huge screen as its main advantage. He is boring, uninformative and relentlessly seeking to please and amaze us with his banal special effects and inspiring quotes from famous names such as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Another problem with the film is that he doesn't even need time to sit down and interview those lucky ones who had such an extraordinary experience that was on the moon. Instead, the authors simply pressed COPY and PASTE and hired famous voices such as Morgan Freeman, Bill Paxton and Matt Damon to emulate their famous quotes. This tactic is steadily repeated and tedious. <br /> <br /> I would say without a moment's hesitation that I did not recognize a single piece of information from the film, which I did not yet know. <br /> <br /> And he repeatedly insisted on irritating the crap out of me with his persistent sentimentality. in three minutes, it seems that Tom Hanks’s voice sounds like this: “Without the participation of these brave men and women ...” Watching a movie is like watching a bad advertisement. Forty agonizing minutes. <br /> <br /> 1/4
