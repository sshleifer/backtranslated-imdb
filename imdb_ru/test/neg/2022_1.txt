Space is vacuum, right? Therefore, space sucks. Vampires suck too. A really bad vampire movie in space would have twice the energy, wouldn't it? <br /> <br /> It all started with what could be a fun premise. Retelling the stories of Bram Stoker's Dracula in the future. There is a rescue team that is sent to investigate a cargo ship lost in space called Demeter. Fans of the original novel unwittingly suggest that this will be a direct retelling of a dracula set in the future ... unfortunately, if you don't count the names of the characters, this one follows the low-brow route and enters the B-movie galaxy in twenty minutes when Kulio becomes a vampire. to me, when I say that he is the best actor in the film, and that says little. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien should sell his goods on daytime television. Erika Eleniak had to leave after she left the Baywatch, and poor Udo Kiera is hard to read from the hint cards. The guy who plays Dracula in this one is more ridiculous than Frank Langella in the 1970s version. If you manage to sit through the entire film, you will be rewarded with the worst possible ending. The ending makes you wonder if the actors and the film crew understood what kind of garbage they were doing and left the film set. <br /> <br /> Watch out for vampire fans. This one sucks twice as strong.
