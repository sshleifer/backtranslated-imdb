You know that this film is in SERIOUS troubles, when the BEST acting job is the supporting role of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Although it was still relatively early in his career, and he was not the best actor, compared to Bridget Nielsen, he is Sir John Gilgud. In fact, this film proves that the only reason she attracted a lot of attention was her boobs and the fact that she was associated with the incredibly self-destructing player Mark Gastinot. Thus, instead of being her “breakthrough film”, this film with the film “Beverly Hills” is almost as tall as it has been in its entire career. It was also obvious that the finance wizards also abandoned this film, because the cast (except Arnold) is rather inconclusive, and the script is boring, boring, and boring. Fans looking for another CONAN movie will no doubt be very disappointed in this slow and uninteresting movie.
