Wow. As soon as I saw the cover of this film, I immediately wanted to watch it, because it looked so bad. Sometimes I watch Bollywood films just because they are so bad that it will be interesting (for example, Koi Mil Gaya). In this film, there were all the elements of the brutal film: “a completely harmless gang of local thugs”, a poorly made scene on a motorcycle, a terrible dialogue (“Congratulations, son, I'm very proud that you are a bad boy”) would they be good, cruel songs (“I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad bad boy”), inexplicable storylines, for example, why are friends Good Boy and Bad Boy ??? And why is a hot girl in love with a nerd ?? I have never seen such a poorly constructed story with such a terrible impact. Some scenes actually took 30 seconds, for example, a scene in which “Good and bad guys” inexplicably came across a “gang member” poker game. Congratulations to Ashwini Chaudry, you are a bad director. If you want to watch a good movie, look at the Guru, if you want to watch a movie so bad that it is really interesting, then watch Good Boy, Boy.
