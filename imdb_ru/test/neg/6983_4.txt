Yes, I know that his character was supposed to be drunk, and he probably just acted stupidly. But something tells this criticism that Mr. Pleasant really drank a lot and was intoxicated during his scenes in the film. Basically everything he says is slurred and often unintelligible. Or maybe it was just bad production figures ... hard to say. <br /> <br /> In any case, “Race for Yankee Zephyr” is a film that simply does not work. This is also a shame, since the film has an amazing beginning and an interesting plot in general. Ultimately, production values ​​are too low, and the action in this New Zealand adventure is too little for the delivery of goods. This story is about a US military plane filled with gold, money and medals that crashed into a lake in New Zealand during World War II. The plane remains lost for about forty years or so, until it is somehow washed ashore, and a drunk literally stumbles upon it (Pleasence). First, he collects all the medals of the purple heart and tries to sell them in the city, actually getting $ 75 for them! Little does he know that as soon as he sells them, the local jeweler makes a phone call and starts trying to track down information about the plane. Before you can blink, all the attention is brought by the rich scumbag (Peppard) and his minions into the city, and they quickly try to get the old man to give up the plane's position, because they know that there is much more to him than just medals. , The old drunk business partner (Val) and his daughter (Warren) run to try their luck before the bad guys get to him. The resulting action is simply not as fun as one might hope. <br /> <br /> The game is pretty awful, with the exception of “Guessing”. George Peppard is trying to do some (I guess) Australian accent, but this is hardly convincing. Lesley Ann Warren is not so bad, but Ken Wal is really bad. Basically, he makes the best impression about Michael Couple on his worst day. And it says something. I hope he made enough money on this film to fix his front teeth, which looked a bit crooked. I do not remember if he straightened them by the time he was in Vizega. The rest of the actors are pretty mediocre. Probably mostly locals who did nothing else. I guess the biggest problems for me were the lack of action for most of the film, and the lack of danger. The villains are too cute and stupid to take them seriously. And, frankly, in the film NO helicopters that look like on the cover of a DVD. And none of the boats in the movie have teeth painted on them. <br /> <br /> Although the film has its strengths. The beginning, which begins as a newsreel, and then becomes part of the story, was a nice touch. Brian May's score sounds too strong, as in Mad Max 2, but in some scenes he turned on the pleasant little march that they play as Plence. It sounds the same as in the Great Run! There are some neat helicopter stunts and a great boat chase that apparently killed three stuntmen during filming. The landscape, despite the grainy look of the painting, is still quite beautiful. Most of all, you will remember the drunken antics of Donald Pleasant. He was almost enough to save this film. Nearly. 4 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Dog.
