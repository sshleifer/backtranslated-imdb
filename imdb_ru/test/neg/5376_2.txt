I suppose I should be fair and point out that I don't believe in ghosts. However, I am very interested in this topic, and I like the scary story as much as the next guy. I'm a fan of Ghostbusters, because at least they are trying to give their research a scientific point of view. Even the early episodes of "Most Haunted" had the factor of an entertainment camp for them. The paranormal state does not possess any of these qualities. Cases themselves can be interesting, but, as is the case with a lot of reality TV these days, it suffers from overproduction, bad games and stupid scenarios. The creators of the show freely admit that the screenwriters "lead" the stories. I heard that they are even going to file a horn in a romantic plot to appeal to a young woman. The show also has many other disadvantages. According to others, the story quickly turns into nails on the board. Above, the visual and sound effects quickly become just as annoying. I am ready to suspend some disbelief for the sake of entertainment, but this whole plot of a “demon with vendetta” is ridiculous. Considering that the producers of this show are also responsible for brainstorming such as MTV's Laguna Beach and Newport Harbor, I believe that this is really not surprising. If you're a fan of Ed & Lorraine Warren or a big reality show junkie, I think you will find a lot of interesting things in Paranormal State. For the rest of us .... I recommend that you avoid.
