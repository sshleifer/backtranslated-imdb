I have never seen a more unreal film than this dirty piece of manure. The game was excessive. The direction was tasteless and amateur. The script was just a joke. The story looked written by a man who had never played a football game in high school, especially in a professional game. And why, why did Oliver Stone feel the need to play an actor in this film? He was terrible, playing the most unreal narrator in the whole story. He could not even be hired to participate in professional wrestling competitions. Then you have Jamie Foxx who throws like a girl. But he's a bit more athletic than the older Dennis Quaid. Seriously, Stone wanted to direct this film to 16-year-old men with ADD. That is why we hear loud music, quick cuts and numerous edits. It just became a bad MTV video. Shame al pacino for this nonsense. Cameron Diaz? Hell, this untalented person takes on any role that comes down to the peak. When Lawrence Taylor is the best "actor," you get success, your movie sucks! And this one does.
