First, I would like to apologize for my rating of "1" ... The only reason I give this film such a high rating is that I cannot delve into negative integers. All the reflections on “This is a fake,” and, although I, of course, tried to give it due attention, left me with a certain idea, namely; "This is probably the worst movie ever made." At any level and in any plausible quantitative assessment of qualitative measurements ... Seriously, I tried, I just like in any birth movie for a cult video, like the next lover, but seriously, this film sucked rhino balls ... /> <br /> Honestly, if I shot this “movie”, I would see in it the legitimate cause of suicide.
