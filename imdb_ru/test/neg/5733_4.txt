I just saw this movie for the first time after buying it on DVD. <br /> <br /> This is a cheap attempt to capitalize on two films about Conan. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film doesn’t seem to have the same budget as Conan’s films, and therefore some sets and effects aren’t as bright, and some scenes seem to be rushed. <br /> <br /> Nielsen is fine, but, unfortunately, she could not act if a gun was put on her head. <br /> <br /> The supporting role of Arnie looked like it was made as a favor to director Fleischer, who also led Conan the Destroyer. Maybe Arnie was not sure that he would go to the headlines of films such as Predator, Recall All, T2, etc. <br /> <br /> Some female guardians of the talisman at the beginning of the film they looked like they were fighting to raise their swords, and the expression on their faces suggests that they had a lot of fun in this movie. I could not be so fun if I fought for my life. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, this film required very little concentration and was a bit interesting. I have seen much worse. Two stars
