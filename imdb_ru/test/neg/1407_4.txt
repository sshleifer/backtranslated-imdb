The somewhat warlike brother of suicide discovers that he and his mother grieve almost equally (playing out), but that dad is sullen and blames himself. Writer-director Dan Harris gives us a dysfunctional family, torn at the seams, characters with question marks hanging over them, and then sets out all the plot lines in the most obvious terms: suicide! Secrets! Gay shame! Family disease! Ultimately, trying to wrap things up with a neat bow, Harris wants to make sure that we did not miss the trick, first giving us thoughtful material for reflection, and then putting it all elementary, sentimental. The stunned work of Sigourney Weaver, because the family matriarch is dryly disengaged, and she is joyful, that is, until Harris redoes her (complete with a sensible new hairstyle). This is the cinematic equivalent of indulgent patting on the head. ** from ****
