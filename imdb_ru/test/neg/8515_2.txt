I will give him two, because there is a lot of music in him, otherwise it would be one. <br /> <br /> This evening I watched this film for the first time, and this is the first film “Roads” that I received. saw. I expected waaaaay better. Robert Osborne says this is the best movie from the movie “The Road.” If this is true, I do not need to look at others. The great thing about this film is that there are a lot of songs in its first half, but it is balanced by only one number with dances in the entire film. <br /> <br /> I didn’t like the film, Neither Hope nor Crosby came across all this well, their characters were not very adorable, the film was not at all funny, most of the dialogue was just a worthless filler, there wasn’t much action , there were not many spectacles. <br /> The film was not the same as I expected. I expected more “Road”, but there is not so much. They quickly get to the palace, and then most of the film comes to the end there. I also expected much more from the famous “road” style of breaking into the fourth wall, where the characters communicate directly with the audience or comment on the plot. There were only about 4 cases of this. One of them is an example of this script’s not funny humor: <br /> <br /> (Hope still tells the story of Crosby) Crosby: I know all this! Hope: yes, but people who came halfway through the picture do not. Crosby: You mean they missed my song? <br /> <br /> These are two weak lines, but at least they are actually jokes. Most of the rest of the script does not even have a joke. Example: <br /> <br /> Crosby: Remind me in the morning to throw you a piece of cheese. (Indirectly naming "I hope the rat"). <br /> <br /> This is not funny at all, it can hardly even be called a joke, but this is a kind of a joke-free dialogue that carries most of the film. Many scenes are not even close to a joke, but simply use a common uninteresting dialogue, such as: <br /> <br /> Crosby: Hi, why do you accept me? Do you think you can just throw me at dogs? Hope: why not, you did this to me, right? Crosby: Yes, but that's because I was looking for us. You are not looking for anyone. Hope: oh yes? Then why did I pay the check? <br /> <br /> (the above is just from my memory. This is not entirely accurate, but it illustrates what I mean). <br /> <br /> And so on .... just a common dialogue without jokes. <br /> <br /> My rating: a waste of time.
