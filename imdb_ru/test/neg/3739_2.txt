I love John's work as a singer, but the film was boring and “not worth the time” to watch. <br /> <br /> I thought he did a great job with his role. When he says “you have an affair with an old man” to his colleague, I somehow laughed at his facial movements ... or their absence. <br /> <br /> I would recommend a movie if you like the music of John, but not the video of a Saturday evening. <br /> <br /> If you like his music, then there is some music in it, but not much. <br /> <br /> So .. at best
