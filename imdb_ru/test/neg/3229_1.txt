I hated the book. The guy meets a clever dog, gets a virgin girlfriend, and all this time they are pursued by a hired killer and a monkey (both want a dog). Dean Kunz really can't write (I read the book on the recommendation of my sister, I should have known better). When I saw this (mostly out of painful curiosity), I actually found myself criticizing it because it was not true, although it is a book from which it is impossible to make a good film. I thought, at least, if they were going to make the film adaptation of the worst book I had ever read, the filmmakers could be accurate. They turned the guy and his virgin love into a boy and his mother, for some reason, which bothered me the most (even if I seriously doubt that this guy is, and his chick will not improve him) Quite simply; bad book, bad movie, I don't see it.
