What can I say? After reading the books of Herbert and loving the version of the film Lynch, I was extremely disappointed. I felt like I was watching a rejected version of Buck Rogers. The sets looked like shots from the special series “Star Wars”! I felt that acting was a little amateur for most. The costumes were flashy and finished, which gave him the feeling of a flash of Gordon of the 60s. Worms! They are supposed to be sandworms, and yet they seemed to be “big stalagtitas” with a mouth at the blunt end. The effects in general were rather minor. I will not even talk about the shameful effect of the Navigator. <br /> <br /> This so-called “Frank Herbert's Dune” was not even true to his books! It should have been called "Frank Herbert's Dune - For Dummies." Key elements of the plot were omitted, the names were changed, and the whole “feeling” of the story was “sanitized”. I did not even recognize the Harkonnens! In fact, most of the characters did not look the way Herbert’s descriptions described them. I'm getting upset, just remembering what this tragedy was. I am glad that I could not digest the second installment ....
