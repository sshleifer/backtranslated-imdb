I just wasted my saturday night, watching this shit! I saw the names of Chris Nota (Mr. Big, from Sex and the City), Robert Patrick (from The X-Files), the decadent Elliott Gould, Colma Mini, and Mercedes Ruelle on credit; very reasonable IMDb rating (5.6); and a lot of good reviews in IMDb. To my complete surprise, the film is terrible: the characters are poorly constructed; the story is trying to be funny, but it is completely stupid; Mercedes Ruehl's character is strikingly stupid for Professor Princeton. So, I decided to check the validity of good reviews, and found that most of them were made by IMDb users only with a review, therefore relatives or friends of the actors and the crew, or people hired to promote this garbage. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sem Retorno" ("Without Return")
