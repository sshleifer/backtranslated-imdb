Travolta, Thurman, Rock, Vaughn, Keitel and so on. It seems that this star parade of great actors can really warm up this film, but no. Travolta again plays the role of Chili Palmer, but this time we have already seen the gangster, who is testing his luck in the difficult world of filmmaking, it is no longer funny. This is a typical problem in Hollywood, they think that if the first was good, the second would be twice as good, NO, the first was original, the second could not be, Hey, Hollywood, try to understand, originality cannot be duplicated, you must give us a new twist and not just the same film, again shot with a big budget. I always found myself laughing a bit when I watched this movie, but it still had a lot of great actors like Harvey Keitel, James Woods, Vince Vaughn and Rock, and the like! <br /> <br /> 4/10
