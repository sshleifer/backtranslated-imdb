I caught it at IFC last week and thought it was typical for a short indie film: heavy in style, not enough in content and originality. Is it not surprising that an extraordinarily attractive (and light blond) boy with 70s shaggy hair and clothes too cool for school are being shot in the upcoming film? In addition, this film is thinning into the chic of the late 1970s, which works for some (recalls Sophia Coppola "Virgin Suicides"), but not for this director. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer compared this with the work of Harmony Korin, and I agree. However, I do not consider this a positive point (what has he done lately, anyway?). Bobbycrush is simply a waste of time and energy for all participants. If you happen to see it late in the evening by cable, turn on the channel and see something else.
