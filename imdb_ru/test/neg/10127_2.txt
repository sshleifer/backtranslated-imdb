You might think that the idea of ​​ordinary teenagers with superpowers would be interesting, but far from it. Take, for example, the concept: the main characters have a big secret that they hide from their peers. It's like Hannah Montana and That's Crow. Further, the acting is just average. Selena Gomez seems to be half asleep in many scenes. Finally, jokes or cliches or boring. If they do not use colorful, but strange dialogue to make us "laugh", they throw various objects around the room. I really want this show to use more original and interesting material. In conclusion, Wisards of Waverly Place is disappointing.
