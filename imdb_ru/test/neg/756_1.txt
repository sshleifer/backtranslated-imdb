Wow, what a racist, defiled piece of celluloid debris and what an insult to the great genre of westerns. <br /> <br /> Exploiting? Sex scenes abound, profanity abounds, violence and blood abound ..... everything that gives modern films such a good name, especially among those who prefer films of the classical era This is the kind of meanness that gives the elderly ammunition against today's films. <br /> <br /> For some reason I just can’t imagine the scenes of bathing nude men in the films of Randolph Scott or Gene Autry. Nor can I imagine that I hear "Mama --- uh!" exclaimed here and there. I sincerely doubt that this word was even about 100 years ago. However, the word f is so common here that you might think that you were looking at a story centered on modern urban areas, and not on the old west of the 1800s. <br /> <br /> Prejudice? Well, what if all the white characters were good guys, and every black one was an evil, cruel villain? Do you think someone can complain about a racist film? When we get home, we don’t hear a scream when the opposite shows in hundreds of cinemas across the country - as shown in this movie? <br /> <br /> Mario Van Pipples wrote, shot and shot in this bomb. Remember this name. Apparently, he is "Ed Wood" of modern cinematographers. Even Spike Lee would not be so racist. You can't be much worse than this movie.
