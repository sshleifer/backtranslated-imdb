While the film has one ransom feature, namely several striking shots, such as a shot of a sheep hanging from a tree, a scene of a funeral procession on a raft or the scene of boats leaving the village (which seems to have been affected by the scene when fantasy "Fellini's Satyricon"), these were photographic rather than cinematic, and it would be better if they were hanged on a wall in an art gallery rather than being built into a painfully slow film that lasts as long as 162 minutes and suffers from logue, very bad character development, over-acting, boring and heavy symbolism of stylization. This is the first film that I saw in Angelopoulos, and his reputation ahead of him, I expected much better, but I can honestly say that this is one of the worst films I have ever seen, and I will not leave my way to watch any other directorial work in the future. The four friends I went with agreed.
