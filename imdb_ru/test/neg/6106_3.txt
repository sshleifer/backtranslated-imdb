My mother told me not to go to Kadosh - but who is listening to my mother? <br /> <br /> I was so detached from this when I looked that I thought that I must have lost my feminist diplomas on my way to the theater, so the next day I checked the feminists with the cards. No, they also thought that it was more of an anti-Orthodox screed rather than a pro-feminist statement depicting the Orthodox as equal to the Taliban. <br /> <br /> Although this Israeli film tries to show that the sect The story that these are extreme ultra-Orthodox Messianists is so unpleasant that being incredible (plus that itâ€™s not a fanatical Orthodox rock and roll (!) in which one of the sisters is in love, incredibly sexy - even in Israel it must be a fantasy). <br /> <br /> The theater was quite crowded, so there is a curiosity to watch Israeli films; It is a pity that this vicious film was widespread. It was almost enough to make me go back to lifeless romantic Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 04/29/2000)
