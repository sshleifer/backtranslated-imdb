I have to start by saying that the actresses and actors did a great job on what they worked with. The problem with Dark Reality is that you had a bad director who tried so hard to be innovative and evocative memories that he eventually crushed the film. From beginning to end, you can say that the quality of the film on the film itself is low, but poor lightning and camera shake only worsen it, hiding what is happening. The sound is muffled and often incomprehensible. I am sure that Houston (the director) will argue that this should have caused a state of panic in the audience, but he had more than enough material to do so. The fact that he led to the camera and lighting as he did was a sign of excessive syndrome. <br /> <br /> The story is good. The main sadistic story of a female kidnapper who avoids cliches, holding the girl in despair all the time for a good reason. Billy Bob from The Silence of the Lambs treated his victims better than Netwon. The biggest problem in this story is that the dead people constantly harass the main character in her mind, and the second time when they appeared, I moved forward, trying to destroy the only decent part of the film. <br /> In the end, the way the director put it together, showing random blurry objects and permanent barely visible scenes (not due to horror, lighting, corners and camera), ultimately destroyed this film. Houston obviously tried his best and, in any case, reminded me of a bad film school project. If you want to see a decent story, then everything is fine, but keep in mind that the quality of the film is enough for most people to turn it off.
