BARNYARD sucks! I saw this movie last week, and it's terrible. Which bull has a udder? My 2-year-old girl asked me if all cows had an udder and tried to explain to her that this was simply not true, and watching the film only embarrassed her more! <br /> <br /> Also, the violent topic scared my 2-year-old. They made the coyotes look fierce, and it instilled in me the fear of coyotes. I know that coyotes are not really fierce and natural predators. Mother and son, who were sitting in front of us, shouted: "Kill him, kill him, yes" in a certain scene in a film where good against evil, say, <br /> <br /> This is a break of the Lion King and they must stop use famous actors for a bad movie. Steve Oderek, who also starred in movies with Thumb, such as Thumb Wars, Thumbelina and many others, is so bad! <br /> <br /> If a good film about Steve Oderka ever comes out in my life, I will turn over naked and swallow my diarrhea and publish it on Youtube.com ... enough said!
