The creators of this film must have sat down once and said: “Let's laugh at the Russians and show people how advanced we are (Americans)”. In the film, Russians are depicted as inferior people who cannot understand the brilliant ideas put forward by the Americans. It is true that American campaigns are probably more professional and more based on expensive research than campaigns in any other countries. However, this film goes far and exaggerates the differences between East and West. For me, it was like a propaganda film made during the Cold War.
