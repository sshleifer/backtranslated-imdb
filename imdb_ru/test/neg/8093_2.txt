A badly flawed, but almost watchable, comedy that works the way the Farrelli brothers reject. The most criminal thing about it though is casting. I couldn’t believe Jerry O Connell and Jake Busey for a minute in the role of superstudies that could pull on any woman without delay, and at the same time I could not believe (very beautiful) Shannon Elizabeth as a street policeman! The story is predictable, but in some cases it manages to raise the titer, although the “rough exit”, that is, the “shock comic” scenes (one with an amputated testicle, the other in a sperm bank), is just awful. If this movie is on TV, then it’s probably worth seeing if you’re very bored, but please don’t spend money on renting it !!
