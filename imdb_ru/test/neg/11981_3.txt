I was rather surprised to learn that a film based on Far Cry was created. I do not consider this story the strength of the gaming universe. Do not worry, though, as in the usual Boll fashion, the plot of the film has nothing to do with the game on which it is based. Now I understand that to transfer from one form of media to another, you need to use certain freedoms, but it seems that he really does not even try to establish communication. Not only are the actions and sequences of actions so commonplace, it almost makes you feel that the whole project was one big joke. This has already been said a million times, but why can't someone more talented get the rights to a video game to create a movie?
