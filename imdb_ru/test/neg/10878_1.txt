Definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. I cannot find anything positive to say about this film (if this production is even worthy of the word). <br /> <br /> This production is not even a low-budget porn-film standard <br /> <br /> My question is simply: why would anyone look at the script and think, “Hey, I'm going to make a movie of it” ? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, I didn’t even hope that “Nicole” was going to do it ??. She was really so annoying! <br /> <br /> So for yourself, don’t watch this movie ... unless you want to spend 85 minutes of your life ...
