As a rule, I try to find in films as much as possible to enjoy them. I did not make any exceptions with Pie, trying hard to evaluate it for what it was. But no effort, no matter how big, could justify this pathetic excuse for a film. <br /> <br /> For a number of reasons, this was not possible. First, cinematography was pointless and ineffective. Secondly, the script reached the depth of the “poor”, which allowed him to really go well beyond the category of “so bad it is good.” Thirdly, the acting game left much to be desired - it was terrible, it really is. Anyone who saw Misha Barton (seen here as the amazingly awful Grace, a character so badly invented and realizing that Ja Ja Binks doesn’t look so bad) like Devon in John Duygan's “Dog” wonders what went wrong By this now, it is possible that if she was given a character with which to worry, and with a bit of directionality, she, at least, could give this film ONE redemptive feature. Alas, this was not. Finally, the film seemed to make no sense, expressing nothing, accomplishing nothing. In fact, I wonder why Christina Wayne was worried. <br /> <br /> "Pie" made a weak attempt to be something and failed. The result - the film, unfortunately, is so bad that it is just very, very bad. Don't worry - it's really not worth it.
