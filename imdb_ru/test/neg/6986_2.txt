Don Wilson plays the role of a cop who sometimes likes virtual reality fighting games, but things go wrong when the people behind the game decide to take virtual reality to a new level, turning real people out of the video game, and in fact they make cybersex models the prototype, but the main bad guy from the video game is waking up and starting to kill people, and now the only person who can beat the guy is Don Wilson, who meanwhile falls in love with the cybersex model. In fact, taking into account everything that bothered me, I was trying to understand whether there were people who were brought from the ground of virtual reality, robots, people, cyborgs, or just some unidentified computer program. It doesn’t matter, as it’s just a reason to watch one of the worst actors ever talk about the butcher, as if he were a grocery store. Don Wilson’s complete lack of charisma is the biggest drawback of the film, as he just doesn’t like the guy, he’s too good-natured, his voice is too high and doesn’t look very impressive in action movies. What saves this boring holiday from my lowest rating is Athenia Massey, which looks very hot in high costumes and that sometimes gets naked. Also on board are Lauren Avedon (Good Martial Arts Master), Stella Stevens and Michael Dorn as the main voice of the bad guy, but their efforts are in vain, since they are all hidden from Wilson's very bad game. Another disadvantage, which is the biggest mistake of the film, is the lack of action, as we are asked to observe the unfolding of the story, but in addition to Massey’s nakedness and perhaps some unintended amusement due to a ridiculously unconvincing game, there is really nothing interesting. It also extends to sequences of actions in which the choreographer is clearly set, poorly directed and completely exhausted from all possible disturbances. Make it almost impossible. <br /> <br /> * of 4- (Bad)
