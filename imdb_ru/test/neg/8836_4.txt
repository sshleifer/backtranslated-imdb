STAR PACKER is one of 152 million westerns in which John Wayne acted in the 1930s. Well, the number is a bit exaggerated, but it seemed like so much. This is because these B-films were quickly shot with a very small budget to become the second or smaller film in the theater. Most B's were fairly cheap and tended to cut corners to reduce costs, and THE STAR PACKER is no exception. To save on costs, random music is not used, work time was reduced to an hour, scenarios were often quite derivative, and the actors — mostly less talented — and Wayne himself was definitely not a household word at that time. Some of these Wayne functions are pretty good, while others, like this one, are watchable, but also pretty dumb and inconsequential. I liked this movie and most of the others, but this is probably because I greatly weakened Bs. <br /> <br /> Wayne plays the role of John Traverse, an American marshal investigating the actions of the local gang pursuing him. locals and stealing from the scene. This is strange, since the film seems to have been made in or near modern times, because they used telephones and modern machine guns — things that you simply do not expect to find in the Old West. Such anachronisms are actually quite common in B Westerns - as Gene Autry films (for example) abound in them. Wayne's assistant, Yak, is played by a stuntman and a true friend of Wayne Yakim Kanutt. <br /> <br /> A bad guy is an unknown figure called “Shadow”, and he distributes his instructions through a black screen. it hides his face! It sounds just like the character from the series - the same villain that children love, but adults moan because they are so stupid and a bit like Blofeld or Dr. Evil! The problem is that if you listen to his voice and pay any attention, then at the beginning of the film it becomes obvious that this “Shadow” is George Hayes. Now, speaking of Hayes, this is the same guy who later in the films was called Gabby Hayes, but here and in several other early films of Wayne he looks and behaves ANYTHING like Gabby. In STAR PACKER, he was well dressed, clearly articulated and clean-shaven - imagine! In real life, apparently, it was the real George Hayes - although I doubt that he was evil! Now, as you can tell from the last paragraph, there’s nothing mysterious about this movie. You are left with acting (tolerable and nothing more) and stunts - which were actually quite amazing. Over and over again, one amazing trick after another took place — for example, people jumping from horse to horse and several magnificent fighting scenes — all this, by the way, was done by Kanutt and his friends. Kanutt was often John Wayne’s double in films - and this went on for decades. The problem with some tricks, however, is that the filmmakers actually killed a few horses in order to get these magnificent “stumbling horses” that we will see later in the film. Until about 1940, filmmakers often strung thin metal wires and ran horses at full speed along it! In this case, the legs of the horses, as a rule, were broken, and then the horses were killed! One of the worst examples of this was the movie "Jesse James", where several horses were brutally killed, which led to the American Humane Association insisting that a representative of the organization be filmed during the shooting of the film to make sure that the animals were NOT affected in production. So, since about 1940, films have carried this small disclaimer. STAR PACKAGING was made long before the disclaimer, and I cannot see how the horses did these "tricks" without being killed. <br /> <br /> In general, this is, at best, a random passing due to a bad conspiracy, sometimes a bad game and an incredibly cruel attitude towards horses. I do not have a bleeding heart, but I just can’t understand this disregard for the poor old animal.
