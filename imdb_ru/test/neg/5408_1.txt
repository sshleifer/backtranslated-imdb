Although Casper van Dean and Michael Rooker generally belong to category B films, even they are superior to this film. It can not convey even the slightest feeling of excitement, fear or fear - unless you consider the fear of sitting through the rest of this garbage. Direction is amateurish with annoying cuts and sharp movements that hide the fact that the killer is not near the victims when he attacks. And what a murderer he is: a cheap mask with a skull and a black hood. I liked him better when he fought with He-Man. This is one of the most lazy character design work I've ever seen. I mean, this is Skeletor! And he is on a horse! Does it have to be some kind of scary, supernatural being? How should we take this seriously? All we get is scenes with a dude who rides through the woods on his horse - which he can barely stay - interspersed with scenes in which soldiers randomly shoot at the woods, thinking that they can shoot the ghost. From time to time, Skeletor shoots some of the arrows or drives past and strikes someone, showing how trivial effects really are. I usually enjoy the Sci Fi channel fare at a basic level of cheese, but this film is too inept for any pleasure level. Where is Dolph Lundgren when you need him ???
