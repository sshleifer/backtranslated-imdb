When I saw the poster in the theater, I thought it was a “new line” of horrors without a famous cast that was worth trying. But after I entered, I wanted to leave after 20 minutes. There were a lot of senseless and logical flaws. For me, this is a movie that should not be shown in cinemas. It is not even worth seeing.
