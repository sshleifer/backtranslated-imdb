This is complete rubbish. I studied Nazism and read many manuscripts of the time - the "parallels" use most of the classic humiliated apocryphal myths about Nazism, and then compare them with complete false generalizations about 1/3 of the planet. It was created for the audience of Polly-Anne's complacency, which to a large extent follows a diet invented by lies, horribly thought-out arguments, irrational conclusions, erroneous ideas, and meaningless logic. <br /> <br /> Who made this world a success? Easy. <br /> <br /> When all is said and done; Que Bono? So who benefits from this in the long run? <br /> <br /> No. You donate money and rights. Muslims do not get, they get our bombs. Try again. Answer, and you opened the main door.
