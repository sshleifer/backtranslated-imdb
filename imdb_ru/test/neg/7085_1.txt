This is perhaps one of the worst films ever made. Everything in it - acting, directing, screenwriting, cinematography - is terrible. An alien (a man in a brilliant suit) claims that he is from a neighboring universe; it can be assumed that the author of the script meant "galaxy", but did not bother to find a dictionary to test its terms. The best name for the film would be “It came from a planet of conspiracy.” The plot is overly stupid and almost absent. People are all given magical McGuffes, which correspond to a tortuous series of unbelievable restrictions just for moving a bare plot. Any thought over time is ignored. Now a couple of days after meeting the alien then BAM! Suddenly only a couple of hours remain until zero o'clock. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. You will make yourself more stupid for watching this. The end was especially stupid, and had to accompany someone who said "Ta-da !!!!" because the screenwriter just pulls something random out of his ass. I think the real alien conspiracy is that this film sucks, so bad that you look at him with cancer. If you can watch the last 10 minutes without tormenting yourself (“enemies of freedom” - honestly) laughing, you are retarded.
