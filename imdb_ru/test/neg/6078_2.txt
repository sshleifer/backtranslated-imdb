Let me start with a personal note as a lover of film and television, more about the joyful side of life: I love what James Woods can do and did, and I always love Melanie Griffith, and Natasha Wagner was very good at this terrible, wretched, smelly essay about the "true crime". <br /> <br /> Whoever wrote this film, he obviously never spent time talking to real criminals with real crime talents: yes, some thieves are addicts, but they have very short careers, like thieves, Truly successful thieves are rarely caught, because they do not use "garbage" or drugs before they score points (work). <br /> <br /> James Woods’s character was loyal to this paradigm at the beginning of the film, and then the script fell apart completely. He turns into a mad, alcoholic-madman. Good work for a high ranking guy like Woods, maybe, but not at all believable. <br /> <br /> Most criminals are lazy. If they wanted to work, they would work. <br /> <br /> These people in this film are beautiful, self-satisfied, drug addicts, drug addicts. They could not achieve a real result in the real world, in the real world, where it is held by a big and muscular guard, who beats a living hell from a skinny child (as it was in the earlier scenes of this DOG). knock off and not let him down. Is always. <br /> <br /> How many ways have I found to hate this movie? Lot. Even utterly vulgar people - like most thieves and drug addicts - have a greater vocabulary than these cretins. And the scene of "robbery" with neo-Nazi bikers? Puhlease. All cattle are not neo-Nazis, and those who are neo-Nazi speed dealers are simply not so stupid! <br /> <br /> This film earned two, because Natasha Wagner was extremely good in her role as Rosa and because Melanie Griffith still has “something special”, or at least she had this is for this brutal and offensive stupid film. I'm not the only one to sing praises to real criminals for any reason, but the reality of these criminal types in this horrible movie is that they would all be dead or in prison according to Act 2, Scene 1. Watching a lousy Zombie movie being better spent time than this .... thing ... and I hate zombies.
