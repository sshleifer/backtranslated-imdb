“De Dominee” is based on the life of a real Dutch gangster, Klaas Bruinsma! In the film, his name is Klaas Donkers! I have doubts that the events presented in the film are somehow related to what really happened! But it does not matter! Because it could not get my attention! I am tired of this movie! He lacks content and style! A substantial part could be forgiven if the game were good, and if the director tried to do something original! Without substance, you will at least have to bring some style or decent action! Do not we need to have fun? It would help if the director saw more gangster films! Obviously, he did not! Otherwise he would not do it the way he did! This film has received wide publicity due to a small scandal around Klaas Bruinsma and a member of the Royal Dutch family! This scandal has nothing to do with the film, which is always the case! Without this, Dominie would never be successful! I'm sure of it!
