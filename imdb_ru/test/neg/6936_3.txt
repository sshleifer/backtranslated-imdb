Eugene O'Neill's game “4 and a half hours in 1927” appeared on the screen in less than two hours. The combination of symbolic dialogue and gothic melodrama in the play did not endure well, and the actors had some difficulties, especially with Nina Norma Shearer and Marsden Ralph Morgan. Clark Gable as Ned Darrell looks better, but mainly because he is a rude character who is not attributed to the philosophical reflections of others, which better fits the range of Gable. As soon as the plot settles down on the love quadrilateral, and the public adjusts itself to voice the film, the film becomes more enjoyable. The technique used here for parties is another issue. On stage, the action froze, and the actors expressed their thoughts to the audience. Here they are made as a voice acting. You might think that it would work better, but since the action no longer freezes, the actors have to stop the speech and grimace in the camera in order to match the emotions in their thoughts. In addition, it is difficult for any movie lover to watch this movie and not think about the fun parody version of Groucho Marx in "Animal Crackers". To these shortcomings are added some cuts made because of censorship (Nina’s licentiousness is mild and there is no mention of having an abortion, which plays a more important role in the play) and a poor (uncredited) score that sounds like background music for Weak-ear turn of the century. O'Neill called this film “the terrible hash of attempts at thickening and idiotic censorship,” and although Strange Interlude is not nearly as good as his later Return of the Ice Man and Journey of a Long Day to Night, it definitely deserves better than this.
