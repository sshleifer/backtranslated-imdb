This is a bad comedy. <br /> <br /> That's why: a comedian with his wife and man. Good. <br /> <br /> A husband is a shower bag. The wife is Einstein. <br /> <br /> How original is this? <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller is the same guy in Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> Lame jokes No witty one-liners. <br /> <br /> Enough is enough for me. Stop it now. <br /> <br /> Last word: stupid. The destruction of the average white guy continues on ABC. The worst part? Kevin James is actually a funny comedian. He is simply not here. Lia Remini is an excellent eye candy, but hardly. Lost talent is the word. Bad sitcom.
