if you're a fan of the original ten commandments, this movie will make you cry inside. Of course, now I have only half an hour, but it hurt so much, I felt I had to warn the real ten worshipers of the commandments before they were subjected to this meanness. I didn’t think that it was possible to make the special effects worse than they were in the 1950s when the original was filmed, but this 2006 remake proves that I’m wrong. I can forgive some inconclusive special effects, but the foolish dialogue, melodramatic cinema-style playfulness and the game We Are Wax - come to life, stretched to the scene make me hope that they will rewrite the story and drown Moses in the Red Sea.
