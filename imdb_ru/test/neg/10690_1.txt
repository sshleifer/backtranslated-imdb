my friends and I watched this movie last night. it was quite incredible. Of course, it was the worst movie I've ever seen. At first it was tolerable. it smelled of BAD IMPROV, but it was damn fun, even though the scenes were too long and stretched, and the terrible quality (I read a budget of $ 400 above ... sounds like this) of the movie itself. > the biggest problem was due to the lack of a script; with the background in improvisation, I know how difficult it is to make scenes short and effective. what happened in this film was that the actors left to improvise the scenes, and they didnâ€™t know when to stop, they just went on for ages on silly topics. At first, I thought it was because the film was short, and they needed long useless scenes to flesh it out. As the movie progressed, I realized that it was just a very bad movie. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of details where I could see that the director had a really good idea for the shot, but not the resources (or talent!?) to cope effectively. Many scenes were shot from one frame (because, you know, improvised), it seemed like a very long time. so boring! if you can endure an hour and a half of horrible improvisations, watch this. This is really fun in parts, but also very stupid and annoying. The action ranges from good to absolutely terrible. it seemed that the only good parts were those parts that really had nothing to do with the main plot; stupid child who swore a lot, a hairdresser, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> but yes. hurt badly Like, it literally hurt me. About an hour later, my friends and I just missed and left.
