I am speechless, to be honest, I can't understand how someone could give way to a script like this, play someone in a film, let alone shoot it. The fact that I am writing this review seems like an insult to my fingers, this film should be thrown into the trash bin, and not be watched. I am disappointed at Flex Alexander for even thinking about accepting such a BAD excuse for the script, not to mention playing a role. OH MY GOD! I think I just insulted the word "essay" ... yes, I did. You know what, the less you talk about this thoughtless nonsense, the better. You were warned, nobody warned me, I should have experienced horror myself. LOOK AT YOUR RISK.
