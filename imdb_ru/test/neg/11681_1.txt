I rented this copy from Netflix - a big mistake. The DVD version called “One-armed Swordsmen” was released by madmen who thought that combat sequences would be rated better if they were combined into one big chapter, and not as part of a consistent, coherent story. Part of the story was left in separate chapters, which you can choose from the main menu, but the DVD is still in disarray. Do not give up and do not buy. Not that in the original story was something amazing, ridiculously complex nonsense. No matter how I liked to see Wang Yu again in his prime after all these years, this one is a waste of time. I had detergents for dishes that made a better film than this. The cut DVD version shows us that no matter how stupid Chinese writing is, you should see some story to take care of how the combat sequence will turn out. <br /> <br /> But “The“ One-armed Swordsman ”really gives you a chance to see how Luo Li, like Wang, and Shaw Brothers, is beaten badly by the grinning handsome boy David Chang - it is always good to see how this happens. plays a sort of second-rate villain here and serves as a prime example of why some people really need orthodontists.The film also involves Taiwanese actor Chang Yi as a magistrate. <br /> <br /> In the other commentary above, the mandatory scene "battle in a hotel "(actually there are two of them), Wang and Chang are attacked by a group of funny barbarians using what looks like cavemen’s weapons, making Bruce Lee making a noise during a fight. None of this makes sense, but it’s okay if you don’t expect any clarity or common sense. in any case, it was fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Another feature of this performance is the absence of significant female characters. There are several female roles, but they do not play any serious role in the action movie or plot. <br /> <br /> If you can find a copy of the original film The Shaw Brothers Armed Swordsman, which explains why he has only one hand and why he uses a broken sword, follow him.
