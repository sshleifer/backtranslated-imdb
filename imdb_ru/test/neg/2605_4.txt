This could be great. The voices behind the scenes are absolutely correct and suit the characters for T. One small problem, though; the appearance of the characters, mostly auxiliary or guest characters, looks the same. The same bored look on each face with only minor changes, such as hair size or weight. It seems strange to see the voice of a really big guest star coming out of a lifeless form, like the characters here. If I'm not mistaken, Kathy Griffin made a voice-over for this show, and it looked too weird to be funny. <br /> <br /> There are several other problems, one of which is a family story. The Simpsons made it much better when you could buy most of the situations in which the characters fell. Here we get too many annoying deviations, like someone with a strange fantasy, and then we have to find it funny, but for some reason the delivery is a little behind. As you can probably tell, it’s difficult for me to understand exactly what’s wrong with this show, because basically it’s nothing but a clone of the Simpsons or even more “Married with children”. <br /> <br /> If I need to point a finger at what is completely wrong with this, then this is probably repeatability. Peter Griffin is not a very bright character, but no one else. Lois should have been called Lois Lame, because she is one-dimensional. Seth Green as the type of mentally retarded son is the best thing on this show, and this is the most stereotypical part of the show. <br /> <br /> So what else can I say. There is nothing wrong with this show, but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work for the Simpsons to do for almost two decades.
