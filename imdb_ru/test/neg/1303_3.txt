I'll tell you straight, this movie is damn boring. It's about the flood, that's all. Blah blah, a little about the family, blah blah blah, politics, blah blah bla boring. <br /> <br /> A meteorologist, poor fellow, is to blame. Deputy Prime Minister Campbell is a stubborn person who expects clairvoyance of the most annoying nature. <br /> <br /> If you are from the United Kingdom or anywhere else where it can flood, you might like this movie. This is similar to the earthquake movies that are most appreciated where earthquakes occur. <br /> <br /> This is not really an action movie in which the weather is the enemy, and you have to defeat or overtake him literally, itâ€™s more like a time bomb that needs to be turned off. <br /> <br /> Looking at this film, it is clear why the UK thinks that the world is overpopulated, but this is not so. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the film is as exciting as the scab collection, and I cannot recommend it. It's over 100 minutes, too much. <br /> <br /> Problems with the film; I will not go into their details, because the film does not deserve such analysis. A hint Londoner - buy more boats. If you bring the children to this film, they will either fall asleep or become uncontrollably bored screaming demons.
