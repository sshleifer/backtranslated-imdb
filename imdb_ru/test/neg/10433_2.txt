When I think of a 1970s film, this is not what I think of. I don't want the monotonous soundtrack of a single song Robin Troer; I want the soundtrack to be accentuated on the top 40 chewing gum songs of the day that personified the 70s. The disco-style karaoke disco music was particularly annoying. The action (if you can call it that) was very wooden, and it seemed that it had just been read from the script in a monotone. The quality of the film and camera work were terrible; the dark dialogue, the script seemed to be folded without much thought, and the plot was thin, if not absent. I can not believe that people put high marks that I read here. In fact, an unforgettable, unsuccessful attempt to recreate a favorite era of the past. Two stars are all I can think of. Sorry guys.
