It was a terrible short film that tries to be funny, but not funny at all. Say at the Chicago Film Festival. This is really what is written in the title, and I just was not interested in it. Poor storytelling was what it did. If you rewrote it and shot it, it could work. This attempt fell into a hole. Terrible filmmaking.
