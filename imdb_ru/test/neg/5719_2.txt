Possible spoilers As Peter Jackson so brilliantly showed in his trilogy "The Lord of the Rings", it is quite possible to make good films, even excellent ones, in the genre of heroic fantasy. This genre is distinguished by literary predecessors, dating back to medieval chivalric novels, in particular, to the Arthur legends on which Tolkien and other authors relied. However, besides "The Lord of the Rings", it is difficult to come up with any other films about swords and witchcraft that would be good. I would agree with the reviewer, who said that the best of the bad group was Ron Howard's Willow, and even that was not much different, except that he was just a mediocre film, and not positively bad. “Red Sonya,” however, cannot achieve an even more modest difference in being just a bad film, unlike a horrible one. <br /> <br /> As in Willow, many of the plot elements in Sonia are derived from The Lord of the Rings. An evil ruler seeks to gain control of an artifact with supernatural powers in order to achieve the ambitions of world domination, but it is hampered by a group of heroes. The film, shot in the era of Hyborian, a barbaric era in the distant past of the Earth, begins with the villain of the play, the evil queen Gedren, making unwanted sexual advances to the heroine Sonya. When they are rejected, Gedren (not a woman, to answer "no") responds by killing Son and his parents. (In 1985, apparently, it was still considered politically correct not only to make the main villain a woman, but also to make one of the main reasons for her meanest broken lesbian lust). <br /> <br /> Gedren’s next step is to capture the Talisman, a kind of fluorescent green soccer ball with magical powers that kills an entire poorly dressed female priest called upon to protect him, just as they are going to destroy him, because they feel his forces had become too dangerous. Among the dead is Sonya's sister, her only surviving relative. Sonya herself, however, did not sit idle, but entered the martial arts academy, in which she finishes with distinction, and intends to avenge herself. Along the way, she unites with Calidor, the heroic wandering swordsman-king, resembling Aragorn Tolkien, Prince Tarne, the spoiled child ruler of the kingdom who fell under Gedren’s power, and Falcon, Tarn’s faithful servant. The rest of the film is quite predictable, as Sonya and her allies are trying to overthrow Gedrena and prevent the destruction of the world that is threatened by an uncontrollable Talisman. <br /> <br /> What exactly makes this movie so bad? Well, acting, for a start. Arnold Schwarzenegger in the role of Kalidor gives a kind of typical wooden performance with a poker face, which became his trademark, at least at the beginning of his career, combined with a strong foreign accent. However, compared to Bridget Nilsen in the role of the heroine, he looks like Laurence Olivier. Miss Nielsen seemed to have even worse language difficulties, and each line sounded like the mechanical, silent voice of a man who had just completed the third lesson in the course "Learn Yourself by Correspondence." One may wonder if she was hired for the role only to make Arni look good in comparison. The other characters, while not conducting their own personal struggles with English, are simply caricature caricatures, especially Prince Tarn, who must be one of the most disgusting young people on the screen. <br /> <br /> Even worse than a bad game, however, the film’s almost total lack of imagination. This is a particularly blatant mistake in a fantasy film, since films of this genre must rely on their creative power to convince viewers to stop the natural feeling of unbelief, which will be provoked by a fantastic plot. When we look at Peter Jackson's masterpiece, we can convince ourselves, at least for the next three hours, that we are in Middle Earth, that elves, wizards and hobbits exist, and that the fate of the world really depends on the destruction of the magic ring When we look " Red Sonya ”doesn’t convince us of anything, except that we are watching a group of actors with a bad accent, fighting each other on the side of a hill for possessing a lemon-green football. <br /> <br /> This lack of imagination even begins with the title of the film. British science fiction writer Brian Aldiss, when asked about the exotic names given to his characters, replied that there was no point in creating a fictional alien society with its own distinctive culture, if you were going to spoil the effect by calling the hero Joe. ((Admittedly, Tolkien was able to do without giving Sam the name of one of his main characters, but that was because the Hobbits were supposed to be encouragingly familiar, the Mediterranean equivalent of a tweed tube). English smokers). In the same way, to give the heroine of a fairy tale supposedly established in the long-gone barbaric age, the usual name for girls, such as "Sonya" (that is how the name "Sonya" is pronounced), is almost as appropriate as calling her "Betty" or "Mary -Jane '. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have been made with a very small budget, which makes me wonder why they were worried at all. Fantasy must be done convincingly or not done at all. Obviously, he was shot in a remote mountainous area, with little or no attempt to offer a distinctive culture. The few buildings we see, such as the Talisman temple or Gedren’s palace, are obviously cheap sets. We learn that the capital of Tarn was destroyed by Gedren through the use of Talisman’s power, but in fact we don’t see this event; all we see is what could be a thunderstorm occurring on the other side of the hill. At first you wonder how Sonya intends to overthrow the whole kingdom with the help of just a few allies, but when you see how little Gedren’s army has at her disposal, it becomes clearer. When an earthquake threatens to destroy the palace, you are wondering if this is a Talisman at work or just a member of the crew, unintentionally leaning on the set. If we can enjoy this film for nothing else, we can at least enjoy it for its unintended humor; a great example of such a bad, funny school of filmmaking. Ed Wood would be proud of it. If it were shown on California television on the night before the repeat elections, Gray Davis would still be the governor. 2/10.
