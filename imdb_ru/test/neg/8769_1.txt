Being an avid fan of Christian cinema and a person who is trying to keep a close eye on improvements in Christian film production, I was glad to have the opportunity to watch this movie. I was ready to see something that will leave a new mark in high-quality films. I was left disappointed. <br /> <br /> The opening scene is excellent, although Leon’s small robbery is “Professional at an angle”, it demonstrates excellent cinematography in the early stages ... everything after that was largely downhill. <br /> <br /> I could hardly sit through it, several times I was tempted to simply turn it off. <br /> <br /> The game, although quite possibly sincere, was incredibly awful. But again, the essence of the problem lay in the script itself. The dialogue was worse than anything I had ever seen, and even my amateur script Awakening (soon to become an independent film) looked like Hitchcock's thriller next to it. (That does not say much.) The bright side of this film is that it was shot on the new Sony High-Definition 900 cameras, shot in 24P format. This film and Star Wars: The Clone Attack were the first films to use these new technology cameras this year. Unfortunately, the camera's performance seems to have been wasted due to poor lighting, poor angles and clumsy controls. <br /> <br /> The only good feeling I got from watching this movie was how good my brand new indie film is to look next to it. ; ) 4/10
