If you're looking for a nice summer hit, Dark Harvest 2 may just be your ticket. The production values ​​of this film are extremely high (it looks like it was filmed using Sony Handicam and edited using iMovie), especially the sound effects - they sound right from the Spooky Halloween Sounds CD! Scarecrow from the cover, although he did not appear in the film and otherwise has nothing to do, terribly realistic! From the beginning to the end, you will watch a man aimlessly looking for his daughters with the help of the MAIZE pun! At the end of the movie you will see, well ... you have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I really want to say this: do not enter the 1000 yards of this film. I rented it because I thought it would be a funny "Troll 2", but it is not. I cried after watching this film because I realized that I had spent money on it (and I found 4 dollars, which I spent on renting it). I actually fell asleep for 20 minutes and still knew what was going on.
