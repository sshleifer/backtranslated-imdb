This should be one of the biggest misfires in history ... the script was good and could have ended much better. The actors had to play better, and maybe then I would give this film a slightly better grade. Perhaps Hollywood should remake this film with a bit of better actors and better directors. Sorry for the disappointment, but the film is bad. <br /> <br /> If I had to watch it again, it would be like torture (do not vote before watching it!) And by the way ... Have fun watching it! Do not just look ... look until the end :))))))))) !!
