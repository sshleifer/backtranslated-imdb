I do not want to seem too picky, but if the accidental death of a butterfly by a time traveler led to such a huge change in the timeline, how could this happen because the butterfly burned with a pyroclastic explosion? anyway volcanic eruption? And how can time travelers continue to return to the same moments and not continue to meet with their former and subsequent “I”, who were also on the timeline in the same few minutes? Looks like there was a rather large crowd before this dinosaur attack. <br /> <br /> Although I can accept the idea of ​​a time wave, I seriously doubt that this wave would cause only a few changes. When the wave passed, all the changes that would have occurred, would have occurred immediately during the passage of this wave. So, scratch the idea that the city is beginning to overgrow with the jungle. Why jungle at all? The location of the city would still be at the latitude and longitude that was before, and the vegetation would correspond to its geographical position on Earth. <br /> <br /> And an endless list of other illogical nonsense. <Br /> <br /> Bahahahaha! This click is a strange combination of some pretty decent production values ​​and absolutely ridiculous holes in the plot and factual errors. <br /> <br /> Too bad. Awesome story idea spawned by stupid science. <br /> <br /> Sigh ... why, why, why, why? Why spend all this money on production and not even try to subtract the script to see if it has any real meaning?
