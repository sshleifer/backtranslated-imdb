First of all, I would like to state - for the record - that it is incredibly stupid to call your film “Embryo”, when the subject of the research is exclusively scientific research carried out on embryos (animals and humans) aged 12-16 weeks. The embryo stage ends at the end of the eighth week of pregnancy, and from that moment on the unborn corpse enters the fetal phase. Well, honestly, I did not know all this, but I made efforts to find it, and this is also the least that the creators of Embryo could do. Do not worry; I don’t just stumble over details or exaggerate bitterness, as there are several more reasons to state why Embryo is a huge failure. Actual science can be considered boring and inaccessible, and thus science fiction is a cinematic genre created specifically to make the tiresome, but at the same time, educational topics of science more interesting and understandable to a wide audience. By portraying ambitious science experiments that go terribly wrong, or space missions that meet evil aliens instead of light years of emptiness, cinematographers usually manage to entertain people with impressive special effects and, at the same time, teach them useful things about science. To make a good or at least half decent sci-fi film, scriptwriters and directors must follow only one basic rule: DO NOT miss! If they cannot fulfill this one condition, the viewer can also read a theoretically accurate book. Something must have gone wrong during the production of the Embryo by Ralph Nelson. The basic premise is potentially exciting and even exciting, as we all feel caring about saving the lives of unborn children. The production also included very famous names, such as the main stars Rock Hudson (“The Giant”, “Seconds”), Diane Ladd (“Chinatown”, “Alice Does Not Live Here Anymore”) and the director Nelson himself. for the famous classics "Soldier Blue" and "Charlie". Then what went wrong? Simply. The script is incredibly boring, cliché, and everything looks incredibly stupid, because laboratory scenery and scientific equipment is clearly too primitive to achieve any medical advances. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson, in very poor performance, plays a doctor who has not been keen on his research work since his wife passed away. When his car crashes into a pregnant dog on a rainy night, his passion returns, and he does his best to save the fetus of dying animals. He manages to keep one fruit alive, impressively accelerates the process of his growth and trains him to become an extremely intelligent dog. Because his procedure is so successful, Dr. Paul Halliston convinces his friend in the hospital to repeat his tests with a human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenage girl who committed suicide. However, the female subject unexpectedly continues to grow at a rapid pace, and after just a couple of weeks she becomes an adult, delightful and super-intellectual woman. A good doctor naturally falls in love with her, but the innovative growth procedure also begins to show horrible side effects ... Absolutely nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film, apart from the many implausible and over-melodramatic idlers and one or two deeply impressive dog tricks . This second half of the film contains some (grotesque) action and expectations, but by that time the stupidity of the dialogues and implausible plot twists had already destroyed a potentially incredible sci-fi idea. There are some really cool scenes, in particular, the chess battle between Victoria and Roddy McDowell (in an extremely memorable and extremely unpleasant supporting role). The grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally on the verge of ridiculous, and it almost looks like Ralph Nelson made this last terrible frame, because it was a general rule in modern thriller and sci-fi movies. The latter sequence, including the horrific stills taken at the end, is definitely not consistent with the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the film. But still, my sincere admiration and respect for the dog and its trainers. An animal with such intelligence and talent certainly deserves to demonstrate its techniques in a much better film.
