This film lacks everything. Except for Bobby Deola, who is mediocre by his own standards, no one in this film approached to act in a single scene. Kangana is completely fake in her game. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous Anupam Kher is visiting, and during those 2 minutes sheâ€™s better than Bobby in the whole movie. The music does not complement the movie very well. <br /> <br />. The contrast in music between Bobby and Upen is not particularly prominent. A great concept is completely wrong. The film does not have the correct ending. Please don't waste your time like me on this movie
