Looking and sounding like cheap porn without sex, this is the first in an amazing line of nasty types from the manufacturer (or in this case the director) Jeffrey Reeve. <br /> <br /> And this is Doozy. Ludicrous on almost every level. <br /> <br /> Some government agents (I think) are "professionally killed" in Amsterdam and a much less charismatic Interpol agent working in shreds of wood (which I assure you) his name is not Louis Salinger) goes to investigate, walking a lot on it, to make sure that tax evaders will get their money for plane tickets that they will shoot on the spot. <br /> <br /> The scum attitude towards drugs and the image of prostitution must have looked ridiculously outdated even before the celluloid dried up, but the script, at least, is very necessary, as it accurately explains what happens regularly in terrible contrived dialogue (“You were followed? Oh, no, of course not.” No one outside Washington even knows that you are here! ”) But despite this, the plot somehow remains confused. By the time the sinister Vladimir Putin, similar to the Priest (no less than Kronstin from “From Russia with Love”), has reached his pulpit to preach, your brain will turn off, which is regrettable because you miss our hero - you have stuck with the ground during the battle - struggling to get to the plank of wood, then to realize that he actually sits on a loaded pistol, and he shouts: "You, bastaaaard!" on the dead body of his friend, and gone from the skin baleened go-go boys, dances of Morris and a hilarious sequence of torture - all this provides enough laughter. Only the climatic chase on a boat is impressive. This is an exciting, well thought out sequence that really has no place in this film. This apparent anomaly is explained when the captions roll over - Reeve has nothing to do with this sequence! Fortunately, everything goes on as usual, because of the ridiculous, perverse drink and warehouse. <br /> <br /> If such a pathetic thing as Jeffrey Reeve does not exist - and you are one of them - I would not worry about this instantly forgotten nonsense.
