The first two Bring It On films were good in their own way. The first one was quite serious, the second one was successfully satirical, and the third one chose the usual idiotic low-eyebrow comedy that we always see in brainless teenage films that Hollywood removes from work. The whole point of this film is that the fans are full heads, who barely know enough to have a general conversation, and this is the essence of the comedy of this film. Ha ha no. <br /> <br /> In this film, there is not a shred of cunning, no subject, no subtext, no one who has half a step to have fun (and, of course, I could not get through all this). If you are the person who is entertained by farting jokes, this film is for you. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
