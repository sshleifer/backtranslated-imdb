On the heels of a well-received and beloved adult classic of films about the lives of adolescents, when they reached adulthood, the American Graffiti of George Lucas, we have Coolie High. His adaptation is Erik Monte, one of the creators of the good Times CBS 1970s sitcom. <br /> <br /> Coolie High was and remains the black version of American graffiti. Instead of central California in American graffiti, we see the black slum of Chicago's Cabrini Green as the background for this story. Instead of America in 1962, Kuli Khai is located in 1964. Welcome Back Kotter's movie stars, Lawrence Hilton Jacobs and Glynn Thurman as the main characters of the film and its main characters. In it, Garrett Morris plays the main director, who tries not to give the heroes of Jacobs and Turman, by the name of Coceise and Preach, to often get in trouble. <br /> <br /> You know, I would like to say that Cooley “High” is a worthy comparison to American graffiti or to the fact that this is an excellent film in itself, but I cannot. The problem is that the film producers couldn’t or didn’t want to hide the sad opposite side of black life in America. Saving the film in the Chicago part of Cabrini Green does not help. <br /> <There are also no rude attempts at humor. When Coceise is looking for a letter of intent from college, he discovers that his younger brother has thrown into the toilet. When a gang visits the Chicago Zoo, one of the gangs named Pouter ape threw dung at him. When Thurman’s character, the Preacher, is harassed by two hooligans at a school get-together (Dirty and dreary place to eat in far fewer people), he opens the girls' toilet door, while the girl frees herself as he runs through the window of the same bathroom. ! In high school, the homes of heroes, bathrooms, everywhere in the film can be seen a regrettable view of the destruction of cities and poverty. <br /> <br /> If this was not enough, there was a rude display of humor. in film. The use of violence and profanity in the film. “Coolie High” can be a film about coming of age, but this is a heavy and rough film about coming of age, in which there is little or no wit and sympathy for the use of nostalgia that made people love and appreciate American graffiti. <br /> <br /> Motown Records had a hand in making the film. The music of the company was part of the film's soundtrack. But even here you feel the same old thing that these songs have heard up to a million times. Not that they were not great songs within themselves, but black music, of that time was more than just Motown. Especially in Chicago. The song is nearing the end of the film. Spinners' author G.C. Cameron, not so impressive. There were the best Motown ballads that were made by the best Motown artists than Cameron without question. <br /> <br /> The last part of the film, showing where the characters went to pay tribute to the film Cooley High, aimed to be, American graffiti. This shows that Propich, an intelligent but unsuccessful student, went to Hollywood and became a successful television writer. Erik Monte may have called himself a Thurman character. The last frame of the film "Preaching", escaping from the funeral of Coachs, held a dark rainy day, and all the gloom that was represented by Cooley Hai. Eric Monte through “Propich” and this last scene received one small lesson for all of us, when I watched Coolie and love for the past. Do not look back.
