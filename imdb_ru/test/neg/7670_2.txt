I gave “Airport 79” only two stars, because this is really a lousy movie. None of those who had any relation to this deserves praise (except Chihuahua Charo, who does a good job with his role.) This does not mean that the film is not worth watching. It helps if you have a high, but it is not necessary. <br /> <br /> A'79 really seems like an early version of "Plane!" Each scene has a setting and feedback, and the scenes are intertwined with each other, as if they were completely turned off. One of my favorite recurring moments is that the passengers, crew and aircraft continue to move, no matter what. Are you a reporter and a strange guy killed in your house in front of you? The assassin then chases you to the roof of your greenhouse? No problems. You can still catch this early morning flight to Paris ... no need to involve the police. Does your plane evade one unmanned rocket launcher, four warheads looking for heat, and cannon fire from an unidentified phantom fighter, performing barrel throws, unmanaged power jump and crash landing without reverse thrust? No problem, we will ask the mechanics to check the oil and send you on the road in just a few hours. This is really funny. <br /> <br /> And I admit that there is a bit of anarchist in me that appears when passengers do not pay attention to the flight attendants. The highlight is when the accompanying person tells Jimmy Walker that he will have to take away his saxophone (God, spare me from flying, sitting in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) Before takeoff. Jimmy basically says, "No." Later in flight, the saxophone is damaged during the barrel, and Jimmy does appear in the next flight phase with another saxophone, which he will not remove. This aspect of the film is just fun. (The ONE passenger really submits to the accompanying person. When Charo is told that she cannot take her dog on the flight, she leaves the plane. Naturally, this is because you cannot see her ass and tits well while she is sitting.) <Br / > <br /> All in all, a terrible movie, but awful enough to be a little funny. Unfortunately, the filmmakers and actors do not deserve this, as it probably was completely unintentional.
