This film is really bad, and I tend to be prone to bad movies, but that was too much. See it as an OD'ing on a clean suck. Now you might think that you have seen the bottom of the trunk. You may have watched all the titles of “Full Moon” and “Tromy”, all the films of Edward D. Wood Jr., Uwe Boll, Albert Pune and right on DVD movies with faded people. You may even have seen The Death Tunnel, The Lake of Ghosts, and a lot of movies that were covered by MST3K, but in their original form. But you do not really know the terrible filmmaking, until you saw the Dark Hunters. And if not, not worth it. Don't worry. Not only is this film surprisingly poorly written, shot, shot, shot, edited, played and sprinkled with coarse, cheap consequences. First of all, this is a pretentious mess. But this is not good, pretentious in the style of Greenway or Lynch or funny in the fashion of Ittenbach or Early Waters. This is the kind of pretentiousness that arises when someone incredibly stupid thinks that he came up with something incredibly clever. It seems like M. Night Sheymalan (sp?), Only this person seems to be a damn messiah compared to this railway shipwreck (and this comes from the rampant hater Shaimalan). This is also boring. Not a hard boring type, which is good if the film rewards your patience. Darkhunters does not do such things. It's boring: “Oh, my fu By the way, anyone who claims that he likes this film is a liar with an arrogant face, and anyone who claims that this film is complex or deep knows what their mother is in bed.
