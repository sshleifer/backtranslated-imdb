I saw this movie yesterday, and, like most Olrdi, wrote “I also expected a movie about Stephen,” God, I love this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very noisy. I had little doubts, because I read that “Ja Rule” plays in it, but I hoped that they would play a small role to it, therefore I did not feel irritated watching it. And, of course, said the opposite, ooooooooooooooooooooooo Stephen, what the hell were you going to join such a harsh *** team? Was Stephen broken and in need of money? bah = (what a big disappointment. If you like Stephen's movie, please skip this movie - pure drama, you only get a few special effects that made me vote 3/10. The film went to his friend Curupt with his annoying hoodie talk. < br /> <br /> My beer has gone from tasting fresh water to water in which we cook dishes. I felt like a 3-year-old director. <br /> <br /> I hope Stephen will make me happy again in a future movie People who do not even need to rent a simpel. <br /> <br /> Bad and sorry :-)
