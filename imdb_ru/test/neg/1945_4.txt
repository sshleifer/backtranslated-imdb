A WARNING!! This review may contain spoilers. The back of the box is misleading. It says all this crap about kids telling ghost stories, which they do, but then it means that they will all be killed by some kind of killer in the forest. That doesn't happen. The stories they tell are a bit interesting, especially the story of the dog and all these licks, but most of them are pretty boring, monsters in the forest, some kind of dumb girl and the main movie.
