When I watched the first octopus movie, it was a laugh when I saw these lousy acts and terrible effects. This film seemed to compensate for the action, but not the special effects. After Jaws and Piranha, of course, why not shoot a movie about killer octopuses? Octopus invades the waters of New York, where 2 police investigators are trying to stop a wild animal until July 4th. <br /> <br /> Quite a clean conspiracy and incidents with a fall, but the octopus is pretty terrible, it's good to see it, in fact, they did it this time, but it looked like a piece of plastic ... Better with a big budget, this film could be a good watch. There are a lot of bugs, and I wouldn’t have been surprised if they hadn’t explored the octopus’s lifestyle ... <br /> <br /> Watch this if you like cheap sequels on DVD, otherwise you’d better watch Jaws.
