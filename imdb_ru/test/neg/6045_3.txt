I saw this movie a few days before Halloween 2004. I noticed it around lunchtime, and it was an interesting description in my menu, so I decided to watch it. Seriously, only a movie suitable only for late night television ... you know, after Conan, but before the commercial. <br /> <br /> Although this film has very little in common with networks, it has a lot to do with spiders, refer to my headline if you need to refresh your memory. <br /> <br /> I found the idea behind the story absolutely fascinating. A hidden nuclear generator, a scientist and a believable portal ... That would be a good start for a cool fantasy, but in 15-20 minutes everything would have gone down. <br /> <br /> The cast is poor, without memorable performances, poor-quality queen, who had enlarged breasts ... considering that spiders do not carry breasts. And also bad sound effects. The film is clearly low-budget, although the actors have already tried. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> 4 electricians stumbled upon a hidden nuclear generator when they are at work. They fiddle with the buttons and open the portal. Two workers fall into the portal, and it closes ... scrambling to find out what is happening, the party that is still in our world is looking for help, while the other side is watching their surroundings. <br /> <br /> Help does not come as they open the portal and hold meetings in a parallel dimension. They are faced with a race of human spiders, who are called soldiers. After death and the chase survived survivors. <br /> <br /> Now it gets boring ... they hide, talk a little, try to build another portal, and then attack the hive. Having lost 2 more electricians, they open the portal and escape, returning to our world ... about 200 million years ago. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting, huh?
