This film was actually filmed and filmed in 1987, but until 1990 it did not appear in cinemas. When I watched this film, I saw his good intentions, but, I'm afraid, there was little talent or experience behind the camera. to make it work. The story takes place in California in the 1890s, and some Italian immigrants who own vineyards are said to have to leave their land for the railway to pass. Dennis Hopper plays William Berrigan, who offered money for the land, but was rejected. Giancarlo Giannini is Sebastian Collogero, and he is proud to be leaving and asking other farmers to stand up and fight to save their land. Berrigan loses his patience and hires a bunch of goons to free everyone. These thugs are headed by a man named Andrews (Bert Young), and he without hesitation kills anyone who gives him problems. Andrews and his people kill Collogero one night, and his son Marco (Eric Roberts) vows revenge and returns the land to everyone. Marco blows up the bridge that the railroad needs, and they also destroy the tunnel, and this delays the project for several months, and now Berrigan is starting to receive heat from other investors. This film was filmed by director Peter Masterson, and besides "The Journey to Abundance," he makes a directing career at best. He is a good actor, but here he seems to be above his head. It was a film that desperately needed more attention to detail, and it was easy to see that this did not happen. Roberts's hairstyle is perfect for the 1980s, but itâ€™s supposedly 1890! The cinematographer is Toyomichi Kurita, who eventually turned out to be a good cameraman, but this was only his fourth film, and of course he did not recognize everything at that time. This is not a very sharp film, and I noticed on several frames during the day that the sun blinds something, and the scenes simply do not have a definition that would help to look as a whole. The script is just a story of revenge, and there are no surprises during the film. We know that Giannini will get it, and it seemed just a matter of time. The cast is top notch, and they do everything possible, but the whole movie seems boring. It came on as the debut of the film by Julia Roberts, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Perhaps she appeared in a movie called "Fire Station" before.
