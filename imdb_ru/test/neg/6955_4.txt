Car for Michael Kane. It's pretty well written, and there is something good about it, but, in fact, it's a mess â€” not funny enough, not scary enough. This sluggish modern thriller with a Cockney. <br /> <br /> I like the premise - even in the deflected moral depth of East London, people do things for the right reasons. The unexpected result of the first correct match, which Billy Shiner supported at Kane's old school, kindles his paranoia. In the second half of the film, he pursues the shadows to cope with the disappointment of the outcome of the first. <br /> <br /> My biggest disappointment was the inability of director John Irwin to make more of a relationship between Shiner and his lieutenant. Branch Frank Harper. Harper, the Briton Tom Sizemore, understands his role well, while others seem to ignore her. A pity. 4/10
