I do not like Cary Grant, but I found his performances annoying in enough films to notice them; This, arsenic and old lace and child rearing. I don't like it in the north to northwest, but I find this film intolerably stupid. In addition, I find endless nonsense about Grant's class tedious. I have no idea what makes his class for viewers who foreshadow this. It means nothing to me. <br /> <br /> Patrsha Hitchcock says that in the backstage films included on this DVD, Grant was her father's favorite father; I think he was wrong. Jimmy Stewart was the best leader in Hitchcock's best films. <br /> <br /> With its ruined end, it’s really half the film and doesn’t carry on the discussion, and cannot support the high marks he gets. Even if the film is over, there’s nothing special. Fontaine - completely unsympathetic sucker. She must remain numb, inactive, and not willing to mess with anyone other than Johnny during the entire film, at either end, for his tricks to work. It is not much for work. Cary Grant starts each line with "Monkey ..." until I didn't want to strangle him. He says it about sixty times. This is positively annoying. Technique Hitch is shockingly small. An endless series of rooms / suites has an illusive skylight projected onto the back wall as a spiderweb effect. A light bulb in a glass of milk can excite fans, but cannot save a film that was made poorly. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovich must resign if he makes another imitation of Hitchcock / Carey Grant DVD I think this is his whole career now. As soon as I saw him, I thought, damn it, here is an imitation that impresses only him. Instead there were two! oh joy!
