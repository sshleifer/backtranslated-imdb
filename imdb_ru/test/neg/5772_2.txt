A group of friends heard from a friend who found gold in an ancient mine not far from the ancient abandoned western city of Suttersville. Despite the warnings of the local sheriff, Murphy (John Phillip Lowe), Old Man Pritchard (Richard Lynch) is a dirty hick who is deceived by tourists with alleged “Wanted” collectible posters and strange superstitious aunt Nellie (Karen Black) to stay in the mine because of this the infamous legend (that the evil miner who sold his soul to the devil and killed the priest’s daughter (Jeff Conavea), will return from the dead to kill those who remove gold from his trunk), these people see only the green, not the blood-red, which potentially could in leak out of their dead bodies. Finding the intact gold of Jeremiah’s stone, they line their pockets and suitcases, preparing for a bright future that supposedly lies ahead. But, if you do not heed the warnings of those whom you consider to be loons of the wilderness, the terrible death will be the obvious result. Jeremiah Stone, as we see, lies just a skeleton near the altar, in which the skulls are laid out next to each other, when the candles light on them, the pickaxe below is waiting for its owner, and dust particles return him to the grotesque corpse with a demonic exposition, his eyes burn with anger . This unfortunate group, hoping to have fun at the fire with gold, giving them warm prospects for the future, will become the victim of a vengeful ghoul and his vile picks. The other victim will meet the disgusting end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her car, and direct her way straight into her neck. Another unsuccessful attempt to retreat — Kamen made a frightened victim drive his car into a tree, his body was engulfed in fire, since he could not escape without harm. Another local girl, looking for her new friends, concerned about their well-being, gets a pickaxe hidden in her stomach. Aunt Nelly informs those who are still alive about the Forty-Nine and the curses of those who raid his eternal stash ... and pay the price for transmitting such information. Will anybody survive? Or is the whole group destined to die at the hands of a zombie miner? <br /> <br /> Make-up artist and monster creator John Karl Büchler directs this supernatural killer without worrying about logic or strong story-telling. instead, deciding to let his zombie miner destroy everyone and everyone who was in his way. He gives enough background, and this is at best weak for a killer, allowing special guest star Karen Black (oh, how her career fell into the abyss) to tell the viewer about him. According to the story told by us, the miner holds the daughter of a priest hostage, threatening to execute her, as the authorities of Suttersville warn of such an action. Amazingly enough, the Stone Plants, which are pickaxe right in her back, with the opposition discharging their weapons with little effect, because he sold his soul to Satan. Retreating to his possession, the mine, Stone sends a warning against anyone who even tries to seize his prey. Typical for most slashers in general, this bunch of twenty people are victims of your garden variety, with little development, except for some kind of banter and word exchange, which serve as filler until the undead maniac appears on the scene to kill them. . This is a regular group from the city, penetrated into unfamiliar territory, resurrecting evil, which must remain inactive. Like many of the slashers of the late 80s, much of the violence behind the scenes. What is on the screen, the minimum blood, is rather ordinary presented and occurs rather quickly. The killer’s make-up is shown only occasionally: it is mostly shrouded in darkness, the frightened faces of the victims, when he catches or chases them, are trusted more than the destruction method. One thing is certain, the stuntmen were set on fire many times. At least three times the character is burned alive either by a lantern or by a flaming vehicle. Martin Cove has a small cameo, since Black's ex-husband, Caleb, now lives with a much younger and dense honey. Vernon Wells (of “Road-Warrior” and “Commando”) is known for having pre-history Jeremiah Stone as a man who still captures the same type of threat he specializes in. John Phillip Lowe seems to enjoy being a rather polite and hospitable sheriff, welcoming strangers around his neck in the forest. Buechler has a rather attractive actress, all in tight trousers and little shirts, showing off her sleek and athletic figures, especially Elina Madison as frivolous Roxanne, always ready to take off her clothes for the greedy jerk Hayden (Rick Majesque). Stephen Westell (“The Ghosts of Edendale”) - Axel, a rather awkward background used as a joke for many jokes, including his “dumping in the forest” scene and the current status of unemployment.
