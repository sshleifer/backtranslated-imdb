I watched part of the first part of this film and small pieces of other parts. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think this film is really worth seeing. Strange characters and events really attract your attention and are quite interesting, but there are bad things in it, and some rude things. The magical and mythical side of this distracted me, and for most Christians this film would not be very suitable or worth watching.
