Even being a big fan of the horror genre with a low or no budget, I could not find this disaster a bit amusing. With a terrible game, painfully common “plot” and without dimensional characters, no matter how boring and drunk you are, this one is not worth your 81 minutes. Do not make the same mistake as me. Rent something else. Anything else!!!
