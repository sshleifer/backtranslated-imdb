Seriously, I do not understand how Justin Long is becoming increasingly popular. He has either the best agent in Hollywood, or he recently sold his soul to Satan. He is almost unbearable to watch on the screen, he has almost no charisma and terrible comedy time. The only film that he tried to anchor, which I remotely enjoyed, is “Waiting,” and this is almost exclusively because I worked in a restaurant. But I digress. In addition to this terrible leadership, this film has many other debits. I understand that it should be a cheap comedy with popcorn, but this does not mean that it should completely insult our mind and write so incredibly battered that it borders on the offensive. Lewis Black's considerable talent is also lost here, as he is in the most incendiary state, when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating definitely will not allow. The only bright spot of the film was John Hill (which will look almost unrecognizable for fans of the recent Superbad because of the weight he lost during this time). His only liners were funny in some cases, but they were obviously not enough to make it somewhere close to portable. If you just want to completely turn off your brain (or, better still, not have it), then you might like it, but I can't recommend it at all.
