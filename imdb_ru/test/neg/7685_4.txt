"Ivan the Terrible" - rather a shot of the play than the "big screen opus." Citizen Kane - similar work in many respects - is quite the opposite (in the sense in which we are accustomed to expect such a fare) in the sense that it has a lot of shooting from locations. <br /> <br /> To act is to convey the motivation of the character and the thinking of the audience; if you manage to understand the character, what does it matter, how was it done? And, given the low number of actions, how else can one express events that affect history, and, consequently, the machinations and decisions of the characters, except for "exaggerated movements"? <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a historical level. Why the style of the game should not be surprising. The rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany and the USSR forced the filmmakers, who remained, to make films as they knew. Since they were denied access to more modern works, which talked about the evolution and technology of cinema, they used only what they knew. <br /> <br /> Nazi control over the government in Germany destroyed the great German film industry of the 1920s due to their complete control over this film industry. And propaganda films can only “entertain” German troops; hence the need, for example, of popular German silent films of the 1920s. Thus, many methods of the film of Ivan the Terrible would have been derived from such captured German films directed to the film crew (as mentioned in other comments). <br /> <br /> Nowhere was there any confusion, and although he was personally found overly advertised, this is by no means a bad cinematic experience - and definitely NOT among the worst films ever. The game is good, and some of the cinematography is excellent (even by today's standards; more below). Definitely not a popcorn flick; no one can leave your brain behind the door of this. It may be dated and very symbolic - it’s worth watching on the big screen only if you don’t see movies with lights turned off at home, since many cinematic elements will be lost mainly in black and white films. It all depends on what expectations one may encounter ... <br /> <br /> WARNING - SPOILERS: do not read the following comments if they affect your personal view of the film (s). <br /> <br /> ... and if you do not mind the obvious communist propaganda (as opposed to capitalist propaganda). For Ivan is how Stalin saw himself - obviously, in his influence on the direction of the film (see Other Comments) - and anyone who possesses world historical awareness beyond the perspective of the United States will certainly understand this. Maybe Ivan was an early incarnation of Stalin, but maybe not; it’s more like a diatribe about Stalin and his motivations, decisions, loneliness, promotion of lackeys, etc. — using Ivan’s character — than any genuine historical record of Ivan. Also note the obvious use of certain colors in the sequel: Red (for the USSR) in the banquet scene. And maybe blue (for the USA) during certain shots, when the usurper wears the crown? <br /> <br /> But he has a lot of great visual effects, such as deep use of shadows or an external snapshot of people coming to beg. Ivan returns to Moscow.
