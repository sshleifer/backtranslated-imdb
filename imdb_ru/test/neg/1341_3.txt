Screenwriter Diane Inglish in 2008, updated the classic comedy of George Cukor in 1939 by MGM, unfortunately, shows more mothballs than his predecessor. Based on the astutely observant play of Claire Booth Lucy in 1936 about relationships that develop among a strictly feminine group of spoiled Manhattan secular people, the story seems ripe for a modern remake. Instead, due to the thematic overstrain of the English language, the production looks like an extended therapy session with a bit of wit. Moreover, in this film the diverse lifestyle of women is now reduced to stereotypes at the level of comedy performances, and the central idea of ​​the original play, which is to exclude men from the storyline, seems even more far-fetched, given the open pansexual evolution that occurred among men, as well as women since the 1930s. To add insult to injury, the recent adaptation of HBO's “Sex and the City” on a big screen made this type of sorority dish much better and with much sharper fangs. <br /> <br /> The skeleton of the original play remains as the story focuses on the rich Mary Haines, who abandoned her promising career in fashion design to become the devoted wife of the financial wizard of Wall Street. Like “Sex and the City,” she is surrounded by three best friends — Sylvie Fowler, a successful, cutthroat magazine editor in the guise of Miranda Priestley in “The Devil Wears Prada” (another film that is repeated); the long-term pregnancy of Edie Cohen, representing his wife, sitting at home; and Alex Fisher, the author of lesbians, who seem to represent every repressed group excluded from such an exceptional clique. Through a cheerful manicure, they learn that Maria’s husband has an affair with the ogre Crystal Allen, a perfume girl from Sachs, who is more than ready to break the marriage, fighting to become an actress. The rest of the story doesn't matter much, as it becomes a series of scenes focused on sisterly connections and debates, none of which are very bright and without satirical singing that was supported by the 1939 film. <br /> <br /> Looks weird At the age of 47, Meg Ryan seems to be playing Mary in such a way that she is trying to revive the goodwill that she generated in the 1990s with "When Harry Met Sally" and "Sleepless in Seattle" . The point is not that she does not match her age, but her usual vigor seems to be at odds with the character’s passive nature. Annette Bening cope somewhat better with the role of Sylvie in stealing the scene Rosalind Russell, because she proved that she is able to convey rigidity, masking vulnerability, but her character goes through such a banal transformation that greatly undermines the actions of the actress. Poor Eva Mendez should play Crystal as a petty, transparent saleswoman against a smart hard-edged cookie that Joan Crawford should play. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith are apart from Edi and Alex, respectively. Much better than Candice Bergen in the role of savvy, supportive mother Mary and Cloris Lichman in the role of nonsense housekeeper. <br /> <br /> Reflecting the dim box office response to the release of the film, the 2008 DVD does not have a reliable DVD. set of additions. There are two remote scenes - one with Crystal and her friends is having a night party for girls, unlike an elaborate Mary Garden party, and the other is continuation of Camet Bette Midler as a multi-female Hollywood agent advising Mary during a late night. in the yoga camp. Two articles supplement additional materials: "Women: Heritage" about the history of the film from the original play of 1936 and "Women for Women", in which the actors and film crew endlessly talk about the self-confidence and self-sufficiency of women. The irony is that this version of "Women", the director and the script which the woman does, so patronizing looks at women.
