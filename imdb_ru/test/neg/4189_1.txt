This is by far the worst horror movie ever. No, this is a movie I've ever watched. Shame Block Buster even for the fact that he carried this shit. I have never asked for a refund for any film, but I think it will be the first. <br /> <br /> The film is so bad that I had to stop after 15 minutes of watching it. <br /> I had more fun watching some kind of fuzzy movies on YouTube than watching this piece of throwing. <br /> <br /> The marketing dude in this film should have some sort of silver language to translate this thing into a Blockbuster establishment.
