Writer and director Jay Andrews, also known as Jim Wynorsky, offers more of his characteristic shock with a decent cast that is threatened by computer reptiles of the Z sort in Komodo Vs. Cobra ", as a common fraud" Mysterious Island "is found" Jurassic Park ", as you can imagine. The main problem with this predictable thread of monster food on humanity is incredibly fake special effects. Cobra and Komodo are terribly terrible. Nevertheless graphic people cope with the integration of monsters with their victims, but not that it was the least plausible. remain This epic of a stupid monster takes place on a remote island where the US military conducts top secret DNA testing on animals. The result is that giant Komodos and cobra thrive on this tropical paradise island. When the action begins, the primary scientist is absorbed by a cobra that loves to swim After that, we meet with Greenpeace, a group of environmental protesters and a journalist Planet One organizer Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish from Hellbent) pays charter skipper Jim Stoddard l Couple from the Houston Knights on CBS-TV) five promises if he delivers them to this forbidden island. Meanwhile, the US military suspects that something is wrong on the island, so they send their team of people who give food eaten by large predators. Our heroes are confronted with the last remaining scientist on the island, Dr. Susan Richardson (Michelle Bort from “Wonderland”), the daughter of the scientist responsible for this insane scientific project that tells them that the military are going to target the island for destruction. The title fight between two overgrown predators occurs in the last quarter of an hour after our heroes, who were successively hit by monsters, found a helicopter and took off in time before the military destroyed the island. In this non-standard being there is no tension, tension or something worthwhile. The best in this onlooker - the orchestral soundtrack of the composer Chuck Sirino; it gives "Komodo Vs. Cobra" an epic feel. Usually, Jay Andrews writes and manages tolerable chatter, but this is far below his low standards. Sexy women live better than guys. In one scene, our heroic group crosses the river, and we don’t see wet T-shirts. Get out! There is nothing in the way of an unforgettable dialogue or relationship in this tree. I think the military guys do too many salutes when they collect their heads to talk. Hopefully, Michael Pare received a good salary from this garbage. The ending, when one of the scientists acquires the features of a lizard, occurs in an afterthought. It's not so bad, it's good, it's just bad.
