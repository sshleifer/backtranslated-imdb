The first thing that struck me in this film is a terrible game. The whole cast was so out of place in the transfer of their roles that I started laughing at the terrible dialogue in the middle of the film. An even bigger problem with this film is that we will never know what motivates the actions of each character. One aspect of the film is the innovative visual effects of Halfdan Hussey. However, no matter how attractive they are, they can compensate for the gaping flaws mentioned above. A terrible script, mixed with acting at the level of the theatrical community, does not make viewing enjoyable. I was genuinely shocked at how bad this film is.
