The film "Chaos" got its name from the 1988 pop-scientific explanation of the Glyk chaos theory. What does the book or anything related to the content of the book have to do with the plot of the film “Chaos”? Nothing. The filmmakers seem to have looked through the book (obviously, without understanding anything in it) in search of a “theme” that unites a series of worldly sequences of actions that overlap a thin chain of events that acts instead of the plot in the film. In this regard, the film “Choas” resembles the Canadian film “Cube”, in which primes function as a device for mystifying the audience, so the absurdity of the plot will not be noticed: in Cube, a bunch of primes are thrown so that viewers attribute their lack of understanding to lack of knowledge about primes: the same approach is used in “Chaos”: some excerpts from Gleick’s books are added to make the bad guy’s actions in the film seem damn smart, This is, of course, an insultingly condescending attitude towards viewers, and any literate The Chaos ’s ripper, which can endure the entire movie, will eventually be confused. How could such a bad movie have been made? Rewritten as a novel, the story in Chaos probably wouldn't even have passed by the desk of the secretary of the literary agent. How could (at least) hundreds of thousands (and possibly millions) of dollars be thrown away on what can be considered a waste of time for everyone except those who took money from the film? Regarding the fact that in the film, each performance is telephoned. With the exception of technical failures, it would be surprising if more than one take were used for one scene. This story is completely meaningless: the last time I saw a disconnected story, it was the work of an eight-year-old child. Among the other significant flaws are the following: The bad guy leaves hints that the police will follow them. He has no reason to leave such hints. Police officers do not wear or use radio. A bad guy has no reason to act with a bad guy. Let me strongly recommend that no one watches this movie. If there is any other film that you like (or even just don’t hate), watch it.
