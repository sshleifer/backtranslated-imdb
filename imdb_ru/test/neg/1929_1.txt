Dear Mr. Seitzman, or whoever I take responsibility for so that Mr. Seitzman does not fulfill his legitimate destiny in order to be eaten by the living frantic wolves; <br /> <br /> I don’t know you and therefore cannot comment on your character; As far as I know, you give donations and help little old women cross the street. However, for the common good, I must insist that you never write another script while you live. Put the pen away from the laptop! <br /> <br /> If you refuse to listen to a request for injured brains, I watched one or two films in my life, and I believe that you will find my advice useful: <br /> <br /> 1. Not include love scenes in which overloaded teenage boys name parts of their girlfriends after USA states. If you have to write such a scene, please do not call the breasts "New York" and "New Jersey"; this causes unnecessary speculation as to which cities occupy the nipples. In addition, it is almost inconceivably stupid and annoying. <br /> <br /> 2. Don't rely solely on John Hughes films to reinforce class differences. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not hammer the audience over the head with exhausted clichés. Yes, yes, Kelly and Sam stand out in the rain, and this clears them of their worries. We get it. Yes, roses continue to bloom in the greenhouse of Kelly's dead mother, although all other plants have begun to rot. It is a symbol of their love. It is also very painful when blunt-force injury is applied to the back of the head. For the love of God, Mr. Seitzman, we received it. We all understood across the country. Amish people, hearing impaired, unborn children - we all understand. <br /> <br /> 4. Do not require actors to play memes. Ever No never. <br /> <br /> 5. Did I mention that you should weaken banal symbolism? Because the audience can draw a parallel between restoring a restaurant and building a relationship between Kelly and Sam without help. Really. We understood. <br /> <br /> 6. Review your script and highlight the following lines and any lines that resemble them: "I no longer know who we are." "I do not want to lose you". "He is the same as everyone else!" (And his consequence: “Dad, you don't even know him!”) 7. Yes, yes, she is in heaven, running around the field. We understood. <br /> <br /> 8. And in other news, we get this. <br /> <br /> I have seen dozens of horrible films in my life; I never expected to suffer for your art, and I would just leave the theater, but the elephant with the inscription “Doomed Love” on its side fell from the sky and pressed me to its place. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, your letters bite, you owe me ten dollars, and I hate you.
