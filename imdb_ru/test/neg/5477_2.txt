It was supposed to be a capricious, gloomy film that lingered in memory as a demonstration of relationships in which the dominant personality survives only because the dominant personality does not see any hope for change. <br /> <br /> The game was intense and skillful, the dialogue worked, but the film was annoyingly ineffective: too many remote shots that suggested a lack of focus, not a bigger picture. Bad flow The first 5 minutes could be missed completely. <br /> <br /> I suspect that with other editing this film might be attractive. <br /> <br /> In its current form, it is flat, shapeless and extremely disappointing.
