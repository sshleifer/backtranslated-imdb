I will begin by acknowledging that I like many of the low rated movies on this site. I found that if I see what the creators tried to do, I can find gratitude for their work. The sound of the Thunder was a story that interested me. I wanted to see what angles the directors are attacking, telling the story. By and large, they tried to create an entertaining film. The plot was invented, but the plots of the majority of militants are as follows. Ed Burns does not know how to carry a gun, but still feels good as a leader, given that he is not asked for much. The main problem! Destroys the whole movie!, This is a terrible CGI. It is absolutely unacceptable that animals and backgrounds look too artificial. In addition, animal concepts could be really good, as were action scenes, but they failed because production failed. It could be a truly memorable film, if they had just finished it. Looks like they wanted to come back and fix all the terrible CGIs, but they ran out of money and still released them. Save your money, because someone failed this movie. I give him three stars, because it really could be good, but it didn't work out somewhere, I can't say enough.
