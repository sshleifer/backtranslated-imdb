I find it terribly ironic that Hollywood’s “left wing” continues to hedge its stakes by making these terrible, warm films that do not condemn the war on terror and do not accept it. <br /> <br /> If you survived in the sixties and are a devoted pacifist, and you hope for a general condemnation of the war, like Born on Thursday July or Everything Is Quiet on the Western Front, this film will really feel like a breakdown. None of these soldiers question this war, any war or the idea of ​​war. They are simply unhappy with the need to take another tour. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are an American patriot who wants to see a story about courage and honor, then this film will really look like a breakdown. None of these soldiers love America or even love service. The way they blow and sulk makes them look more like suburban teens than cool guys. It is not WE, were SOLDIERS, and it is not SANDS IVO JIMS. This is not even a meaningless action, and the war scenes are less RAMBO and more BUFFY. <br /> <br /> Ryan Phillip can't quite carry this kind of film at all. Although he is incredibly sexy, in a rough trade, in the men's room, in a bisexual way, it is difficult to imagine him as a sluggish Texas boy who wants to get up and be considered. This is not a sergeant. Croft in Mailer "Naked and Dead." He looks more like Joel in Truman Capote's OTHER VOICES. He cannot sell you because he fought and did his job, OR that he wants his woman and wants her right now. He falls on the battlefield and in the bedroom, looking as if he would prefer to bend over and undertake a good tough attack from behind.
