This DVD is only 30 minutes long and contains boring interviews that show that the average Slipknotian IQ is about 30. But here these aspects are the least problematic. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that Slipknot is one of the least talented metal bands to ever sell more than 100,000 of its own shit. (The only reason I say “one of” instead of “that” is because System Of A Down is even worse.) Just like Ed Hein’s girlfriends, the music of this group consists of old metal cliches that should be both in their image and in their ultra-boring music. In fact, their image is quite funny; their videos are like excerpts from raw horror films, therefore, they fulfill at least some purpose as entertainment. <br /> <br /> Their music, however, does not consist of anything of quality — however: just a bunch of useless, heard — reefs made a million times before they played only the guitar, which in no way linked together and yet randomly grouped together to form “songs” that have no cohesion, no glare, and nothing. But if the riffs are really bad, then the vocals are even worse: the Slipknot vocalist has a stereotypical and, therefore, an uninteresting “angry” roar - 90% of all metal bands have today - but this is nothing compared to when this lost hook starts trying to sing! And yet, what can we expect? Rule No. 39 of the Nu Metal Reference Guide says: “You will growl and sing alternately. Do not pay attention to the fact that both styles are poorly combined, because most of your fans are so deaf that they will love you. ” even if you **** into the microphone. “Slipknot reached their absolute worst when their“ singer ”starts to publish“ melodies ”. <br /> <br /> But back to your image. It’s stolen, copied, ripped, cut, borrowed, taken, without asking anyone besides Mr. Bangla. Have you never heard of them? Of course not, you only listen to nu metal, and Mr. Bangle is quite far from it, and in any case goes beyond any classification. They also wore masks - grotesque, terrible, similar to Slipknot masks, I could add - in the late 80s and early 90s. This group, whose leader is Ike Patton from Faith No More, never achieved great success, because their music was not aimed at ordinary music lovers (to put it mildly). <br /> <br /> So, basically, Slipknot aren 'even original in image department. They have nothing new, so they will be forgotten in a few years: as soon as the masks become boring for the legions of their fans with a mad face, it is then that Slipknot will have to compete in the music market exclusively with their generic music. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Mike Patton, it is interesting that many nu-metal bands often consider his singing to be a big influence. Predictably - and fortunately - Patton is not flattered by this and denies that he is proud to have influenced one of the worst metal sub-genres in all of history ... <br /> <br /> After saying this, enjoy this short DVD and cheap sharp feelings that he can give to an untrained ear and a bored eye ... And then to polish these Slipknot posters, because in a few years no one will take care of them, poor dear ones. <br /> <br /> After seeing Corey in the documentary film “Beat it Out,” I finally understand why he wears a mask: he is a blue-eyed, child-faced redhead, looking like Dave Mustaine’s younger brother! Not really scary. <br /> <br /> To learn more about my music world, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/1 <br /> <br /> Please punish me hard, very hard, by clicking “No” below.
