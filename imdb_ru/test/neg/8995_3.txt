In most cases, the deadly boring company Naaha talks about this dancer / choreographer (Antara Mali), who considers herself a certain author, in addition to petty commercial compromises on which the people around her, including her acting beauty (Abhishek Bachchan), build their careers. A good idea, it only turns out that she has the most incredibly bad ideas about costumes and dance moves, things are so rotten that even the forces behind these ultra-cheap South Indian cauldrons writhe in great confusion. <br /> <br /> This story follows a predictable pattern, causing a yawn ... The dancer and Bo meet and have an affair (yes, including sex) ... Bo gets success, but she rejects his attempts to help her. .. Bo throws the mood and they go at each other ... the dancer meets the most incredible director who wants her to "do what she wants" ... inappropriate bags with efforts of even more irrelevant popularity ... trying to reach to failure, to climax, when he explodes about how he can not live without her ... End. <br /> <br /> In fact, I did not expect this film to be good. So why did I watch this? Because I have a fetish of Antara Mali. She is an actress with enough IMO talent to reach great heights if she has the chance. Alas, her role in the film looks much better on paper than in real performance, ironic for the film, which should be about an uncompromising character. To pay tribute to her, she makes game efforts, well beaming in the few scenes that actually ask her as an actress. I just want the film to be more worthy of it. Abhishek Bachchan also delivers several good kicks, the last scene was somewhat saved by a slow turn, which pleasantly reminds you of his father. <br /> <br /> It is recommended only if you can sit through huge piles of dog litter to return a few moments of good moments kindly provided by leading actors.
