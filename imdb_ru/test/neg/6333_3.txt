The unpleasant genre of “home invasion” can be traced back to Wes Craven’s early and dismal “Last House Left”, with such unpleasant shoots as “I spit on your grave”, “The Wrong Way” and “Visitors”, shortly after the tracks of this film. Here, in the early 80s, the Italians offering the same section are again spewed out, with the turn that this one is set on the continental train. "La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto" ?? known in English speaking countries as "Terror Express" ?? It starts surprisingly well, but after about twenty minutes it is the turn for the worse, as sex scenes begin to take precedence over more serious actions and uncertainty. <br /> <br /> David, Phil and Ernie, three rich young men who are tormented by terrorism and humiliation of others, take the trans-continental express train in Italy. The train is full of other passengers, including the prostitute Juliet (Silvia Dionisio), who often drives on the train and made a deal with one of the porters to act as a pimp, urging the male passengers to part with their money for the night of passion in her bedroom. The three cretins quickly began to upset the passengers with their aggressive, drunken behavior, but things get more serious when they take control of the whole car on the express train and barricade themselves from the rest of the train. Pretty soon they revel in their temporary control. the young wife (Zora Kerova) was raped by two young men in a close compartment; Juliet herself is subject to prolonged sexual abuse; and later the odious trio makes male passengers play dice to decide who to rape a 16-year-old virgin traveling with her parents (a concept made doubly tasteless due to the fact that her father is one of the men forced to play the game). The only passenger who seems ready to fight back is the convict who is escorted to Germany, but what hope does one person have against three armed thugs? <br /> <br /> La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto begins a decent start. Introduces various intriguing characters, and it is shown that the three hooligans have a truly disturbing impact on travelers. Although the story is clearly exploitable, the opening scenes are carefully aligned, and the film seems to rise above the usual level of the genre. Things fall apart during a terrible scene in which Kerova is caught in sex in the toilet compartment by two thugs. The scene is condescendingly filmed, and the effect does not seem to cause sympathy for the victim or hatred of the criminals? instead we are asked to feel included. This is a sensation at worst. Further humiliating rape will follow, but too much protracted camera work on oral sex and female genitalia is involved in the rape sequence. One sequence involving a 16-year-old girl swinging on the edge of a hard core and feels especially "wrong." By the end of La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto, it is easy to forget that it was conceived as a thriller, in the last hour of the film pornography is devoted, and not uncertainty. Lovers of meanness will revel in this; others may want to look elsewhere.
