In this film, there are 2 famous actors who I used to love to watch. There, the actions are great, and every action is felt in the heart. But it makes me think that these two were thrown into a speech / drama class in a college for the first time and told one to act dominantly and shyly towards the other in the room, not allowing her to leave, and for the woman to be truly innocent . it is enough to disperse the audience to tears. <br /> <br /> The only good role is the acting ability, the plot has the same trick as the influence of Hitlers, and I began to hate the main character for that one. But, in my opinion, all this could have been done in 15 minutes, so delaying it for more than an hour was just a punishment for everyone who watched it. <br /> <br />
