Ben Stryker, a former green beret, stops in the small town of Agua Dawley to visit old friend Tick Rand. Soon after a trip to the city on his Suzuki and settlement. A team of motorcyclists, known as "Savages," led by tyrant Pyhiron, invades and finally captures this place. Stryker does not want to interfere, but this changes when his friends become real targets. <br /> <br /> What can be said about this subject? Difficult challenge, since the only fundamental reason to watch this low-budget car accident is a terrific cast that the crew managed to get this project. Although I do not think that this is a complete unsuccessful job, this is also not very good. Now, what the cast! Lance Henriksen (being the main character, he, oddly enough, has no main billing except the final one), Karen Black, George Kennedy, Richard Lynch, Bill Forsyth, Mickey Jones and Leo Gordon. Now, what went wrong with this nasty low-budget messenger. The shallowness of the material is too one-dimensional, in order to largely borrow ideas from the best films (namely, Mad Max) and come up with a complete mess of ideas that simply do not stick together and could be better thought out. The clich√©s used can be used for good viewing, even though they are predictable, but Wild Dawn seems to allow it to jump quickly, not allowing the viewer to absorb it all. Actors for the most part are vain in empty roles. Helriksen with a snow-white blonde skillfully holds and even thanks to her commendable presence provides a mysterious shine to his character. He is not a damn, and sometimes disappears in battle. Too many side effects, but when he really kicked some bikers in the ass, good times are over. Hissing performance of Karen Black is very strange and all about screams and curses. Although she does enter into one unforgettable fight with the flirty fox character Claudia Udi Katie. George Kennedy, confined to a wheelchair, wanders aimlessly around before the final attack, and Richard Lynch looks confused as a wayward priest / mayor of the city in a very redundant role. Bill Forsyth on the verge of simply chewing on him as the main honorary badge of the notorious biker pack. <br /> <br /> In the anecdotal story (written by William Milling and Max Bloom) there is this funny comic book, and it has been greatly influenced by the western genre. Just look at the villains for this. How they came up with their names, remains a mystery. Maybe they pulled them out of their hat. This is a rather second-rate material that most often moves to one dim scene after another. Funny funny elements are added, as well as a bit of meanness. Gummy exploitation, which does not get tough enough, and deaths are pretty ridiculous. The awkward script is filled with confusing details and unbearable banal. Simon Nuchtern's spotted guide was numbered and neatly laid out. One or two intense scenes can't do make-up due to his tortoise-like rhythm and many shitty hands tricks. Cardboard kits looked indecent, but had no organic meaning. Gerald Fail's carving-like cinematography was better processed when the focus was not on the city, but on the desert background (like the beginning and end of the film climax) with some neat camera touches. Pinot Donaggio's clumsy musical preferences are drowned out by his own incompetence. <br /> <br /> Savage Dawn is an unforgettable film about midnight movies, which for the most part is a special misfire. There are better and more convincing exercises of the same kind.
