Even to say that this film is Sebastian's work at its best, just tell you everything you need to know about a person. Sebestyen is a miserable, stupid, at best, not funny, but very popular leader of French television. If watching any of his shows is just torture for any person with a normal physique, his first film (just what you can hope for) turned out to be even worse. Sebastian’s apologies for rape (the victim falls in love with his aggressor) are not only irrelevant, but also clearly unacceptable. I highly recommend you not to look at this picture (or any of Sebastian’s future functions), you just lose time ... There is something on French television that doesn’t smell right ... and this is Patrick Sebastien !!!
