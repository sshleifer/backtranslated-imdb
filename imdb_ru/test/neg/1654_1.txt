Oh my God! The Beeb reached a new low with this ruthless act of political correctness, a mixed race living in Birmingham with a disabled child added for good measure. Whoever ordered this scar should be tracked down and thrown to the dogs. Usually the funny Jasper Carrott is as funny as the heaps in this show, and don't lead me to the rest. They have the time and subtlety of a nuclear bomb. I only hope that the comedy will be better, but with such as Little Britain and Catherine Tate, I strongly doubt it. I think you better get a box set for a decent comedy from years past, such as Fawlty Towers or Bottom, if you want to laugh. <br /> <br /> BAN THIS SQUEAKY CLEAN RUBBISH
