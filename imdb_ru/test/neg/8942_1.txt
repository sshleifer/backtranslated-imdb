Oh my god, I'm lost. Now I know that everything that this guy does is senseless. R. D. wrote on August 13, 2006 (Publication No. 881): What a terrible experience. It seems that a group of 3-grade students stole a video camera, borrowed some old editing software in 1995, and poked fun at each other. Trash RGC wrote on August 1, 2006 (publication number 747): This film is a piece of @ $ # @ # @. It sucks. Calling it a movie will be deceptive. It was a group of friends who were having a good time and filming. It was difficult to follow the storyline. Attempts at the artistic angle of the camera distracted from the plot and in themselves made all this time a dizzying experience. The acting was funny, but very amateur. The concept is fine, I think. Maybe next time, manufacturers should raise capital and hire real professionals and try again. I have to say that I am tired of what many people think that making a good movie is easy. It is not easy ... This fact seems to be lost or ignored by many who believe that without any training / experience and talent they can make a good product. I guess at the end they will find out how difficult it is for me so disgusting. I am NOT WITHOUT the COMMENTS that Chris wrote on August 5, 2006 (publication No. 762):
