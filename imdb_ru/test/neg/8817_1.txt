(This review does not necessarily reveal the plot of the film, but it can change someone’s expectations about the film and thus make it less enjoyable.) take off the edge of your place in fear, and instead end up laughing at every stupid plot twist? This film had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. He was badly cut and jumped too much; references to the past seem more like an excuse for why the plot went in a certain direction. The writers should not have thought about how the magnificent plot was to be performed, because the poor distribution of time throughout the plot discourages the viewer and makes the film all the more tedious to watch. <br /> <br /> Almost worse than the fact that the authors abused what could have been a great and classic thriller, it was that he gradually relied on cheap tactics for intimidation. Acting didn't make it scary, and situations hardly made it scary, so you needed some dark scenes with things jumping on you to make it worthwhile. Even those were predictable. <br /> <br /> Even the blood could not save the plot, and he was competing with the blood of the successful Se7en thriller. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Se7en, I feel that Co tried to follow the incredibly fascinating psychological topic of Se7en, but failed miserably. I was terribly disappointed by the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the killer's psychology. The opening scenes make the viewer think that this is a psychological thriller; believe me, this is far from the case. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention a bad game? At first, Cary Elvis seems to make a convincing presentation; however, it completely deteriorates in the most important parts of the plot. I stayed in tears of laughter in this performance, which is worthy of Razzi. Lee Wannell’s performance is also terrible and too played out, although not as bad as Elvis’s performance, and the big red flag says Vannell is also the author of the film. <br /> <br /> End Saw can never compensate for the loss of its entire middle, and this makes it a huge failure. It was a missed opportunity, and I have no idea why Monica Potter and Danny Glover decided to star in this movie. <br /> <br /> I’m angry with myself for wasting my rent money. It was definitely not worth 4 dollars, and in the future I will definitely avoid seeing anything related to Elvis, Wannell or James Wan. The big tragedy is not in the fact that she lacked the basis for the plot, but in the fact that the huge potential plot was discarded, and the bad game added insult to the injury. I will avoid the pun-related game associated with the title, and just conclude with this: do not watch this movie.
