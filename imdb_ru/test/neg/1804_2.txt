If you are looking for a movie that puts you to sleep, then Heart of Darkness is the movie for you. The book was not the same as I expected, and the film disappointed me even more. The cast list was pathetic, and the whole plot was pathetic and did not look like a book, except for a few scenes. I understand that everyone has their own point of view when they read The Heart of Darkness, and they create their own films in their head, but the director takes important scenes and adds meaningless scenes. If there was someone in the film who was supposed to be of a certain culture, they should have used the actor of that culture. There are actors from everywhere, and I am sure that they could find more suitable actors for their roles. Joseph Conrad was a respectable man and created a book that will entertain you if this is what you are looking for, but the film was cheap and meaningless, and someone who could have made the film as respectable as the book should have done. If you want a movie that draws you into darkness, then the “Heart of Darkness” is a movie for you.
