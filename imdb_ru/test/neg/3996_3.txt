Initially, I became interested in this film after reading a brief review and watching several amazing screenshots, and there was a promise to create an exciting horror film in the style of Dario Argento. Admittedly, I have to say that Argento films have been rather inconsistent from time to time, and some feel like a handful of visually influential set pieces, strung together with a vague connecting storyline. <br /> <br /> Since Argento is credited as the author for this, I must say, I am not very surprised. Even his masterpiece Suspiria, when considered, shows the same tendency to be strung on sometimes unrelated scenes solely for aesthetic impact. However, Suspiria also had the advantage of a single protagonist and explicit antagonists, as well as scenes that ultimately contributed to the final decision. <br /> <br /> The Church, on the other hand, has nothing of the kind. He has no protagonist, no protagonist at all; besides, he has no real plot, no crescendo, no climax, no denouement, no resolution. This is a completely empty, incoherent work that looks like Argento sat down and thought, “Hey, this will visually make an interesting scene ... let's do it!” The film is a series of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Initially this may be interesting, and the director Soavi, I must say, is great. Soavi can not be blamed for the material, as it is made as convincing as possible. However, such a good direction draws attention to the horrific errors of the script, and there is absolutely no point in this. An attempt at a central unifying conspiracy is nothing more than plagiarism of Carpenter’s film The Prince of Darkness. Events occur solely because the script wants this, and the reaction to these events is completely implausible. The narrative flow is irreparably damaged after a certain point simply because it is not possible to suspend disbelief; this is too funny. To this is added numerous factual errors, which are so vividly demonstrated that it is becoming awkward. <br /> <br /> If he were more outspoken and artistic and edited to another work, he could be frightening or tense. If it had been turned into a real coherent narrative, it could be exciting. But it was none of that. The best he could do was confusing and sometimes infuriating. Plots are introduced, but never follow. Characters are forgotten and changed arbitrarily. No logic is ever applied to any situation. It may be scary or interesting, but in order to cause such a feeling, you need more effort from the writer ... much more. <br /> <br /> In general, the Church should not be considered but full of enthusiasts of Italian horror, which is more style than substance. This is the Argento style at its worst, and this is a serious excuse for ordinary criticism.
