An incomprehensible horrible confusion, probably the most notorious of all Roman emperors, who went insane, leaving the infamous party orgies and ruthless murders on its way ... I know there are several versions of this, and this is based on the 102-minute version I watched - but I can't figure out how this can make any difference to get the rest of this movie out of the mud! <br /> <br /> I have long heard about the alleged "shocking" content of sex / nudity (which, frankly, there is very little - and boring when it is) and blood, but be careful - this is an amateur technical production, which well and truly shocking here: everything looks simple and simple as a failure in a youth film school project! Camera work is hopelessly inept, full of strange scales, unsuccessful frames and intricate panning (from and to what looks like a huge theatrical scene for the most part!) Complete with grainy, cheap photo quality. Lighting and colors are terrible and uneven - day or night? Are they inside or outside? Did they change the scenes? Who or should be in the frame? Editing is the last sin here, confusing everything randomly with random jumps, lack of continuity and random transitions that destroy any chance of impulse, plot development and participation. Potentially interesting dialogue and no less interesting true historical history ... but these shortcomings are so distracting that it is tragic. <br /> <br /> A story in which there are so many opportunities to be great is just one giant, burnt (and Fellini) -like) turkey, which is good only for a few laughable creators and Peter O'Toole, who makes memorable Tiberius. Oh yes, that brings us to famous actors. I would like to build them all in turn and just ask: from whom did you get free access to the bonus in orgies to become a part of it? There I spent enough time on one of the truly worst films of all time - a period! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 from Ozeppe
