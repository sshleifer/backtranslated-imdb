This is only the fourth effort that I watched from this director (whom I met and found quite brilliant at the Italian B-film of 2004 at the Venice Film Festival), and also possibly the worst. As in the case of the BRONX EXECUTIONER (1989), which preceded it, this is a prime example from the tail of the European culture era - the prime minister, because it shows the depth to which the previously invigorating style fell by this time! <br /> <br /> Here, in fact, we get a plot spinning around - I'm not kidding, guys - the killer phone! Cute, but polite Charlotte Lewis - in her third film after PIRATES (1986) and GOLDEN CHILD (1986) - a model that obviously had just finished the novel; she always expects her lover-architect to call her back, but every time the phone rings, all she receives is static, accompanied by voices from the outside (or some such nonsense). She made friends with a new tenant in her apartment building, who, oddly enough, knows the authority on paranormal phenomena (William Berger), who, cheerfully speaking, explains that the negative energy that is released, say, during family disputes, can manifest through home appliances into lethal force (I swear, I do not invent it)! <br /> <br /> Among the main points ... low points of the film: a grumpy barman, from a dark place where the heroine calls a couple of times (it seems that the chain of events can only be broken, forcing Lewis to go through her steps again , the style DESTRUCTIVE ANGEL (1962)!), on display a lot of ridiculous looking phones, the device of the girlfriend-photographer of the heroine sneaking up on her before the murder, sarcastic policeman who greet Lewis when he reports strange incidents (â€œI wonder what kind of toaster this is? ") Potential abuser Killed clatter of coins, shooting from a phone booth, and its own bloody demise Berger (with the phone working on a pacemaker, which it is equipped, and causing heart doctor explode)! <br /> <br /> The climax of the film is rather tangled and, apparently, in the end, he sees that all the "lost souls" inhabit the flock of pigeons and fly out of the window of the "obsessed" office (office of lonely hearts!). For whatever the cost, the score - no less than the former goblin Claudio Simonetti - is quite effective, despite the fact that there are dated heavy metal numbers on the soundtrack.
