This film was a complete disaster for me. There is one thing that films must have in order to be watched, and that is * some * psychological certainty of the characters ... unfortunately, this is not so. The main characters behave irrationally most of the time, and even if they have reasons for such behavior, the director does not reveal them to us. The character of Sophie Marceau is especially annoying when shooting everything throughout the film, when you can expect something more rational (for example, meeting her mother in the hospital) ... and why was she the one who married this guy? (no, this is not a spoiler) The plot sometimes seems to be cut off from some soap opera, and, although the actors play well, it doesnâ€™t help much. In general, I just could not find a way to connect with this movie. Not that I tried too hard after the first hour. I never left the cinema during the movie, but this time was the closest in my life.
