NBC had the opportunity to create a powerful religious epic in the spirit of the “Ten Commandments” and “The Greatest Story They Ever Tell”, and instead they decided to make a hesitant cartoon that would be more like “Water World” than anything else. or else. I don’t remember the biblical passage in which Lot turns into a pirate and attacks the ark, and I don’t remember one where Noah’s son develops a serious friendship with an orange, and I don’t remember that Noah was some crazy old stupid suddenly behaves as if he were in command of the navy and running around, shouting sea terms like "lift up the pedestal!" Perhaps this was the worst marketing decision in history. Obviously, the majority of people who watch this will be Jewish and Christian parents with their children, so why make the film so offensive to these people? If they were deliberately trying to offend, why not advertise it in this way and at least not interest the right audience? I hope that they will someday make a REAL film about Noah, one of which is made seriously and thoughtfully, one that really attracts people and makes money. Until then, do not waste your time with this garbage.
