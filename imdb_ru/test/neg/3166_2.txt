This is Valentine's Day, and we decided to stay, have a good dinner and watch this movie on TCM, and not go out. We are in our 40s - 50s, we love romance, and we are both "soft", but this film was just bombed for us (it's hard to imagine that he was nominated for an Oscar, etc. was then). The cinematography was beautiful, but for the most part the film as a whole is terribly outdated. The character of Jennifer Jones made so many references to the fact that she was a Eurasion, that we started counting, and after a while we giggled every time she said that. Add to this that the “song-theme” sounded continuously throughout the entire film, and we could not wait to finish it to watch the evening news.
