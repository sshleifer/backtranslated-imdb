Imagine this: high school. In addition to the boarding school, and children have no parents. Oh, and this is in Malibu. And the children are all thin, white and gorgeous, with an exceptional symbolic minority or fat child to play in the “strange” outcast. And there are no reasonable rules, such as how they have cohabitation, nuclear weapons in their dormitories, coffee kiosks, a sushi bar and a free laptop for each student. <br /> <br /> Here is the story: A girl, Zoe Brooks, attends the PCA, a former school for boys. Absolutely perfect in all possible ways, she is smart, beautiful, thin, athletic, creative, and everyone who wants to be a perfectionist. Almost all boys in school want her, and every girl wants to be her friend. This is the one to whom everyone turns for advice, the one who saves the day with a simplified plan, and this is simply wonderful. It is a pity that none of this makes her pretty. <br /> <br /> We have to believe that if we don’t even get close to the perfection of Zoe, are we bad people? The series does not have her guilt, and if someone contradicts her, they are portrayed as a bad guy (Logan). He may be a jerk, but at least he has some kind of brain that he thinks himself, instead of just agreeing with the princess every time. <br /> <br /> Her loyal group of blind followers: Chase, medium blunt ass, who secretly is in love with her, Michael, symbolic black guy (and the only decent actor on the set), Lola, imitative actress and anorexic, thoughtless talkativeness, Quinn, a clever but ignorant girl when it comes to teenage things and Logan, a rich dork with a soft side. Yes, this show basically spews stereotypes. <br /> <br /> What surprises me is that they all try to pretend that they are normal children. They complain that Logan gets too much money when they have to work independently, although they already go to a boarding school with a very good reputation and have relatively good things that many teenagers cannot afford. They drink coffee and eat sushi on a regular basis, almost do not have homework and sunbathe almost every day. Wow, it's hard for them! Any more problems? I'm too beautiful, rich and stress free! I assume that Zoe 101 (for which 101 is needed at all) is Nick's attempt to try to realistically depict teenagers. Except that they caught a glimpse of reality, she did not like it, and they decided to give the children a life like donkeys in the Hills. <br /> <br /> But at least the set is pretty.
