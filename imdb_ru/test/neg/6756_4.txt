How many disaster films can there be before we get tired of them. C'mon, we can see them on Discovery all day. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment that the first part of this film is just a soap opera. The grandson of the Great Predictor makes a prediction, and everyone starts to moan about how he destroys his last name. An evil mother-in-law convinces his wife to throw him into the arms of her mistress, with whom she wants to meet. Can you believe it? Wife wants to approve a new wife! At the same time, the mistress has a man in love with her, who has no wife, but she sends him to pack things. <br /> <br /> Now that the soap opera is over, an earthquake appears. /> <br /> Special effects are really good, but rewriting is bad. That's why I love movies with subtitles. All the actors are very experienced and have won many awards, so you can see some of the best in Japan in a frequently repeated story. <br /> <br /> But the story from the soap opera returns with a strange ending.
