I clicked on the Encore Mystery channel to wait for the film I wanted to see, Dr. Moreau's Island. I caught only a few minutes of the Shadow Conspiracy. The old man runs towards Charlie and grabs his arm. Suddenly, the Assassin in a bright raincoat knocks the old man on the head (with a side arm) on the other side of the street. After waiting "C" to turn around and see, "A" is trying to shoot at "C" and clearly misses. "C" was a much easier target, the old man could not run far. Duh! The chase is on, and “C” is on the elevator, “A” is on the roof, so he is trying to shoot a cable that is parallel to “A.” It beats and breaks the cable, it is impossible. Later, this time with a specialized rifle, the letter "A" is built on "C" from a distance of about 50 meters, but it is foolish to notice that the motorcycle is approaching and instead knocks on the rider. How does charlie get his parts? Dad goes to the producers and says: "Listen, my child needs a job ...". It reminds me of his stupid Sit - Com. All the actors are good, except, yes ... you understand. I usually have to finish 2 or 3 minutes of that waiting C.S.I. come on See what I can do the next hour. I know, I'll cut my toenails! Much better to use my time.
