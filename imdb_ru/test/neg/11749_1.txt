Let me start by saying that this reworked version of one of the greatest films ever created, Psycho (1960), was just an excellent example of bad direction, bad acting and bad cast. The best way to describe this film is to compare it step by step, acting, acting and processing, process by process, with the original. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock, one of the greatest movie directors ever lived, intended to shoot the original in black and white, despite having a color image. Well, the people of 1960 may not be used to bloodshed or horrible scenes like we are today, but this did not stop people from loving them and getting a nomination for 4 Oscars. Gus Van Santa had absolutely no reason to release it in color, except that it was 1998. What should have looked realistic in color was not. After the shower scene, Norman washes his hands, and it is easy to understand that everything that was used for blood looked like some kind of red wax. As soon as he washes away the blood, his hand is red. <br /> <br /> With regard to acting, there may not have been a better lineup of Janet Lee and Anthony Perkins in the original. Perkins suited Norman well, and he was incredibly natural when he smiled and talked to a stranger. Hitch wanted a beautiful and good actor, and he worked just fine. In this version, I personally think that Vince Vaughn looked perfect, beautiful and strong to play the role of Norman, unfortunately his game was no less terrible. In the office of the motel, where Norman and Marion were talking for a long time, there was no expression on his face, and his voice and face never changed. In the original of the same scene, when the insane asylum is described, we can clearly see Perkins's sudden change in facial expression, and he looks frighteningly evil, though not aggressive. Vince Vaughn is working through the whole conversation as if he is just rote. Again a terrible game. Same with Anne Heche. In the opening scene in the original, we see how tense and nervous Marion (Janet) is when she goes to Phoenix. She was happy to receive money, but at the same time she was afraid for life. This is what I call acting skills. In the remake, Heche has no signs of fear, and she periodically smiles to get money. I don’t think that someone will be “happy and smiling” when they have just stolen $ 400,000, and all state police are behind them. In the scene in the shower, Janet in its original form captures the curtain, turns around and dies after being hit by a knife. In the remake, Hatchu is stabbed, turned, then swings the other way, has a stupid expression on his face and will die with great effort. Again, terrible game. <br /> <br /> In this film there are some specially made changes compared to the original, which seem to have nothing to do with the storyline and the current situation. In the scene where Arbogast is killed, two scenes flash between the blows. One with a naked woman, and the other with a sheep. Many people, including myself, are not quite sure whether the second scene showed a sheep or a cow or something else. What does the beast or nude woman have to do with the murder of the investigator! The changes were simply inappropriate and unnecessary. There are also a few changes in the final scene. <br /> <br /> Let me add some (and only) positive moments along with it. I felt that Julianne Moore did a good job and played a good role as Lily. And William Macy acted well, and that was exactly how Arbogast’s character would play. <br /> <br /> It is well known that the purpose and intention of the film’s remake is to convey to the current generation a movie that has a good classic plot line, and try to make it look better than the original. And if something happened here according to what I just said, it is just the opposite. Unfortunately, many, like me, were not impressed after watching this film, unless we learned of the existence of an unforgettable original version. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this film, it is far from original, and the original will always be one of the best films ever created, if not the best.
