“The Island of Death” is not a very good film, by any standards, but curious. Imagine if the Natural Born Killers were made 20 years too early, since the porn film is Greek Eurotrash. This is what you get here - a strange story about a young sociopathic British couple who cut a death strip among the population of a beautiful little Greek island. <br /> <br /> I will save you from a detailed analysis of the plot; in fact, it is not important, except to create more perverted or violent sex scenes, followed by mercilessly brutal murders, often photographed with love for posterity by our charming young couple. It could have been brilliant, painful and unpleasant in its own way, but instead ... <br /> <br /> Instead, I eagerly checked the lead time and head index to see how much more parade will be past. Sluggish walking and sluggish, soft play turn even the most vile perversions into pablum, and combine scenes into an eternity of dull boredom. Oh, good. You can't beat them all.
