Usually any movie with Steve Railsback is a good movie. However, this film does not match this view. Lifeforce is a below-average film that is very confusing at first (reminds me of Star Trek: TMP), but is able to come to an end a bit when London becomes Zombie City. Horror / sci-fi mess, which is very difficult to handle, although it is very easy to look at a naked space girl / vampire. This film deserves a rating of 4 out of 10.
