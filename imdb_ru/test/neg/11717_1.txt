Having completed this hellish piece of garbage, my friend and I swore an oath of solemn oath to never again talk about how we had just destroyed the last 90 minutes of our lives. This film is absolutely meaningless, a two-dimensional hero and heroin, which we cannot say whether they will survive or not, and some of the most villainous villains ever black out the horror screen (or any other). To prove once again how completely pointless this film was, I would like to add a plot synopsis, but I cannot write fiction. In general, the only reason I can think that someone wants to see this movie is that he just killed his entire community and is looking for some kind of suicidal punishment that will haunt you during the next few years. years old!
