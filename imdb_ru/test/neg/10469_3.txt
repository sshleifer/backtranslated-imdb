Yes, that's what I felt after I finished watching this movie. The game is below average, and the special effects are terrible. In fact, the worst that I have ever seen. This is a very budget movie. This film can not scare you, there are no creepy and scary moments. Mr. Bone Eater was a funnier creature to me. It could have been much better, but oh well, they didn’t have a big budget. The film can not convince you that you are watching a horror movie, laughs. I would call this film “Time Eater”. I am sure that you will have a lot of good films, etc. To view. Still see if: 1. you have nothing more to watch. 2. You can watch it for free. Rent is not worth it at all.
