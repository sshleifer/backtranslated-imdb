Based on the excellent novel “Observers” by Dina Kunz, this extremely awful film that probably no one should watch. Since the Time of the Running Man, I have not seen a book that has been cut down beyond recognition. The difference, however, is that the film “The Running Man” was still enjoyable, like a funny action movie containing a million phrases. This movie?? No, nothing remotely funny. In fact, if you like a book like me, you will hate that bastard even more. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ** CONTAINS SPOILERS ** Rightio, I mainly tell you the story here, almost in its entirety. What for? Because you, dear reader, also do not need to suffer because of this abomination - this is normal for me, because I like to watch shit. Because I like to complain about shitty things. Now about the unpleasant: this film revolves around the boy and his mother, running away from the government and the mutant soldier-monkey-soldier who escaped from the destroyed state genetic laboratory with a super-intelligent golden retriever, who is called by the “hero” Furface. Moan?? Believe me, in the novel this story shook. I will come back to this later. In any case, the hero is none other than the dreamy boy Corey Heim. Oh, I'm not kidding. Our hero runs, in a hoarse voice and all that, trying to convince his mom to help save this dog from the “evil government” that gave birth to him and made him genetically ultra-intelligent. The monkey creature, backwardly referred to as “Oxcom” (God helps us), is also a genetic stew of a creature created to be the best fighter on the battlefields of the future. Michael Ironside (Total Recall, Starship Troopers always plays badass) is also in this film, and no, I could not understand how someone convinced him that this would be a good idea. He plays a government agent with a FNL hunting a dog and a creature. Oh yes, here is some kind of spoiler: it is also a creation of the government and the same laboratory, and now, most of the film he plays a shot and kills people, and all these killings must be performed by monkeys. soldier. Instead of a terrific, creepy horror movie, we have a rectal hemorrhage from a horror movie. The intelligence of the dog is found too conveniently, and this is much easier to believe than we think, that we can see the clouds, looking outside. Breakdown !! <br /> <br /> Change the book to the film: <br /> <br /> - The main character (Travis) has turned from a man into a boy. <br /> <br /> - A man’s love interest in the book (Nora) now belongs to his mother, and all her depth and character growth has completely disappeared. <br /> <br /> - Lem Johnson, a black man, is now white Mr. Ironside. This is important because the character’s strength was based on his heritage in the book. <br /> <br /> - The relationship between the two authorities is completely ignored, now Lem is killing the guy who was originally his best friend. <br /> <br /> <br /> One principal character in the book is now completely absent, the "immortal" who hunted heroes - perhaps it should be Ironside, but then why is he someone else? <br /> <br /> A dog never gets a decent name for Einstein in a movie. <br /> <br /> No part of the book was published in high school — at least nothing that would have a strong influence on the plot. <br /> - Occurs in a few days, not months, like a book? Unrealistic set up. <br /> <br /> - Cory Chaim's girlfriend appeared in the film in no more than two chapters in a book - and they never met in a book. <br /> <br /> - Lem Johnson's character is no longer cool; instead, he is a complete asshole who intimidates his way through people. <br /> <br /> Hero Travis was part of the Delta Force (military segment specializing in hunting for terrorists), instead his father, who had never been seen in the film, was part of this group. <br /> <br /> - The perceived monster's intelligence is now completely absent. <br /> <br /> - Plots with the participation of the Soviets and The Mob completely dropped out of history. <br /> <br /> - These are just the most unpleasant changes, and those that I could remember by hand (and every other day). <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - In the end, after more than 90 minutes of pain and emotional distress, the film ended. <br /> <br /> It didn't hurt, it didn't help: <br /> <br /> - - Michael Ironside ?? I usually like him. <br /> <br /> - The dog is still pretty cute. <br /> <br /> - Unusual title screen "completely 80s." <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - Ok, the script for one is extremely terrible. <br /> <br /> - The direction is so half that anyone who watches the movie will feel better than anyone. Not involved in this. <br /> <br /> - The game is shitty and weak, especially from Corey Chaim. <br /> <br /> - Weak, weak, vague history. <br /> <br /> <br /> Monster looks just pathetic, that is, when we really allow us to see the bloody thing. His gigantic head, yellow eyes that were part of the book, are visible for no more than two seconds. Instead of a slim, powerful, fast, smart killing machine, they impose a donkey in a disgusting monkey costume. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no character development. <br /> <br /> - Even violence and bloodshed are bad, for God's sake, it must be a horror movie !! Usually violence is at least done well! <br /> <br /> Despicable: <br /> <br /> - The idea that Dean Kunz developed his brilliant novel to become this dirty, damn piece of shit * It dangerously brings me closer to vomiting in me and to all who is near me. There are films that are worse than this (it can cause a headache, as this idea may seem), but for now, at least for me, only Alien vs. Predator is a big parody and a more painful disappointment. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene. Watch the start of titles. <br /> <br /> Acting: 3/10 Storyline: 4/10 (the novel was really good, it's just awful) Atmosphere: 5/10, Cinematography: 4/10 Character development: 1/10 Special effects / Makeup: 4 / 10 Nudity / Sexuality: 0/10 Violence / Grief: 4/10 Music: 5/10 Direction: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br / > Overall: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I would recommend not watching this movie to anyone except for a few extreme horror fans - and only if you haven't read the novel. Instead, I recommend to everyone who is interested in this, avoid it and buy / check / borrow the book. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
