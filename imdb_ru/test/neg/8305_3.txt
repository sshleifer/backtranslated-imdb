Low-budget, but still terrible enough to interest you in a new acquaintance with the history of Frankenstein. This film is also known as Lady Frankenstein. Tempting Tanya Frankenstein (Sarah Bay), who just arrived from medical school, arrives at her fatherâ€™s estate to discover that he is still ready for his old tricks. Baron Frankenstein (Joseph Cotten) is killed by his own creation, and now his daughter decides to continue the family tradition, creating a lover. This is closer to a terrible melodrama than to a horror movie. Cast: Mickey Hargitay, Paul Whiteman, Paul Muller and Herbert Fuchs. A rainy night can enhance the atmosphere. Still fun hours.
