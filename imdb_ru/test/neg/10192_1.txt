Christian propaganda ... Too much fear ... <br /> <br /> This is not SciFi, this is ChriFi (Christian fiction). The film began normally, but abruptly turned right. Since then it has been all about God, JC, the holy Bible and the devil. The UFO is really just a demonic deception to fool people into believing that there is another intelligent life in the universe. The idea of ​​Satan is to make you think that there can be more to life than what the Bible does. <br /> <br /> Abductions can be used to explain ascension. The remaining people would have believed that it was a massive alien abduction, instead of God taking all Christians to heaven. There is no reason to repent if it is aliens. A deeper idea in the film: if you don’t believe in God and you don’t have jc in your life, then you don’t believe in anything and your life has no meaning.
