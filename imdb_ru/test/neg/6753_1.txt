This so-called movie is terrible! Actors cannot act. There is no plot. I believe that they should start from scratch and start shooting again. I hope they can correct the flaws in this film. I would like to see the trailer after they take it off again. Maybe there is hope for it. I'm not going to hurt feelings, but I believe that students can work better. The wardrobe could be much better. Sorry, but this is just not for me. I usually like trailers from this site, but ... this one I can't find interesting. I hope they take criticism well, because I believe that they will get much more from others regarding this film.
