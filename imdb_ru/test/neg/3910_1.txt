To, once, my father made a film with a “neat” cover. Returned home with my mom, and we were like you, let's see this new film, which we have never seen before! .. Okay, so it began ... an interesting beginning, cool robots and disgusting blood on an alien planet (actually it was Pluto, wasn't it?) ... Ballabla, I could tell the whole story, but I rather didn’t specify, WTF NEVER ever take a film with a bad ass name, and seriously, NEVER I mean, EVER judge a book by its cover (erroneous tape ...), it looked like an interesting film, HOWEVER it was a slap in the face Sci-fi movies are disgusting. I mean, it was so bad that I just started laughing (I swear he tried to be serious). I CAN'T DESCRIBE STUPIDITY! It killed more than a million of my brain cells, I can't even write a critical assessment. IT IS BAD! Argand and I will prepare you for something “weird” * KITCHEN KITCHA * mechanical p3n1 $ * KITCHEN KITCH * Sorry, just had to say it, it's so funny, think of it as a comedy or a parody of sci-fi movies. Classic Batman is laughing, but in a new package. What the hell was this director thinking?
