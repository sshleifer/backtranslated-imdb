There are so many holes in the plot that it makes you wonder if they knew that they have an audience for this, and just threw it together. I don't know much about George Zucco, but I saw him in two films. Obviously, he was called a loving father, a mad scientist, a vampire guy. He looks so simple. I am surprised that he was in the genre. This is typical: "I will create monsters that can be used to fight in the army." By transferring wolf blood (or coyote) to a hired hand, he turns him into a werewolf. Glenn Strange, who was one of the successors of Karloff as the monster of Frankenstein, plays a kind, nice hired man, who is persecuted because he trusts the mad doctor. First, the scientist can control when Petro (his name) can be transformed. But, like the Invisible Man, he suddenly begins to change himself and becomes a liability. There is a small love story of a daughter and a reporter with some kind of high voice (Golly Miss Brooks). She wants to leave, but her father, the doctor, will not allow this. He is also led by a group of his peers who scoffed at his research earlier, and now he will be satisfied. The way he plans to embarrass or kill them is rather contrived and largely depends on Peter and the guys sitting around waiting to be attacked. This is not a very good movie. The strength of the forest is the atmosphere when people and monsters hide around the Spanish moss. Again, the townspeople are a bunch of morons who look as if they have escaped from a bad western. One thing that remained with me was that the little girl was the first victim, and this seems unusual for a film of this era. There is also a smoking old lady who knows about werewolves, but nobody listens to her.
