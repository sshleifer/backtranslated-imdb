I will not be too diligent in this show, because I enjoyed the first season, but then everything got worse. This concept is nothing special, just a girl named Casey, who is trying to cope with the new half-brother Derek and his loud, rough family, while she gradually imposes her standards on the princess to each of them. <br /> <In the first season, the story was really interesting. I liked Casey then, because she was smart, strong, independent and conservative. She was raised and deep. I felt bad when her new stepsister pursued her in a new school. She was a perfectionist, but not as annoying as later episodes. Oh, and she met a nice guy who is now portrayed as one of Derek's friends. The season embraced the true tension that the title of the series tried to cover. <br /> <br /> Now I can't say that the show really went bad, because the story is sometimes interesting, but I support Derek now instead of Casey. Now there is almost no interaction between two brothers and sisters. If they interact, it's not for long. Oh, and I don't want to have Dacey fans. People who are called INCEST, even if they are stepbrothers and sisters. My tolerance may go this far, but that's not the point. <br /> <br /> Strange. Derek, as an antagonist, eventually became more sensitive, while Casey, the supposed protagonist, is more neurotic and less likely than before. I love how younger children get more airtime, but parents are even more ignorant than before. But this is not the biggest problem ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we have to see everything from Casey’s point of view, with disgusting, nauseous background music. Over time, it became more stupid and more superficial. In one episode, she cried and wanted her boyfriend to be more chivalrous, so she purposely threw food on herself and blamed Derek. Now, what happened to a strong, independent feminist? I haven't watched much of the fourth season, but I heard that she meets a guy named Truman who is ass and arrogant. Oh, I remember this fencing episode. Does she constantly remind him that he doesn’t like him, goes crazy about the fact that she is hooked by the sword, and eventually hooks him, because she can "cope" with him? What the hell? Why go with such a guy first. In the first season, Casey would just hit him on the head ... never mind. Or maybe it would be my reaction. Oh, and she is a fan. Not that this is bad, but I think she fell on her head during one of her workouts. And in the graduation graduation she cried because she could not find the “dress in her dreams”, and was not fully satisfied until she became the prom queen. One thing I noticed is that, as if Casey didn’t tell us about her life, in the end, she almost always goes her own way (she needs the boyfriend she wants, Derek takes revenge, people all love her, and etc.) Derek is still quite immature, but I see that he has really matured. I don't understand why so many people hate Sally. She seems cute, and it's nice to see Derek in a serious relationship with someone he cares about, not “play on the field.” In addition, he is a little better with Edwin and is a good brother for Marty. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the show is so-so, and I rated it as low, because, despite the character development, the character I once admired now become like any "fashionable teenage queen" that you can see anywhere on tv. But it was good while it lasted.
