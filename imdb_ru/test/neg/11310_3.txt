Only one word can describe MR MAGOO - farce. Unfortunately, this is not a plane. Appearance can decide, and this is exactly what MR MAGOO is doing. Based on an old cartoon, Leslie Nilsson plays Magu, an awkward, almost blind man who stumbles upon a pair of jewel thieves. Now he has to hunt them down using ... blindness mostly. And that's all that film is shooting. Blindness MR MAGOO. Maybe if they had some funny jokes about it, but pretty much it is just one of those “disgusting, stupid grins on your face because you are too ashamed to admit that you paid to watch these " films. <br /> <br /> But MR MAGOO is not as bad as it seems. At the very least, he has some funny jokes, and this is good and useful entertainment for the whole family (Nilson tried to make a “NAKED GUN” for families at MAGOO, but this is not so good). So look once, you can hate it, you can love it, anything. I personally did not hate it, but I certainly did not like it, or even rated it “good.” 2/5 stars for MR MAGOO- <br /> <br /> JOHN ULMER
