Wow. Just wow. Never before have I seen a horror film in which it seemed to me that it was a bad fan fiction that someone wrote once in 20 minutes. And then I accidentally stumbled upon "Lady Frankenstein." This film takes everything you know about Frankenstein and turns it upside down ... and not in a good way. If you watched this movie, you either stumbled upon it on Italian television, or you have a dubbed version of the 50 Chilling Classics Box, like mine, at number 24. And let's just say that there is a reason why these films are here. Because they are not very good. However, enough about this in the film. <br /> <br /> It all starts with the fact that Dr. Frankenstein is trying to create a monster with his assistant, who ... obviously, for some reason is not a gamer. His daughter is a college graduate (?) Appears and states that she has just graduated with medical education, because yes. then there were so many women doctors. Therefore, she states how she wants to help her father with his work, and he says no. And then he makes a monster, and it kills him. Therefore, she grieves for exactly 7 seconds, and then tells the assistant how it was a robber. The monster runs away and becomes enraged. <br /> <br /> Okay, I really can't believe they killed Dr. Frankenstein so early in the film. he dies like ... after 20 minutes and then his daughter takes over. which .... does not make much sense, but sure. <br /> <br /> So, Lady Frankenstein decides that the best way to kill a monster that is now rampaging ... is to do ANOTHER monster! Oh yes, how I love her logic. so her new monster gets a body, killing someone and putting an assistant's brain in it ... I know. just nod and agree with that. So, monsters are found and removed. I like the way the helper asks: "Why don't we just let the monsters kill him?" and she replies: “They don’t know how to kill it!” and in the end he kills him with an ax on the head. haha oh yes, no one else could figure it out. so in the end, the brain switched to a new monster killing Lady Frankenstein. The end. <br /> <br /> This movie was just ... weird. it was serious, as if someone had written a fanfic for insertion. There is no other way to describe this movie. there were also some strange bare scenes. For example, this girl had sex in the park with her boyfriend, the monster picks up the girl, and the guy leaves. haha good guy. Then she struggles a little and dies from ... honestly, I really don't know what she died of. But whatever. This is Lady Frankenstein. It should not make sense. <br /> <br /> In this film there were many such "Why?" moments to the point that I just gave up. Movies should not do this, but for some reason I see it more than I probably should. <br /> <br /> So, the last word is not the worst movie I've seen in this package, but it's a bit boring, full of lots of holes and random things. <br /> <br /> Lady Frankenstein gets 3 scenes from Frankenstein's movie of 10
