In this film, one of the worst main characters. I say this because he is considered a hero when, in my opinion, everything he does in the whole film spoils life for people and creates problems. He can't do anything right, but the movie makes him look like a cool dude that everyone should watch. He has fits of rage at all inappropriate times, he has all the wrong attitudes towards things that ultimately make people angry at him and kill people, he is too curious, too pushy, too courageous, too presumptive all the wrong decisions and no common sense. <br /> <br /> This is a private detective hired by a successful artist to search for a woman and a son, with whom he left many years ago. The detective finds a woman and what he considers her son. However, all sorts of things make this story full of crime, drama and turns. This is for television, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is quite interesting. Johnny Depp is very young in this and he has a terrible 80s haircut. He chews the cud and throws the soccer ball for about 5 minutes, and thatâ€™s all we can see about him. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the print version of VHS sells for $ 40 at online auctions. This should be only for collectors of Johnny Depp. It could not be because of the plot. It can not be. <br /> <br />
