So, I have to start this review, saying that I really expected to see this movie for a few months, I use to watch its trailer and I think it looked really cool ... did I know that the only cool thing about this cliche - Turd was precisely his trailer. <br /> <br /> In the cinema I watched the first 3 frames of this film and, although for myself “by no means this film is not so bad, don't be an idiot, give it a chance! you only saw 3 minutes” while I rolled eyes of shame. All these shots showed ... understand this ... a guy with a poker face (because he doesn’t feel anything ... deeply) is looking directly at the camera in the center of the frame. In the second or third, he is awake in his perfectly made bed (because he sleeps like a dead guy ... because he doesn’t feel anything), and his father calls and says: "John Garden State, it's me, your father." ... Come on! I saw a little more than a couple of clicks to hate clichés, such as “it's me, yours (pick a parent),” how the hell do I have to react ??: “Oh, he has a tough relationship with him” .... e -e ... yes, that's exactly how I should react .... <br /> <br /> Dude, this is a shitty movie ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, during the shooting we will learn something about his friends, each of whom is an ALTERNATIVE EMO WALKING INDI CINEMA. For example, one of his acquaintances is a guy who works in a medieval themed restaurant and speaks Klingon (fancy characters + pop culture = your standard American indie film). Then we recognize Natalie Portman's character, who is a copy of Alyssa Jones (from the movie that kicks ass GS, Chasing Amy), Amelie and that Eternal Sunshine chick ... you know, smart, original (not really), cultural, beautiful and ... in touch with their sexuality (!). She listens to some group of the 70s called The Shins and gives ... what? are they from this damn decade ?? Then why do they sound so ?? Oh, they have no personality, well ..... so she passes her CD player to John Garden State, and he looks at her with a dull face (you know, love). When the song went on, I heard the lyrics: “You will like this soundtrack, it is so alternative and cool that you will like this film, it will identify you and your generation, even if it is an ideological photocopy of The Breakfast Club,“ The World of Ghosts ”and all the others smart films for teens over the past 20 years, you will drink coffee and read books that you do not understand "... <br /> <br /> By now, a really extraordinary jester is starting to happen! ... he doesn’t care if he dies in a plane crash (because he is already dead .... and he doesn’t feel anything), and he lets us know about the idea of ​​the scene, taken directly from an unknown movie called FIGHT CLUB! !!, it's a cool scene, but, oh, did I mention that she appeared in a trailer? ....... then at some party, and only when you think that this guy is very deep and sexless, does he deal with Bimbo ... well, after all, he is not such an emotional zombie .... clever character development or just a crappy movie? ...... well, let's analyze this scene in which he sits motionless Cou ch with everyone else moving at really fast speed ...... the idea of ​​the scene is taken directly from an unknown movie called REQUIEM OF A DREAM! ...... so just sh! tty sh! tty cinema ... <br /> <br /> Then they meet more eccentric (cliche, in fact) characters and, finally, the one who lives next to a big hole in the ground. John Garden State says some shit like "good luck in exploring your endless abyss," and the guy says ... and now I really wanted to strangle myself: "You too" .............. and then we are told softly that Neo is Jesus .... oh, no, wait, this is from another stupid, obvious, repetitive, overpriced and cliche piece of shit. <br /> <br /> Finally (finally !!!!) some more shit happens and he gets into a big fight with the warehouse to defuse the bombs: he has to talk to his father whom he hasn’t seen over the last millions of years, because he (FINALLY COOLING) killed his mother .. (see, he killed his mother, so he, too, is dead ....... and he feels nothing ..... it's deep). Now I really expected just an intelligent and touching dialogue, like a magnolia, between father and son ...... but this is the State Garden, so it’s pretty much like this: - John Garden State: Father, I forgive you, you don’t I don't know what you did when you gave me drugs for millions of years, but I know you love me. Director's dad: No !!! Not !!!! I will say something simple, because in any case I’m not as deep as the whole movie, so no !!!! -John Garden State: No, Dad, we have to get along, because we are equal people ..... I mean different people -Happy Director's Dad: No !!!!! Not !!!! ............ Well, you convinced me. <br /> <br /> And he gets a girl (because he is no longer dead, you know), and the film ends, and I go and eat the piece of chicken that makes my day .... <br /> /> This movie for trailer sucks
