If Halloween 5 was a cruel joke for fans of the series, then Halloween 6 is a cruel insult. The storyline went to the dogs all. Michael is used in this film as a helpless pawn, and he is not at all scary. He reminds me of an overweight person than a boogie who in the original instilled fear in our hearts. In this function, there are almost no redeemed qualities, and I am very glad that the H20 came out, because it would be offensive for fans if this were fresh in our memory. <br /> <br /> In Halloween 6 there were about two aspects that I like. The presence of an adult Tommy Doyle in the film was a nice touch and connected him with the original. Donald Pleasant is here (in his last performance ... what a bad movie to end up with a good career otherwise). When he appears on the screen, he makes you remember the good old days, when Halloween was really scary. <br /> <br /> That's all, my friends. The stalk sequences are unoriginal. One of them is the blatant robbery of the persecution of Lori / Michael in the original. Other characters are terribly written and just do not like. In this film, tortured music, covering the events of Halloween, even if the movie is bad. we get a silly rock version of the topic of stalking / stalking. What did they think when they made this film? <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Their biggest mistake is to kill the character Jamie (now played by another actress who is not worth mentioning) We saw how this character escaped death in two movies. We were rooting for her, and when she is killed in this film, you can't help but feel sorry for her, and you realize that the filmmakers don't care when there are good characters in the film. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILER * <br /> <br /> The less said about embarrassment, the better. I wish this were not. I propose to skip this film, and even 5, and just go straight to the H20, because if you watch it, you might no longer want to watch another Halloween movie.
