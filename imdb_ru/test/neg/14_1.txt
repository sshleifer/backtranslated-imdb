Some may go to such a film, but I, of course, did not. College professor David Norvell unexpectedly gets a yen for adoption. He pretty much picks up the first proposed child, a poor choice named Adam. It turns out that Adam does not have both oars in the water, which almost immediately causes indescribable stress and confusion for Dr. Norwell. This story of sobbing is funny played out with one problem after another, all around which is connected with the inability and seizures of Adam. Why Norvell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor, such as a foster child, was never explained. Along the way, the good doctor managed to attract his wife so that she could share all the hell that the little one was laying out. Personally, I think they both were one beer, with the exception of the sixth package. Circumvent this yawn.
