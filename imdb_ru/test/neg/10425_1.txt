Wired would have to be rated as one of the ten worst films I have ever seen. The screenplay and direction show a tremendous lack of imagination, and I’m sure that most of the actors still cringe when someone mentions this film. <br /> <br /> He does not work either as a tribute to Belushi’s unique talent or as an accurate account of his short life. <br /> <br /> Meaningless confusion without the possibility of redemption.
