Convinced of 7.0 points in IMDb, which is pretty good, I decided to watch this movie. However, I found this film quiet and boring (about 2 hours) and full of clich√©s, the Little girl who received many personalities after being injured in childhood, etc. The tamer Karadagli is quietly amusing in this film, in dialogues, etc., You will have to watch him, he is like a cool cop, whom you see in American films, perhaps he copied too much. I would call this film an ordinary American thriller with a slight Turkish accent. Unfortunately, once again, I am convinced that comedies and dramas are the only genres worth watching in Turkish cinema. In any case, I put this film on 4, it is too boring and full. cliche
