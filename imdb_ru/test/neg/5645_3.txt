The growth of tax funds and sale and leaseback schemes has led to the emergence of a variety of non-traded films that collect dust in laboratories and storage facilities throughout the British Isle, because they seem to be made solely because they meet financial criteria, and have not had any potential lecture hall. A few lucky people get a week on a small screen in London before heading to a budget DVD, but The Riddle distinguished themselves by completely going around the movie, television or even the rental market to act as a free DVD gift for Mail for the first time on Sunday. <Br /> <br /> It is too easy to understand why it was literally given away. Apart from a few glitches (the boom microphone is clearly visible in one frame), it is not very badly made, and although Vinnie Jones fits like a modern version of the British cinema "Freddie Mills Mills" as a greyhound reporter who wants to get closer to the crime desk and the supporting roll deviates from the ham to a vaguely passable, no one stands out here, being either exceptionally good or extremely bad: mediocrity is more the norm here. The real problem is that, like many films of the tax fund with the sale and leaseback, this is a “soft” film - there’s nothing to watch it for. It exists, because there are circumstances for its creation, but it lacks pace or progress. It seems that it is aimed at the audience of the Sunday TV set (despite the fact that it is filmed in Scope), but does not reduce it. There is a couple of good ideas in this resolutely harmless story about the unpublished manuscript of Charles Dickens and several suspicious deaths in modern Limehouse, but the mysterious element is so painfully obvious - just like the last-minute supernatural twist (you I never guess who is really literate the tramp Jacobi. What, you guessed it?) - that you almost expect the Scooby Brigade or Double Decker to come to solve it. <br /> <br /> This is a very erroneous movie. for various reasons: several actors play double roles when they don’t even have to play one role, and all the shock revealing the truth of Dickens’s manuscript is completely flawed because it is all told in the first person Dickens rather than the intended character of the novel. The main murder in the film is clumsily integrated into the main plot, the characters suddenly remind Vinnie that he already forgot about it, foreshadowing the increasingly desperate last half hour when he sees the secretary of the evil developer Jason Fleming put Rohypnol in the Vinnie drink so that she can let her he leads an unholy lifestyle with him and leaves behind him incriminating photos, “so that you look disgusting with your girlfriend,” which brings him to a dream, where he talks to Charles Dickens (“You are Charles Dykings” - “What name? )), Which offers slightly less probable assumption that "you've read too many books." But all this is nothing compared to the finale, which falls into complete absurdity, with logic and common sense, completely out of the window, because it plays like some kind of strange Jacobin tragedy of revenge with pistols on the banks of the Thames with two-day guest stars Fleming and Vanessa Redgrave look as if they preferred to be somewhere else (Mel Smith appears in a one-day cameo role, so it’s clear that the film’s “names” are mostly there for a mere 10 thousand dollars or for child support payments). only absurd and pointless, which is almost worth it to see it. <br /> <br /> One curiosity - a rather prominent role in the first third for Vera Day, a kind of prototype Liz Fraser and the former pillar of British films of the 50s - barmaid at Hell Drivers, barmaid at Quatermass II - is promoted to owner the pub, while comedian Kenny Lynch appears briefly to give a better idea as the gangster of the old school. Oh, and the late Gareth Hunt makes his last bow as oh, irony of fate, as a coroner ... <br /> <br /> As a supplement to the package, the free-record DVD also contains a trailer for another movie directed by Vinnie Jones , Bog Bodies, cheeky British horror with transatlantic scientists and Vinnie dressed as duck hunter Elmer Fadd, terrorized by a revived 2000-year-old sacrificial victim from a nearby peat bog ("Be careful, fragrance: I'm hunting" dwuids "). I can't wait .. . <br /> <br /> The only thing I can guarantee is that About every indie producer in the UK is going to spend the next few weeks trying to figure out exactly how much Mail paid for the DVD printing license (they paid the Prince £ 250,000 for his new CD.) With so many UK tax shelters, on the shelf and with the money that is so hard to find at the moment, it can be an interesting reserve market for British films.
