Part of the low rating of the film is the emphasis on unemployment and the suffering that we must endure. Although this is good for drama, in the comedy we know that pain does not need to be emphasized. As a result, “Fun with Dick and Jane” does not fit, and I was just disappointed that I could not have fun with Dick and Jane. It is true that this is a copy of a movie with the same name, but it is not executed during the performance, and the title is not suitable for the storyline. <br /> <br /> However, if the film was renamed “The Art of Theft” and the emphasis on awkward comedies with farces reflect the robbery more, the plans of theft (foolishly, of course) will give the film a significant impetus. Although at the same time, the film should show that the CEO, at least at first, was a fraud, so it would be easier to project the pain on the responsible person at an early stage and just leave it at that. The film suffers from a point of view problem, and with this in mind, comedy cannot work if the point of view is not done properly. The intriguing character of her husband, similar to the character Wile E. Coyote on Road Runner, would be more fun, including the comedy of farce. But in this case, to steal instead of catching a bird with complex tricks, it would be very funny here. I mean, you can make many of them and put them in a movie. But since the point of view was done wrong, part of the robbery should have been limited. <br /> <br /> You’ll enjoy the film for the first 15 minutes (during Jim Carrey’s big rise), but to solve the problems they had to face to be more comical, as this is a comedy, this is the part that needs in overhaul. It can be funnier if during the crash the problems were faced with the John Travolta Civil Claim. This film was serious, but the problems they encountered were somewhat ridiculous.
