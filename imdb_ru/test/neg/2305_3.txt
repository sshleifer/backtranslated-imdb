Jacqueline Suzanne wrote several novels, all of which were devoted to sex and melodrama, and some of them were actually turned into films, including this effort, and they all had the title of one of the worst films ever made. The story here is about Robin Stone (John Phillip Lowe) and his elevation to the top of television, being ruthless and calculating for everyone around him. He is the worst playboy who uses and then throws out every bed woman, including the wife of the president of the IBC network. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER WARNING ***** Greg Austin (Robert Ryan) is responsible for the IBC television company, and when his younger wife Judith looks at Robin, she doesn’t waste time lying down with him in bed. Greg got sick and needed some rest, and then Robin intervened and began to try to launch the network, but during all this, the model in love with him Amanda (Jody Wexler) kills herself. When Greg returns to work, he tries to get rid of Robin, using the moral clause in his contract, when rumors about his relationship with Jerry Nelson (David Hemmings), who is a gay photographer, begin to spread. <br /> <br /> This is directed by Jack Haley, Jr., who later became a very successful producer on both television and film, but it was only his second film as a director, and the material with which he was forced to have case seems over his head! The script is taken from Susanna’s novel, and probably that’s why it’s like a cross between Alfie and Dolls ’Valley, and I think the reason why her books could never be well translated into a film is because the filmmakers made a terrible mistake of taking her stories seriously, and not tongue on the cheek. In this confusion, which arises because of this, is unintentional, especially during this completely ridiculous battle near the end of the film, which begins when Cannon refuses to give a slave bracelet to gay heroes! Hemmings was a very good actor, but his role here is completely unmatched, so he wears one of the worst beards in history and uses the term “chic” in every other sentence. Lo was not the first choice for the title role, but another actor who was cast was in a serious accident, and Lo entered and staged one of the more wooden performances on this side of Miles O'Keeffe. The film's script suffers in two different areas: it is completely stupid and terribly boring, and it will test the audience’s patience if they want to watch it. One has to wonder what the result will be if the director decides to remove one of Susanna’s novels, and not take him seriously, because the attempt here is cumbersome and ridiculous.
