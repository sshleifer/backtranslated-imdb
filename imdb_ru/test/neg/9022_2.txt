This is probably Wayne's worst movie; at least the poorest one in which he played the main role. This is just incredibly bad. Editing is especially awful; it really seems that the editor (if there was one) literally took pieces of film from the floor and glued them together. The opening must be seen to be believed. John Wayne must have cringed every time it was mentioned! I know that there are films "B" - but are there any films "H"? If so, this is an example. And I say this as a devoted fan of JW.
