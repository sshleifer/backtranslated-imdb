I read without exception Baroness Orcaâ€™s books The Scarlet Pimpernel. Considering this, I saw 3 pimpernel films. I really liked the one with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews. He tries his best to violence and actions, sometimes completely breaking the spirit of the book. I do not expect films to stick directly to the plot, I have long ceased to be such an idealist, but if a great film from the book has already been made, do not redo it with a television film that includes great actors and beautiful costumes, but a barely decent script. Adhering to the 80s version .... Run
