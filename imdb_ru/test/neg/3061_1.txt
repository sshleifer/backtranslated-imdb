Is this film as bad as some claim? In my opinion, yes, it is. I was not going to comment, noting that quite a lot of comments had already been made, from “terrible” to not very bad ... ”. However, I can not resist. <br /> <br /> What are you doing from the movie that is on the DVD cover. the phrase "real story" Ma Barker and her boys ...
