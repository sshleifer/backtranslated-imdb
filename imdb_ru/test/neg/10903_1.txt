I won't spoil it for you. Although you probably would not care if he was spoiled (you will understand what I mean after watching it) B-rating of the quality of the film. Typical horrors - stupid situations - rarely. I need to know when they are trying to push a lot of advertising in their ads or even add "quotes". Just tells me that the film is being bombed for a great time. And they are trying to get everyone involved so that they can match the cost of making this bomb. I would like to take the time I spent watching it. I was stupid and thought that there must be something great around the corner. But they let me down all the time. I usually do not spend time adding comments to any movie. This is actually my second post. I just felt that I could save some of you from wasting money on something that had a lot of hype.
