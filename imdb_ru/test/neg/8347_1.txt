The story of a volcanic eruption in downtown Los Angeles sounds like a good plot for a movie about a catastrophe. This one, however, missed a great time. The film looks chaotic, it has a storyline that is hard to believe or believe, and the acting was very bad. <br /> <br /> I agree with a lot of comments that Lee Jones is good at leading people as Chief in a particular area. In this he heads the emergency department. Being the head of such an office is naturally a good idea to lead your daughter into dangerous scenes. Clever thinking. Anne Heche touches the walls and walks in the tunnels, suggesting that the temperature is 678 degrees Fahrenheit. Yeah, right. Besides the bad play, these factual mistakes make the movie almost as stupid as Armageddon. The only good moment of this film is that there is no Ben Affleck, which aggravated the situation even more. Avoid this movie at all costs.
