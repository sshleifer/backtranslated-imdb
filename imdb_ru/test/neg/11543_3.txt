“Death Panther 2”, filmed in the Philippines, is a boring fighter of the early 90s who sees a reckless cop who hunts evil criminals who killed his wife. This film looks quite cheap and has almost no artistic merit. It depends on the quality and quantity of its actions. But while there is no shortage of fistfights, shootouts and explosions, the quality is simply absent. Endless battles are desperately lacking originality or excitement, with poor editing and worldly guidance making this film a real routine to sit. <br /> <br /> Usually the impressive Yukari Oshima is completely wasted, with its natural athletic abilities shaded by some painfully poor wiring. Ballistic fighters are not an impressive mix of heroes of “slow flight in the air and during shooting”, crazy tricks with vehicles and endless bad guys lining up. <br /> <br /> There are so many of the best examples of the girls and pistols genre that are now available on DVD, I advise you to leave it alone (if, like me, you can’t stand almost any old nonsense to be complete ).
