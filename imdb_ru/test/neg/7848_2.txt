This should be one of the worst movies of MGM and FRANK SINATRAS. A strange musical comedy that fails in almost all aspects. A stupid plot forces Sinatra to maintain his father's reputation as a kissing thug. He is not a gangster and does not kiss !! He plays a "know-it-all" just as one would expect, given the dialogue that he should speak. Scene theft - by J. Carroll Nash and Millred Netwick. Too bad they didn't have more scenes together. I gave the film two stars, because the scenery and costumes are excellent, and one of the songs sung by CATTREN GRAYSON "Love is where you find it," is sensational. Might have a repeat of this. In addition, a comic-style dance number from RIDCARDO MANTALBAN, CYD CHARISSE and ANN MILLER, if fun. So for this and only for these reasons it is watchable. KISSING BANDIT is part of the collection of Frank Sinatra's early years.
