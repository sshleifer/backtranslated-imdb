I watched this movie for the first time the other day and I was bored to tears. Probably, I was just looking for memories of a wonderful series that I remember. I watched the Mod Squad TV show religiously and it was fantastic. It was filled with action, and the relationship that 3 had with Greer was adorable. There was nothing like that here. When Greer was killed, you have the idea that these three could care less. The actor who portrayed Pete is a really good actor, but they wrote his role as if he were mentally retarded. Pete on the television series was quiet and serious, but he also had a funny side. They had this guy who behaved as if he was either taking drugs at the time, drunk or just ignorant. I would not recommend this film at all. Especially if you were a fan of the show. It will be a complete disappointment.
