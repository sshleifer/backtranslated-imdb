During the eight-year period of the 1980s, when Charles Bronson shot nine films, one company released only one film, apart from the Cannon Group: “The Evil that People Do”, the pick-up of TriStar Films from ITC Entertainment by Sir Lew Grade. Bronson was already in the midst of his collaboration with director J. Lee Thompson, who worked in numerous actors up to Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects in 1989. <br /> <br /> Expectations should be quite high, since Bronson and Thompson are working on a better funded outfit, such as ITC, but “The Evil That Man Do” is a big disappointment on many levels. “Evil” is still from a small budget film from the 1980s, but it has great potential for making a great movie. Everyone in the production department, however, went the easy way and sold hacker works, without deserving Bronson’s imprint. "The Evil That Men Do" had a concept and technical resources that could be used to create one of the best films of Bronson and Thompson, but instead it would be ranked among the most average. <br /> <br /> in 1984 The political thriller / action movie begins in brutal form with the British doctor Clement Molloch (Joseph Maher), who holds special lessons for political leaders in Suriname. A grizzled, passive Mollokh is an expert on torture methods used by numerous political regimes. In the first seven minutes, we see how Molloh uses electric current to inflict unbearable pain on Jorge Humberto Robles, a dissident journalist. As you can expect, the scene is terrible to watch and was cut from the original VHS release. <br /> <br /> Hidalgo was none other than a friend of Holland (Bronson), an assassin who enjoys life in the Cayman Islands. Journalists turned to Holland years before, in order to save humanity from Mollock, but rejected the proposal. Shortly after Hidalgo’s death, a Mexican professor named Hector Lomelin (Jose Ferrer) arrives to persuade Holland to finish the job, bringing video recordings of the testimony of the victims of the Doctor. First denying that Holland finally agrees to the dirty work aimed at Mollok and his beloved sister Claire (Antoinette Bauer) in Guatemala. <br /> <br /> Holland enters Guatemala with the help of adviser Max Ortiz (Rene). Enriquez); he pretends to be a tourist with widow Hidalgo Rihan (Teresa Saldana) and young daughter Sarah (Amanda Nicole Thomas) in tow. Like most of Bronson’s later work, his character knocks down Mollock’s minions by crossing paths with the sloppy American diplomat (John Glover) and his fellow killer (Roger Kadney) along the way. The cruel finale takes place in the crevices of the opal mine, where the Doctor receives only deserts from several of his victims. <br /> <br /> “The Evil that People Do” is based on the forgotten novel by R. Lance Hill and leaps on American political relations in Latin America during the 1980s. Indeed, “Evil” is hard-boiled in every sense of the term, because it uses sensation and doses of cruelty to hide the huge flaws in the development of the plot and character. For each plus of this film, there are three or four minuses resulting from wrought craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> Although “The Evil That People Do” has a great concept, the film is never more than Bronson’s excuse to destroy foreign scum. In the style of bad reading, "Evil" is filled with cardboard characters that we will never know and will not understand. Holland, despite the fact that Bronson plays him strongly, never speaks about his inner feelings or explains what prompted him to become a murderer for hire. Riana, the terribly weak part for Theresa Saldana, is disgusted most of the way with Holland, but later she loves him. Where did her love come from, especially after Holland looked at how several people killed several people and wanted to go home just a few scenes earlier? <br /> <br /> The most interesting characters are actually Molloh and his sister Claire, because many questions may ask them. Naturally, we will never know what brought them so close to each other, how and where their torture began, what is the exact role of Claire in their business? These holes in the plot can go on forever, especially with the story line coloring by numbers, which seems like everything goes along the way. Why did the daughter of Hidalgo find herself in such a dangerous situation, except that she was conveniently taken hostage by Molloch? If Mollock's bodyguard Randolph (Raymond Saint-Jacques) clearly saw Holland and Ryan in the cockfight arena, why is he so friendly with them in the afterwords of the bar? Is his memory so short? And what was really the goal, apart from cheap theater, in that Holland dropped the driver of Mallock Cillero (Jorge Luke) from the ledge on the window when the murder could be considered more carefully in Claire’s apartment? <br /> <br /> On the whole, acting skills are decent and for some reason Bronson gives one of his strongest performances. The direction of J. Lee Thompson is missing at some points, but may be compromised by limited time in place. In addition to filming “Evil” in Mexico, the presence of ITC was made evident by better products, cinematography and music. Rural areas are well used to convey the hot and dusty atmosphere of Latin America, and filmmaker Xavier Cruise provides rich color and clarity. Ken Thorn's orchestral score ('Murphy's War') is refreshing in the era of synthesized garbage. Oddly enough, these positives only exacerbate the disappointment in a good movie that screams out. Editing Peter Lee Thompson is better than usual, although with more ridiculous succession errors. <br /> <br /> “The Evil Than Men Do” was the ideal material for the mill in the early 80s, and I find it difficult to recommend it for 21st century fans. The Columbia TriStar Entertainment DVD is a good presentation, offering a widescreen and standard format with subtitles in four languages. Although the video quality is much higher than average, originally “Evil” was recorded in normal monaural audio. A theatrical trailer is offered and actually has a greenhouse feel, with a blurry color and fuzzy sound quality. <br /> <br /> ** of 4
