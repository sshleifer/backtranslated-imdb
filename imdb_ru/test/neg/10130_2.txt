This is what Disney Channel shows children who are dumber than messages. It suits them well. It's not funny, acting is the worst thing I've seen in many years, there are more stereotypes than actors, and everything in this show makes you moan and roll your eyes. Want to know why? Not only is this show a waste of airtime, the leading “actress” Selena Gomez looks like a pig. The character Jake T. Austin needs a little Ritalin. The character of David Henry must visit a strip club and get lost. In addition, the author of the show is controversial. In one episode, the guard is called “sir” by one character and is referred to as a woman by everyone else. <br /> <br /> Hello? This is called proofreading and editing. Do it sometime, Disney. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen the commercial for the new “bloody saga of four parts”? Disney wanted to have its own version of Twilight vs. Harry Potter. Except a million times lamer. The film "Wizards of Waverly Place" Think about it for a minute. The family goes on vacation, and the 16-year-old daughter wants independence from her parents. SAME PLOT from the movie “Proud Family”, etc ... <br /> <br /> What's worse, it's all Emmy and ALMA. And most of the audience is people aged 4 to 13 years (and without teenagers). how many more years? before Selena Gomez shows her boobs? <br /> <br /> and Disney shows - all this crap ... writers hacking ... hacking shows ... destroying minds and wallets of modern youth
