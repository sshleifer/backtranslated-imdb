Bad dialogue, slow history, scenes that stretch and are absolutely meaningless. I can not believe that so much money was invested in such a poorly written film. The director and actors could not save this bomb. <br /> <br /> 50% of the film, and you're still waiting for it to begin. They lay the foundation with an introductory preface, and then spend the next 40 minutes without setting anything up. You are watching 40-minute shots that are absolutely useless in trying to do something, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie is like watching a really bad French film, where nothing happens, and the characters are just boring, lifeless and self-centered, living without purpose or care. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. Anyone who recommends this is disappointing to you, and you will undoubtedly question their taste and depth.
