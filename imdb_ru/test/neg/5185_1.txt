What makes this movie damn bad? Is this a humorous humorous humor? Could this be terrible "fashionable" music sucks? Perhaps the boring story has not gone anywhere? Or maybe even the fact that the Traci Lords demonstrates his worst acting qualities and adds insults to injury keeps all his clothes throughout this smoking sandwich with poop. Regardless of the reason why this film sucks, the fact remains that it really is REALLY. I never wanted to be able to watch a movie with Dean Cameron, not what I watched in my life, but “Ski School” is a masterpiece of comic genius compared to this parody. <br /> <br /> My Rating: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nicole Nesbitt, Buffy Tyler and Suzanne Stokes all use their Tupperware tits <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand
