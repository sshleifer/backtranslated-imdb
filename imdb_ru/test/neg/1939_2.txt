VIVA LA BAM This film "The Donkey" tells about the (apparently scripted) adventures of Bam Marger and his friends (Johnny Knoxville, Brandon Dicamillo, etc.). This show, although it has its own amazing comedy and insane stunts, is devoted mainly to the torture of Bam by his parents. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say this, Bam, but ... you are by no means as cool as you think. This show, caused by egoism, is not only terribly unfunny (and yes, I liked Jakass), but also incredibly narcissistic. An overly stylized intro ends with Bam coolly explaining what he is going to do “whatever he wants.” How about doing something really funny? I liked Donkey because it was worth it. The filming was terrible - any idiot could have done better with a video camera in his parents' garage - but at least the show was moving at a constant speed, and he was never bored between crazy, dangerous or just disgusting tricks that his friends performed. . <br /> <br /> This is not the case with "Viva La Bam". We follow our hero when he plays his friends and tortures his relatives, but it never seems to be anything but a really lame and screenwriting comedy. Tricks and practical jokes are a bit interesting, but presented so boring and boring that they can hardly make you smile. <br /> <br /> Viva la Bam is a bad result, of which there is little use, but Feed Margera is already too big an ego. I don't recommend this flimsy and inappropriate show to anyone.
