Now I like Bollywood films, and I am very glad that they have recently achieved success in the UK. However, Syunil Darshan’s latest work is a deeply flawed film from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a modern Bollywood look at Amadeus was quite exciting, until two supposed “musicians” appeared on the scene as if they had never touched a piece of the manuscript in their lives. Upen Patel is a very good looking man, and the film plays in his narcissistic feelings, but he was never as believable as modern Mozart. In terms of action, all he can do is stand there and sulk. His facial expression, hair and clothes look the same everywhere, including the scene where he allegedly “dies,” although in fact he seems to have nothing but a slight mockery. Bobby Deol, who plays the role of Salieri, is trying hard to revive the little wooden script, but, alas, he just looks a little bit angry when he thinks he is jealous. <br /> <br /> Bollywood films are widely known for their stunning scenery and color schemes, but Shaklaka looks like a monotonous dramatic reproduction of the BBC. In fact, the closest thing Shakalaka comes to is Hollioks, since she clearly hides a really bad scenario behind beautiful people who look, well, beautiful. “He has not yet reached mediocrity,” the same can be said about completely forgetful songs. <br /> <br /> In short, Darshan’s last sentence has no booms, no hits, no noise, no noise. Instead, he just wanders along with his head held high in the hope of getting your attention by gently tapping on the shoulder. And this is not good enough at all.
