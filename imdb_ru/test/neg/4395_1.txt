Useless movie. A complete waste of time and nothing I expected. Packaging creates the impression that it belongs to the genre of the American pie (it is not). rather, it is a ridiculous sequence of coincidences that makes the film more like a writing exercise (let's try to see how many confusions we can write to turn what should have been a bad SNL password into a full-featured presentation). What is remarkable is that directors (based on their comments on the DVD) take themselves seriously. I was a big fan of the films with which National Lampoon gives its name, right down to Van Wilder. With this, I feel completely deceived. In fact, I feel cheated. I expected Van Wilder to outlast my student years as a farce, but instead I was served with an hour and a half rubbish. What led to my ultimately unmet expectations? Well, for starters, the fact that all the actors look naked (with a huge sausage covering what needs to be covered) on the DVD cover. Add to this the images on the back of the case, as well as the description, and you will mislead people into thinking that this is a film, not one. To make matters worse, the film begins, as one would expect, with half-naked drunk students who are weakly trying to take a picture, but in the end this has nothing to do with the film. In fact, I didn’t even realize that the people in that introductory sequence where the characters of the film should be until I was told by the directors in the commentary. Don't get me wrong, I like plot twists and surprises from films, but I hate the fact that this film is trying to lay itself down as something it is not. Ultimately, this in itself does a huge disservice (artistically, although, most likely, not financially), because it sets up its audience for confusion and disappointment simply because it neglects what it advertises. <br /> <br /> In short, it’s not worth renting this film, depending on what you see in reality. This is no ordinary film about the National Lamphun. The only thing that is funny about this is that many of the actors have appeared in other films and TV shows, which makes their participation here fascinating.
