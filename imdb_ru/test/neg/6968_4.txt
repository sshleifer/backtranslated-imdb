I just recently watched Ed Wood, Jr.'s autobiographical film Glen or Glenda, having first heard about this for many years. Nothing I read or heard about this film could prepare me for what I saw. It must be the weirdest movie ever made. Dirty bison, women in captivity, prancing Satan and Bela Lugosi, wandering as much as they can: “Bevar, Bevar ... pull the string, pull the string ...” it was completely insane The game was terrible, and the dialogue was unintentionally fun, exactly what you would expect from an Ed Wood movie. Having said all this, no matter how horrific this film may be, I must pay tribute to Voodoo ... he was well ahead of his time. You have to remember that when this film was made, transvestites were not even discussed in public, much less the theme of the film. I read that Wood was a transvestite in real life, and I am sure that this film is based on his own experience. It was sad to see that Bela Lugosi spoke the ridiculous lines he had to say for this film, but it was a kind of Ed Wood Jr. at least to give Mr. Lugosi an acting job while was penniless. and an addict, and no one in Hollywood will hire him. If you've never seen this movie, you should watch it, especially if you're a fan of Ed Wood Jr.
