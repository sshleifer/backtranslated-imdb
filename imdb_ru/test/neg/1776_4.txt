I starred in the role of Eugene Morris Jerome in my school adaptation of the play, and this film is definitely not in line with Neil Simonâ€™s script or imagination. I know this play back and forth, and I can honestly tell you that the acting was off. The production was fun. Changes to the play script were made poorly. If you want to truly enjoy this play, you should see the real play, not the adaptation of a Hollywood film. The hero Eugene did not have a soul, and he was too sarcastic in everything he said. Other characters were also not key. A total disappointment, dirty, disloyal to the play, performed in an amateur way!
