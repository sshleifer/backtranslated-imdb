I am very disappointed because I expected a real trip, as promised in many reviews. The script is very bad, with a lot of holes and direction. The director could not fully develop every scene of violence with thrills and uncertainty. He tries hard to follow the thriller of the imitator. Therefore, I had to watch how each bullet was spent, without giving me any meaning. I always asked what movie I was watching. Then I did not like that she aggressively smoked one cigarette after another, but perhaps the film was partially supported by the tobacco industry. The end is also very disappointing. I can't understand how Jodie Foster could have been nominated for a Golden Globe in this worst role in her life. Jody, so I really liked PANIC ROOM or FLIGHT PLAN. This is definitely one of the worst I've ever seen. 4/10.
