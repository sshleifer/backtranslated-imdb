I have to watch shit like this, to the end, to see if there are any justifiable qualities that can be justified by including it in my clients video library. Do not watch it, even a minute, if someone does not have a gun to the head. Like me, you will moan and moan at least 500 times and pray that one of the one-dimensional characters played by really bad actors will turn around and shoot you. <br /> <br /> Even if you are the biggest Sandra Bullock fan in the world, you shouldnâ€™t even watch two or three short scenes in which she appears. <br /> <br /> I want to kick ass for dirty marketers who put a huge picture of Sandra on the front side of this DVD box, and they are jailed for robbing me or something. I would very much like to have the opportunity to read a review of this film before I bought it. <br /> <br /> Please call me and I will pay you 10 dollars to immediately remove this film from my inventory before it appears. stinks the whole place! (kidding - please don't call)
