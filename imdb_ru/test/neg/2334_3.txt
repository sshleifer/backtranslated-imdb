How long will we insist on this erroneous belief that, as soon as the director does a great, pioneering work, all future work "cannot be so bad, after all, he did this and that." <Br /> <br /> Mulholland Drive is a good example, and in fact it is useless rubbish. The performances are excellent, especially from Watts and Theroux, but they don't necessarily make a good movie. What Lynch has obviously forgotten is that simply making the film unnecessarily strange only works when it catches the audience off guard. When viewers expect the film to not make sense, then the film must have some substance to interest the audience. Lynch does well in the first half of the film, with a murder mystery created with lots of turns and red herrings, and then ... a slap! The story plunges into a swamp of strange hallucinations and meaningless segments. Metinx Lynch realized how intricate the film is becoming, and threw it into lesbian and mastobator scenes to awaken viewers and prevent male viewers from getting up and leaving. <br /> <br /> Watching the film on the previews, I was surrounded by Lynchofil, who had no idea what was going on, but left the theater, commenting on the “layers and layers” of Lynch’s film production. Sorry, but these people are the same fools who stand in art galleries, staring at white-painted canvases, commenting on the “artist’s courage to paint such a bold work”. <br /> <br /> Such films are made because (a) Lynch sells his previous work; and (b) because people convince themselves that an implacable film is an art, and therefore must be good. I questioned a number of lynchophiles about what they really liked about the film, and the only answer I received was that the answer was not a wide "layer" that was what they liked when "the chicks shot their kit." <Br /> <br /> Nuff said.
