It was the worst television movie I've ever seen. The visual effects were so damn jerky that I felt dizzy. I hated the constant increase and decrease in scale and the frequent switching between black and white and color modes. I also thought that “History” does not make any sense, and it was another clichéd action movie with a hero, a bad guy and a few hostages. I could have made the film better than on my own camera, why? I can keep it steady, something the director could not do. Because of all that really is the worst thing I've ever seen, did you think Disney was bad? I didn’t even bother to watch it all, because I’m sure I could guess the result, and the visual effects were the worst I’ve ever seen.
