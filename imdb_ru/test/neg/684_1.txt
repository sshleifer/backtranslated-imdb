This film is really bad. I love to show TV while sleeping, and this film looked like it would be something good to sleep, and boy, I was wrong. My body literally woke me up from a dream and said: "Hey ... this film is terrible ... you have to watch it." I love bad movies with bad actors and stupid stories. Something about an unintended comedy makes me move. This movie is impressively crappy. I really do not know how to express it correctly, except to recommend that you watch it, just to see how bad it is. I mean, seriously, you have to watch this with people. In this film, I joked out loud with the best jokes, and there was nobody to hear them. <br /> <br /> Worse than Swimming. This is so bad.
