Oh dude, they knew exactly how to make them then. Hollywood has forgotten the main components of making bad films: cardboard steel and the God-fearing action hero! <br /> <br /> This film was so close to the masterpiece, but, alas, this did not happen, because there were no ray guns and invaders from the moon. The MST3K version attempted to fix this by adding a pilot show called “Captain Cody”, where the guy in the rocket jacket is struggling with the bad make-up artists from the moon, but this did not quite add up. br /> In addition, the comments of the guys in the theater were not as funny as I expected. In general, a big disappointment.
