Steven Seagal's career in cinema is a tribute to a terrible movie. I was tragically bored with each of them, as soon as I realized that they were even more unreal than Jean-Claude Van Damme. Has anyone else noticed that they never beat him ?! I mean, give me something to support ... a tough battle with a bad guy who's scary. TWENTY YEARS, and he still shoots the same fighting scenes. Battle scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero can not act. The boring choreography of Segal's film puts his painful lack of acting skills in dramatic relief. Worse, he is terribly out of shape. Just what we need, a fat man who THINKS that he is the leading man. In all these films, there is not a single iota to redeem the cinematic value. DO NOT watch this unless you want to lose an hour and a half of your life.
