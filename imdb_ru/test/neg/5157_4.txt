The “nest” is actually just another “terrible course of nature” that fails due to low budget. Acting is fine, and the setting is great, but somehow the whole movie seemed a little boring to me. The effects of blood are not the best that I have seen, but they are funny. Cockroaches themselves are common cockroaches that bite humans. The nest reminded me of a much better movie called Slugs. If you like The Nest, then Slugs are a must see, as it is ten times better. It is also worth noting that Lisa Langlois, who plays Elizabeth, starred in another film like “Escape from Nature” called “Deadly Eyes” (aka “Rats”), which tells about killer rats, you guessed it. <br /> <br /> If you like horror movies of this type, then you might want to give them a watch, but you will be much better able to see slugs, which is much more interesting and bloodier.
