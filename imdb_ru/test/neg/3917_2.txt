Dennis Hopper must have been very hungry to make this film. Brutal special effects, very bad writing, stupid dialogue, stupid looking killer biorobots. Never mind the blatant disregard for science. An awkward scene with two young presenters taking off their clothes. The best part of this movie is cyber penis with a push to start with a broken pirate cyborg captain. 2 out of 10 stars, because I have a good mood.
