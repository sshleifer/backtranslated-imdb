In the video "Joyride" it says "second-generation superstars in the lead role," and no one can not feel sad. Of course, Melanie Griffith took up big and better things ... but who cares about the rest of the cast? So, being a pathetic burglar of attention on the box, I was so stupid as to buy a film for a dollar, thinking that I would end up in the country of “films that are so bad, they are good 70s”. Oh, not so much. While so many goalless 70s youth films (or just 70s films on this subject) struggled to say something deep and meaningful, Joyrid is not even trying. This is just aimless. He is deprived of any interest. Each character is so poorly thought out that it is not surprising that these actors look so sluggish. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the film tells of three twenty-year-olds who travel to Alaska to start a business, but instead they are robbed and then have to find a job. They are beaten, they eat dog food, they steal cars, rob banks. This is all very typical, but in addition, it is performed in the most mundane way. There are no surprises, and the flow is so bad, and the actions of the characters are so ambiguous that you can skip a few scenes and not think at all. <br /> <br /> But if you're a fan of Melanie Griffith's chest, then you definitely need to see it. This is still not enough to get this rating above the lowest rating I can give. <br /> <br /> The best line: "Jesus, everything is in biology with you." * outside ****
