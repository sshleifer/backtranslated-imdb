As a true movie lover, I must advise you to avoid these terrible efforts. God knows how the funding was approved. Seriously, this is one cinematic experience that brings zero dramatic tension and entertains, while nothing happens again and again and again the connection - these are two fears that, at least, will not let you fall asleep. Perhaps this is the worst movie I have ever seen, and the actions of the main woman border on criminal intentions. One blessing with modern technology, you can rewind it forward and watch it 12 times, and it will only last 25 minutes, And you will not miss a single plot. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know how people find it interesting at all, and some people give him high marks!
