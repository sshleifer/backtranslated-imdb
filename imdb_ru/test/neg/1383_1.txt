The slogan of this show is: “He expresses his opinion. We hire additional lawyers. ” If you look back in time, then any classic comedian has never been proud to be controversial. Richard Pryor’s slogan was "I am rude, racist and defiant." This is basically how Comedy Central advertises this show - in your opinion, not on the PC and “honestly” - but how can a television show be proud of that? Where is humility and humility? And what suddenly made Carlos Mencius such a huge figure for Comedy Central? Let's start from the very beginning - Dave Chappelle cancels his show (which has become NECESSARY popular and controversial), and Comedy Central is looking for someone new to push it. They hire this guy named Ned, who claims to be Mexican, although this is not true. They spray his face on several commercials and create the impression that they are “daring”, exposing him to the public. <br /> <br /> I have seen many hated topics on the forums about this. the show, and I disagree with the "Mencia" detractors. This is not a terrible show. Several times I cried with laughter. When it's funny, it's very, very funny. Yes, he is a minor, but just like Chappel. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlos is that he uses a lot of the same material over and over. And he is too obvious. Rejected open marketing: "Carlos" spoke so many times that I lost count. He is trying to make it the next known line (for example, “I'm Rick James, b ****!”), But this is too obvious. <br /> <br /> In terms of repetition, Carlos uses many of the same jokes over and over again. For example, in one episode, he said that he would have liked it if all Mexicans had disappeared from America overnight. He woke up and the American guy said: "Room service!" in a southern accent. <br /> <br /> He used the same joke - literally - when he appeared as a guest on the Adam Carolla talk show. The second time it was much less ridiculous, because he seemed more desperate. <br /> <br /> Is Carlos funny? I think so. There are a few outrageous moments in his show. But he pays too much attention to TRY to be controversial, and not just go with the flow and allow his comedy to develop naturally. The repetition of silly little catchy phrases over and over in combination with dull faces and loud vocal cries really gets old very quickly ... I just hope that Carlos - or his authors - can give a new advantage to this show, because now it is starting to dwindle in the repeating hell
