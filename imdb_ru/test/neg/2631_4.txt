I accidentally caught this supposed horror movie late on Friday, I would like to go to bed! Tell me ... Is 3 feet in a raincoat, wearing a raincoat, on a bicycle for a gurlan, should cause some kind of fear? Not here, but Mi-Lowe is still able to knock the crap out of the janitor (Antonio Fargas), which is three times his (?) Yeah. And the finale is so pathetic ... it just leaves you alone, and you have nothing to go! I caught myself asking, “Is that so?” <br /> <br /> Acting is about as good as in a film with a low budget. The aforementioned Fargas provides decent performance; but I concluded that Jennifer Yostin is perhaps one of the worst actresses ever to perform in Tinsel Town! Of course, sweet face, but plays poorly. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
