When I was 13 or so, I was lucky enough to find this film. It was part of an endless Danish series of really stupid things. This, however, was the cheapest I've ever owned - but I think I sold it, very badly. Well, what to write ... Better than "Manos: hands of fate" and worse than "Critters 4". But it is definitely worth an hour and a half since it was done by people who wanted to do it. The action is not so terrible compared to several other cracks of the eighties - in fact, I seem to be like an old man, although he didnâ€™t look like an Indian to me. But I think you can't have everything ... Do yourself a favor and see ...
