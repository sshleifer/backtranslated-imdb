When the first shot - the American marines, seriously not respecting the flag of the United States, the film has a difficult road ahead, but, unfortunately, from there it went downhill. A military adviser was enrolled, who apparently also is a retired US Marine, which further perplexes that this incredible violation of the protocol and the law went unnoticed. Even more puzzling is how they just keep silent about how the marine are informed about KIA, and then they are buried in a very short order, without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body, or whether the body was even. The US government is still missing during the Second World War, and it takes months to identify the remains. Those killed by servicemen remain in the Ministry of Internal Affairs for months or years, and are declared to the KIA only when the remains have been identified, or after several years of bureaucracy. Here we must believe that this will happen in a few days or weeks. Maybe it happens in Denmark, but not in the USA. Obviously, none of the people involved had any relation to the US military or respect for them. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are a number of other ludicrous moments when characters come out of nowhere. There must have been really long meetings between the author and the actors when they tried their best to find their motivation for such a thing. Perhaps a working script would help, but this one seems to have been compiled in place, working with Cliffs Notes. There is no way to know if the script was so horrible at the beginning, or if it was the author, or the middle-level guys in the studio who are responsible. In any case, this is a terrible film that should never have been made.
