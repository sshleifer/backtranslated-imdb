Iâ€™ve just looked at UbuWeb for this early experimental short film directed by William Vance and Orson Welles. Yes, you read that right, Orson Welles! Years before he became famous for the War of the Worlds broadcast and his debut film, Citizen Kane, Wells was 19 years old; he only found his muse. In addition to Vance and Wells, the other player here was Virginia Nicholson, who will become Orson's first wife. She plays a woman who sits on something that swings back and forth thanks to the courtesy of an African-American servant (Paul Edgerton with a black face). During this time, the man (Wells) continues to pass by her (the courtesy of the scene is constantly repeated). I will not reveal any more, except how to say how interesting the silent images were as they constantly jump. This does not mean that it was good, but it was interesting to observe even with a guitar score (Larry Morotta), added to the imprint of 2005, which I watched. It is necessary to look for enthusiasts of Wells and everyone who has avant-garde taste.
