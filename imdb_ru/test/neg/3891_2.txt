Wonderful music. Beautiful photography, some scenes exciting and impressive. But the dramatic tension is lost in a badly edited film, so itâ€™s hard to understand exactly what is happening. At times the dialogue is incomprehensible. Then there is Richard Gere. He must be a factory worker who gets into trouble and gets a job on the farm. We see dozens of sweaty and dirty peasants in the hot sun. Then we see Gere, similar to the fact that he just walked away from Calvin Klein's commercials. Sam Shepard, another glamorous guy, must be fatally ill. But he looks great. Nice try, but it just doesn't work. Brooke Adams tries his best, but she is lost in the scenery. The real star is a girl.
