I liked most of this movie. As mentioned in other reviews, he has a good composition, the plot is quite interesting. In general, it is interesting to watch. <br /> <br /> But I think that the ending is completely unfortunate, it left me at a loss. Yes, you expect people to intersect and intersect with each other in this film, but four-time intersection? Well, if this is justified by the plot, then why not? <br /> <br /> But this is the worst, there is no need for it. After a certain point, all this intrigue without any sense. (here comes SPOILER). After the scene at the airport, Enrico and his associates already have money. I could not understand the need for the rest of the fraud. Should I just rub Federico's nose because he was fooled? I do not buy it. <br /> <br /> So 6 out of 10 for 3/4 of a film and 2 out of 10 for the final.
