Warning: this could ruin your movie. Look, see if you agree. <br /> <br /> To think that we, as humans, cannot learn from the past. The futuristic society portrayed the fascination of what Hitler believed, the destruction of a race of people (in this case, men) for the benefit of society. I was sick to the stomach. Also the plausibility of the Y-bomb is insane. Even in war our self-preservation instinct will prevent the extinction of humanity. We made mistakes in the past, that is: Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 45, but because of this we avoided a bigger mistake in 63 during the Cuban missile crisis
