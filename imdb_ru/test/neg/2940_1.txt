Stay away from this ... No, really, I seriously - I know you might think that this is a fun, agile, fun Hong Kong-style thriller B. I did, but believe me, it is not. In fact, the only thing that is accurate in this description is the words "Hong Kong", and then they are used only in a strictly geographical sense. <br /> <br /> Yes, Donnie Yen co-authored this. Jackie Chan has a cameo. The guy Ekin Cheng from Storm Riders plays the main role. He has vampires. It should be good - or at least fun, charming and rich. Once again - this is not the case. <br /> <br /> I could take a break from why this movie sucks - I could make it out, break it into small, quivering pieces. But where to start? I hate so much ... <br /> <br /> To simplify it and give some credibility to this hate festival, let me say that I am usually a big fan of the Hog Kong movie. Heavier dramatic things, as well as more frivolous action films and / or comedies. Really good films, and also really stupid. I can sit for hours with bad subtitles, jokes are enough to make first graders roll their eyes. I can treat lovers as chaste and unmarried as the convention of nuns, and, like almost everything else, the average cinematographer will rush around with metaphorical fingers between the sequences of actions. In addition, Hong Kong or any other origin - I like it when the film turns from just bad to bad enough to be good. <br /> <br /> But this is Arrgh! It's just awful, stupid, invisible trash. So far from being funny or charming, it really hurts. The resulting action film Bergman looks like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. <br /> <br /> Why ?! Why waste such an opportunity ?! It could be so much fun!
