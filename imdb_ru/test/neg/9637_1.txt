After watching Stop-Loss, I feel disappointed in Hollywood for having made such a stench. Gone are the days of the glory of the films of the 1940s, which made him proud that he is an American, fighting evil that craves for conquest abroad and death at home. What we have left is a frothy drop in the mouths of rabid anti-Bush radicals. The story tells about three young people who are returning home from the war. Man descends into uncontrollable madness, the culmination of which is his death. The main character leaves his country during the war and at the same time destroys the relations of his best friends with his fiancé. The third is really the hero of this story, deciding to continue the struggle, which was brought to our shores almost eight years ago. What makes this film bad is not an acting game, but a premise. We tend to think that decorated soldiers are actually haters of our country. During the war, desertion is like treason, and the main character flirts with her throughout the film. This paradox is intended to weaken the audience’s reaction to the central act of the film. We do not have to find fault with King because he wears medals, but his actions not only deserve it, but also demand it. He is not an antihero. To accept the film, viewers must accept the correctness of desertion, because the story portrays King as a hero. I can't accept it because it's like asking me to call the sky yellow on a clear blue day. In addition, scoffs at the real hero, a man who re-recruits and continues to serve his country. I would recommend this abomination only to those who need to be convinced of the breakup of Hollywood, as this is a prime example of this. Not surprisingly, at the box office things went bad.
