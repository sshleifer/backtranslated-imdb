I work on the Classics 50 horror film collection, and THE MAD MONSTER is one of the films in the set. <br /> <br /> I'm sure George Zucco was a good actor; but it was only the second film in which I saw him, the first film “Walking Men”, in which he played two roles. However, even a good acting game could not save THE MAD MONSTER. <br /> <br /> Zucco plays a mad scientist, Dr. Cameron (who was banned in academic circles because of his unethical and inhuman experiments). He believes that he can control the evolution, bringing the characteristics of one animal to another. <br /> <br /> In this case, as in many other similar cases, it is a transfusion (I guess) of wolf blood into humans. His goal is to create an invincible army that he can control with an antidote. The subject of his experiments is his hired hand, a backward gardener, whose dialogue slows this classic with snails almost to a standstill. <br /> <br /> In addition to his experiments, Dr. Cameron also plans to take revenge on those who have discredited him using his transformed gardener. However, he loses control of his object, which begins to transform without transfusion - yikes! <br /> <br /> Werewolf transformations are classic Hollywood stop-action / makeup effects. No doubt these were the revolutionary methods of the time; but in today's digital era it's hard to imagine the audience being scared by this.
