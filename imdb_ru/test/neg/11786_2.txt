Only a very small child could ignore the absurdities in this bomb; The first difficulty faced by the submarine "Sea View", is that what seems like pieces of rock? falls through the water and crashes into its hull. But this is not rock, they are under the North Pole - this is ICE! All, except perhaps the previously mentioned small children (and even some of them) know that ICE is swimming. <br /> <br /> Then a catastrophe happens - this damned VAN ALLEN belt lights up around the Earth! We are told that no one knows how this happened, and this is understandable, because the radiation cannot “catch fire” at all, and even if it could, there is no air in the air that burns. <br /> When creating a film, there is literally no valid reason to lose sight of the scientific concepts that are fundamental to second-grade school textbooks; however, Irving Allen manages to do it all over again; perhaps we should focus on “people,” and this is fairly easy, since they are CARDBOARD. <br /> <br /> The cast tries very hard not to look embarrassed in this ridiculous bustle with young children, as the later episodes of his show Lost in Space, the concept of which was immediately stolen by the writer Ib Melchior, and then put into production. <br /> <br /> The subwoofer looks pretty good, which is why this one gets a "2".
