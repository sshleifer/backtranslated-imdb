The problem with this — and with all the films about the Vietnam War — is that they are too biased. Anti-war films overlook the fact that the vast majority of US soldiers were heroes, while anti-war films overlook the fact that many soldiers actually committed atrocities like the one in this film. This movie sucks. The time has come for a film that is neither military, nor anti-war, nor liberal, nor conservative, but FULLY ANNOUNCED.
