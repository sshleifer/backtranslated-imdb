Boring drama with Pat O'Brien starring as the washed reporter who appears in his former boss's house to ask for money to finance his sonâ€™s operation, only to find him dead on the floor. Since O'Brien knows the identity of the criminal, he offers to take rap in exchange for the money he needs. A decent premise is wasted on a film that pretends there are surprises, twists and turns in it, although in reality it is not. The performances are rotten in all directions, the film is dressed like a hard-boiled American noir, but the mixture of quirky accents does not work, and the story is hardly exciting. And it contains, perhaps the least attractive on-screen kiss for all time.
