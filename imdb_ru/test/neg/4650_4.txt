This is fun for Z-class movie fans. Here you will find that you write and play badly enough to compete with anything Ed Wood has ever created. A veteran bad film actor Cameron Mitchell - a former make-up artist from "Paragon Studios", who after an unpleasant incident with acid in the face at a secular meeting becomes embittered. Secret Lab, conveniently located in the local wax museum. Or are they zombies who carry out his orders? He is not sure. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, many of your favorite movie clich√©s are here. Check out the villain's lab! Are these mysterious smoking vats of liquid? Test tubes with colored water without explanation? Hooray! And what, we see spare arms and legs, arranged as if on a wooden rack? Still would! Marvel at the awkward detectives acting right from Plan Nine! Now enjoy the stupidly tamed car chase and hear more dizzying shouts than you might want. Raise the eyebrow on a winding storyline, made even more opaque by a completely pointless ending, which does not seem to be related to the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> A trashy joke and a lot of fun for a bad movie lover.
