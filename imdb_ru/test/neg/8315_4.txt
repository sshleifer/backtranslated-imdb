Hello everyone, Oh, Boy ... This is Lulu. He has really bad background music when he can be squeezed in. There are three bad guys who, I think, are the stars of it. They beat people, smash people and smash trucks and bulldozers into people. Ordinary things. <br /> <br /> A woman who sends them on a mission cannot move her mouth when she speaks. This is like watching a bad ventriloquist who is her own doll. She walks as if she is balancing an egg on her head. <br /> <br /> A wardrobe is a 70s leisure style for men and a bla for a woman who should be a good nurse. A woman's bad procaineum wears red. Perhaps a silk dress, or maybe just a windbreaker of poplin, which is too large. <br /> <br /> I really liked the final, although it didnâ€™t make much sense. This allows us to understand what happened earlier in the film. <br /> <br /> Police are fine. Some bad, some good, all stupid, except two. Two bright could work again in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film begins quite interesting and ends with a surprise. The middle sucks. The guy at the diner who gives a free hamburger to a star does a good job. He looks like a character from the 1940s. Great voice. <br /> <br /> This voice is too long. A lady with marble balls in her mouth could have just a couple of lines, and a parrot could tell about the rest. A bird would be easier to understand. <br /> <br /> A trained woodpecker could have made her sword scene. <br /> <br /> tom willett
