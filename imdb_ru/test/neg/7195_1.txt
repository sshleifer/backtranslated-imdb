This was found on the DVD my friend bought me. They called it The Savage Guns, which was a completely different movie. Obviously, the people who pack DVDs never bothered to look at what they recorded on the disc. <br /> <br /> In any case, this film is as bad as it appeared. The soundtrack is a combination of TV Batman / Early James Bond / Spaghetti Western. Jumps around this music a lot. It seems that the guy has to jump between scenes in order to burn for a while and let the guys from the audio track do something. <br /> <br /> English is dubbed Italian, and it really shows. I wish everything was a little worse, and then it would look a little indecent, like Ed Wood's films. How terrible it is.
