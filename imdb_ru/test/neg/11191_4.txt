Some films you will watch because they touch your soul or challenge you at a growing pace. <br /> <br /> Some of you will be watching because you want to experience adventure or shock beyond your experience; they will not feed you directly, but they will help you find yourself in a wider world than you could. And in the end, the difficult moments of life are that you have decided not to accept. <br /> <br /> And then there are films that do neither the one nor the other, which you will watch because of commitments or because you have a need for a historical context. This is a rather useless experience in terms of building life. <br /> <br /> Of course, the problem is that often you don’t know which of the three films will be in the film. You can get some directions from people you trust, but since the life in the film is so personal, you really won't know until you go on a blind date. <br /> <br /> For me, it was pretty useless. Yes, yes, I know that for many Bunuel is the embodiment of the sublime and the rich. And you should know (if you don’t) that among my greatest impressions of the film are some very strange films, really very strange ones. <br /> <br /> The point is not that it is not cinematic or symbolically deep, or apolitical / politically friendly to how I think. This is how he gets there, what is outside the base. I am annoyed by the deviation from the real deviation. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is that this is a successful alternative art, which means that it is a successful commercial art. Which, in turn, means that it can be simply explained, and this explanation is not only widely acceptable, but simply coded. Of course, all this is true. <br /> <br /> When the term surreal is used, it is usually used incorrectly to refer to any film or world that is different from reality or seems strange. But when it is used correctly, that is, in accordance with the theory of consensus, it always revolves around Buñuel, in particular, this film and the one that he sincerely did with Dali. Since they invented surreal cinema, they define and control this term. This in itself annoys me, and I have my own alternative definition, which does not come from their philosophy. <br /> <br /> This is because philosophy is completely opposite. This is not a philosophy at all, but a rejection of philosophy, an anti-order. It is a packaged anarchy that carefully selects the things they use and the things they oppose, without clearly differentiating them. <br /> <br /> So good: against linearity, against narration, against history, against religion (simple), against deliberate love But for a linear linear narration, to create your own story (glorified by countless film school professors; what else can they do ?) for a kind of transcendent "random" love. <br /> <br /> This is her own enemy. If Bunuel was alive today when he sold his image, the first thing he would do was attack the church or the surrealists. <br /> <br /> My regular readers know that in almost all cinematic matters I pay attention to Spanish and avoid French. But as for surrealism, I would like you to consider the opposite: get your surrealism from Alfred Jarry and not from Bunuel. <br /> <br /> Ted's score - 2 of 3: contains some interesting elements.
