This film tells the story of John Belushi, based on his biography of "Wired", written by Bob Woodward. The entire film is told in memories without chronological order, where, after the death of John Belushi, we see one angel accompanying Belushi for several points in the image of John Belushi rather believable, but completely devoid of destructive power of Belushi, and his play remains only a pale animation. The director, moreover, does not succeed in continuing the story, that for those who do not know, the book is very confused. But the worst thing is that they showed Bob Woodward, who spoke with Belushi before his death. Because of these negative moments, the film is only a potential attempt to tell the controversial story of John Belushi. My rating is 4.
