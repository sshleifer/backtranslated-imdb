I sat down after 2 hours of pure boredom. I am looking at IMDB here, although it is not at the top of the list, but also in the top 250. I was a little surprised. Although yes. I am very impressed with the acting ability of Robin and Matt, they still have not saved the film. I'm not sure that I really disliked the film. Maybe it's because I neglect math. Maybe I'm not too much bored to talk for 2 hours. Although I loved "American Beauty", but that was all. I just want 2 hours ago. It was a big waste of my time. If I missed something in this movie, please email me. I'm curious why this is in the top 250. And don't say "because it was a good movie." <br /> <br /> 2/10
