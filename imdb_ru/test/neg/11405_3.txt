You can usually ask two questions about low-cost horror films from the 80s. and this "Demon of the Wind" in particular. 1. Is this a good movie? No .. 2. Is this a funny movie? You bet! “Demon of the Wind” is a terrible dirty and sickening story, filled with cheesy makeup effects and cruel violence. The story is largely non-existent and includes a group of young people who reveal the terrible secrets of one of the ancestors of the group. Apparently, his grandfather and grandmother used to live in the area where they worshiped the devil, and evil (in the form of demons and fog) still lives there. But I have to pass it on to this film. From beginning to end, he breathes soreness! Devil shades, playful blood and (relatively) decent action - all together make this film rise high above the mainstream, boring slasher of the 80s. This shows some creativity and courage (in the literal sense), when other productions of this decade more easily fall into routine and oblivion. These creators were clearly inspired by the success of the Evil Dead, and perhaps even the "Demons" of Lamberto Bava, but what the hell! It is fun and made with great enthusiasm. Although this film does have a fairly high "at times" - sometimes the standard. Especially towards the end, when memories and laser shows are happily mixed. And what the hell is this story about those two imitator wizards? However, `Demon Wind 'gets my recommendations if your likes aren't too high for shit horror!
