This is the most pitiful excuse for a comedy show I've ever seen. I'm confused that this guy was given his own show. He smells of complete and total despair from the central comedy, trying to fill the void left by the talented and incomparable Dave Chapelle. He is a clue from the bag of Ned's comedic gold: is it not a funny zest? Need to give this an extra boost to the fun? F *** ING YELL IT at the top of your lungs. Simply no? And as an added bonus .... finish half of your jokes with ... THEN YOU BEGIN !! or DUH-DU-DUUUUHHHHH! Oh man. So funny. Biner ... funny. Wetback .... does laughter ever stop? <br /> <br /> To illustrate my point more clearly, I will give an example. Mencia jokes about how “backward” is the restoration of the new Orleans, because he is so close to the water. Genius. The distinction between the great comedian and the hack has never been so clear. While a good comedian will find hidden humor in the tragedy, finding subtle ways to entice a joke into something we can all laugh at and comfort, Ned seeks the obvious. Move the city. Fine. Wait, is this funny? Ned does not have the intellectual ability to find the deepest meaning of things. The hurricane did not flood the city, weeks. The dam project was underfunded and badly in need of federal dollars ... and lo! They broke down. I think this is God's way of telling us that we should not be there. In the end, he got a place in congress. What a fool. <br /> <br /> Chapelle knew how to twist a weary racial comedy on his head. He was effortless, and in all respects we laughed with him. While mencia says that black people cannot swim * yawn, * Chapelle rose 300 yards with a black and blind white supremacist. You don't have to be scary to get nervous. You must be original. <br /> <br /> Mencia and his legions of fans are like this hidden funny guy who laughs too harshly at funny jokes, thinking it somehow disguises his own insecurity. Except, of course, with Ned, he too emphatically laughs at the "mentally retarded." Du duuuuh.
