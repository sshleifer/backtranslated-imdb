I donâ€™t care if this show is supposed to convey deep messages about human existence. <br /> <br /> Shows are crap ... how can anyone enjoy watching them? Yet it was received so well. This reflects the sad state of affairs for Joe Moron. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch this program when it first came out when friends talked about it. The mad laughter of the two main characters and the pitiful dialogue made me cry. <br /> <br /> People can't believe this show. Nevertheless, I think that the creators laughed at the last ... making themselves rich, taking people from those who would watch such a show. <br /> <br /> I would argue that they are laughing. down to the bank.
