Stay away from this movie. Long away. Stars Phil Fondcaro in the role of the insane leader Freakshow. All performances are flat and insensible, except for the foundation of the car. The plot is simple and repeats almost every possible cliche of horror films. A group of schoolchildren goes to the carnival, arranges rides and looks into their heads. <br /> <br /> Fred Olena Ray’s fans should be warned, this is not like his other films. This is lacking in all departments (humor, sex, horror, etc.), except F.O. Ray's films are excellent. <br /> <br /> The version I saw also contained documentaries in which the director makes comments like “We had a limited budget” and “with our limited time”, which says a lot as much as Charles Band cared about this movie. Instead, rent a "Droid Runner" (Fred Olen Ray) or "The Dead Hate the Living" (Full Moon). The full moon should be ashamed of itself (and this says a lot after watching “The Eyes of the Killer”) <br /> <br /> Rating: D-
