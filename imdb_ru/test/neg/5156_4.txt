In this film, cockroaches are super killers that feed on flesh. Perhaps it was the first film where cockroaches were the main killers, although not the first film where cockroaches are killers. In the Alley of Curses there was a scene with cockroach killers, and in Kripshaw there was a story in which they were. In this they are the star. Not as good as it could be, there are not so many murders. However, I could be wrong in this matter, because I have not seen this for a long time. Cockroaches became killers, and this very strange research lady in the city to study them. Yes, she is rather strange, because at some point she put her hand in the drawer on the roach-killer, and she like “They bite my hand,” and she says this almost in a state of ecstasy. There is also one very big roach at the end of this one, as in many insect films. Not a very good movie, but worth watching that night when you're bored.
