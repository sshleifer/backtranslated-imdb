I went to see this movie to kill time. I remember Cole Hauser in Tigerland, and although his acting is wooden, he does portray a tough "leader." Same. This film was about a bunch of young, hot scientists and divers exploring a cave in Romania that you need to dive in to see. The initial scene was very interesting, with a handful of Romanian or Russian men exploring the cave in search of prey. Fast forward to 30 years ago, and we have a team of divers, called by some scientist and his team, to explore some kind of cave for unknown scientific purposes. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of clichés, useless conversations. Women are too hot for their work, let's face it. I hate to watch these women talk about guys who drink beer at a cave exploration party. I mean, as if we were in a bar with a type of brotherhood and female communication, talking about the opposite field, and not about a group of scientists and divers. Each character had a zero personality, with the exception of perhaps a scientist who, at least, was not one of the young and beautiful people. Thus, the acting, although professional, did not inspire. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was pretty bad. Once in the film, Cole Hauser ("Jack"), the lead diver - his irises are transformed into a Cingular wireless symbol and remain so. We tend to believe that since he was scratched by one of these monsters, he turns into one of them. Fair But above all, no one tells him the obvious thing: "What happened to your EYES, man ??" Not. Everyone just talked about how he “changed” and that he should no longer be the leader of the group. And then this guy says: "You see that he is not a MAN." BUT? If they really believed he was a damn monster, why not do it? Instead, the group falls into two parts: those who go with Jack, and those who go different ways, I think, thinking that he is a monster. It makes no sense. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the film is a blonde female diver who crawls along a cave wall and is attacked by a goblin. Her cry really sucked - but she struggled with the goblin. <br /> <br /> The photo was all right when the camera was still there. But any sequence of actions, the director found it useful to confuse us into hell, flashing bubbles, flashlights, dark space, God knows what. I wish they would show us the scene right from time to time. The fact that you move the camera everywhere does not make the film more intimidating, guys. <br /> <br /> This movie could be much better if the following changes were made: <br /> <br /> 1. Each actor was replaced by someone who looked real. Let Cole Hauser be the lead, ok, let him be beautiful. I am tired of meeting with 20 supermodel scientists. Give me a break, people! <br /> <br /> 2. The cinematographer was dismissed and replaced by one who simply pointed at the camera and sat motionless. This may be a director's mistake, I do not know. The jumping camera (as in the Constant Gardener) is aging, guys. <br /> <br /> 3. We saw that goblins really devour humans. What about blood? There is nothing else in this movie. We barely saw the creatures - I felt a little deprived of it. <br /> <br /> 4. The ending was pretty lame. During the denouement, the sexy British scientist has a secret ... guess what? It is a bit canned. The ending would have been better if they all died instead of the Black Guy (Morris Chestnut), who seemed to have breathed a little sympathy into his character just because of restless expressions. All other actors had no expression. <br /> <br /> I gave him 4 out of 10, because in the end, the acting was without noticeable mistakes, and the concept was rather original. I would like to see that Cole performs more military roles - he is good at it.
