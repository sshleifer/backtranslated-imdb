if you like banal films and want to see something that you donâ€™t need to pay close attention, you may be worth seeing. The story itself is very unreal. the dialogue is also not very believable. it is doubtful that you will find yourself in any of these characters, because none of them are very cute. the action could have been much worse. Victoria Pratt is noticeably out of place with the rest of the cast, as she seems to have a lot of potential and talent as an actress. while it does not say much, it is one of the best acting acts that I have seen from Tori spelling. she seems to be recovering with age. In general, this extremely melodramatic film is mediocre at best.
