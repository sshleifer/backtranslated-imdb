Do all fake movies require sheer stupidity and the absence of any intelligence for humor? Is there at least one really funny parody film? All I see are zero-quality films that look as if one pair of high school students once missed a video camera. These films are not funny, they are not smart, they are not entertaining, they are simply useless in all possible ways. <br /> <br /> “Returns” is a film in which they tried to hide their disgusting level of garbage. without calling yourself "Sporting Cinema". This is the same though. There are several different authors for these films, some of them were written by Wyana, others by Freudberg and Seltzer, and I am sure that there is one more pair. I can't even tell the difference in direction or humor, to be honest, it all seems that the very same people wrote and sent them. I can’t tell if the “Returns” were the ones who made the “Scary Film”, or the guys who made the “Epic Film”, or someone else, these are just jokes from everyone else. <br /> <br /> If you have ANY taste or value for humor, do not watch this movie. If you have a self-image, do not worry about it. If you have ANY respect for making movies, don't even consider watching it. I don’t see it in any broken, abandoned theater that can still carry it, not rent it out, not order it at Netflix or Pay-Per-View, not redirect it and not even watch it for free on OD. Avoid this like the plague. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can see this film is as follows. <br /> <br /> A. Masochism. If you love to torture yourself, there are several better ways. B. Seeing a vivid example of why ANYTHING in which Fox Atomic is written should be avoided. C. You are paid significantly larger amounts of money. <br /> <br /> I really would not have watched it all, if someone had offered me $ 100 for it. This is just a meaningless mental torment. <br /> <br /> You can watch Zohan with the same success.
