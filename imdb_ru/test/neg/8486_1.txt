This film is a real shame, not only for the plot, the empty game of characters, but also because of the lack of creativity on the part of the director and the entire film crew, this is probably one of the worst films of all time, and it is hard to believe that this is a continuation of one of the most famous films of the 90s. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m a big fan of Masks, when I went to see this movie, I expected to see a movie with a good sense of humor, a movie with an acceptable plot, but instead I saw a really bad copy of the cartoons of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery, the film was not even funny for my 7-year-old sister, so I wonder: what happened to New Line Cinema He tried to repeat the success of the first film or tried to create another masterpiece, such as "The Lord of the Rings"? Because if they did, they were completely insane.
