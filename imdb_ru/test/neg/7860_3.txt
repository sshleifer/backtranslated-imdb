Although you can recommend a lot about Maetel Legend both in the concept and in the finished product, in the end this is a bad movie. A wise plot is a retelling of Matel’s early life, which is usually unclear; At the same time, writers take the opportunity to tell the story of the Empire of Machines. And since Leiji Matsumoto is having problems, apart from his other works, we get a starting point for her sister Emeraldas, her mother: the Queen La Metal and a small amount of the Galactic Express 999, to specify the film. <br /> <br /> In short, Maetel is a princess on the planet La Metalle, a planet with an irregular orbit, which means that her cycle around the nearest Sun reaches the cold stage, and its artificial Sun dies. The planet is getting colder throughout history, which increases the sense of doom. To protect her subjects and family, the queen decides that mechanization is the only way to ensure the survival of the La Metal people. Log in to Lord Hardgear, a robot / cyborg that provides the means to work. In the film, the heroes are left to ask questions of mechanization, will they still be human? Can you trust Hardgear? Will the soul and the heart? So for a fan of Matsumoto's creativity there are a lot of interesting things, questions that need to be answered, themes continue, with the exception that it is obvious that the film should be introductory, as well as the curiosity of the fans. Negatives, primarily animation, while the Galaxy Express 999, a television series more than 20 years ago, have a scanty mouth animation and sometimes sketchy character design, Maetel Legend has all the worst features of modern animation and thus gives the impression of respectability to the Galaxy Express 999. The design is well developed, but, unfortunately, the animation has suffered, leaving well-drawn characters that “slide”, as in the background moves or scaling the camera, a quick way to animate. However, few, but a few well-animated scenes are used again and again in dream episodes, repetitions, and additional scenes. Anyone who sees the movie will wonder how many times Lord Hardgeir can drink the same glass of wine. <br /> <br /> Next story. Although in principle everything sounds great, the finished product is actually a series of conversations about the Plot, which repeats over and over with a slight effect, the number of times that the characters face the same problems and learn the same things are almost offensive to the audience. and characters that seem much more distinct in previous incarnations. Add to this some horrible character design that seems lifeless, overly exaggerated, and the audience remains with the film, so that the missed processing could be rewritten as well as another film, at least the newcomers will not remain puzzled. <br /> <br /> And yet, he does have his moments, the final is at least amazing. The plight of the inhabitants of La Metal was very touching and rightly disturbing; I believe that this whole theme of “man-machine” is grieving. It’s hard to know who to recommend Maetel Legend, since it’s not very well animated, written or executed, plus it is confusing when Leiji Matsumoto compulsory cross-reference is introduced. However, I cannot help but clarify when the magnificent entrance to Three-Nine takes place, now it is a good cinema. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars out of 5, 2 if you are a fan.
