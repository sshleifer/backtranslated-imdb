We spotted this VHS, which is hard to find, after seeing two great photos from the “Trade Ivory” series. Knowing that it was an instant failure of box office, a failure as a rental, I thought that in any case it is worth seeing, based on the reputation of M-I. Very bad! Nine years ago, the goal of the Liberal Agenda was to destroy the founding fathers, and they did achieve some success in eradicating the founding fathers in many American classrooms, including, for example, New Jersey; whose destruction of our great founders quickly ended when the Washington Times shed light on the truth in the New Jersey school board and their subversion. A small part of this was the headliner of Sally Hemmings' alleged connection with Thomas Jefferson, ignoring the inconvenient DNA finds that did not support the agenda of the foolish left. Nevermind! They forced James Ellis, the author of a dubious reputation, to put it in a book, and Columbia University made a deal, giving Ellis Pulitzer. <br /> <br /> Regarding Jefferson in Paris, the spin on the Liberal Agenda begins in the opening scene in which James Earl Jones claims to be the son of Jefferson. Rotation just continues in memory mode to Paris. The unmistakable truth is that even if a person assumes that the lie is true, the Hemmings indictment would have little detail on the wider issue of Jefferson’s long and vital diplomatic mission to Paris (and the Netherlands). when our young nation was without means). <br /> <br /> In addition to “Liberal Scrolling”, there is nothing more interesting in this boring and painfully boring movie. Some other story is really accurate - adding credibility to fake a lie - but this film takes one of the most interesting moments in American history and turns it into a remedy for insomnia. <br /> <br /> Please do not ask me why the liberals intended to destroy the founding fathers, because I do not spend time explaining the actions of such people. Do not ask them either; they usually answer such questions with the same answer: “CLOSE!”
