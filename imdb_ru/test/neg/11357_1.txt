If you want to spend a small part of your life, sit in front of this predictable zombie movie. It fails in the first post without being scary OR funny. This is a boring gray film that I think immediately went to the video. Hammy and tongue in the cheeks leave a sour taste in the mouth. If you want to watch a poor, but still watchable film about zombies, see The Diaries of the Dead. Bad special effects, school-level script. Zombie films work if they have a moral or political point of view. In this film, there is nothing, it is not worth it to emphasize the zombies. This is just as entertaining and convincing as the Republican Convention, and itâ€™s not a shame to watch the Republican Convention, which will be the best example of a film about zombies.
