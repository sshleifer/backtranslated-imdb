If you describe any of the scenes; the nightmares of children killing you in a dream, your infant daughter is talking to ghosts, looking for your lost child in an abandoned mine at night, so petrified with fear that you cannot move, even if the blood from the murder victim drops on you from the floor above ?? then I would say that you had a horror movie. But something like “Evil Little Things” was just not scary. I am a fan of horror, and I liked the place, the plot in principle, and I liked the three leading ladies. I didn’t want them to hurt, I wanted the “bad guy” to get their desserts only, the rest of the actors are always just cannon fodder, so I didn’t care about them anyway, and it played every cliche in the book - even batteries of the torch, discharged in pitch darkness, as soon as you begin to whisper voices approaching you. <br /> <br /> I still recommend that you watch it, but if you're not new to horror films or under 12 years old, you've already seen it all before.
