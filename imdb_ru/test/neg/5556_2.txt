Well, I've seen Hershall's Gordon Lewis films before, but this one really takes the cake, its really awful and rude, not to mention the disgusting behavior of the strippers, I'm talking about a bad game that makes Plan 9 from space look like Hamlet, the only saving grace - the late great Henny Youngman, as the owner of a strip club, yes, take my wife ... please. The strippers are very sexy in 1972, I think they used the same plot again in Roger Cormanâ€™s movie; undressing to kill in 1987. I really enjoyed the earlier HGLewis flick 100 maniacs, which were a kind of mini-masterpiece, but a bad acting game, there are no awards here, but keep in mind that this was a sprinkling movie that saw the way on Friday 13th. In one disturbing scene, a half-naked stripper spanked her ass with meat tenderizer. Lewis strikes again. 2 out of 10.
