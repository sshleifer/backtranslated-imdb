This movie is terrible! It is disgusting and makes you laugh, but it fails terribly. The director clearly does not have the feeling of a comedy slap, and the actors are not similar to anything I have ever seen - they lack the acting talent and talent of comedy. Even their attempt to interfere with English is really sad, and in fact the very right specific Swedish accent, which speaks of incoherent dialogue, is probably the most ridiculous and pleasant thing in this film. Even the blood I am terrible and unconvincing. If you crave a bloody comedy, I would advise you to turn to classic rates, such as the series “Evil Dead” or even “Deadly Brain”, if necessary. We all enjoy a bloody laugh, but this is ridiculous!
