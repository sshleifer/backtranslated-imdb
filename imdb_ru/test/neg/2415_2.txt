The street gang brutally murdered the sister of a boy-lover of parties, which made the young man suddenly go out with psychosis. He and his buddies kill half the city to bring his sister back to life. <br /> <br /> SAVAGE STREETS were released a year after the release of this film and became more interesting. Linny Quigley, who played the role in this film as the sexual (and slightly naked) friend of one of the guys, also starred in the movie "STREETS OF THE STREET". <br /> <br /> This film is not very good, although it is runaway enough entertainment and gratuitous nudity to please the target audience (me). <br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated for strong violence, nudity, language and some sexuality.
