After the Japanese attack on American troops at Pearl Harbor during World War II “Children of Eastside”: Leo Gorsy (as Muggs), Bobby Jordan (as Danny Connors), Hunts Hall (as Glimpy), David Gorsi (as Peavy), Ernest Morrison (like Skruno) and Bobby Stone (like Skinny) want to serve their country. But both the US Army and the fleet reject them as too young. Still wanting to "knock down about a million Japs," the "boys" are attacking an Asian clerk who turns out to be Chinese. However, the unfortunate incident prompted the gang to help identify some really nasty Japanese and Germans. <br /> <br /> If “too young” is defined as “under the age of twenty-one”, then only Mr. Jordan and Mr. Stone will be rejected for military service. But perhaps recruiters were turned off because of the manner shown by Mr. Gorsy and Mr. Hall. "Let's get tough!" was made at the time that the script accurately describes it as an “open season in the Japs” - for this and other reasons, it did not stand well. This is a useless effort, but the regulars come out skillfully, Tom Brown promotes the storyline like Brother Jordan's spy. <br /> <br /> *** Let's start hard! (05.29.42) Wallace Fox ~ Leo Gorsi, Bobby Jordan, Tom Brown
