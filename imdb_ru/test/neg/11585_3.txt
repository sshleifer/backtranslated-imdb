Another ridiculously lame and senseless low-cost sci-fi television presentation ?? but really it's kinda funny ?? view?? out of habit. Am i soft I do not know why they came up with these names. Yes, there is a komodo. And yes, there is a cobra. But what between "against" and between? Of course they come to a fight? I can add only two sequences (one repeats the incident, and the other - a tricky climax) and fairly boring exchanges. Preparation is the same old scientific experiment routine, spinning out of control on a secluded island (no dinosaurs about), and some innocent bystanders (environmentalists hoping to test for animals) get involved in it. This leads to the fact that the dragon and the kobodo cobra become massive in the statue, and the government soon wants to destroy any evidence (including witnesses) of its existence by blowing up the island. So the survivors rush over time to find a way out. Famous major things existed from the terrible computer game CGI, hacking script, several dirty sets (although the setting of the tropical island was easy for the eyes), repetitive characters (but I found that the performances broke out), lifelessly sticky thrills (which for some reason were saved using the same repeated shot of the victim who just stood there in horror, which meant that I was waiting, please eat me now, I donâ€™t go anywhere, and in the end they were swallowed whole - well, almost as always azalos second sip to kill them or just get rid of the hassle, stupid crush them) and very hysterical edge with some pathetic message of survival among the acts. Director Jim Wynorski seems to be everywhere on cruise control. Michael Pare has fun with his rude dialogues, and Michelle Borth has added much-needed spark. Rene Talbert is here to sulk a lot, quite successfully too.
