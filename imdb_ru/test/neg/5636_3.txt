I knew nothing about this DVD when I hired it. Quickly looked at the comments here, but decided to keep an open mind. Obviously, an independent film and a low budget, but that didn't bother me. I will watch anything with Derik Jacobi, and, as always, he played his part well. What a pity no one did. I watched "The Atonement" a few weeks ago with Vanessa Redgrave, and she was great. In this, she seems to have just appeared to read the lines. In my opinion, the main mistake was in the casting of Vinnie Jones. Honestly, I saw his picture on the cover of the DVD, but did not notice that he got the highest score. The sticker was strategically placed above his name! It was watchable, and I really liked the story of Dickens along with today. Perhaps with a more capable actor playing a major role, it might work better. However, it was weak.
