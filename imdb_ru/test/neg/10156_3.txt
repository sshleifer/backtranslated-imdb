oh well ... a sadistic comedy was supposed to be funny, many horror films lack common sense, but I think that a backward caveman could get around this situation. Don't expect Hitchcock or something close to that. This is a good option for friends, but I would not recommend it for anything else. This film lacks the whole essence of a true horror movie, tension, shock, and good characters. the killer could not become the force majeure I had expected of him, and he seemed like an average angry student "D", able to outwit only stupid people. and the really fun thing is a terrible game and lack of emotion in the so-called "victims". <br /> <br /> 3/10 just expect this in daily fun.
