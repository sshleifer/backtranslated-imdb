A strange novel about a black comedy with a great cast and a less than stellar script. Brenda Bletin (“Beautiful and Amazing”) is the title character of “Betty,” a woman who is married without love with a man who clearly has an affair with a beautiful blonde secretary. Guess who plays this minor role? Naomi Watts (Mulholland Drive) had to do this project even before its superstar status was insured with the help of the thriller The Ring. <br /> <br /> On the male side of the cast, there is the sadly mistaken Alfred. Molina ("Frida") is an old-fashioned undertaker who suddenly decides to reveal her desires for Betty, who have been inactive for decades. Perhaps Miramax hopes that Molina’s turn in the upcoming “Spider-Man 2” might generate some interest in this little knickknack on the DVD rental shelf. <br /> <br /> But the reward for the wildest thankless performance goes to Christopher Walken. (“Catch Me If You Can”), who, being a “modern” undertaker, goes to a Vegas-style funeral in a small provincial town. His character must have parachuted into the village, because there is no particular reason for this scenario. <br /> <br /> However, if you want some top-notch actors to do some unassuming humor then this is for you, and if this is not your cup of tea, try making Harold and Maude, a film about the funeral which is still funny so far.
