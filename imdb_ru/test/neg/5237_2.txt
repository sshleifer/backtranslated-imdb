Christoph Lambert once said that he still acted in films just to earn good and easy money. When I see his latest issues, I can believe it. <br /> <br /> Beowulf, in general, is in the “good” part of the shitty movies: there really are some good thrills. The actors themselves are not so bad. But the plot is stupid, the music is similar to “Mortal Kombat”, there’s nothing to do with it, the ending is really very bad ... <br /> <br /> Indeed, the only thing that’s good is that I and my friends could laugh over how it was uninteresting. I would even like to spend my money on something else. <br /> <br />
