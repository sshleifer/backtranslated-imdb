Solo begins when a team of American soldiers travels to South America to blow up the rebel runway, joined by a robot named Solo (Mario Van Peebles) who can use any weapon that has ever been made is fifteen times stronger and ten times faster than any man. of being. Something goes wrong, and Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians, whom Colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler) is not thrilled about returning to base, and General Haynes (Barry Corbin) orders Solo to be closed and reprogrammed. One of Solo’s main directives is self-preservation, so he decides to flee back to the South American jungle, where Colonel Madden and his men are sent to fight it off ... <br /> <br /> This co-production of Mexican Americans was directed by Norberto Barba - say that Solo is terrible. David Corley's script was based on Robert Mason's The Weapon and is one cliche after another, robots were popular at the time Solo was doing in Hollywood and at the box office, so Solo robbed Robocop (1987), Universal Soldier ( 1992) and two films “Terminator”, as well as with the same plot and base story as Predator (1987). This is the usual nonsense for an unfeeling robot that develops a sense of humanity, being surrounded by people, at first he does not know what a joke is or why one person takes care of another, but by the end he develops emotions and begins to be friends with people, it sounds like Terminator 2: Judgment day (1991) for me. The character is poor, and Colonel Madden, in particular, completely gives no reason to hate Solo in general, and why he kills other American soldiers and does not obey orders to destroy him. You know that I saw it on cable television last night for free (thank God, I didn't spend any money on it), and I watched it on the TV guide, and do you know what he said? My TV guide described Solo as “a terrible sci-fi game with Mario Van Pibels in the lead role,” which, when I think about it, is an excellent description of Solo. In less than ten words, my television guide hit me in the head, I mean, this is a sci-fi action movie, Mario Van Peebles most certainly appeared in it, and this is definitely awful. In fact, stop talking. <br /> <br /> Directed by Barba does not do anything special here, in the action scenes there is not enough real excitement, and there are practically no science fiction elements, except that Solo is a robot. So the military is losing Solo, and Colonel Madden is sent to return it, right? I’m not funny, but wouldn’t the military introduce a self-destruct mechanism inside Solo in case something like this happens? Of course, at least Solo had a tracking device inside so that the military would at least know where it was at any moment? I'm not funny, but these people may come up with a walking soldier robot soldier, but they are not smart enough to understand that a tracking device or self-destruct can be useful if something goes wrong? The violence is mild, there are some good fighting scenes, but in reality these are pretty weak things. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film looks well and well made, it was actually filmed in Mexico. The creators of the agent Red Dolph Lundgren (2000) edited footage from Solo in this film. The game is bad, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play an unfeeling robot ... William Sadler deserves better than this, it was just a few years before he played in the fantastic film Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990). br /> <br /> Solo is a really bad sci-fi thriller, which in essence represents a huge robbery of big budget Hollywood sci-fi action films such as Robocop, Universal Soldier and Terminator. I do not recommend it, and I'm going to start and pay more attention to my TV guide when it comes to choosing films to watch ...
