This is the slowest film “noir” I've ever seen. A very weak script gives Jack Palance and Rod Steiger only the opportunity to produce exceptionally good lines that were made for acting listening. Palance and Steiger claim that they are really serious actors who can portray their roles with power, emotion and drama. The story itself is moving at an incredibly slow pace, mostly taking place in the living room. The director obviously moved the actors in rhythmic circles when they pronounced exhaustingly long lines so that the slow pace did not become noticeable to the audience. The action does not begin until the last ten minutes of the film. If you are the one who is looking for more depth in a crime drama, this is not for you!
