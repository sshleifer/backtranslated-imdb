Take it from me, like an operator who worked in Republic Studios from 1946 to 1950, and then from Warners Bros and Paramount from 1950 to 1993, this is a piece of shit. Of course, it would be great to show it to your favorite friends at a house party, but trying to sell it on DVD is completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I saw a bad game at one time, but this is NO acting, the Hero is almost ridiculous, and he really thinks he is something, judging by his comments on special offers. I hate to see his fan club. Old films did not mix with action in many scenes. What the hell was that scene in the garden with the three worst actresses. I have never seen a garden on the ship. They could not even be emotions. I would not have objected to this if they had at least one ounce of acting, but the only one was a guy with Trans-Slavonic accent. Sorry, but this is not a smart movie, as some people claim. I think that horror movie lovers will be offended by this piece of film.
