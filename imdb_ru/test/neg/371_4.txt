As noted by other reviewers, this film is a cross between (that is, stolen from) the stories we have seen before. In particular, this is similar to how Clint Eastwood of Sly Plains inserted into Mad Max. Remove Clint's cigar and replace the cigarette; remove his horse and give him a high-tech motorcycle, and voila, an updated drifter. In this film, the “hero” is even more clearly “Savior” than the Drifter High Plains. Now our hero has long brown hair, he has a wound on the left side, and his entry into the city is preceded by a request for the "rescue" of the surviving citizens - a fairly transparent reference to the "Second Coming". I watched a movie on a hot, wet morning. Sleep was impossible, and when he got up at 4:30 in the morning, there was nothing else on TV. So the film has completed its task. While non-original, with characters that are almost comic caricatures, the film is still somewhat interesting ... at least at 4:30 in the morning.
