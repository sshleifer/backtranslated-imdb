I am so disappointed in this film that I cannot express it. I was so excited when I started watching this movie to see Mickey Rourke with leather skin and that guy from Third Rock From The Sun who behaved like a psycho. I thought, wow, that would be the winner, damn it, Natural Born Killers. And it became better. The production value was great, the direction was great, the acting was great, the cinematography was great and the plot was, well, in general, the plot, so what's the plot? About halfway through this movie, I pulled out my hair, screaming "What the hell is going on?" and I mean literally? Nothing makes any sense. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Aaaaaaahhhhhhggg !!!!
