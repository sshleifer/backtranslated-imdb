After reading _River_God_ and _The_Seventh_Scroll_, I cannot begin to express how disappointed this film is. Although I agree that some poetic licenses may be admissible, this film is constantly at odds with the books, making an incredible injustice to the exciting, believable and wonderful stories written by Wilbur Smith. I can only believe that the writers, directors and producers of the film have never heard of Mr. Smith, let alone read his works. Smith's bright characteristics are transformed into wooden stick figures, all historicity is ignored or discounted, the realism of the books has been changed to include phantom monsters more suitable for the cartoon. And why does the Egyptian minion speak Spanish? Damn, no wonder the movie was turned into a mini-series! Did Wilbur Smith have any input to making this film? I can't believe what he did. A terrible, terrible movie. If you read one or both books, do not waste your time or money on viewing this money. You will be greatly disappointed, I assure you. <br /> <br /> Only a moment of the greatest generosity convinced me to assign a 2 rating to this film, and this is only because of a beautiful, sometimes impressive photo.
