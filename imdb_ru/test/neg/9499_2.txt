I do not know where to start. Perhaps the whole idea of ​​this film was just a disaster waiting to happen. There is nothing funny about kidnapping. I do not know what was more offensive - the subject or "performance" of David Arquette. It looked like a bull saw his penis cut off, although I think the bull has become better after that. The filmmakers must find something about Sinatra, except for the abduction of his son, to show (for example, I do not know, his TALENT IS A FRIEND !!!!). His family does not need to worry about this horror. Thank God, it was only shown on HBO and not released in theaters. Please do not watch this if you have self-esteem.
