Complete and complete parody of the film. “Dark Power” is the film that even confuses the release of the film. The script, direction, action and sequence of actions are so terrible that it is almost painful to look at them and it is impossible to think. that it's only 75 minutes, you could spend better. The aforementioned reviewer should be related to the director, as this is the only reason I can see his / her assessment of this garbage, some may call it a funny b-film or “so bad it is good” just to justify this enjoyment of it, but when the lead actor (and the most experienced actor) cannot convincingly show his roles, you know that you have a very, very bad movie. Avoid at all costs.
