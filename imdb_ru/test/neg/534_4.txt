This is a more kind, gentle film about Cyborg with a love story. Awww This is not as bad as it seems. The action, when it is there, is decent, and Jack Palance, Elias Koteas and Angelina Jolie are always reliable. Is this the fact that this is a continuation of the horrible film of Jean-Claude Van Damme, or is this the main theme of the Master of the Universe trilogy? I'm still confused by this. In any case, this film was not necessary. What was the need? Angelina Jolie. She can play a killer robot that can explode in the middle of intercourse, but which way and even if this is her first film, she is still present, which made her the prize winner.
