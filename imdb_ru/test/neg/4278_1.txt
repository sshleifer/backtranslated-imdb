for anyone reading this book, Fanny Price turns into his own woman, a beautiful woman ... with the mind. Le Touzel looks like she takes medicine. Awful game, it just destroys it! Henry is a bit tall for his character. He is also too feminine. Mary Crawford is great. Edmond is too old. Mrs. Norris is hysterical - well, this casting decision works. Rushworth is also perfect. Yeats looks too effeminate. But Le Touzel is just awful. This is not a good character for her. Poor fanny! I would recommend this film only because it contains an almost complete textual report about the language that Austin uses in the novel. The 1999 version is much more fun, but terribly incomplete. If they could remake this version with a more suitable actress for Fanny, it would be incredible!
