“Airport 4” is, in fact, a complicated confusion for Universal Studios, which is trying to translate a new turn - a supersonic airliner Concorde - into its formula “a catastrophe in the sky”. <br /> <br /> Breaks down with unintended humor, the best of which is when George Kennedy put his hand out of the Concorde window at supersonic speeds to launch a rocket cannon into a rocket searching for heat, following that these stupid passengers continue to return aboard the same plane to continue their flight, despite all the problems in the air. Many stars in it, including Robert Wagner, Sylvia Christelle, Alain Delon and Martha Ray as a nervous passenger. <br /> <br /> Not related to other films from the Airport.
