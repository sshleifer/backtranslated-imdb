"Ripe" is one of those terrible Indians who manage to enter into circulation and give India a bad name. To tell a foolishly irrelevant story about fertilized twin sisters who crawl because of a car accident that kills their parents and then sets off, happily stealing in a store, looking at some guy and ending up in an army post decayed, what the army want (yes, that's right!). An overt attempt to reach adulthood, “Ripe” is an almost complete loser who wanders aimlessly when players leave and leave a character, eventually ending awkwardly, not having a drop of believability that can be found anywhere. No one is recommended.
