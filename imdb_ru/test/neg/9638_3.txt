This is one of those so-called "Hollywood social commentaries" that wants to have it in both directions. And believe me, in this film, both ways are clichéd and stereotyped. STOP-LOSS is a 21st century film about John Wayne devoted to some anti-war sentiments, but clearly ending with a note: "If you are a MAN in modern society, you will gather together and go to war with your buddies." In many ways, the film was an excellent continuation of “Taxi on the Dark Side”, as it depicts the military, equally insane and uncontrollable, quasi-enchanting extravaganza FRAT PARTY / ANIMAL HOUSE, mixed with the world of erotic evidence of Texas red neck. masculinity. In this film, it was all in one scene after another of clichés. And then the rebellious military deserter Ryan Phillippe goes to Autotrack with her best friend's girlfriend, artificially manipulates the storyline to visit the families of the dead soldiers, the crippled soldiers in military hospitals, etc., and finally, to address the issue of fleeing to Canada or Mexico . But men's honor and patriotism eventually win, since they are all clean and beautiful, he leaves for the sunset bus with friends to Iraq and to the world, which a few minutes before he assured everyone he never again will tolerate Fully metal jacket meets SANDS IVO JIM. But in the end, John Wayne rides again! And the Hollywood blockbuster eventually gets to keep both sides of his audience in the palm of his hand - at least he would like to think so. As for me, just bring me back to a more convincing reality IN THE GARDEN OF ILAH.
