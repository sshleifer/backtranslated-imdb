The initial scene of the beach in Fircombe, although fun in itself, unfortunately, provides a suitable metaphor for the film - tasteless and blurry. In fact, this is not as trite as most of the others in the “Carry On” series, but perhaps this is not a special pleasure. It's fair to argue that this title will appeal to fans of the Benny Hill show, but those who are looking for attractive girls in bikinis and mini-skirts, although they will see some in this, will surely like some other titles in the series, such as "Carry On Abroad" or " Carry On Up the Jungle "more. The emergence of feminism in the early 1970s is used as a plot device, which seems rather self-destructive.
