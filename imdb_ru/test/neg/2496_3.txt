The United States created an atomic bomb to show its superior military power and put an end to World War II. The film "Fat Man and a Little Boy" is an attempt by American physicists to invent the technology needed to create a bomb, as well as the tension that existed between scientists and the military about the potential use of a bomb, and even the acceptability of its creation. Scientists believed that the bomb should be created as a deterrent, a mechanism that will stop the war, spending as little life as possible. First, they saw themselves in a race with German scientists who themselves tried to build nuclear weapons. When the Germans were defeated, many scientists hoped to stop working on the bomb project, because they knew that the Japanese did not have the technology necessary to build nuclear weapons, and therefore they did not pose a threat of mass casualties. Those who supported the continuation of the Manhattan project hoped that the bomb would be used as a demonstration by inviting the head of the Japanese state to look at its location on some tiny deserted island. They believed that such a powerful manifestation of force would be enough to win the war - killing would not be needed. The American military, led by General Leslie Groves, all the time hoped to use the bomb as the actual weapon that would be used against the enemy, first against the Germans and then against the Japanese. Because of the preservation of Japanese soldiers in small Japanese islands, the United States decided to drop a bomb on densely populated cities to put an end to the war, first in Hiroshima and then in Nagasaki. The demonstration of this enormous amount of force also served to notify the rest of the world that the US is the dominant military power, which was aimed in particular at Russia, whose growing military power and economic weight in Eurasia threatened our outstanding global position. “Fat Man and the Little Boy” was a film that had good intentions, but they rather confused them with the choice of actors, script and cinematography. One of the highlights of the film was the struggle between the military view of the science of killing and the scientific view of the science of knowledge. The cornerstone of this conflict is the ongoing disagreement between General Groves and Dr. Oppenheimer. Mr. Newman does his job as a general, mean, strongly angry and radiating his dependence on project success. Dwight Schulz, on the other hand, never gives much resistance to the requirements of the general, always looking rather weak, bloated and phlegmatic in his audience. John Cusack represents a stunningly non-sympathetic character in the same role I have ever seen - it looks like he is just reading his own lines. Laura Dern seems to be suffering from the same disease. None of the characters are helped by the script, which is childishly ridiculous in the sense that it is trying to scientifically explain scientific concepts, offers the most unreal relationship between Mr. Cusack and Miss Dern that you can imagine, does not even give us cheap thrills on how the army drops nuclear bombs on Japan, and relies heavily on voice acting - a technique that is evil at any time, even when it explains the characters' true innermost thoughts, or to narrate about something that can not be shown in the film. , but is used here to read some absolutely banal entries from Cusack's diary. The cinematographer offers us some snapshots of the ominous shadow of two bombs that can be amazing if it didn't look like they were cardboard cutouts instead of bombs, a fake atomic fire really looks fake, and why use it when the stock footage is so striking and realistic, and the ubiquitous brown tint does not look thematically appropriate. Besides, this is not a bad movie.
