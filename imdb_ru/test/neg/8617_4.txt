A good story is well hidden and never used! <br /> <br /> The film is short and overly dependent on the action and thematic photo; somehow the character and story development was forgotten. What remains is confused and superficial. <br /> <br /> Turn off your brain and see that you are likely to find that time passes quickly enough, but if you are not the person who finds the soap deep and meaningful, you will not get real satisfaction from this film. <br /> <br /> See only if you have nothing to do, and only if someone else is paying for renting a video.
