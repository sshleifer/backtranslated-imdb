I can not stress how bad this film is. This director made every cheap little unreasonable shot to make these people look so “grieved.” Why are their clothes so dirty? Why on earth did you make the new Clark Kent play a crazy head? You should forbid to act in films for the rest of your life. Buddy Giovinazzo. <br /> <br /> I am seriously offended by this fool who wants to call real actors bandits and scum as some kind of clever joke. Why do you ask Clark Kent to play crazy? Why do they scream so much? Why is everyone so angry? Why are these kids so dirty? No one would like to be so dirty? Not even a crazy kid. <br /> <br /> You need to grow up and no longer make any films.
