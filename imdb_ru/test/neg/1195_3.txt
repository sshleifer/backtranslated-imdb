If there were unknown people in the League who filed this scenario, the patrons would simply turn around and say: “No, you have no money - this is terrible.” As a fan of the League of Gentlemen, this is their poorest walk to date. Not particularly funny, not particularly exciting, little laughing moments. They exist, but they are few. I felt that the format was tired and really addictive. The film refers to the authors who are tired of the characters, and it shows. As for the movie. I felt that the Xmas special had the best production value; FX is usually quite poor, and it is obvious that they were not filmed in the original Royston Vasey (they shot it cheaply in Ireland) The music is weak and the dialogue is terrible. In addition, the character accents were largely due to their television equivalents. Baths and Edward, greatly underestimated (again), just didn't look like themselves. Disappointment is really because I was hoping for something much more interesting. It really was the equivalent of the 1970s Comedy League, where the actors go to Spain ...
