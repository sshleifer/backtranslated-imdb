This thing, which should not be called a movie, is almost worse than Manos, but you just have to see that itâ€™s fun. If you see it in a video store, rent it, if you see a 10th anniversary issue, yes, there is a special edition, buy it for less than 10 dollars, if your friend has it borrowed, you just have to see it. The game is so bad, and the blood is so unreal. After watching this, you ask yourself why they did this insult to the art of cinema? This is provided that your face does not melt, like the Nazis in the "Raiders". If you manage to see it, be sure to vote for this film as 1 (terrible) so that it can hit the bottom hundred, it really deserves a spot. I'm surprised it's not number 1 right now.
