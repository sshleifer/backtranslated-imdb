I have not seen this for many years. The game was so good that I started this time, I thought, “Great! Another movie I underestimated as a stupid young man. ” But then the topic became clear, and I felt the same. <br /> <br /> It was Hollywood, a place of charm; therefore, the concept should not be a surprise. But this is such an indulgent concept that it seems to me that I need to take a shower after watching. In short, it tells us that even physically ugly people may seem beautiful to each other and even feel attractive. <br /> <br /> Dorothy McGuire is cute as a home heroine. It seems she was shot with minimal makeup. Robert Young is injured in the war and feels injured. His parents can't look at him either. He seems to have all his abilities, and in part, the concept of disability is outdated. <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall is at hand as a blind pianist. His character speaks in low voices and is omniscient. <br /> <br /> Best work given by Mildred Nuthick as the owner of the title residence. It is bitter and harsh, but not of ice. Her story is much more interesting and believable than the story of McGuier and Young.
