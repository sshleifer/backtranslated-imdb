The film is an adaptation of the Japanese story of the respected author Yukio Mishima. It simply does not make the transition to a credible story about Britons and Americans. <br /> <br /> The story moves sluggishly, especially in the part where Miles and Kristofferson are separated, and the director fills in the cliché with frames of the film. the nose of the ship cut through the waves, and a small line of the route filled the maps, and their letters were heard in the consignment note. The film moves so sluggishly that I quickly go through scenes of sex and masturbation, which, although long, are in fact neither passionate nor erotic. The film gained fame when the then wife of Christopherson divorced him during extracurricular activities with Miss Miles during filming. I guess they liked the sex scenes, but for the viewer this is not quite true. <br /> <br /> There are no characters to hold on to. A disappointed widow is unlikely, a small child is disgusting. Kristofferson is kind enough, but he simply does not have acting skills to play a lot in this role, although perhaps we don’t want to get too carried away with him, given his final fate. <br /> <br /> As for a small child, well, he seems to fall into a bad crowd after his father’s death, and they help him to arrange some kind of evil against the man who enters his mother’s life. Now this is a really bad crowd. They don't just steal in the store and smoke drugs, nosireebib. They slip Mickey to the cat and vivisect it. This is shown in bloody detail. But, of course, this is just a practice, so they can do the same with Christopherson! <br /> <br /> So the movie basically moves slowly, without any characters, and when something happens, it's relentlessly painful. <br /> <br /> The end is as unsatisfactory as any movie you have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It would all make sense if the Japanese language and cultural context were preserved. In its current form, it's just terrible. <br /> <br />
