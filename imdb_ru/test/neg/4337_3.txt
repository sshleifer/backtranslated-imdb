Well, here is a really short review: this film is blown up. I wish I had just a review, which sets out this simple principle, but I have to tire you with more bad review type words, such as “terrible”, “cliche” and “invisible”. This is the type of movie you watch when you are drunk or stuck on a deserted island, and you have nothing else to do. Here is the premise: the vice president is captured by a terrorist group in a playoff hockey game, and only Van Damme can stop the madness. Indeed, really terrible, but again, I did not pay to see it for the first time, and only my dad felt there was no girth in his wallet after this movie. I hate the fact that he is a Republican and all that, but again, he saved me from the horror by paying for this piece of garbage. Well, now this place is enough to be rated as a review, so I apologize.
