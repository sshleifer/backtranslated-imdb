Harrison Ford plays Dutch Sergeant Van Den Brock of the District of Columbia Police Department. He is trying to find the bad guys, but does not do a very good job. When we meet him, he tries to catch a corrupt officer undercover. Christine Scott Thomas plays Senator Kay Chandler from New Hampshire, trying to re-elect. She runs against a candidate who has a lot of money. The last thing she needs is the death of her husband. She is a politician, she cannot be bogged down in feelings. <br /> <br /> This story moves slowly and painfully. Every five minutes I looked at my watch, wondering when it would end! The story is lost in the details, the director Sydney Pollack should not have inserted. We do not want to know about the police investigations in Holland. They give some insight into the policies and back control they do for campaigns. After watching the movie, I still wonder why they were so involved in romance. No one else mourns? Don't you need more than two weeks to even think about going “horizontally” with someone else? <br /> <br /> It was nice to see an actress, a comedian, a Chicago native and a graduate of the Second City Bonnie Hunt. Her role is not necessarily comic, but she was the only one I wanted to see more. Do yourself a favor, wait for it on the video, if you want to see it at all.
