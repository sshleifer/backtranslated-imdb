Even with a small budget, this film would be worth seeing if there was any story here. It all started pretty good, pretty attractive and believable. Actors and characters were interesting, although there was no special character development. My favorite scene was when they all ate their diet. Some seemed to hate it, and some seemed to think it was not so bad. The story begins very tight. And then ... <br /> <br /> And then he fell into a little horror, which is usually a death sentence for most fiction writers. Suddenly there is no scientific basis for any events. No real believable game for a villain? There is no real explanation of what is happening. As a rule, if in the film you need to use the word “F” for every other word, it usually also goes down. I'm still offended, believe it or not. I often wonder what inspires people to do bad science fiction? Doesn't the universe have fantastically good stories? Don't people feel like they are wasting their time, and everyone else, when they release things like this. Why do we get such mediocre science fiction like this? Female actors / characters either? Not at all? This was intended to become another “Predator”, but, alas, it was far from enough. <br /> <br /> My last comment is poor editing and, finally, budget too low to build a real fire? What gives? <br /> <br /> My advice for any low-budget film company. Make sure you have a good story before you begin, and edit the bad special effects - better we will not see anything except what looks fake or ridiculously fuzzy.
