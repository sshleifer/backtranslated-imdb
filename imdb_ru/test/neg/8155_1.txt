This film was in a box with 20 others, with different quality, and I can safely say that this title was right at the bottom of the pile. <br /> <br /> It is pointless to go through the plot, which was what I understood, what was wrong, because I don’t have an entire day, and my life is short, which reminds me, I just lost about 85 minutes watching for this prank. <br /> <br /> The acting was devilishly bad, which made it funny, though only funny, while comedic elements, such as two idiotic police officers, surely made Laurel & Hardy fans moan. One of the few funny moments was when the lead lady joked about her former friends of plastic T * ts, which would be nice if I didn’t have to watch them sway as she laps around the screen. <Br /> <br /> The lowest I can give is one, and it probably deserves to have Heather Thomas in it, since she was certainly sexy and slim, although her game was the same bad, like everyone else.
