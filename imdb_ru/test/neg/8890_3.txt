Quickie talks about a decadent Russian mafia family that lives in Malibu and ... well, to be honest, this horrible attempt at drama does not deserve comment. <br /> <br /> Jason Lee introduces himself to Mr. Pacific Fighter Guy with huge letters on his back, which say "West Coast Fighters." In the end, the guys become suspicious, because she exterminates in the bedroom. (Spirit). <br /> <br /> In another scene, Mr. Mobguy plays Russian roulette, giving the prostitute $ 4,000 to bet whether he will survive or die. She has 5 chances out of 6 to save money if she makes a bet "live". Well, she bets "die." (double spirit) She later complains that it was not fair and wants to play again. (Triple spirit). <br /> <br /> The list of flaws only continues, until this offensive film stinks and drowns in the mire of lousy music, mediocre camera work, bad direction, boring history, and so on. D. Pass on this loser. (D) <br /> <br /> Note. On my DVD, the barebones had no English subtitles or subtitles.
