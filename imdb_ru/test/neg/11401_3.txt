This is one of the worst films I have seen lately. The acting was terrible. Anthony Kamerling is usually a pretty good actor, but in this film he sounded like he was reading his text from a sheet of paper. Especially his voice was very wooden. Bo van Erven Dorens, being a little boy Frazier, was completely unbeatable, although it was probably connected with a foolish dialogue. “Ik ook van jou” is an adaptation of the book, and the filmmakers have forgotten that the dialogue on cinema follows different rules than the literary dialogue. It all sounded like a book. <br /> <br /> Some situations were very poorly visualized. Example: somewhere in the beginning of the movie there is a scene where the canoe quickly runs across. This bit is too unbelievable to be true. You see, obviously, a rather shallow river, with a large number of stones right below the surface (hence quick). We hear some disturbing music to warn us that danger is ahead. Canoeing with girls runs across this rather shallow threshold. Then our hero dives a few meters below the surface to save one of the girls. The girl faints and says the words "You saved me ..." Vomiting! <br /> <br /> In fact, everything was so bad that it became ridiculous. This is sad because it really was not intended. During the break, I heard someone behind me say, “Oh my God, there is another part!” My feelings for sure. What scares me is that the last words of “Ik ook van jou” were in English. Does this mean that he will be released abroad? Just when the Netherlands began to acquire a good reputation after such films as “Anthony” (the line of Antonia) and “Character” (character) ...
