Unlike the conditions of tenderness and the Magnolies, I left the cinema, feeling VERY disappointed. I began to understand the characters and their complex mother / daughter and father / daughter relationship at the beginning. I even cried. But I did not feel sympathy for the characters with the finale. The final act did not at all correspond to the character of the mother. So, although the acting was pretty good, I thought the film was generally disappointing.
