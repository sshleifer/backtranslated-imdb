Words let me down for this terrible waste of two hours of someone's life. The story is invented to complete incredibility. <br /> <br /> The acting is lead, and most of it is terribly ridiculous. Vinnie Jones - so wonderful in the movie “Stocks” and “Two Smoking Barrels” - unbearably terrible and incredible, like Mike Sullivan, a journalist. <br /> <br /> I honestly never remember watching the worst movie. One has only to watch the terrible failures of continuity. After Jones got a huge beating, he appears without a scratch on him. His girlfriend gets drunk on him, and he stalks her, jumping out of the pub. It's pretty awful, compounded by the talented actors who appear in it.
