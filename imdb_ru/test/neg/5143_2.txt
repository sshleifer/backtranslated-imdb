The plot of the film seems to have been built from a scattered dream. Not enough realism to keep the interest of the viewer. The Vermont farm scene was an unsuccessful opportunity to show how farms were created and farm families lived, which would be interesting and interesting. There was little if there was no research in the bootlegging trade of whiskey from that period. The costumes of the Canadians looked like something from the French Revolution, absolutely unbelievable. Playing the violin was good, and the time, but the movement of Chris during the supposedly incredible game. The owl's appearance was never a mystery, and the train disappearing into the air was too big. I could not understand how live trout froze in the ice and why two people in the desert without food released trout, a good source of food.
