Yes, the film is not a work of art, but when I first saw it, I was 10 years old, my parents were absent, and I stayed at home with my two brothers. It was in May 1970 (I know this because I found a note about a cycle of horror films that was on the same network). This is one of the most vivid memories that I have left with the guys. We ended up all in the same bed and covered our heads! Our very first horror movie! We continued to talk about this for years and laughed at the moment. These were horror movies. Nowadays, horror movies are always the same. Or was it better when we were children, enjoying without analyzing the plot, the cast and the dialogues? Most likely, so. But for me this is a great movie!
