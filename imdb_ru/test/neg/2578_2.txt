This is a well-known fact, Mr. Seagal cannot smile, he can act, he can kick ass, there are faint smiles, there are no real smiles, they don’t laugh out loud, and there is no point in watching this tangled film. We see Mr. Seagal’s overweight as Dr. Wesley McLaren, who desperately needs a haircut, and his real daughter Ayako appeared as his office assistant. Story: Okay, so Wesley lives in another damned backwater with his cute daughter Holly. They sit and enjoy their red flower tea and omelettes, and at the other end of the city some overweight police leader decides to infect the entire city by spreading a virus that travels through the air and kills for 2 days, thinking that it can survive he had an antidote. The problem is that there is no antidote, and the existing one only delays the virus for some time. People associate with the CIA, and even they cannot help, and only one person is not sick, Wesley's daughter Holly. Therefore, they hunt her, thinking that the medicine is in her blood. Wesley manages to grab his daughter and take her to her grandfather, who is an Native Indian. Together with her daughter-in-law, Ann, they go to a base where there is a hidden laboratory to find a cure, but even soldiers there slowly die, like others, unless they find a cure on time. And to shorten the moment, neither Ann nor Wesley is infected with a virus ... hm. One weak battle scene. A terrible film and all men in it desperately need a master of the stairs.
