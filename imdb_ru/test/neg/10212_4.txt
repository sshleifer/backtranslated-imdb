Being a fan of wrestling, wrestling films tend to suck (Backyard Dogs, Bodyslam, Jesse Ventura's story), but this film is not the worst I've ever seen. Yes, this is bad, but better than some others I mentioned. <br /> <br /> Hulk Hogan basically plays himself, and for some reason the competing network wants to beat him because he does not want to be in that network. Let me explain this so that everyone can understand ... Imagine that there is a Rip in the US network ... and TNT will do everything possible to get it. <br /> <br /> Does this make sense ... no? Well, I do not feel bad, because it does not make sense. It also does not make sense to have a legitimate ex against in a real fight with Rip at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Nothing from this film makes much sense, but compared to other wrestling films and later Hogan films, itâ€™s not so bad. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
