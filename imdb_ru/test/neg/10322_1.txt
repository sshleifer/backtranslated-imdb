On the DVD version we bought, there was Sandra Bullock on the cover, but we found that it was her picture from another movie. Unfortunately, her in this film is very small. However, you can see how far it has come. <br /> <br /> Another bright spot in the film, besides its very small part, was a few scenes filmed in New York and New Jersey in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The sound is terrible. Sometimes the background noise is so loud that it's hard to hear. Sometimes the dialogue was redone without any background noise, which is puzzling. For example, sometimes when they are in a car, the noise from the car is too loud, and then suddenly there is absolutely no additional noise. The director likes close-ups on faces, and then it becomes clear that the film was re-recorded, because the words do not correspond to the movements of the lips. For most of the movie, voices sound like people are talking in a tin can. <br /> <br /> Background music, when there is music, is distracting, not added to the film. <br /> <br /> Direction is funny. Stupid camera angles and sound effects make the film look like a joke, especially at times when tensions are expected, for example, in the middle of a shootout. The letter is terrible. There are some plots that do not make sense, and most of the characters look very silly, because there is no explanation for their motives. The author / director tries to explain some of the relationships between men who were together in Vietnam, but none of this makes any sense. These main killers and ex-soldiers seem not to be able to see the shadows of other people or hear others moving. The actors move from calm to panic and return to calm without warning again. It’s just a combination of bad direction and bad writing. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are so bad that at first we thought that we had stumbled upon someone's student film, which, as it turned out, was Sandra Bullock. If you like to laugh at really badly made student films, then this film is for you. Otherwise, avoid this movie.
