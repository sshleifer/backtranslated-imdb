Horror movies are a curious thing, sometimes they manage to stumble upon a formula that works very well, sometimes they valiantly try to tell a decent story, despite the problems with time and budget, sometimes they are so bad that they are really funny ... and sometimes they "Cave". <br /> <br /> A good horror / suspense movie should contain quirks that make you guess, they should allow you to be interested in the characters and their motives, so that you really have some kind of reaction when they die. However, The Cavern instead prefers to introduce elements that work at the beginning, but only to deny it because of their own sloppy stories. <br /> <br /> All characters are completely forgotten, and any real backstory can make any of them even remotely interesting blurry during a 30-second monologue, which makes it impossible to do anything more than just laugh, as characters are selected almost by accident and more than once in the least frightening way. <br /> <br /> (To spoil the scene a little, one victim is taken during a complete blackout, which might be a bit intimidating if the sound effect used to indicate his killing did not resemble pan stirring with too thick pasta and cheese) Add to this formula a camera that works makes me think that the director has seen too many Nine Inch Nails videos and a finale that, in an attempt to be shocking, is almost useless, but annoying and confusing to the viewer, and you get almost completely invisible horror movie Otori fails on every level. <br /> <br /> I'll be honest with you, if you want a horror movie that causes claustrophobia in caves, go see “Descent” and I feel weird, saying this because I don’t really enjoy this movie either.
