This is so bad, I can not tear myself away. I keep asking myself, "Why?" "What for?" with every scene. <br /> <br /> There is no continuity, but again, if you want to make a very frank homosexual film with a fetishistic attitude to all things: Big, Big boats, Big Boys, Big planes, then you don't need to worry about such things as plot or character. I am puzzled and very concerned that CAG looks just like Richard Pryor. It seems wrong to look at Pryor in such a terrible movie. But I can not tear myself away. This film is the first film I've ever watched. This is how phenomenally bad and strange. This prompted me to join this site. I counted 50 main characters. Perhaps if I were stoned, I could have followed this, but in fact, I feel that I am in some kind of endless bad dream, which is always 1988, and we were the greatest bird on earth.
