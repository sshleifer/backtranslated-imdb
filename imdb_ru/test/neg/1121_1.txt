Makes the fourth theatrical release (the one called “National Lampoon”) “look like a comedy.” A complete mistake and a sad attempt to capitalize on the once proud franchise. It is painfully unfunny and invisible ... even for a television movie! Eddie’s cousin’s character became less and less amusing from the initial vacation, when he was fresh and unique, to the Christmas holidays, when he started to get a little thin, to the vacation in Vegas, where he was really annoyed when he appeared the screen (but in truth, there were a lot of things that were unpleasant to see on the screen in this film!). But this attempt to raise the character to the status of leader, unfortunately, to say the least. Vacation films themselves met a terrible death in Las Vegas, and this hope for the revival of even the thinnest thread for television was completely erroneous. Chevy Chase and company gathered a big trilogy when he was in his prime; now let's just pull the plug and let the title rest in peace. (One tiny note of interest: the original Audrey Griswold - Dana Barron, the first of four actresses who played the role, including Juliette Lewis - returns to the role 20 years later! One can only wonder ... WHY?)
