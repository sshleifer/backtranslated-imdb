I would like to know what to do with such a film. It seems he is divided into two parts - militants and personal dramas on the shore. He follows Ashton Kutscher through the rescue swimmers school under the direction of the chief chef Kevin Costner, and then to Alaska, where several impressive rescue operations take place, the last of which leads to death. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the scenes on the beach seemed so stereotypical in many ways that they should be covered with a crust. A typical bar brawl between the Navy guys and the coast guard ("pirates of the pool"). An experienced old timer Costner, who, as an elderly bar tender tells him, “married a coast guard”. The senior leader, who "continues to try to prove to himself that he is still nineteen." Abandoned ex-wife on the beach, to which Costner makes a farewell visit. The seeming sadistic requirements imposed on instructors for swimmers, all in pursuit of a higher goal. A gifted young man suffers from a troubled past. <br /> <br /> The problem is that we have seen it all before. If Kevin Costner is here, then it's Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, Lou Gossett Jr., Vigo Mortenson, or Robert DeNiro. And in the climate scene, elements from the “Ideal Storm” and “Dead Calm” are shamelessly drawn. None of this is fresh, and none of the old stereotypical characters and situations are treated with any originality. <br /> <br /> This works best as a kind of documentary about what happens in a swimmer’s school and what can happen afterwards, and even this is a bit weak because we don’t get much in the way of training. Basically it is a personal conflict, romance and tension due to erosion. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the US Coast Guard is quite noble, its official mission is “the safety of life and property at sea”. In wartime, he is transferred to the Naval Department and performs combat functions. During World War II, the Coast Guard even managed to win an honorary medal in their ranks. <br /> <br /> But again, we will learn little about it. We really won't know much. The film turns into a sequence of visual displays and not too much else. Disappointment
