I became more and more angry as this movie progressed. <br /> <br /> In essence, Dr. Crawford (Dennis Hopper) predicted that a meteor would hit the earth. “The forces that were” do not believe him, so he sets about building a mountain refuge for a small group of people. <br /> <br /> Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati) is a loser for a trashy tabloid who gets a tip from a friend whom he considers dead that something is happening in the mountains. He goes to investigate. <br /> <br /> Trying to penetrate a secret refuge for survival, Jake spends a lot of time shooting people or beating them to a pulp. He spends the rest of the time arguing with Dr. Crawford about who gave the doctor the right to decide what people should get in order to survive in a meteor. <br /> <br /> I realized that I wanted Jake to do a great service in the future and point the gun at himself. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time on this turkey.
