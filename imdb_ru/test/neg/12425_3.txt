Some friends and I have a strange hobby - to look for really awful and completely obscure (for good reason) horror films, and then watch them under the influence of consciousness-expanding consumer goods, such as alcohol and / or soft drugs. Of course, many people do this, but they watch movies like the remake of Godzilla, while we torture our eyes and brain with such things as Loch Ness Fear. And, Eureka, this is the prototype of a bad movie! We open traditionally, with the music of the bag of pipes during the opening credits. This, of course, to emphasize to us, stupid viewers, that the story should take place in Scottish highlights, and not in the birthplace of director Larry Buchanan in Texas. For the same reason, the actors also seem to receive instructions to replay and to speak with cruel accents. American marine biologist, Professor George Sanderson, arrives in Loch Ness with a brand new and very sophisticated sonar to track the location of the legendary monster in the lake. Meanwhile, many other groups hang around the lake, for example, a group of children in a science camp (which is a boring way to spend a holiday), retired army generals looking for a Luftwaffe plane crashed in a lake during World War II, and a bunch of thieves and unsuccessful scientists who have become a monster egg. You might think that these numerous supporting plots bring some variety and excitement to the plot, but unfortunately this is not the case. "Loch Ness Horror" is a boring movie, in which there are only a couple of remarkable elements. For example, the monster itself is a delightfully delicate creature with cute eyes and smoky breath. His teeth also glow in the dark, which is very useful when you are stupid enough to take a boat ride in the middle of the night. Toward the end of the film, the other actors were more interested in the lost Luftwaffe aircraft than the monster, so it was time to complete it. "Loch Ness Horror" is carefully recommended in case you are a fan of bad 80s B-films, but keep in mind that it contains an overload of meaningless dialogues and a bizarrely hasty ending that gives the impression that the film suddenly came out budget.
