This movie was sooo bad. It was not even funny. Even the sarcastic scenes were not funny. Oh, man, bad, so bad. Thumbs down. Counterfeit, Karate Kid, Young Wolf, Free, Dirty Dancing, Some Beautiful, Soulkeeper, and possibly another one or two. Chris Kattan is the worst dancer from high school who runs a dance studio in the warehouse. He has a jealous girl who breaks her ankle, and her place to dance goes to a pretty novice blonde behind which Chris looks I thought the game was really bad. I like to laugh out loud, it was not one. "Not Another Teen Movie" was not funny, but there were much more funny scenes in it than Totally Awesome. “Scary Movie” is very funny. I always laugh when I watch these super pleasant ones. This film is not funny.
