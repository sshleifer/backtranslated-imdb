With the exception of the glossy look, this show did not recommend much. The letter was patronizing and confusing. Without exception, all the characters were shallow and not sympathetic. Female characters have gone bad from the worst ... turned into pampered, selfish giddies, whose ambitions in the soul are to run around in formal dresses and stiletto heels and try to dress a man. This aspect is even more curious because the series was filmed by two women! For the most part, acting was dull and unhappy: the actors played one-dimensional characters attacking each scene on the same note. This is not really the fault of the actors. If they had spent more time developing the characters and storyline, adding a small injection of style and humor, MVP could be a hit. What we have left is something flat and vaguely unpleasant.
