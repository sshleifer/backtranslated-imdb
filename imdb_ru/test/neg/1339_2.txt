Saw this movie last night. Usually I do not comment, good or bad, because I think that films are like books that have something for everyone, and everyone has different tastes, Yadda Yadda. This film was bad. By the end, I thought, oh god, this is a test of my patience. How many women actually look and live like that when they reach the bottom, and if I could just borrow some money from my mom and make my dreams about clothes design come true - damn it, life would be great! I was on a good shoot with a girl (my dear hubby loves to watch movies together, and I knew it wasnâ€™t his business), something light and easy to feel, but it was one bad movie. We are smart and interesting viewers, and this film was not like that. Annette Benning is a great actress, she clings to herself. Bad. Bad.
