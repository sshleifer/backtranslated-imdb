This film is a backward, cheap film that is trying to become a stunning film, because the characters are looking for a pot, but none of them is a smoker, just a bunch of garbage. Thomas Hayden no longer needs to make a film, especially this film, which is a waste of the film. People who liked this movie gave good comments, but of all those present here, some are simply backward and do not watch movies, so they think that any bad movie is good, the actors suck, and the movie sucks eggs. <br /> <br /> I think many people will be upset because this film is trying to look like the best weed film, when it's just the worst weed film I've ever seen, I hope that people they won't let a director direct shit, as even weed can't make this movie fun or interesting.
