Zzzzzzzzzzzz. This one was obtained directly from the jaws cookie mold, with some other fancy stamps added for good measure. It was interesting for me to look at it after I found a photo from a book about Italian horror films, and wow ... I think I got what I deserved! <br /> <br /> Very sluggish and talkative, most of this movie about the shark killer takes place on land, which is not surprising. It seems the only way to show a shark is to shoot a shark in an aquarium. The shark is never in the same frame as any of the actors, and this is very bad ... most of the characters are so annoying that you really want to be eaten. <br /> <br /> The problems of the “plot” are a group of four children who once meet a mysterious Indian on the beach and fry sausages. The Indian, for some reason, gives them an ancient artifact that will allow them to track down the ancient evil that took the form of a giant shark to attack their tribe ... presumably because they were too good at catching the ocean and the ocean god was worried that they will take all the fish. Or something like that. <br /> <br /> This is also good because you don’t know about it ... years later a monstrous shark appears and begins to devour people in a sleepy seaside community. When the shark eats one of the four guys, the other three are determined to kill this thing ... especially since (the big shock here) the authorities killed the shark and believe that the threat is over. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Mandatory death scenes are incredibly tiring, and you can see them go for a mile (my favorite was a girl who fought with her boyfriend while they were in the van, then jumps out and says, "I will go swim. ”(Immediately I would be consumed by the waiting shark.) They had a lot of courage to call this film“ Deep Blood, ”since you barely see anything, just cloudy water. The actors cope with their roles as if they were all big fingers, and there is even a funny storyline that includes a fat, rock type bad guy who It threatens our good heroes, heroes, and then becomes good to help kill the shark. It took me a long time to find this film, it is rather unclear, so I don’t think there is a danger that too a lot of people will spend their time on it. However, if you are lured into it ... do not say that you were not warned!
