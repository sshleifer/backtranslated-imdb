A man comes to the office of the psychiatrist Dr. Sammael (Joan Severance), who claims that he is the demon Asmodeus (Kane Hodder), the torturer of the 13th level of hell, and he would like to say strange things. He says he made a deal with Lucifer to become human again. He must slaughter his virgin sister, Mary Elizabeth (Alison Bree), on the day their mother died, and she must kill six people and deliver the Antichrist, and then he would run away from the pit and be reborn. When Mary Elizabeth becomes pregnant, her tense and abusive sister Katherine (Denise Crosby) does not believe that she is a virgin, but their father and former obstetrician Albert Martino (James Callahan) inspects her daughter and sees her intact hymen. In the meantime, the Church will learn the truth about Mary Elizabeth's pregnancy and send the priest and former military father Anthony (Eddie Veles) to spy on Maria Elizabeth. It is dominated by the fetus and she is forced to kill truck driver Lars (Joerg Sirtle), who is the lover of her tenant and friend Jennifer (Azalea Davila), as well as Jennifer herself eat their hearts and drink their blood, but she believes that she has nightmares during an ultrasound, she realizes that she is carrying a monster, and asks her father to end the pregnancy. But it's too late. <br /> <br /> Horrible “Born” is a B-movie (actually a Z-movie), which is considered to be a great movie. The result is a pretentious and disappointing production, with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and terrible action and direction. The plot is a complete mess: there is a priest, a hired killer and a former soldier; a demon in an existential crisis, going to a psychiatrist; a father who checks his daughter's virginity; two female demons (succubus?) who stand naked like statues, covering their gender with both hands; a character who is a whore, and exists only to expose her beautiful body. There are many scenes with free and cheap nudity. But the worst is an acting game: the unknown leading actress Alison Bree is historical, with funny voices and grimaces. I'm sorry, Mrs. Alison Bree, but I hated your annoying performance. I did not recognize Joan Severans, who has good performance because I still had the image of her youth. Denise Crosby plays a hateful character and, like everyone, she has aged, but she is still a good actress. I believe that if the writer and director included some kind of dark humor and suggested that this film is a B-film, the story could work better and better. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “About Anti-Cristo” (“Anti-Christ”)
