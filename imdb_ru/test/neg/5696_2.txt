So this is a space film. But this is a low budget. You ask, "how about effects?" The effects are sometimes good and sometimes very bad. I mean bad. And notice, I started with effects. <br /> <br /> There is a story here, but it is told in that, I think, the wrong order. I do not mean the wrong order in the style of Tarantino. I mean, it is said in a completely meaningless order. Much of the story is about the mother (in the future because you know it is scientific), as her daughter tells, which is basically a story told from a daughter's point of view. Only when you pass the first hour and hear Paul Darrow's voice as a computer, will you understand how much more tolerable the constant story would be if he read it. This plot is so constant and inclusive that the actors on the screen hardly speak a word during the first hour. <br /> <br /> There is also a lesson for you and novice directors: if you are not acting in 2001 and want to have some action (it does), then PLEASE hire a good combat choreographer. Otherwise, your fights will look, well, like in BATTLESPACE. And note that the title has the word "battle." Ugh. <br /> <br /> I think that this could be a classic scenario of making a film based only on a concept. And some effects. My biggest surprise is that IMDb has placed this film at 1.8 million dollars. When you compare it with something like PRIMER, which showed itself better with a budget of several thousand, you understand that in low-budget filmmaking the whole story is about. I did not expect much - but I was still disappointed. Two out of ten stars.
