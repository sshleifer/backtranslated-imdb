This film is sometimes called "The Story of O-Pt.2", which tries to impersonate the sequel (a kind of) of the French erotic thriller S & M "The Story of O". Although I have never seen the original version, I did see this pathetic mixed bag of sexual and social policy. I assume that the angle 'O' comes from the random overtones of S & M (which have never been so obvious (and unpleasant to view) as in 'The Mistress'). Klaus Kinsky is the only recognizable person in this French / Japanese production (but says that his lines are in English - at least in the version I saw). Excessive use of surrealism only makes this boring example in pseudo-even more pretentious (what are they trying to prove with the image of a piano floating in water?). It is obvious that after all the “porn chic” tendency in the movies died down (uch, sorry, bad pun!) around 1975, producers had to scrape the bottom of the barrel trying to please the connoisseurs of adult movies, not to mention the Foreign / Art Cinema moviegoers had to contend with such a tree as The Last Woman, and with others like this.
