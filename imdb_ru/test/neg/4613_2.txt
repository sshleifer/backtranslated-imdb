Following the classic 1970s Carrie horror movie with this proposal, this is similar to how Ford follows Mustang with Edsel. This film was terrible in every detail. It would have been called “Beverly Hill 90210” and it meets “Mystery Science Theater 3000”, but both of these performances far exceed this jester This film was hardly a horror movie. I counted on 3 minutes of blood and 90 minutes of bullying mats and rituals in high school. Wow, what a surprise, Carrie’s strange friend commits suicide! Wow, Carrie misinterprets her love interests! Wow, the crowd is setting up Carrie! Wow, athletes have a sexual assessment contest! This film needed more action and much less tired teen stamps. This movie is completely unavailable for viewing.
