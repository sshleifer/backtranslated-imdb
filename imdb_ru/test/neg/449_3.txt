Larry is an excellent example of the Democratic Party in the United States, of which he is a convinced member. King used to be somewhat honest and impartial, and he had many guests. The party used to be centrist too, but it was a different era. Now, like Larry, this is the far left. <br /> <br /> At least 90 percent of all the guests on the King’s show last year or two are liberals who sit there and beat President Bush and all conservatives that they might think about ..... night over night Bill Mahar, one of the most viscous - and you can look at it - the most frequent guest in the history of the King's TV show. You can count on the fact that other frank left wingers will attend King’s show every week, but don’t wait for the Conservative. They are few, and they are far from each other. <br /> <br /> King was also one of the innovators of undue media influence. It all started with O.Ya. Simpson trial. Night after night after night is all you have ever seen in the mid-90s. Whatever the latest gossip about Anna Nicole Smith, or the murder of Petersen, or Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, or any other tabloid subject, you can bet that Larry will defeat him to death. Unfortunately, all other networks are doing the same thing now. Larry was a leader in this regard. <br /> <br /> King also has the courage to sometimes give advice, such as marriage. I am not kidding; I heard him say that. The joke is that he was married and divorced half a dozen times! This man has little doubt, believe me. When it comes to morality, he is ignorant. Maybe that's why he has Dr. Phil to regularly explain some facts from his life to him. Larry will nod, but he understands nothing more than when Billy Graham was talking to him. <br /> <br /> King also glorifies the softball interview, that is, he does not ask complicated questions. This is largely due to the fact that most of his guests are his political convictions. People know that they like to watch a PR concert at the King’s show. <br /> <br /> All this meant a serious downgrade in the past five years. People see through him and his mentality of liberal tabloid television and switch from King and CNN to Fox News.
