Stay away from this movie. The fact that you read reviews tells me that you may already be spoiled by the horror that it carries. This is really a terrible movie ... so let's get down to the problems. Writing and directing: I won’t be surprised if they are handled by a group of over-active students who watch “cry” and “I know what you did last summer” several times. GIANT EARTHING plot hole holes abound; although I cannot congratulate them on this film, it is nice to know that they are finally accustomed to the pot. Actors (or lack thereof): Only the best for this film ... the best additions that have ever graced the screen, now starring in the debut of their acting role! As a disclaimer, I must point out that I am able to watch and enjoy almost anything. I recognize a good movie when I see it, but I can still giggle and grin during the Bubble Boy (yes, guys, this is true); so when I say to avoid something, you KNOW that I am not joking.
