Well, I recently saw George Zucco in at least four separate horror / suspense films while I was making my way through various collections of 50 packs, and I have to say that the guy had a limited range, but he was good at he did. He was not Karloff, but the PRC was lucky that he got it. <br /> <br /> But the poor fellow was stuck in some kind of backstage ghetto of horror films, and he was not good enough to take them to the next level of interest ... not in the subject — the bare scenarios, directing and budgets, under which he worked. This is the case here. <br /> <br /> This film is, for the most part, slow, heavy and uninteresting for the most part. The “heroine” seems doomed to become Judy Garland's “rent for the center,” the “hero” is ruthless like white rice, and the poor creature who plays the monster does not even get a good transformation scene. His makeup effects are not at all scary - he looks like a bit more shaggy version of the farm hand, that's all. <br /> <br /> This is not a complete waste. Zucco looks good on camera, he chews landscapes, and at the same time he is able to pronounce several strongly affected and contrived speeches, without flinching and not losing the flow. Here and there there are some capricious black and white shots that are not completely lame. <br /> <br /> So in general ... this film helped some actors of level "C" - "Z" pay rent for another month, and it never falls below a certain level of quality. Take a look once if you like George Zucco, or just feel the need to see every wolf movie ever made.
