I love this show. I watched every episode last year. I bought a DVD. And I tune in to watch tonight, and I see that for some reason you have converted this great show. And you took what made it work, and destroyed it. You removed one of the best aspects of the show, which was 4 friends. Sam, Sally, Lizzy and Piper. I love other characters, but they are good in small doses, such as Derek, Darcy and even Sally. Itâ€™s like a show that has lost part of its family, and everyone else is trying to fill it. This is an overdose. While everything is funny in small doses, when you are constantly exposed to it, it turns from funny to annoying. I was so looking forward to the return of this show. Therefore, please return the charm. Even if you can't squeeze Piper into the show, at least bring Lizzy back. But I loved these girls. They brought fun. The show was about Sam trying to live his business life, as well as his personal life and friends. It was a charm. And this great dog too. <br /> <br /> I hope the network (FOX) has forced the authors to do it, and the writers did not want to do it from the show. I'll give the show a couple more episodes before I give up, but tonight the episodes were bad. I made a big deal from the show that came back tonight, and I had people, and I felt like a fool, because no one laughed, except 2-3 times. I apologized to them and said that I did not know what had happened. And about 10 minutes after the episode, I realized that they were not going to show Piper or Lizzy, and it was no longer necessary to watch a television comedy.
