I liked this movie 10 years ago, when I was about 16 years old. My biggest mistake was to watch it again, 10 years later. These are not the worst films "I want to be a pilot," but there are so many flaws in it that you can hardly miss them. <br /> <br /> Queen "One Vision" (along with the rest of the soundtrack) makes this movie better than the usual patriotic nonsense you usually see;) <br /> <br /> [**** - -----]
