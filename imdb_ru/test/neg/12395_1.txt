College students (who are actually over twenty) on a campus in Boston (which is strangely similar to the Isle of Man) are threatened by a ferocious monster (gathered during the episode of Blue Peter). A new teacher has to save the day (although he really ... Oh, who cares?) <br /> <br /> I will start with some good things ... there is a good picture from Eastenders new gal Samantha Janus can a campus soul in a mandatory scene with her best friend Katie Lawrence. A bit of minor detail: Katie was hired when she arrived to audition with her sister, as well as the moral support of her sibling, but in the end got the role. Oh, joy. Chosen from obscurity, to ... highlight her stubborn buttocks in a meaningless scene added to drown out, and then die 30 minutes later because of her troubles. Her last (and the only other well-deserved role) is Internship No. 5 in Atonement. I wondered if she looked at Keira Knightley (assuming that extras and stars can mix) and was surprised: where did everything go wrong ?! <br /> <br /> I'll give you some advice, Katie: If all other British actors are asked to speak with an American accent in a doomed attempt at mass marketing, and the only person who can control this is American bi-fiction veteran Bi-bi Todd Jensen, you know, you have a problem. If you look at the payroll receipt, and it only covers your lunch and bus ride home, you won’t play a major role in a movie with a trillion-dollar budget. If the premiere is accompanied by many members of the family of the fourth assistant director and causes dashing laughter when a Stickyback monster penetrates the sewers, then it should be clear to you that this is not Alien. Or even Critters IV, if you think about it. So, Katie, in your next life (I'm a Buddhist, you understand), you may be more selective in choosing your debut character, rather than impulsively jumping into the first pile of shit that stands before you. Flashing skin in your first movie does not guarantee long-term success. Unless you are Sylvester Stallone. And he had a script for Rocky to support him. <br /> <br /> In every sense and purpose, it’s like a 0/10 movie I've ever seen. However, for pure unintended laughter and pure value of the camp, he gets 1. Well done;)
