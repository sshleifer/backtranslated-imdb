This game is from the genre of games in which they tried to benefit from the whole trend inspired by Mist - to walk around, communicate with people, solve puzzles. The puzzles themselves are absolutely terrible, but I will stick with the game itself, which is only a little better. If you are looking for a convincing performance from any one character, you will not find it here, but this game is worth buying, if only you will witness Christopher Walken's truly cheerful performance. His game is so terrible in this game that it seems that he imitates the one who turns out to imitate him. He's a caricature of himself. <br /> <br /> So buy this game if you are a masochist, a Walken fan, or just want to hear a lot of the F-word.
