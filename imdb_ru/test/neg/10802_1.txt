But at least this film got what it deserved — to be sent to Love Satellite for the ridicule of Mike, Tom Servo and Crow T. The Robot from Pearl Forrester in Mystery Science Theater 3000! those long-lost, forgotten films that are so bad that in the future you are guaranteed to have nightmares or depression. Although the film is not that old, it is still a very forgotten type of film. If in the “Mystical Scientific Theater 3000” this would not have been for smart minds, the film would not only not have seemed the way it was, but would not have been very pleasant for us, moviegoers. <br /> <br /> In real life: this film is really bad. In the Satellite of Love: this film is excellent!
