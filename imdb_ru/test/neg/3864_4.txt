This is the first time when I feel the need to comment on IMDb, write some kind of review, and, as often happens, this is not because of a really great movie, but really awful. <br /> <br /> Take a narrative style that the youngest may have to do with the Max Payne video game series, actors who are hardly combined (which is not bad in itself), bad dialogues, some dark scenes, but not enough, and make a movie of it. Don't worry about a bad game, a duration (too long), no diving (the main character should be one of the most interesting ones I've seen in a long time â€” don't care if he dies) or often the ridiculous solutions they find certain problems in which It proves the protagonist. <br /> <br /> I would not have written anything if there had been no other review here, giving him 10 stars. I gave him four, but maybe three are closer to what I feel about this. Not only do I not want to see it again, but the mere thought of it makes me dangerously close to wanting to kill myself. Oh, and the so-called film noir - nothing without a good soundtrack - that's not the point. The final song sounds as if it is more suitable for a western film. <br /> <br /> This is not romance, this is not an action movie, this is no noir, this is not good. This would be my review if there were not at least 10 lines.
