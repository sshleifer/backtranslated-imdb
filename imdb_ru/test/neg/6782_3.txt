Some folk friends recommended it, but the film lacks originality. I found that the characters are unflattering stereotypes, and the plot is predictable almost from the very beginning. However, if you like traditional English / Appalachian ballads, it will keep your interest long enough to hear the next. I also read that the soundtrack does not look like music in a film with professional musicians replacing the actors.
