Boyle Heights, Los Angeles: the legendary South American vampire sucking a goat, El Chupacabra, is at large, eating everyone unlucky enough to cross his path. Navarro's animal control officer (Eric Alegria) and Chupacabra expert / author Starlyn Divide (Elina Madison) are trying to track down the creature, but discover that their progress is hampered by a pair of stupid policemen hungry for money from local residents seeking to catch the beast for a fat award and a couple nasty scientists who want a monster for their experiments. <br /> <br /> Smelly higher than a two-week taco, El Chupacabra is an incredibly bad horror movie that even fans of incredibly bad horror movies can struggle to sit down. With his horrible script, horrible direction (not one but two worthless scribblers ?? Brennon Jones and Paul Winn), ridiculous dialogue, and some of the worst acting films on this side, I recommend this movie about as much as I Drink tap water in mexico. <br /> <br /> As Navarro and Starlin continue their inquiries, viewers are treated with incredibly weak blood, the worst book jacket in history, the most unconvincing dead person I've ever seen. visible from the time of the flickering corpse of Dr. Butcher and a high-tech computerized security system consisting of a keyboard nailed to a pole. <br /> <br /> To be honest, for a guy in a rubber suit, the monster itself is rather creepy (hairy, with large claws and a face that looks like a particularly ugly bat), but its appearance is small and far away, with a lot of time spent on boring trials and adversities of the whining Officer Navarro than on the deadly antics of a title creature (how many times does Navarro need to see his bitch boss in paper work?). <br /> <br /> If you, like me, make a mistake, spending your hard-earned money on this terrible Latin American hold (in my case it was a whole 50 pence) consider using the disc as a stand for your tequila, not just watch her.
