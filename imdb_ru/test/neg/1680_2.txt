An elite American military team, which, of course, includes two pretty women and a guy who doesnâ€™t quite understand the teamwork, a lot of bats, some terrorists and a special forces team that acts like a gang that cannot shoot straight - everything is messed up conspiracy with a mediocre game. This one is nothing special. Characters are not convincing. Even an environment that has great potential looks like something from the middle of rural Pennsylvania, rather than an exotic boreal forest in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> Bats certainly look fierce. They can even lift a person and fly with him a few feet (harpies?) Or chop off a hand. You see Delta forces surrounded by hundreds of bats with guys shooting at them with machine guns and pistols, and the bat falls to the ground. It would be like trying to shoot rifle plates from a distance of 3 feet. Totally ignorant. The dialogue is incredibly unrealistic, jokes and flirts between boys and girls in the midst of the tense parts of the mission. One of the team members was blown up by a mine, and the first at the scene just looks at his body sadly, stunned, not even bothering to hide or secure the territory. In fact, AFTER the rest of the group appears, he talks about how the territory looks like a minefield - thanks for the headache. <br /> <br /> If you need a contrast in how a horror movie with a small military group can be well done at a low-budget check Outpost. The harvest is not the movie you want to watch. Actually, I think I'm going to give him two instead of three if I can get through the second half. It seems unlikely at this stage.
