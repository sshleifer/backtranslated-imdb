For me, this film is essentially like a pilot episode for a television series. This is especially reminiscent of the British remake of the series "Wallander" with Kenneth Brannah in the lead role. People interviewed by the police are hardy and often as bitter as the weather, the main investigator has enormous family problems, investigations invariably lead to cruelties of the distant past, and the plot is a labyrinth with strange incidents and scenes that only make sense at the end, Both have excellent cinematography. <br /> <br /> The plot of Jar City is extraordinarily reminiscent of the standard series about crimes in the UK or the USA. In fact, you could take the plots of any of the episodes of "Touch of Frost" and transfer them over the bleak locale in this film and get a spectacular sequel. <br /> <br /> Indeed the script could not be more obvious from the cookie. You have even the most familiar motives, such as the police, going to the local prison to interview a dangerous and dangerous psychopath, which inevitably explodes at the end of the interview. <br /> <br /> I’m absolutely sure that for many people this is buns and jam, but I feel that I need to point out people like me who don’t go to the movies to watch TV. What I felt was acutely flawed was the message. The theme of the film used genetic research in Iceland. Genetically, Icelanders remain largely isolated from the outside world, providing scientists with an excellent opportunity to study their genetics. Much information was stored regarding the heredity of the population, and many genetic diseases unique to Iceland can be effectively traced to a population that has refrained from crossing and is surprisingly genetically homogeneous (it's like trying to assemble a mosaic from the London subway map, rather than from the field of daisies). The company deCODE genetics tried to create a database containing all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of Iceland. Due to confidentiality considerations, this project was terminated, and at the end of last year, the deCODE genetics went bankrupt in Iceland. Episode - a rich topic for discussion. <br /> <br /> But in this film, genetics and medical science are not for the sake of education, but for a strange atmosphere. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible film if you are interested in this, and there is often a painful attention to food to accompany events, like a coroner who eats dinner between cuts. The most unpleasant thing for me was when the lead inspector devours a sheep's head. Unfortunately for me it sometimes became a farce. The film attempts to do the rather delicate task of blending the terrible with the sentimental, and ultimately delivers an unintended humor to an end. This is equivalent, from a cinematic point of view, to trying to prepare a fugu, if you are not qualified, hand-shaking and visual acuity, you are poisoning the client. This rather novice director had to lower the tariff for his performance. <br /> <br /> I came out of this film, feeling pretty bad about myself and life in general.
