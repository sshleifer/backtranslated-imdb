This film preaches a lot of time against marijuana. However, the plot and visual effects are so insane that it is more like a child poster for LSD. <br /> <br /> The plot: Michael's heroic struggle when he fights his drug addiction by being humiliated by such as Winnie the Pooh and Papa Smurf. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, there is a good message, but it is hidden by the fact that the authors took the rather stale idea of ​​PSA and tried to extend it to 30 minutes. This includes a sequence of songs where you are told that there are a million rational ways to say “No!”, For example, “I cannot smoke weed, I have homework!” <br /> <br /> Authors cannot decide on what to do with the characters they brought for royalty. First, we see that they all have to hide from human characters, but after five minutes we see that they all run in plain sight, and no one notices them. Soon they begin to interact with the human composition, and the only one who is even a bit concerned about this fact is not the drug addicts, but the little sister who talks to her teddy bear (Pooh, by the way.) In addition, there is a little drug addict floating around. Because you know, pushers do not give children drugs. He is also ambiguous - although he may be a symbol of Michael's addiction and, therefore, should not be seen by other people, he later goes and stalks little Corey in order to force HIM to take drugs. So I think he ... uh-uh ... moves on! <br /> <br /> The whole plot finally ends with some kind of insane sequence in which Michael seems to be taking place on Saturday morning carnival of souls, he is also a theme park from hell, where various cartoon characters beat him, ignore him and all that For example, Miss Piggy eats him in a sandwich and spits it out. If the writers were not tall when writing this, I should recommend them to try to get up, because they cannot become crazier than that. Of course, the film ignores the fact that Michael had maxima for two years at this point, so why this sequence of blackouts would frighten him is beyond my power. <br /> <br /> I understand that I completely hunt for this film, but in fact I just saw it again because I had to track it on eBay because it’s just a shame to be a BAD cartoon. The level of unintended humor is brilliant. Take, for example, this scene - Michael's dad rummages in the fridge for a beer. He notices that many of them are missing, and mentions this to his wife. A constantly watching mom says to him: "Don't worry, you probably just drank them last night while watching football." Although we obviously should have known that Michael was drinking beer (in addition to pot and crack), we read on and understand instead: “Hey, kids, it's normal to have chemical addiction while you're an adult - up! Scenes like this cost the tiny price tag of this film. Oh yes, and the fact that you hear Simon Chipmunk say "Marijuana."
