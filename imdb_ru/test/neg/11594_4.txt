This is similar to a textbook on zoology, given that its image of animals is very accurate. However, here are a few details that seem to have been slightly modified during the transition to the film: <br /> <br /> - Pistol bullets never hit the giant Komodo dragons. No matter how many times you shoot a Komodo, the bullets just do not fit him. <br /> <br /> - The best way not to be eaten by a giant Cobra or a giant Komodo dragon, just stand there. The exception to this rule is that you are told to stay still, in which case you must run away until Komodo is near you and then you must stand there waiting for defeat. <br /> <br /> - A few minutes of intermittent time-lapse video for captions really gives you the pleasure of watching. <br /> <br /> - $ 5,000 is a tool for improving memory, as well as a sufficient replacement for losing a boat license / arrest. <Br /> <br /> - Members of elite army units do not see the giant Komodo dragons until they are within one meter of huge creatures. Perhaps the computer nature of these dragons is somehow related to this. <br /> <br /> - When shooting a news article, the purpose of which is to expose illegal animal tests, a reporter and camera operator are all you need; Sound equipment, second camera, microphones, etc. - all superfluous. <br /> <br /> - When you hear a loud cry of an animal, and one person has a gun, he should take it out and send it to the nearest person. <br /> <br /> - When you reach for the gun, you hear the sound of removing the fuse, even if your finger is far from the fuse. <br /> <br /> - Reporters agree to go halfway around the world to expose something - having no idea what they are exhibiting. Basic research and vague knowledge is not in vogue in modern journalism. <br /> <br /> - In one clip, the pistols hold no less than 52 bullets, and then more than the next. Despite this, those who have weapons claim that they will need more ammunition. <br /> <br /> Dear cameras (also remember that the reporter has only one camera) are regularly left behind, without even thinking and regretting. These cameras are amazingly able to independently return to the reporter. <br /> <br /> - Blonde is really stupid. <br /> <br /> - The same girl who says do not enter the house, because the Komodo dragon can easily run through him, which makes him unsafe, takes the team into the building of the same material for protection - and no one says not a word about it. <br /> <br /> High-tech objects look like simple offices with chemical kits for schoolchildren. <br /> <br /> - Genetically modified snakes grow from a normal size to 100 feet during the day, but do not grow at all for several weeks on either side. <br /> <br /> - The military usually destroys entire islands when people do not comply with the deadlines for contact. <br /> <br /> - Men with weapons do not necessarily change the direction in which they are firing, when their target is no longer directly in front of them. Instead, they just keep shooting in the air. <br /> <br /> - The better you look, the more chances you have for the survival of giant creatures. <br /> <br /> - Women's intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn minds. <br /> <br /> - Every time when giant creatures hunt you, this is a great time to hit girls at half your age. <br /> <br /> - Animal noise corresponding masking noise for "curse" at the same volume. <br /> <br /> - The US military regularly uses old Israeli and Russian aircraft.
