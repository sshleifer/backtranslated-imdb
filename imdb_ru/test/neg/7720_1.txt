How bad can you make a movie. A good question that House of the Dead 2 can answer. I could not believe that it was possible to get something worse than the first House of the Dead, but surprisingly, the director succeeded. The only feeling you get from the movie is that it’s bad, just bad. What with replay, bad FX and a silly story. This is a movie that gives a bad name to Z-Movies in general. Why couldn't they learn a lesson from the first film, “The House of the Dead”? Anyway, I think you already understood that you should not watch this movie. It's a waste of time. See “Bad Taste” or “Dawn of the Dead” if you want to see good zombies.
