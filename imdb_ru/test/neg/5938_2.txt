Maybe being a government bureaucrat is not the most glamorous way to make a living, but it's still a way to make a living. However, after watching this movie, you can leave, believing that every government official is a lazy, bloated, vain, paper pusher who lives solely to take part in his next lunch break. Not exactly a pretty picture, but this is a picture that viewers must endure, looking at nothing more than a tedious, noisy, replayed action movie. Just what the doctor ordered ... right? How many more of these films did Hollywood make? Thousand? Two thousand? The formula for creating these films is so knocked out in the dust that by now it should be completely unrecognizable. Language standards are changing, but the plots remain the same, with the same superficial character development and equally superficial action, as trained performers are asked to go into pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly. This film seemed endless. "When will this movie end?" I have repeatedly thought to myself. Leonardo DiCaprio was completely incredible as an employee of the CIA, but, oddly enough, one of the main shortcomings of the erroneous forecast is that the overweight Russell Crowe is played by the CIA bureaucrat. Please note that in this film the operative on the site is “thin and mean”, and his desktop jockey supervisor is thick. This is called stereotypes. What did the casting director think about? Why not Jack Nicholson to play an overweight office clerk? Or does Nicole Kidman play the awkward saleswoman of a department store? And the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary licenses could afford authenticity. Obviously non-Arab American (Mr. DiCaprio), trying to impersonate an Arabic ... speaking Arabic ... inventing all kinds of hair brain patterns that are doomed to failure ... trying to think and surpass the real Arabs, who are not at all amused by his laughable Arabian masquerade ... trying to find romance in a Palestinian woman, when she performs an extremely sensitive and complex spy mission ... etc. Now you understand the essence. Next time try to play a real Arab in this role. Even the most naive movie buff can't believe it. There must be a rough balance between the protagonist and the antagonist. In this film, the main character is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in ruins. The next stop for this movie is DVD Land and Oblivion. And one more thing. Do not let this film dissuade you from working for the government. Wages may not be very large, but the additional benefits are excellent, which is an important fact that this film conveniently omits.
