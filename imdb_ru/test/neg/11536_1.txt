Oh, this is the GREATEST fake car accident ever used in the cinema anywhere. <br /> <br /> Now all this is a rather serious mockery for the movie fan, who proudly shows the Police Academy, the Naked Gun, the National Lantern Weapon's Loaded Weapon and many other camping drives in his collection. But at least these people know that the language must be firmly seated on the cheek; the cast of PW unfortunately uses its own languages ​​in an attempt to deliver meaningless dialogue. And, despite the fact that almost beyond my faith, the film characters seem to think that they can actually do something of value. it would be a shame to release this mess as a pornographic back room. <br /> <br /> about .. ... lucky, I bought the worst video ever made at the same time ... "Demon Brotherhood" ... perhaps the name should have given me a hint.
