I am very surprised to see that this film has received even warm reviews, I found this film to be absolutely terrible. The plot hovers around, trying to decide whether it is a comedy or a thriller, and then realizes that it cannot achieve either. So he throws a towel and continues his absurd storyline, underlined by an unintentional hilarious scene with Laura Linney, an injection and spilled coffee, which makes the audience wriggle awkwardly in their seats, looking at each other as if it really is In fact, this is terrible and very disappointing for Robin Williams fans, and it makes you think that someone was blackmailing Laura Linney to add this piece of garbage to her respectable resume. I wanted to leave in 10 minutes and wanted to have it, even if I saw it for free. I wanted someone to pay me for my time. The computer crash / turn in this movie was embarrassingly stupid, and by the end you don't care who wins the election. I vote for direct DVD.
