Yash Raj films are so funny, what works do they follow, but are they called the best production house? <br /> <br /> Seeing working films of Bhatt, they copied the formula, bikini and everything else, and also shot such actors as Uday and Tanisha <br /> The film is so terrible that it makes you cringe. <br /> <br /> the jokes are so terrible and excited that they make you slap them. Make it look like a gay man plus a monkey <br /> <br /> Tanisha looks like an idiot <br /> <br /> The director thinks that we are all idiots Arjun Sablok takes the public for granted br /> Udai Chopra, like an idiot, pleases Tanisha looks like Kajol in K3g, if Kajol is annoying, then Tanisha is worse, the rest are fine
