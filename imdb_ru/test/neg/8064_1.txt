How bad is it? Well, compared to this film, the Cannibal Holocaust is Citizen Kane. This is nonsense, action, brutal dialogue, a semi-burnt plot and, like his companion, too much of a way to slaughter animals on the screen that was actually made. Unlike the Holocaust, Ferox is a direct film. It does not pretend to be a pseudo-documentary. In a sense, it helps producing, because the film is very sharp and clear compared to the grit of the Holocaust. Unfortunately, we are again given a group of people who are morally reprehensible. They torture the natives and, in fact, bring everything that falls on themselves. There is nothing in this film that is worth it. I was quite condescending to my review of the Holocaust because of some real attempt to make presentation and style, but in the case of Ferox there is no reason to watch this, unless you are crazy about blood and blood.
