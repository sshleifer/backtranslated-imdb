The book, although not particularly magnificent, was decent, but this film completely changes it. Many elements of the story are consistent between the book and the film, but Dr. Rossâ€™s character goes from a creatively written character who lives for money and ultimately causes a volcanic eruption with its greed to heart to it - a girl in trouble who will not do anything even if the slightest hint that this may be less noble. When movies change a book a lot but keep the same name, it should be a crime.
