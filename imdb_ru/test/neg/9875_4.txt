When Hulk got into cinemas in 2003, it was not long before DVDs appeared on the old TV show The Incredible Hulk in an attempt to cash in on this mod. We saw a similar event a year earlier, when the Spiderman cartoons appeared on the DVD, which coincided with the debut of this hero on the big screen. Companies get the opportunity to take advantage of the financial masterpieces of a popular brand. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the fact that this picture never appeared on the shelves of Wal-Mart, as its characters showed summer box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot. I guess everyone involved would just prefer to forget. To be honest, the Fantastic Four is not as bad as everyone says. Let me rephrase that. This is not as exciting as all of his negative reviews would suggest. <br /> <br /> Veteran television actor Alex Hyde-White (no, you don’t remember any of his roles) goes ahead, like Reed Richards, a brilliant scientist who, along with his team, gets unusual abilities after a failure in space. He has the ability to stretch and distort his body to incredible sizes. His future wife, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab), may suddenly become invisible, while her brother Johnny (Jay Underwood) can now ignite himself at will. In addition, there is poor Ben Grimm (Michael Bailey Smith), an attractive tip whose body turns into a mass of rocky orange stone. <br /> <br /> As soon as friends got used to all this, they are called upon to save the world from a certain chaos. It seems that Reed’s old colleague Victor von Doum (Joseph Culp) lives up to his name, and this villainous jeweler (Jan Trigger) doesn’t really help the old women cross the street. Can our heroes save the day? Of course they can; As with any superhero movie, the only question is how and when. <br /> <br /> In the “FANTASTIC QUARTER” it is striking how much it is amateur in almost all aspects. The dialogue is so lame and tired that it sounds like it was written in drama lessons. The game is so perfect that it makes the third-class soap opera look like Shakespeare. The special effects are surprisingly good, given the small budget, but there are still some positive embarrassing moments. For example, when the Human Torch completely ignites his body, the entire film turns into a cartoon for a short time. I can only hear this production meeting. “Oh, no one will notice. They will be too intrigued by the action! ”I mean really, a cartoon? At least give me a mannequin on fire, supported by a rope! Prior to this, the scene in which the four appear on the ground after the crash of their spacecraft is the net fare for teenagers in the backyard. The crew simply found the field and lit a fire that looked like a spaceship. Is this the only residue from such a major disaster? <br /> <br /> Of course, the script had nothing to work on. There is a fairly logical story, but everything is so simple. When Reed and Ben decide to go into space, they simply go to the Storms house and ask if they want to join them. It's really that simple? Don't such things require, oh, I don't know, years of training and experience? Not in the world of these authors, who seemed to be inspired by the underestimated genius shown in FULL HOUSE reruns. But no matter how bad it is, nothing can compare with how painfully cliché Dr. Doom is. He was pulled right out of these horrible cartoons about the superheroes of the 1960s, right up to evil laughter and banging his fist on the table to emphasize his remarks. In no comic, least of all in the Fantastic Four, there has never been such an obscene villain as one dimension. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the FANTASTIC FOURTH is saved from a full turkey because it is so damn innocent. You can say that the people involved, with as little talent or experience as they were, really tried. They did not know that the final result would be so embarrassing. They had the impression that it was their big break, that people would gather in theaters. It should be repeated that they practically had no money for work (and I am sure that half of this was eaten by the cool suit of Things). Considering all the circumstances, they did well, and, despite many shortcomings, the finished product gives a lot of pleasure to fans of comics.
