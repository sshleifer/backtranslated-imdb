The film starts relatively well and it seems that something happens when a passenger from the Afro-US sues the airline for negligence. There is one scene in which his beloved dog is sucked into the engine, and this is really sad. But the way it is portrayed makes it difficult to understand whether it was an attempt at rude humor or a tragedy to affect the degree of negligence? After that, they clearly ran out of ideas. If you are stuck long enough, you will soon be treated to one of the worst films that have ever been made. This is basically a racist series of smoking dopes, toilet humor, the style of each airplane segment, reflecting African-American pop culture and practically nothing else. You might think that only 3 white passengers on board will lead to some ridiculous consequences, but nothing like this happens. They were basically just added to show how bad they could have been initially treated, and then, if they behaved, they were taken to the hood. Avoid.
