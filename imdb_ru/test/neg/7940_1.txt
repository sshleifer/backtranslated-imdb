"The attack on the 13th plot" - the most stupid film that I have seen since the days of "Charlie's Angels 2". The shame is that they had a good cast and a good premise for work. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ......................................... .................... I know they said that this film is a descendant of the remake of Rio Bravo, but did the authors of this film really watch Rio Bravo? Besides the fact that Rio Bravo is a Western classic, the premise of the film was that the sheriff (John Wayne) had to keep a prisoner accused of murder from being released by his brother and his gang. Nobody wants to free anyone in Sturm in Division 13. They want ALL to be killed. So my first question should be this: WHY DON'T JUST BURN ALL THE PLACE DOWN FROM THE START? Why "attack" this place? I know that the plot of the plot was supposed to be smart and shocking, but it did not make sense and / or was presented correctly. If a police veteran participated in this from the very beginning, then why do you need this whole film? If a veteran policeman suddenly made a deal at the back door during a siege, how did he even get a chance? As soon as he appeared at the door, he would have been shot dead, and they would have an entry point. This is all just FUBAR. <br /> <br /> In what part of any city can there be a full-scale war at the police station (with helicopters and massive explosions), but no one notices that ?? However, as soon as the fire starts, they have to “leave before the fire service appears” ?????? How did they plan to hide the chaos that was happening outside? Does the police issue bullets in the walls, covers, traces, use of equipment and the fact that there will not be found the bodies of "bishop's people"? What about those police snipers? How could they miss so much so often? I like the fact that when two detainees tried to escape, the snipers were ripped off by two tiny snow mounds. As if it is impossible to shoot a powerful rifle through a pile of snow. <br /> <br /> The situation was interesting, albeit ridiculous, but the film just came off the cliff when they decided to kill this particular character with a bullet in the head, absolutely NO REASON. I know that the filmmakers were shocked, but all they got was an aversion to the cruelty and anger of the audience. Do you think that one of the reasons why this thing is bombed at the box office is the fact that everyone, by word of mouth, tells friends and family to stay away from it? This particular scene should be a big part of this word of mouth (this and the fact that every plot twist is dumber than dirt). The conclusion remains steadily stupid, as the villain pauses to deliver the diatribe-like Austin Powers, instead of killing the helpless people he finally captured. I know that some people mentioned the final scenes that take place in the woods of the city of Detroit (> giggles <), but why did Ethan’s character just wander into the forest first? He doesn't even look, will the SUV run away with the secretary and his friend? They just cut him slowly in the forest with a gun in his hand. Gack I could go on, but I will not. All I can say is that you want to avoid this nonsense at all costs.
