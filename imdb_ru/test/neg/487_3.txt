I did not expect a classic, but at least funny movie. There were only a few scenes that make you laugh, but no more. You are not afraid that it is full of clich√©s of American teens and you can guess that it will be easy. <br /> <br /> But it says a lot about a high school student in Turkey. The student selection pressure (OSS), when this 3-hour exam determines which university you will enroll, and it is no exaggeration to think about the exam when you need a ghost. The film is bad. Do not waste your time watching it.
