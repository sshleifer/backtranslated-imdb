I often wonder how such films are created at all, and the most shocking thing is that people pay to watch them. <br /> <br /> With Aksar, it seems that the director came up with a story when he walked together, adding twists and turns, when he loved, no matter how ridiculous. The script did not exist with empty dialogs such as “Joe Sheena Roy Pehenti Hi, Wahe Fashion Jota Hi” and “Ye Versace High Madame” (yes, that's right). <br /> <br /> Each of the characters was shallow and underdeveloped. It was terrible to act. Constumes (lycra for Udita and terrible costumes for chunky Emran), locales (numerous houses that were used for interiors did not even vaguely resemble a Victorian mansion), script, etc. D. And so on. Only one word is garbage. <br /> <br /> For those people who love Hashmi and his films, watch it. As for me, I will never get these two and a half hours ago. The only redemptive factor was the music, which was decent.
