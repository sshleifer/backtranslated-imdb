For those who want to learn something about the real Diane Arbus or appreciate the psychological truthfulness, this film is terrible. Arbus was a brilliant, talented, restless, and restless person, but this film portrays her as completely smug, and truly strange in her taste and judgment. Kidman portrays her weak and vague, while she was the one who confused people with his charisma. The completely fictional relationship that is central to the film is absolutely incredible, and Robert Downey is really annoyed by his grinning image of someone who seems to think that he is superior to the rest of the world simply because of his suffering. The film portrays this encounter as a source of Arbus’s interest in “freaks,” which is a truly commonplace inspiration for some of the greatest photographs of the 20th century. For me, the mystery is why people with some talent and intelligence decided in some way to participate in this film.
