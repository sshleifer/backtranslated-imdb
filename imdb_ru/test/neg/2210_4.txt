This film embodies the complete dumbness. Nevertheless, I have already seen this film several times and plan to watch it several more times, because, despite its absolute stupidity, it is very interesting. And he has one of my favorite hockey movie actors, Casper van Dean, who is here in all of his hockey film fame. Here Casper van Dean is fully Casper van Dean, and you have to love him for it. If he had not been in this film, it would have been a completely invisible recluse, or at least much more disgusting than she is now. <br /> <br /> The cough science used here has absolutely no meaning. altogether. No one in the world noticed this large asteroid approaching Earth, except this small group? Even if thousands, thousands and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers are constantly looking for just such a thing in the sky? Such a large asteroid would become quite obvious to anyone with a pair of eyes that is even dimly able to see. And a piece of asteroid bounced off the atmosphere, and no one even noticed it? The impact of such a large rock into the atmosphere would cause huge shock waves, which, in turn, would cause great damage to the surface of the planet. Of course, someone would notice such a thing. Bwahahaha! The “science” used in this film is so ridiculous that somehow it makes this film as exciting as it is. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed was that, despite the incredible heat, all the characters did not have a drop of sweat, and their clothes were completely saturated with them. At the most, the characters looked as if someone behind the scenes was easily sprinkled with a bottle of water to give them a "shine of sweat." Authenticity was not the * goal * to which this film worked hard and constantly. What gives this film an entertaining charm in a strange and funny way. <br /> <br /> Is it worth watching this movie? Definitely! Assuming, of course, you have absolutely no expectations from everything that even remotely approaches reality. And this is your desire to wallow and bask in complete turmoil at the moment.
