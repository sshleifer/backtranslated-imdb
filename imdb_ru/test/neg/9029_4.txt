Presumably, the “true story” of Juana de Castilla, the eldest daughter of Catholic Queen Isabella (yes, the one who funded the expedition of Columbus), the film tells about the progress and degeneration of her painful obsession with her husband, Archduke Philip of Austria, known as “Beautiful” (and played by Italian handsome Daniel Liotti is quite carefree in his oilseed and muscular manner. This is the stoningly familiar story of the end of the 15th century, the Beginning of the 16th century. intrigue, betrayal and deprivation. It drains destructive thirst from beginning to end. But while La Reine Margot succeeds in creating brutal sensuality and a ruthless, dizzying intrigue interesting to watch, Juana La Loca simply does not cope. It simply ends up feeling like a soap opera with a big budget, with a game below average, lazy or overly acute. Liotti looks positively boring, and Pilar Lopez de Ayala starring ?? although, honestly, can she grow into a real talent ?? it seems that he is trying too hard, switching from a fourth to a two-dimensional horny to a spoiled teenage tantrum. Some of the cast are in order, with the exception of Manuela Arcuri, another Italian charming, voluptuous and beautiful, but in fact there is no “actress” to talk about. In fact, I could not bring myself to feel any concern for any character, and in this regard I did not feel very negatively towards any of the alleged villains. What a waste of substantial film budget! Unfortunately, this film is so rhetorical and déjà-vu, nodding at other films in the genre, and not at the source material - the story - for inspiration. It seems to me that such a fascinating and complex historical epoch deserved to be called by a much superior director.
