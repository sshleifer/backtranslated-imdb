This game is a beautiful first person shooter. ----------- Wait ...... <br /> <br /> But, of course, a story should be told about this genre, so a rather innovative story about soldiers who are currently Drugs Lead To save the world and kill a terrorist, Nectar is the drug of choice that a super soldier creates. <br /> <br /> Great, now just give us some fun, challenging missions, add some great new weapons and free all-terrain vehicles that you can control at your leisure, and I will be very pleased. <br /> <br /> NO !!!! <br /> <br /> The creators of this game decided to create a propaganda war game that tries to understand our fears of terrorism and for democracy. There are distorted ideals in the game, which only reinforce the moral that we studied when we were in elementary school, they don’t say anything new to us, but "Drugs are bad ... mmmkay." Then pushed in type .... Ivan Eht Nnnioooojjjjj! (to join the fleet) on how to defend the common good, given the desire for normality and abnormality, right and wrong .... GOOOOOOOO WE GET IT! LET'S KILL SOMETHING !!!! <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> You can’t, you have to endure very long intervals between completing BULLSH tasks! T, such as "Run to Helicopter" ....... "Go to the group of troops" .. ... Then, as soon as this is completed ......... CINEMATIC takes over ... ...... You sit there for at least half of the game, watching the small script played by the characters, one of you CAN’T skip, but sit and wait, sometimes when people don’t even talk, we sit and wait for the landing helicopter! <br /> <br /> Bad game from a ridiculous group of programmers! Do not worry about creating another, because I’ll rather watch the movie!
