Now from all the shark movies that I saw, this one shoots a cake! The plot of the film was good, but after that the excitement factor was a little embarrassed. Antonio Sobato Jr. plays the role of a son who is looking for a shark that killed his father. Megaldon is one of the largest and most dangerous sharks. The shark view was really scary in some angles, but the effect was blurry, and in some places the scenes were a bit weak. If you had a mini-saba weapon, it would destroy an entire school of sharks. It was great that his son took revenge on this monster, although it would have really cost him his life. As they say, revenge has its price, but was it worth it? This answer could go on and on, and this film was a major disappointment. The beginning was good, but in the end everything went like on Titanic. 1 out of 5 stars!
