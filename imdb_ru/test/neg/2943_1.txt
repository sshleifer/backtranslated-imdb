At first I thought it was bad, because I had high hopes for this film, but after I thought it was so bad. I was almost captured by the promotion of bad stars hk in bad movies. A new generation of actors and actresses hk, not to mention the bad writers, destroys the industry. At the moment I'm still trying to figure out how gross it is so high. usually you can't play in a movie with Donnie Yen and Ekin (forget about Jackie, he's already behind). but then I have to find out when the twins were on the cover. it's funny, obscene, very trite, I try to laugh at some jokes, but the effect is not only very minimal, but the jokes are very processed and not funny. sorry i bought a movie. the only reason some people think it is so good is because they are brainwashed, the twins are cute, and everyone likes them, and that everything they do is good and funny. and that if you like twins, then you know ... <br /> <br /> take a breath ... I miss those good films when Jet Lee and Stephen Chow films dominated the box office ... br / > <br /> Movies from mainland China are much better than this, and they are shot for smaller budgets.
