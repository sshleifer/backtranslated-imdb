One of the worst things a film studio can do is use the tragedies of other people, commercializing the “shock” or “gore” factor to sell tickets, to be able to buy a new diamond necklace from their Birch trees. Another worst thing is to completely distort the true facts of the incredible saga, inventing events, dialogues and images at the discretion of the director. Finally, one of the worst things a film studio can do is to use actors at minimal cost and shoot it all on the sound stage, which is rented for fifty cents a day. In all these three parodies, the creators of this film are to blame. This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands. The grade "1" is too good for this waste of celluloid. Cinematographers not only should be ashamed of their creation, but also ashamed of the fact that they negatively exploit the heroes of this story - people who have experienced this tragedy first-hand, both the living and the dead.
