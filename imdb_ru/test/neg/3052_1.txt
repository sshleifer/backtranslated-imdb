Worst movie I've ever seen! 90 minutes of painful filmmaking. All the ingredients that make this movie a real CRAP job. Bad game, bad direction, bad storytelling, bad makeup, bad dialogue, bad effects and bad reasoning for certain actions taken by the characters. It also led to a terrible naked shot of a dumb blonde and a shot in the chest of a stupid Asian girl, and both attempts were terrible, as these girls are ugly. Some good horror movies came out of the 80s, but this can never be considered one of them. Kevin Tenney also committed one of the greatest sins in telling stories: he presented the characters at the end of the film (“The Old Man and the Old Woman”). I would vote for him below 1 out of 10, but the voting system, apparently, does not work that way. Right from the sequence of titles, I knew that it would suck, and I would return my DVD, but Best Buy will not refund DVDs or consumables, as they call them, or so it says in my receipt. I have “The Terror of Dunwich”, and it was truly awful, but I still feel that “The Night of the Demons” (the obvious Evil Dead) is much worse than the “Terror of Danwich”. This is just like “Howl”, how the hell can sequels be milked by this anorexic cow ??? Save your money and get "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (but don't get it continued), or "Evil Dead" or "Dawn of the Dead." "Night of the Demons" - a very, very, very bad investment. Every second of it was just unbearable, excruciating pain for the audience, because the whole movie was terrible! Do yourself a favor, DO NOT SEE IT! You will save some brain cells.
