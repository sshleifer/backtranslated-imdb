A few years ago, this film was scheduled to be shown on TCM UK as part of a Todd Browning retrospective. but in fact they showed a remake of 1937! did my brother watch him (and, looking back, follow the original scene behind the scenes, even down to the scenery) ?? although not a classic, he said it was a much more enjoyable browsing experience than an incredibly creaking early version ?? <br /> <br /> This is the first collaboration between Browning and Bela Lugosi, and I had high hopes for that ?? but they were canceled when, after the first video of a tedious conversation, it became obvious that the main task of the film was to calm down still sound technology, and, consequently, the result was scenic and extremely static. The plot of the thriller is also not quite exciting; even less appetizing is the British-Indian setting (with touched character accents and upper class behavior - not to mention the overuse of commonplace idiosyncratic idioms, such as “I say,” “rather,” and “now see here”). “Rendering the most risky more than anything else)! <br /> <br /> In addition, there are several unintended screams: Margaret Whiterley (as a fake intermediary) implores Police Inspector Lugosi (in any case, his undeniable presence on the screen is already obvious) to give her time to “find out”, Who is actually the culprit of double murder (evidence indicates her own daughter, played by Leila Hyams!) ?? she hears a knock and misleads, thinking that the spiritual world has really come into contact with her, but then Lugosi enters the room and with her unmistakable accent directly tells her: “I knocked twice, you did not hear” me! », On which my brother and I almost fell to the floor in convulsions of laughter !! Editing is also very inaccurate: during a single shot of the main angle from a large angle, the microphone is quickly pulled out of the camera's range ?? and what's worse, there are a couple of cases when a person goes beyond the screen, allegedly in the next frame, to another part of the set, but each frame is held by other actors for an absurdly long time, so it is forever that this person will pass only a few steps !! <br /> <br /> THE THIRTEENTH CHAIRMAN celebrates the third, not terrible, Browning speech that I watched ?? even if this and “Wonders for sale” (1939) deal with murder and the occult and, therefore, can be associated with the genre. Much has been said about the apparent weakening of the director with the arrival of Sound: however, although they may be mistaken, 4 consecutive horror films that he shot during the 30s are infinitely better than the rest ?? which I have always found stylish and bizarre enough to suggest that Browning was not at sea in that period, how was it supposed ??
