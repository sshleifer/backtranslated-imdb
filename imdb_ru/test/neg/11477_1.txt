This is absolutely the worst comedy I've ever seen. Although it is difficult to explain, because (if you have not seen it), I bet, you have never seen a comedy that would not be good or bad; it is only there (This is the original part - not good or bad, only there)! <br /> <br /> Let me say that I have seen every comedian playing a major role, and he likes everything. That's what makes it such a mystery. The supporting leads actually function (although the dialogue is bad). The only character who is pretty good is the one played by John Goodman. He does a pretty good deal with the little dialogue he has, and actually has one funny line (I won’t spoil the only funny line in the film if you decide to watch it anyway. It has a pancake.) Are the main leads . I will not call them characters because they were not designed. This scenario is so juvenile that they do not even bother to give the lead fictitious names. They all just use their own. It seems they are not even trying to act. It’s as if they are all reading out loud to each other the scripts that the local junior class sent them. In fact, I wrote such an article for my English when I was thirteen years old — that was not funny either. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, just don't worry about it. It's not funny. It's not even the kind of bad dialogue that you can moan. I just sat and watched it all. It was so boring that I could not even cope with some irritation. I can't imagine how this even gets a grade of 4 here.
