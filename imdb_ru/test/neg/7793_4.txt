Looks like this is one of Noel Kowar's lesser-known films, and it's easy to see why. In fact, this is a good film, but there is nothing to worry about. Nothing special happens throughout the film, it's just a story about the ill-fated novel of Chris and Leonora and Barbara's reaction to it. The only thing that makes the film interesting is the fact that we already know that for one reason or another it will end badly because of the first scene. Strangely enough, in history there are many excellent opportunities for conflict, and yet none of them is used. For example, it would be much more interesting and plausible if Barbara had a falling out with Leonora, but instead they remained on good terms throughout the film. The notion that Barbara was betrayed by her friend was not studied at all - in fact, she did not even feel betrayed by her husband; she even encourages him to go on vacation with Leonora. Similarly, the two secretaries of Chris in his practice, Susan Birch and Tim Werney, who also turned out to be close friends of Chris and Barbara, are never forced to take sides. In fact, Tim dodges the conflict by telling Chris that he loves him and Barbara terribly. Despite the strange lack of conflict, the biggest flaw in the film is the fact that we don’t care if Chris Leonora or Barbara ends. The identities of the two women are in any case indistinguishable, so we don’t know which one is better for communicating with Chris, and, moreover, Barbara’s permissiveness gives the impression that she still hardly cares about this matter. In addition, I found the relationship between Chris and Leonora somewhat inconclusive. I can miss the ridiculously short time in which they fall in love with each other, because it is so common in the films of this era, but even then the relationship seemed superficial. The character of the Coward was too strict and cynical to be the object of Leonora's attachments. He reminds me of the socially inept genius of Sir Ernest Pisa from the movie “Very Important Person” - I am sure that these two would get along well. Chris's coldness and severity made his love for Leonora more insincere. I think that Coward had to sit through this and give his role to a young man - since this, I constantly wondered what this young beauty saw in such a gloomy, mostly unfeeling, balding middle-aged man. Despite all my criticism, the film still manages to be interesting - just not very convincing. The fact that none of the characters is particularly well developed gives them a mysterious nature, which is somewhat intriguing. “Surprised Heart” is definitely worth a look, but this is the wrong part of the movie.
