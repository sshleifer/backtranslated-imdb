I love strange animations, I love a lot of Asian films, but I didn’t like this particular Japanese product. Fuccons is supposedly an American family (all of them are mannequins) who moved to Japan and to some extent belong to the family of sitcoms of the 50s, with times a little more modern feelings. There are some very short episodes on the DVD (for example, less than 5 minutes each?), And I find it neither funny, nor funny, even in a strange way. I'm not sure what this appeal is. God, someone picked up some satire, damn it, but the satire is usually a little funny, isn't it? And nothing of what I saw or heard, did not appreciate even a small smirk. I took it used, and it certainly sounds attractive, but I think that I either miss the point, or it’s just LAME. The box even says that it is Fuccon, right on the front panel, but I will allow myself to disagree. 2 out of 10.
