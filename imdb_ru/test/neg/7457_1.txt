This Canadian film is the worst of them all! Fabulous amateurish. When the bad guys rob a boat, we see two women with machine guns, and one of them says in a very quiet voice: “We rob your ship!” She blinks and is quite shy! Very scary. ROTFLOL !!! <br /> <br /> Two karate heroes of 40 years old, twin brothers five feet tall! They are really bad actors. In fact, all those who participate in this performance are not actors. <br /> <br /> This cheap production has so many continuity errors that it is amazing. In one scene, guys wear one type of swimsuit. In the next picture, they wear completely different swimsuits. <br /> <br /> Absolutely awful! Be sure to look for any fan of bad movies. I have it on VHS. This is very rare. I treasure it.
