Carefully selected street yarn by Leslie Selander, “The Yellow Tomahawk” (1954), incites the Cheyenne to American cavalry with strong, robust Rory Calhoun in the middle, like a hardened, deer-skinned Indian scout who should lead the survivors to safety. This western United Artists was in the color of lenses, but the television print that was shown in the Turner Classic films was inexplicably black and white. <br /> <br /> The action begins with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun from Black Spurs), in which several Indians are hiding. and drives up to a palaver with his old friend and Cheyenne leader, the Fiery Knife (Lee Van Cleef from “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly”), who has murders in his head. The knife of fire warns Adam that his Cheyenne brave men are ready to destroy the nearby cavalry fort under construction, since he is violating the agreement concluded by the Indians with the government. On his way, to inform Major Ives, the commander of the stranded camp (Warner Anderson from Lens, Burma!), About the impending attack of the Indians, Adam discovers a beautiful woody nymph seductively trampling in the lake. Catherine "Kate" Bolden (Peggy Castle "I, the Jury") is another one of those stupid women in the west who are exposed in the center of an Indian country without any care in the world. Castle seems to be truly naked in his bathing scenes, and perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this predictable western. Naturally, Major Ayve rejects Adam’s warning from the Fire Knife until the commander realizes that someone has raided his ammunition depot far beyond the fort. This is one of the many questions that Richard Alan Simmons’s script leaves unanswered in this neat 82-minute speech. Why does the cavalry bury their ammunition in a secret place in the desert instead of keeping them in the premises of the fort? Before they could make this discovery, the Indians attacked, knocked out the hero and left him the only survivor. Before this attack, a pair of white scouts enter the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of Stalag 17) introduces his partner with an arrow in his chest. While Adam gets hot water to help lift the arrow, the greedy Sawyer gets deeper and deeper into the mine and kills his helpless partner. Later we learn that Sawyer and his partner hit gold. The question of the dispersal of gold also remains unanswered after our heroes have survived the ordeal. Adam and the Fiery Knife have the final ending, and the Fiery Knife requires Adam to hand over Major Ives, or everyone will die. Naturally, Adam refuses, and the Indians begin to shoot down whites. James Best in the supporting role of the cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Bury Jr. plays the Mexican scout who is haunted by a sexy Indian girl named Honey Bear (Oscar winner, Rita Moreno from West Side Story) and Robert Bray from Lessi for a little while at hand. - The ultimate cavalry officer Kate planned to marry. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise of this unremarkable western shot on the ground in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives killed Indian men, women and children during the infamous massacre at Sand Creek , kept them. secret that he is also native american! Ironically, the tight bow that the Fire Knife gives Adam to a friendship at the start of hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill a persistent Cheyenne warrior after his bullets have run out. The Yellow Tomahawk ends on an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives provide their respective reports on this issue to the army general, but we still do not know the result of this meeting. This is an artistic ambiguity or another unanswered question. Producer Howard V. Koch has nothing to do with Howard Koch’s screenwriter for Casablanca. Ultimately, the Yellow Tomahawk is one of the many pro-Indian westerns that emerged after Broken Arrow (1950), where Native American is considered a noble savage who is perceived unfairly by some but not all whites. Selander, who made dozens of westerns in the 1950s and 1960s, makes this small west acceptable, despite its subtle characters and familiar predicament. Calhoun stands out from above the middle cast, as always, a serviceable lead man, and the beautiful Castle is worth monitoring her feminine charm. Peter Graves plays a skunk, as usual in most of his early roles. In fact, Leslie Selander made a more satisfactory dramatic version of this film a year earlier called War Paint (1953) with Robert Stack. By the way, Noah Bury Jr. and Rita Moreno both became regular clients of The Rockford Files.
