This film has some good lines, but viewing less of a master Durlon Rourke just left me wanting to see the original. I like Marisa Tomei, but she is not Faye Dunaway. <br /> <br /> In addition, in my opinion, the rule of the film is the number one - to make the main character about those you care about. You may not like a character, but you should not care what happens to him. This is accomplished in Barfly with a fun gag about bargaining with bartender Eddie. The main fight in Factotum is when he, completely unprovoked, walks up to Lily Taylor's character in a bar, hits her on the floor and calls her a whore. <br /> <br /> It all just did not work, Again, some wonderful lines - some funny, funny - but as a film as a whole, itâ€™s a failure. Mediocre attempt to re-invent something brilliant, and you can not get past this. Following? Let's redo the breakfast in Tiffany with Kate Hudson.
