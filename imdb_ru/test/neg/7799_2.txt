Surrender Cinema was known for its extremely erotic, almost overt sci-fi movies. Although they usually do a very good job (Femalien 1 & 2, Virtual Encounters), this particular entry seems to be just an interlacing of old tape. Any number of girls — some recognizable and others not — are present in this film at all stages of the nude. There are also several clips from other films that are outstanding if you have not seen these other films. There are a number of solo nude scenes that do different things: some play basketball, others say, others play with themselves. The only value in this tape is the very last scene - a short but erotic scene of a girl-girl with a very enthusiastic and pleasant Sandy Vasco and more depressed Tammy Heinum. Not very recommended.
