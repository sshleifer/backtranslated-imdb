Making a movie for less than 1 million may be a triumph for a linear producer or accountant, but does nothing for the audience. The balance might have been good, but the viewing experience was bad. <br /> <br /> There will be a triumph for Irish cinema when people realize that production values ​​and the script cannot be sacrificed. <br /> <br /> I don’t understand why people spend energy to put together a film if the quality of production is worse than in a low-quality television show. <br /> <br /> Stress flaws were mentioned. in another review on this site, and I fully agree with what has been written. I would like to add that the film shot the surface of several genres, not dwelling on any of them. The film would benefit from either direct comedy or social / political commentary. <br /> <br /> I had the general impression that the film was hastily, thematically underdeveloped and visually inconsistent with the standards. On a positive note, the performances and music were very good.
