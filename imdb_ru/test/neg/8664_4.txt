“Mansfield Park” in the second half is my favorite Austin novel, and “Fanny Price” is my favorite heroine, so I am saddened by the unfortunate fate that she encountered in her large and small screens. The only good character reading I heard was made for radio by Amanda Ruth, who gave him the same quality as the heroine Anne in the film “Persuasion”: strict, confident, sincere moral focus. If the actress were younger, she would be a good visual actor; but the Fannys, which have reached our eyes today, are more like, respectively: Mary Crawford; Ruby girl-van; and (in this incarnation) a cheerful servant or, perhaps, a pie, with its high moral principles, knocked off a peg. <br /> <br /> Well, I was hoping for the best, but I was afraid of worse. In the series there was a solid Edmund, an actor who was the best in pleasant juices, and perfect, that is, absolutely disgusting, Mrs. Norris; otherwise it was boring. The film, which, apparently, was conceived as deconstruction or some other bad theatrical idea, came out as a mixed burlesque. After such disappointments and more recent disappointments of the related parts of this production (the new "Persuasion" and "Nortanger Abbey"), I could not but mix up the expectations for this; and overall, it made me feel a little better than not. He cleverly squeezed the novel and, finally, left me with the same feeling as the comic book version. On the other hand, for this, he had to remake most of the characters except Crawford, and this accidentally reduced or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book, including her most famous character and what should be if this is not his most famous scene. <br /> <br /> Character - official Aunt Norris, always ready to give instructions to other people what to do, but always trying not to do anything by herself; here it is not felt at all. And there is much more with her: her remark is cut through by Fanny: "... considering who and what you are"; The discovery by Sir Thomas that she had banned Fanny from burning the fire in her room all these years, and his devious apologies for her; Fannie’s honesty, who admitted during a visit to the house, that Aunt Norris, despite all her shortcomings, could cope with the household better than any of her sisters. But then, this whole trip is missing from the plot, and the same thing happens with theatrical rehearsals and confuses Sir Thomas upon his return; and in fact, Sir Thomas himself and his wife are different from who they were. First of all, the scene in which Crawford offers Fanny, one of the most complex Austin, is simplified to a simple story; absent from him is convinced that Fanny is upholding that she knows what is right and what she knows, which is very likely true, against all distractions Crawford and someone else can throw at her. The male reader, now no less than when he was written, he shows with unsurpassed clarity — at least, as far as I know, unsurpassed — through which a woman passes, trying to cope fairly but firmly with a man whom she has grounds for distrust . This is a brilliant scene in the novel; on TV it's just a scene. <br /> <br /> Fanny, oh Fanny: when will we see your love?
