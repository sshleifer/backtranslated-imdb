I love the beach guys and their music. So, being a filmmaker, I thought: wow, the Beach Boys Movie movie sounds great. Well, WRONG! I just turned off HDNET, the channel on which the movie was playing, because it was so bad. Someone mentioned editing ... well, they should have at least looked at the monitors during the filming. I don't know if anyone else caught a mustache falling from the face of one of the guys after he kissed his wife, and then he smoothed them out again with his hands. Ever heard of re-shooting the scene! It was terrible to act. The direction was terrible. Makeup was terrible !!! Perhaps the worst makeup job I've ever seen. Brian Wilson's fat cheek looked like a cry. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is the first time I've been commenting on IMDb, and I know that in fact it doesn't change anything ... but come on, what the hell were the manufacturers thinking about? !?
