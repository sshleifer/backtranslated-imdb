Yes, Pigeon and Koburn are great, and it's interesting to watch them, although Koburn looks rather restrained and boring here. Nice to see Seattle, Victoria and Salt Lake City of the 1970s, as well as cars and clothing from that period. It's all good in this boring movie. The dialogue is incredibly bad, like most actors. Ray and Sandy motives seem forced and unlikely. I have seen this “practice being a pickpocket” procedure several times before. There is a long build, leading to nothing. Better to catch the episode of "Streets of San Francisco" or one of the many great crime / caper films. Here are some of them: “Bedtime Story”, reworked in “Dirty rotten scoundrels”, “Lavender Hill”, “The Grifters”, “Paper Moon”, “Sting” and, most importantly, “House of Games”
