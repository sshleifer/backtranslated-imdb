It looks so good on paper - Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishburne, Jean Renault, okay, right? And a robbery with 42 million dollars sounds like an awesome criminal film. <br /> <br /> A big disappointment - I believe that the stars received all the money, because the production performance on this is disgusting. <br /> /> But more than that, this is a pseudo reservoir of dogs. The atmosphere when an easy crime goes wrong. It is very good for television programs. <br /> <br /> In general, he is very disappointed - he scores points for what he is - but loses them to a great extent for what, frankly, is not very interesting at all ...
