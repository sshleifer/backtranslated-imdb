“Get Shorty”, “Out of sight”, “Jackie Brown” (and even “52 pickups”) - the guys finally understood Elmore Leonard correctly, making good films from his work. Therefore, despite the warnings of my students about how bad this film will be, I could not resist renting it. I thought: how can this be bad? Oh, what a mistake, especially right on the heels of reading a book that was lame (and too circular self-reference) compared to the rest of Elmore Leonard’s books. However, the book was better than the film. Leonard again surpasses the weak and unskilled writers who are trying to get hold of his book. The dialogue written for Stephen Tyler was painful to watch. And the text for the first song of the character Linda Moon? My high school students write with greater depth. Sad, sad, sad. Why even give him a star? Because Harvey Keitel and Uma Thurman are still fun to see on the screen, but Andre 3000 did not make a fool of himself.
