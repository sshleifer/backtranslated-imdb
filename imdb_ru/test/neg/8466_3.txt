- Contains 1 spoiler, on the market: ***** - <br /> <br /> Not being another remake of the "Interview", Five Fingers is actually there. Alas, except, perhaps, the difficulties of physical torture, it never adds anything to the execution of its predecessor in terms of waiting, conspiracy or actions. In fact, the Five Fingers never comes close to their level. <br /> <br /> It was especially painful for me to look not at torture, but at how Martaine (Ryan Philip) played out his ordeal. For me, it looked as though Philip was trying too hard to understand his accent, and this made his performance amateur, which, in turn, even slowed down the performance of the great Colma Mini. By the way, Philip's accent, far from Dutch, sounded more like Eastern European. <br /> <br /> In addition to the actions of Philip (who, to my surprise, by the end turned from poor to really decent), there are memories with beaten Dutch landscapes. (If these scenes were set in Switzerland, they would have eaten cheese on top of a mountain with endless pastures with grazing cows in expensive watches). The script aside, the way these memories pushed the plot away didn't work for me at all. This made it served as french fries upon entry and caused an accumulation of obscurity on the flat line. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, the film became more enjoyable, as Philip's actions improved, but I couldn't help but be annoyed by scenes that were too improbable. For example: <br /> <br /> ************ Start a spoiler <br /> <br /> At some point (after several days), Philip is almost gently bathed by a female terrorist. This should follow the rough separation of another finger. Why wash a guy if he is tortured? And the gap of this last finger, it seemed, in any case served only the name of this click, I mean, he practically begged him to cut it off. Did it make sense ?? <br /> <br /> ************ The final spoiler <br /> <br /> In the end, I continued to observe Fishburn's performance, which again turned out to be a brilliant actor, but he also was the best part of the script for the job. <br /> <br /> In general, it is much better to see the “Interview” with another matrix-icon: Hugo weaving. And when you do, I'm sure you will not find this review unpleasant. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> “Interview”, 1998. Www.imdb.com/name/tt0120714/
