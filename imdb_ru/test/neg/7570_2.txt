It must be one of the worst movie scenarios I've ever seen. In essence, this is a remake of the movie “The Beast with 20,000 Fatoms” (1953), but made with the help of your usual snake-like puppet monster instead of the smooth creation of Ray Harryhausen. Combine the plot of this classic monster movie with production quality and acting level The Creeping Terror, and you will understand what this movie looks like. <br /> <br /> The film is duplicated, although by original actors (I think the film was originally dubbed into Italian for an audience of these countries, and then shortened for release in the US), which simply makes the film strange ... sounds as in the Japanese monster film, the action on the screen just doesn't quite match, even if the actors' lips are moving properly. Poor Ray Milland ... he has definitely come a long way from Lost Weekend or Type M for Murder or any of the number of great films in which he starred. Add this to your other scientific materials (“Panic in Zero Year”, “Man with X-ray Eyes”), and you will see how once a good actor fell into Boris Karloff syndrome ... Stuck, making really bad horror films in foreign countries only for work.
