Oh, how I laughed during these first two scenes. This stupid little movie about an 11-year-old child who carries a gun, steals cars, robs stores, robbers houses, extorts money from other children, burns houses, shoots rats, buys drugs, gives out drugs to his mother and friends, and then kills What a great comedy! But it was not intended for comedy. He was conceived as a social drama. How can it be? The events in this film are absurd and ridiculous. All characters are stereotypes right from the immature imagination of the 4-year comic strip. The dialogue is ridiculous; people speak like morons. This is a very stupid movie. <br /> <br /> The first scenes are really very funny, for all the wrong reasons. But the unintentional gaiety of the idiotic premise ends after a short time, and after that laughter comes rarely; by that time, the viewer cannot believe what he sees and is alternately affected and bored by what follows (if he has at least half of the brain cells). <br /> <br /> Short film, but it feels like an eternity. The film is in fact a deliberate attempt to show the world of the young degenerate, while at the same time imitating films that are far superior to him, for example, "Fun." There is such a rush around everything; children, adults, each lack of trust both in their actions and in dialogue. The guy as the leader sneaks through the film, as if he had seen all the Jimmy Cagney films at least a hundred times. And, as a rule, the child is portrayed not as a source of evil, but as an underestimated little artistic talent. But of course. Every young ruffian was misunderstood - the society made him bad. Poor child. <br /> <br /> The film is confusing; a collection of stale, sometimes funny clich√©s gathered together to create a film that lacks intelligence and meaning. The intellectual level of the film is zero.
